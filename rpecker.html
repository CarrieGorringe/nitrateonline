<p></font><strong><font size="5">I</font></strong><font size="4">n the twelve features
master of bad taste John Waters made before <i>Pecker</i> he has audaciously gone where no
director has gone before. <i>Pink Flamingos</i> (1972) is still a cult classic, containing
one of the most vilest scenes in cinema history. Slightly de-nauseating were follow-up
satires <i>Female Trouble</i>, <i>Desperate Living</i>, and <i>Polyester</i>, even getting
50s movie star Tab Hunter into some more of his &quot;mainstream&quot; productions. His
recent efforts <i>Hairspray</i> and <i>Serial Mom</i> were delightful, but gentle,
additions to his comedy war chest. While the Baltimore native continues to make
modest-budget character-driven comedies in his home town, he comes up empty with his 13<sup>th</sup>
feature. Bad luck, I guess. John Waters&#146; <i>Pecker </i>(conjure up the image!) is a
limp effort in search of a Viagra fix. Too bad the main character&#146;s name isn&#146;t
Cigar.</p>

<p></font><font size="3">Edward Furlong is Pecker, a teenaged short order cook at a local
sub pit and amateur photographer in a decidedly blue collar ward of the city. He
photographs friends, strangers, even the hamburger patties he&#146;s flipping. The camera
is a hand-me-down courtesy of his mother (Mary Kay Place), who caters to the secondhand
crowd with a pre-owned thrift shop. Wacko grandma Memama (Jean Schertler), is a pit beef
queen with a roadside shack outside the family wood-paneled residence, but she would much
rather pray with her &quot;talking&quot; statue of Mary. Pecker&#146;s siblings have their
own quirks: older sister Tina (Martha Plimpton) hires go-go dancers at a local
&quot;working boys only&quot; gay club, while six-year-old Chrissy (Lauren Hulsey) has
over-active sugar fixation. Dad is a struggling bartender feeling the economic heat from a
nude bar across the street.</p>

<p>The family, on the low end of the commercial totem pole, scraps along (although I kept
asking myself how Pecker could afford to develop his own film and strike his own
enlargements) until the shutterbug is discovered by Rorey Wheeler (Lulu Taylor) a dynamic
New York art dealer and the boy&#146;s celebrity status mushrooms overnight. Before you
can say magazine cover, it&#146;s a family feud of the unpretentious Baltimore cultural
challenged inner citizens and the New York name-dropping intelligentsia. The media
over-exposure turns the back-water family&#146;s life upside-down. Their house is robbed,
their nerves are frayed, and the welfare services -- in the guise of one Dr. Klompus (Bess
Armstrong) -- clamp down on Chrissy&#146;s sucrose sensitivity. All of Pecker&#146;s
subjects demand a cut of the action, while his main squeeze Shelley (Christina Ricci), a
&quot;stain goddess&quot; at a local laundromat, leaves him as does his best friend Matt
(Brendon Sexton III), once &quot;the best thief in town,&quot; who gets caught
shoplifting. It&#146;s Job for everyone on a bad hair day.</p>

<p>This fairy tale does have a happy, and a terribly over-forgiving, ending. The New York
art crowd head down to crab city for the grand opening of Pecker&#146;s Place (his
father&#146;s bar hence rechristened). Rorey has since discovered a blind New Jersey
photographer while Chrissy finds happiness snorting peas. In a big hurrah for Pecker, the
crowd toasts to the &quot;end of irony,&quot; while our hero contemplates his next move.</p>

<p>I do admire Waters for writing up a weird array of idiosyncratic personalities. You
won&#146;t find a menagerie like this in any other American filmmaker&#146;s work. The
problem is that Furlong is too weak an actor to carry the film, although Ricci has a good
focus as she continues to strut her stuff in American independent cinema, following up
bravura performances in <i>Buffalo &#146;66</i> (in which she plays a another B-city ditsy
to remarkable effect) and <a href="roppositeofsex.html" target="_top"><i>The Opposite of Sex</i></a>.
And the story&#146;s too weak to carry the cast, the tale unable to support the broad, and
often too brief, array of odd talent. It&#146;s just not a grabber; merely a shrug off.
Gross-out king Waters isn&#146;t cutting edge anymore, either, with his bite nearly as
sweet as Chrissy&#146;s sweet tooth. <i>Pecker</i> peters out.</font></p>
