<p>Screenwriters Roth and LaGravenese go straight for the heartstrings in their adaptation
of Evans&#146; novel. Several comparisons have been made between this film and the film
version <i>of The Bridges of Madison County</i>. It&#146;s a tempting parallel to draw,
since LaGravenese adapted <i>Bridges</i> for Clint Eastwood. Instead, <i>Horse Whisperer</i>
aspires to a comparison with the granddaddy of all tearjerkers aspiring to a literary
pedigree: David Lean&#146;s version of Noel Coward&#146;s play, <i>Brief Encounter</i>. <img src="images/rhorsewhisperer-1.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">Both films contain
the theme of nice people caught up in an impossible romance despite themselves, and share
similarities right down to the metaphoric level, most notably the use of classical music
as a trope for lost love (although the selection here comes from Dvorak as opposed to
Rachmaninoff, but let&#146;s not quibble over differences in composers). The most obvious
evidence that Roth and LaGravenese have borrowed from Coward and Lean has to do with the
ending of the film versus the ending in Evans&#146; novel; the former has been altered so
significantly that, inadvertently or not, the comparison between <i>Horse Whisperer</i>
and <i>Brief Encounter</i> the films is unavoidable. Take away the striking, if
derivative, visual composition and <i>Horse Whisperer</i> could be defined, at its most
elemental, in the same disdainful, dismissive context to which love stories are often
confined: as nothing more than a pricey two-Kleenex-box weeper of nearly three hours
duration. Digging into the subtext of either film or novel, one finds no deeper themes,
such as man versus nature; they exist only on the surface, as a pretentious cosmetic gloss
meant to elevate the proceedings above that of the average potboiler, and betraying the
filmmakers&#146; unease with their task at hand. Their own disdain for the third category
of conflict &#150; man versus himself &#150; not to mention their own disdain for those
who hunger after such tales well told, shines through their surface gloss and turns
everything into dross of the most cynical sort</p>

<p><img src="images/rhorsewhisperer-2.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="left" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="152">Despite the
best intentions of Thomas and Redford, our would-be lovers do nothing to inspire great
passion in the audience, primarily because they can&#146;t seem to convey a convincing
mutual passion. The fault doesn&#146;t lie with Thomas; she projects such self-reliance
and radiance that her appearances often threaten to break through the artificiality of the
script. Redford is the weak link; there&#146;s too much of an aw-shucks mentality in his
portrayal of Tom Booker; you might ask him to shoe your horse, but not to sweep you up
upon it. Cooper and Wiest, in supporting roles that are unworthy of their profound
talents, serve only to provide the necessary local color; likewise for Neill. The real
revelation here is Scarlett Johannsen. So marvelous in <i>Manny and Lo</i>, she fills one
of the two emotional centers of this film with such empathy that you actually can relate
to her crisis; she glows as much as Thomas, but that glow can&#146;t shine far through a
fog of mediocrity. As for this reviewer, I&#146;ll stick with Trevor Howard and Celia
Johnson in that cold, lonely train station.</p>
