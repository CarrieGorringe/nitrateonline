<hr size="4" width="60">
<i><b>

<p>SA:</b></i> In <i>Welcome to the Dollhouse</i> you push social satire into a different
direction. On the one hand it&#146;s dark and scathing, yet you still have a lot of
sympathy for the main character. In &quot;Happiness&quot; there doesn&#146;t seem to be a
lot of sympathy to go around. Is there a reason for becoming even darker in this film, and
less sympathetic?</p>
<i><b>

<p>TS:</b></i> I think that it is a much more troubling film, but I happen to not feel any
less compassionate towards the characters in <i>Dollhouse</i> than I do in this movie. I
think to say that I ask everyone to sympathize with the unsympathetic is somewhat
inaccurate. Many people have walked out of <i>Dollhouse</i> and said &quot;Oh, that was
me, I was Dawn Weiner,&quot; I don&#146;t anticipate anyone walking out and saying
&quot;That was me, I was Bill Maplewood.&quot; But for me the tragedy of Bill Maplewood,
as many people focus on him, is his family: he loves his wife, he loves his son. He&#146;s
not a monster but struggles with a monster within and he succumbs to this demon, so to
speak, and he transgresses, and what he does is unforgivable. But if there is to be any
redemption, and I say that&#146;s a big &quot;if,&quot; I think it lies in the love, the
honesty, he shares with son, before whom he cannot but tell the truth. I mean, to shudder
at the repugnance of his deeds I think is an appropriate response.</p>

<p>I read <i>In Cold Blood</i> years ago, you know it&#146;s the story of a vile crime
that these lowlifes perpetrated. But as you read and get to know something of the hearts
and minds of these characters, it becomes a heartbreaking portrait, so that when they hang
the criminals at the end of the book, you know what you&#146;re hanging and there&#146;s a
terrible sorrow, the waste, the tragedy, the loss of it all. And I feel that certainly if
one is to, I&#146;m not going to speak pro or con as capitol punishment goes, but I think
that if you&#146;re going to hang Bill Maplewood, say &quot;Okay, pull the switch&quot; so
to speak, if you&#146;re going to pull that switch you have to know what you are
annihilating, and that for all the horror there is still something of a life there,
something of terrible, terrible sorrow, and I think that I&#146;m very</p>

<p>moved by that. I think it makes, if one can get beyond the horror of the deed, that I
think there is something in becoming become more fully human and not being able to dismiss
quite so easily someone that is just reduced as &#145;the pedophile,&#146; so to speak, in
some villainous form that we are all accustomed to. </p>

<p>All of these characters for me are bleeding souls. That for me is what ties them
together, the themes for me are loneliness and desire, isolation, alienation, and the
struggle to connect, and these are universals and I can only hope that for all the extreme
nature of these taboos that that is not lost on the audiences. I mean if the audience just
writes off these characters as a bunch of freaks I will have failed for that audience. For</p>

<p>me, just as I was for &quot;Dollhouse,&quot; I feel equally connected emotionally
speaking to all of these characters. Of course I keep a certain amount of detachment,
without which it would all be too unbearable for me and I suppose for the audience as
well, and I think it&#146;s from that that a certain kind of humor arises, but if one
finds it funny it certainly is never a joke.</p>
<i><b>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p>SA:</b></i> I think that for me the most moving scenes in the film were between Bill
and his son Billy, particularly when they have their very frank sex talks. The dialogue in
those scenes, taken out of context, verges on the edge of parody, but the way it&#146;s
delivered by Dylan Baker and presented in the scene with the two of them, it has a real
honesty and a real depth of feeling, I think more so than you see in any other characters
that connect in any way in the film.</p>
<i><b>

<p>TS: </b></i>I feel that for me some of the most tender moments really are between Phil
Hoffman and Camryn Manheim, when she&#146;s caressing him on his bed and when he joins her
on his, or just when they&#146;re dancing,, that there&#146;s a kind of communion of a
non-sexual nature that takes place that I am very moved by. </p>
<i><b>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p>SA:</b></i> I agree, I think that Philip Seymour Hoffman and Camryn Manheim are
absolutely terrific in those roles, especially Hoffman. I think he takes a character that
could have turned into buffoon and invests him with an awful lot of emotion.</p>
<i><b>

<p>TS: </b></i>I think he&#146;s great. It&#146;s a difficult film, it&#146;s a really
very tricky film, and much as in <i>Dollhouse</i>, and even more so now, sometimes you
have one half of the audience telling me how funny it is or dead on and so forth, and the
other half being angry at the first half: &quot;How can you laugh? This is so sad.
It&#146;s so sorrowful and painful and horrific and so-forth.&quot; For me it&#146;s
always both and I think one&#146;s orientation, so to speak, is very much what&#146;s
going to determine your response to these films. </p>

<p>I nevertheless have to say, I think it was at Telluride a month ago, late one night a
college kid who may have been a little tipsy came up to me and told me how much he loved
the movie and how funny he found it and he told me had a joke that he thought I would
appreciate and that I would understand. And he proceeded to tell me this very ugly, very
crass joke, and it was fortunately very short and he ran off. What pains me about this
little encounter is that I think if he had understood what I think I was trying to do
there in the movie, he would never have thought that I would be the best audience or the
audience at all for this kind of joke. You cannot know how people will respond but you
just try to remain faithful to your own feelings about the characters and the reality you
set up and hope that others will get at what you&#146;re trying to get at.</p>
<i><b>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p>SA:</b></i> Taking such black, scathingly satirical perspective is going to create some
problems in getting these characters&#146; feelings of loneliness across to an audience.
Why do you choose that route?</p>
<i><b>

<p>TS: </b></i>You&#146;re presupposing that everyone responds in this way, but I think
that there are those who do respond to the themes of which I have spoken and then there
may be others who are unable to get beyond some of the taboo material that&#146;s
addressed in this film. But there&#146;s nothing in this film that I don&#146;t think one
won&#146;t see discussed any day of the week, whether it be a TV talk show, a newspaper, a
news magazine, tabloids and so forth. I mean it&#146;s out there every day assaulting us.
The difference in part is that the media tends to have a dual sort of message, on the one
hand being very moralistic and on the other a kind of entertainment, a kind of titillating
freak show. So you get that jangly, righteous moralistic/exploitative message and it seems
inevitable that a filmmaker is going to try to address these issues in a more serious,
exploratory fashion. But as I may have said (forgive me if I&#146;m repeating myself), if
the audience just looks at these characters as a bunch of freaks I definitely will have
failed that audience. Fortunately that response is not a universal one.</p>
<i><b>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p>SA:</b></i> It&#146;s been getting good reviews from festivals, but it certainly is
courting a lot of controversy.</p>
<i><b>

<p>TS: </b></i>Well it&#146;s not for everyone and it&#146;s not designed for everyone and
I don&#146;t think I&#146;ll ever write anything that&#146;s designed to appeal to
everyone. If you want sympathetic characters it&#146;s easy enough to do, you just give
someone cancer and of course we&#146;ll all feel horribly sad and sorry. You make anyone a
victim and people feel that way. But that&#146;s not of interest to me as a filmmaker or
as a writer. I may be accused of a certain kind of misanthropy but I think I could argue
the opposite. I think that it&#146;s only by acknowledging the flaws, the foibles, the
failings and so forth of who we are that we can in fact fully embrace the all of who we
are. People say I&#146;m cruel or that the film&#146;s cruel, but I think rather it
exposes the cruelty and I think that certainly the capacity for cruelty is the most
difficult, the most painful thing for any of us to acknowledge. That we are at all
capable. And yet I think that it exists as much as the capacity for kindness and it&#146;s
only the best of us that are able to suppress, sublimate, re-channel and so forth these
baser instincts, but I see them to some degree at play as a regular part of life in very
subtle ways and not so subtle ways. I don&#146;t think that after the seventh grade that
these impulses evaporate. So from my perspective I&#146;m trying to be honest with what I
see and what I&#146;ve experienced and what I believe is true to our nature. </p>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p><i><b>SA:</b></i> Coming out of <i>Happiness</i> I went away with the idea that you
don&#146;t see a lot of hope for American society.</p>
<i><b>

<p>TS: </b></i>I don&#146;t feel that way. Certainly I think just the act and fact of
making a film is an optimistic gesture to begin with. I&#146;m not jumping off any roof.
And I think that for some of these characters I think their fates are somewhat bleak but I
think for others I&#146;m much more optimistic. For Joy and I&#146;m hopeful at this point
in the game that Joy and Allen could make some sort of connection if they were to meet,
and for Billy Maplewood there is a kind of future that while fraught with all sorts of
perils I think I&#146;m actually more hopeful for him. So I don&#146;t really feel
it&#146;s quite as cut and dried as that. I think in part because we&#146;re all so unused
to seeing movies that are less than rosy, they feel particularly unrosy, but I think
it&#146;s a question, to a certain extent, of what one is used to.</p>
<i><b>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p>SA:</b></i> I assume that everything we saw on the screen was in the screenplay to
begin with.</p>
<i><b>

<p>TS: </b></i>Yeah, there was little in the way of improvisation.</p>
<i><b>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p>SA:</b></i> How did you work with the actors to develop the characters as we saw them
on the screen?</p>
<i><b>

<p>TS: </b></i>It&#146;s really through the casting process that most of my so-called
rehearsal takes place, the actor getting to know me and vice versa, talking about the part
and also of course then reading from the script. Once a certain kind of trust is
established you make a leap of faith. Just as they do in me I do in them make this leap of
faith. But my role on the set is in a certain sense is just to make them feel comfortable,
that sense of trust so to speak, so that they can do what they do best and feel the
freedom in that way. </p>

<hr size="4" width="60">
<i><b>

<p>SA:</b></i> The performances were all excellent and I think you put a wonderful cast
together for this film.</p>
<i><b>

<p>TS: </b></i>Well I think so too, I&#146;m very pleased with them all.</p>
