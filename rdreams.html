If I were a betting man, I&#146;d say none. Zilch. Nada. Bleech. Instead, let&#146;s ask
rhetorically what fortunes may crumble with this feel-good movie about dying! I hope Dr.
Kervorkian isn&#146;t endorsing this widescreen paean to suicide (primary weapon:
boredom), but, perhaps as a public service, he might assist the filmmakers for hefting
such a nauseatingly sentimental, empty-headed misconception on the American public. <i>What
Dreams</i> also will probably be the swansong for Polygram Filmed Entertainment, currently
being auctioned off by Seagram, owner of Universal Studios and buyer of Polygram&#146;s
parent for its music division. Although the film division includes a library of 1,500
titles, the offers are on the underside of $500 million. Rather than push more money after
bad, the winning bidder may end up plopping this light-headed lump of coal -- a $70
million effects-laden but story-lite production -- quickly in the home video remainder
bin. I thought I was getting over a head cold before watching this moan-inducing,
sugar-coated dream puff pastry of a film, but afterwards my head was aching, filled with
saccharin slo-mo images, a clap-track score banging at my ears, and one of the worst cases
of drivel to pop out of Hollywood in quite some time.</p>

<p></font><font size="3">I wouldn&#146;t blame the actors that much. It&#146;s hard enough
acting against a blue screen and with the wooden material by Ron Bass (<a href="rstella.html" target="_top"><i>How Stella Got Her Groove Back</i></a>, <a href="rbfwedding.html" target="_top"><i>My
Best Friend&#146;s Wedding</i></a>, <i>Waiting to Exhale</i>) and the inept direction by
New Zealander Vincent Ward, his last effort being 1992&#146;s <i>Map of the Human Heart</i>,
a modest love story with breathtaking visuals. Granted, they have created an entrancing
virtual world in <i>What Dreams</i>, but the film is devoid of everything else,
particularly common sense. It&#146;s so immersed in its Technicolor self that it forgot
what it should be -- something to entertain its viewers, not color blind them.</p>

<p><img src="images/rdreams-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">Within the first
few moments of the film &quot;soulmates&quot; Annie (Annabella Sciorra) and Christy
Nielsen (Robin Williams), meet, marry, and are devastated by the tragic death of their
teenaged children in an automobile accident. Chris, a semi-happy, semi-sad shrink is
killed four years later and lands in heaven, a blurry state of blissful consciousness
literally drawn in gloppy drippings of artist&#146;s oils (inspired by his and mostly
Annie&#146;s paintings). Gooey jacaranda blue flowers ooze in his hand and squish under
his feet. The rest of the film is the moaning deceased husband&#146;s quest for his holy
grail, his Annie, who ends up somewhere a little less accessible than next door when she
finds her inspiration, family, and life drained from her very being (Oh, Lordy, Lordy!).
There are a fistful of rainbow-endowed flashbacks and flash-forwards pointing to the
family&#146;s troubled times -- the death of the family Dalmatian, the children&#146;s
problems with school. And the kids, at first I thought it was two boys, Ian and Murray,
but it turns out the dialogue was so cloudy and the tomboy look so perfect that it
eventually dawned on me it was Ian and Marie (Josh Paddock and Jessica Brooks Grant).</p>

<p>Heaven isn&#146;t a vacuum (the movie may be) and hence there are a few more characters
that actually float in an out of the picture. Cuba Gooding, Jr. is Albert (or is he), a
guiding spirit who escorts our &quot;hero&quot; through the expressionist landscape of his
&quot;own private universe.&quot; <img src="images/rdreams-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">Rosalind Chao is tour guide Leona (or is she), who provides the key to her 19<sup>th</sup>
century consciousness city (seems a lot of heaven is decorated by the same design firm).
And of course Max Von Sydow (previously paired with Williams in 1990&#146;s <i>Awakenings</i>)
as The Tracker (or is he), obviously selected because of the Swedish actor&#146;s
appearance as Antonious Bloch, more than 40 years ago, in <i>The Seventh Seal</i>, Ingmar
Bergman&#146;s award winning allegory on death. In the face of the ultimate authority,
Chris rebels (I knew he should have been a lawyer) and hitches a ride into a sea of
memories, tumbles through a landscape of mumbling heads, and falls into another
recollection. He, and the movie, go to Hell for an overnight stay (again, remember,
he&#146;s on a quest!). Of course, this is a gray, drab black-and-white Twilight Zone
rerun Hell, greatly inspired by the terrifying works of Dutch painter Hieronymus Bosch, a
reproduction appearing above the Nielsen headboard in one of those pesky flashbacks.
Amidst the rubble, Chris searches for his lost love, but he&#146;s only got three minutes
or else. In case you&#146;re wondering who the heck sets these rules, it must be the
producers realizing their going over their budget. Better get out the egg timer, then,
right? Bing, time&#146;s up.</p>

<p>Well, I&#146;ll stop here. One guess how the movie ends. Yes, that&#146;s right. Badly,
for anyone silly enough to sit through it.</font></p>
