<p><big><strong><big>A</big></strong>lthough this film is firmly rooted in the series of
children's books by the late Mary Norton, it has a touch of Dickens, a spritz of Rube
Goldberg, and a dash of Monty Python, while still aiming and hitting the target for wide
family appeal. A popcorn pleaser. Not a bad feat for fledgling director Peter Hewitt (<em>Bill
and Ted's Bogus Journey</em>, <em>Tom and Huck</em>) and freshman screenwriters Gavin
Scott and John Kamps. This is tried and true film, a marvel more in its production design
(kudos to Gemma Jackson) and costumes (Marie France), but also a tribute to fine
performances big and small. Big as in John Goodman, who broadly rumbles through the piece
as the villainous lawyer Ocious C. Potter. Small as in the clan of Borrowers, those
four-inch high little folk who live in the floorboards of our houses and under the
streets.</big></p>

<p>At home with the Lenders we find mom, dad, and teenage gizmologist Pete (Bradley
Pierce, the young gamester in <em><a href="rjumanji.html" target="_top">Jumanji</a></em>). The boy's
parents express disbelief when he suggests that lost socks, misplaced pens, and other
household items are being &quot;borrowed&quot; by the curly, carrot-topped diminutive
creatures who take exceedingly great pains to prevent interaction with their larger hosts,
lest they be &quot;squished&quot; by these monstrous human &quot;beans.&quot; While the
odious Ocious plots a nefarious plan to scrooge the Lenders' home right out from under
them, it's the chance meeting of Pete and bored teenage Borrower Arietty (with a coiffure
reminiscent of Princess Leia on a bad hair day) that forces a strange alliance. However,
the girl's plea on Pete's behalf to her stern father Pod Clock (Jim Broadbent) and
emotional mom Homily Clock (Flora Newbigin) brings only the most tenuous of allegiances.</p>

<p>Arriety and her brother Peagreen are accidentally forced back to their old home when
the Lenders depart for new digs across town in a moving van also transporting the elder
Clocks. A. and Pea discover the plump and greedy Potter ripping out walls in search of a
will that would ruin his demolition plans for the house. What follows parallels the battle
fought in <em><a href="rmousehunt.html" target="_top">MouseHunt</a></em>, except in this film the human
is a rodent of a different kind. And just like <em>MouseHunt</em>, we have an oddball pest
control expert, although Mark Williams' Exterminator Jeff (and his bloodhound,
cheese-gobbling Mr. Smelly) is not as hilariously off-the-wall as Christopher Walken.
Williams does a sympathetic spin on his bumbling henchman of 1996's <a href="r101pups.html" target="_top"><em>101 Dalmatians</em></a>.</p>

<p>The Borrowers succeeds best in its seamless integration of Lilliputian and gargantuan
worlds. Director Hewitt hits it on the head, &quot;The best special effects films are
those where the effects are secondary to the story, they exist to tell the story &#150;
help you meet and enjoy the characters.&quot; The film has a definite Fifties look,
painted in reds and browns then bathed in an amber glow, while still holding onto some
modern contraptions (remote controls, cell phones) with decidedly different retro looks.
Oversized product placements play off the size distortion in a conspicuous but hilariously
reasonable manner &#150; Arriety falling into a gallon of Breyer's ice cream, Reach floss
as part of Pod's mountain (i.e. cabinet) climbing gear, and Energizer-powered back packs.</p>

<p>And finally bad-guy John Goodman. Like his character in King Ralph, he is an ugly
American awash on British soil. He's big, he's oafish, and he&#146;s devilish &#150; a
perfect foil for his pint-size competition. And this mean-tempered Gulliver gets his
comeuppance in a scene taken from the commando drop in Brazil. Here's a film where all's
well and it ends well. Except, I can't find my pen. It's was here a minute ago.</p>
