we got the Stepford Teens. Now Kevin Williamson and Robert Rodriguez have given us <i>The
Breakfast Club</i> edition of <i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</i>, only they&#146;ve
made it work. It&#146;s not so much that it&#146;s all that original or even surprising --
if you ever stop to think it through there isn&#146;t much you wouldn&#146;t predict --
but that they don&#146;t really give you the time to stop and think. There&#146;s a fun
loving, self-aware cleverness to both the science-fiction/horror conventions and the teen
movie clichés trotted out and tweaked around (courtesy of Mr. Williamson, who has turned
such strengths into his entire career to date) and director Rodriguez, who seems to aspire
to nothing beyond the well-turned genre picture, drives the film with a rollercoaster
momentum. Deep it ain&#146;t, but then that&#146;s not exactly what its audience is buying
tickets to, now, is it?</big></p>

<p>After a zippy little pre-titles sequence, where we see the first teachers (a sorry
bunch of burned-out professionals barely making the grade themselves) &quot;turned&quot;
by the alien invader in an old-fashioned locked-building chase punctuated by black humor
and not-so-surprising twists, the heroes of the piece get their introductions. The heroes,
naturally, are a bunch of students who would as soon drop a biting insult to one another
than say hello. Among the classic types are: Casey (Elijah Wood), the perpetual nerd
singled out for a sustained campaign of abuse and terror; Delilah (Jordana Brewster), the
status- conscious head cheerleader and newspaper editor who would have fit right in with
the <i>Heathers</i>; her boyfriend Stan (Shawn Hatosy), the misunderstood jock who is
secretly a nice guy who would rather exercise his mind than his athletic prowess; Zeke
(Josh Hartnett), the smart-ass drug dealer and campus bad boy (with an awful haircut) who
is secretly a genius; Stokely (Clea DuVall), the loner intellectual gal who abets in
making herself a social pariah by posing as a lesbian and escapes in pulp science fiction
novels; and the new girl Marybeth (Laura Harris), a Southern transfer student with a
honey-smothered drawl and a cheery &quot;let&#146;s be friends&quot; come on.</p>

<p>The high school of <i>The Faculty</i> is only slightly less hellish than the vicious
junior-high nastiness of Todd Solondz&#146;s <i>Welcome to the Dollhouse</i>, except that
these kids have all just sort of accepted everything: the pecking order, the catty jibes
and snide insults, the ritualistic code of social behavior and mis-behavior. Students give
their teachers unending shit and abuse -- and why not? Mr. Tate (Daniel von Bargen) is a
supposedly secret alcoholic (&quot;We exposed Mr. Tate&#146;s drinking last year,&quot;
sneers Delilah. &quot;No one cared.&quot;), and Miss Burke (Famke Janssen) is a mousy,
tentative little thing hiding behind frumpy hair, big glasses, and a voice that
couldn&#146;t carry more than ten feet. But when the bellicose football coach suddenly
stops chewing people out and, horror of horrors, accepts the resignation of top
quarterback and team captain Stan with understanding and support (when thanked for not
going ballistic, he replies, &quot;What kind of human being would I be if I did
that?&quot;with a too-gleeful smile), the kids know something is going on. Moments later
the school&#146;s oldest teacher stumbles into the boy&#146;s shower, her flesh eaten away
in front of Stan&#146;s terrified eyes. The kicker comes when Casey and Delilah sneak into
the teacher&#146;s lounge for a scoop and end up being unwitting witnesses to the
coach&#146;s attack upon perpetually sick Nurse Harper (Salma Hayek), followed by the
discovery of a teacher&#146;s corpse. </p>

<p>Obviously, no one believes them. Casey&#146;s own parents figure he&#146;s high on
drugs and schedule him for psychiatric evaluations (and, until then, confiscate all his
porno magazines). By the next day every teacher has mustered confidence, energy, and an
aggressive self possession out of nowhere (check out Miss Burke&#146;s dressed-to-kill
re-entrance as she chews out Zeke with an &quot;I dare you&quot; smile), an attitude
between tough love and drill sergeant orderliness, and spend their off hours sucking down
gallons of water. While the entire student body is called, one by one, into the office for
&quot;ear exams,&quot; walking out with the same sort of slow walking, glowering intensity
as the faculty, our six heroes (most of whom would never even talk one another, let alone
hang together) find themselves gathered in the science room, looking for the &quot;new
species&quot; Casey discovered on the football field, a bizarre &quot;bug&quot; which
comes to life in the water and looks something like a shrimp with flowing tendrils. The
bug -- the only clue they have too support the proposition of some kind of alien invasion
-- is gone, but science teacher Mr. Furlong (Jon Stewart) is very much present and
insistent that they stay put, even if he has to toss them across the room to keep them
there. In the kind of fortuitous luck that only happens in the movies they discover one
way to defeat the aliens and escape, but the walk through the school yard confirms their
worst suspicions: it&#146;s the six of them against the whole damn town. </p>

<p>Williamson surely remembers his teen years. Where the original <i>Body Snatchers</i>
(which Williamson references in dialogue via sci-fi buff Stokely) was a warning against
the dangers of conformity (it&#146;s been argued as both anti-red scare and anti-red), <i>The
Faculty</i> tosses in the thematic twist of high school cliques and tormented loners: why
wouldn&#146;t they all want to suddenly fit in? Without pushing the issue Williamson finds
a contemporary corollary to the 1950s climate of cold war red scares and McCarthyism that
his teenage audience can all to readily identify with, and then riffs on it. The social
strata may suck, but it&#146;s better than losing your soul, and his geek heroes embrace
their wretched existence. To paraphrase Stan, it&#146;s their pain, they&#146;ve earned
it. Yet the script also comes off as rather slapdash, perhaps polished off a little
hastily and tossed off to Rodriguez. The result is a looser screenplay than his sometimes
over-determined previous efforts, one which itself less seriously. </p>

<p>Much of <em>The Faculty</em> is far fetched and silly -- even for a science fiction
invasion movie with teen rebel heroes. Their entire plan is based on the fairly ludicrous
supposition that if the &quot;Queen Bee&quot; is killed, everything will turn back to
normal, just like in Robert Heinlein&#146;s book &quot;The Puppetmasters.&quot; The
students are walking collections of high-school movie clichés, but style, energy and a
few calculated contradictions give them just enough spice to stay with through the film.
And the teachers? Fuggeduhboutit! The key to the film is the willing suspension of
disbelief -- Rodriguez knows that this is really no more than a monster movie with
Clearasil generation heroes, but he&#146;s pushed himself to make it the BEST <i>Body
Snatchers</i> rip-off ever. There&#146;s nothing especially new or inventive to this goofy
pulp gunk; even the monster, which makes its appearance late in the film, looks
suspiciously like any number of recent giant slimy tentacled creatures CGIed to life in
everything from <em>Phantoms</em> to <em>Deep Rising</em>. But that&#146;s all fine for
Rodriguez, who like his buddy Tarentino is so in love with pulp that he embraces it all.</p>

<p>It&#146;s less bravura than anything in Rodriguez&#146;s previous two films (<i>Depserado</i>
and <i>From Dusk Till Dawn</i>), but of all things it&#146;s stronger, more focused, more
directed. Williamson has given Rodriguez the structure and narrative coherence lacking
from his previous pair, and in return Rodriguez has injected this silly little monster
film with rather thoughtful direction. It sounds crazy, I know, but they have crafted the
perfect throw-away teen horror film: unpretentious, giddily junky, stylistically
restrained, and lots of fun, like a carnival ride. It&#146;s obviously not for everyone,
but if you still enjoy the innocent space operas and monster movies of the 1950s,
you&#146;ll likely take to the savvy updating of those conventions to the 1990s. Check you
brain at the door and have a little fun.</p>
