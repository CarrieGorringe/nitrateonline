<p><i><font size="5"><strong>8</strong></font><font size="4"> Heads in a Duffel Bag</i>
takes its audience back to the world of dese, dose and dem, but with a twist on the old
theme of taking someone for a ride. The &quot;someones&quot;, in this case, happen to be
the decapitated heads of eight mobsters who, shall we say, did not live down to the
mob&#146;s expectations of them. Their freshly-disconnected remains are prepped for
delivery to the story&#146;s Mr. Big. Mr. Big has been waiting for this grisly tribute to
arrive for over two weeks, and his patience is getting a touch thin. The designated
bag-man has only forty-eight hours to make his delivery, or he, too, will be bagged. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><img src="images/r8heads-1.gif" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="114" HEIGHT="179">However
adept the courier, mobster Tommy Spinelli (Pesci), is at evading electronic surveillance
at the airport, he is unable to overcome the kindness of strangers and the intractability
of airline bureaucracy. The carry-on bag in which the heads are resting will not go in
peace to their final destination; among other problems, it is too large for the overhead
bin, so it is unceremoniously consigned to the cargo hold. To keep things interesting, the
bag is an exact replica of the one belonging to Spinelli&#146;s seatmate, Charlie
(Comeau), an earnest but naïve medical student, on route to meet his would-be fiancée,
Laurie (Swanson) and her family, consisting of a control-freak father (Hamilton) and a
dipso mother (Cannon) on her n<sup>th</sup> time through rehab. Naturally, the wrong bag
accompanies Charlie to his Mexican vacation, and a desperate Spinelli goes to
Charlie&#146;s college to &quot;extract&quot; a little information from Charlie&#146;s
dorm mates, Ernie (Spade) and Steve (Louiso). Meanwhile, the vacation plans go up in the
air as Charlie and co. try to figure out just what to do about and with their additional
passengers, who grow riper with every passing day. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><i>8 Heads</i> is an extremely broad farce. Cinematically speaking, it
has much in common with the work of Jerry Lewis. It&#146;s a world in which the characters
are increasingly beset by more and more improbable plot twists until the idea of
plausibility threatens to come completely undone. The tortures inflicted upon the
characters, however, are nothing compared to those suffered by the audience, as its
members wait almost interminably for the punch line while the tension builds. This style
of comedy, the most crude in actual execution, is probably among the most difficult to
construct, for the writer has to skillfully bundle several gags from seemingly disparate
locations, build the tension, and keep the audience engaged in the process without
introducing so many elements and prolonging the tension so long that the audience becomes
confused, annoyed and/or bored. Schulman&#146;s previous comedy, <i>What About Bob?,</i>
in which Richard Dreyfuss is tormented endlessly by the self-absorbed neuroses of Bill
Murray&#146;s character, is very much part of the same tradition. Said comedic style is
also an acquired taste; you either enjoy it or you become annoyed much sooner than anyone
intended. <i>8 Heads</i> differs from its predecessor only in the application of an
impasto of black humor, already a growing trend in this year&#146;s films (included under
that category are the just-released <a href="rgpblank.html" target="_top"><i>Grosse Pointe Blank</i></a>
and the unspeakably dreadful <i>Keys to Tulsa</i>, as well as the forthcoming Australian
film, <i>Children of the Revolution</i>). When black humor is mixed with farce, the usual
result is an upping of the ante in terms of what the audience must endure. A careless
admixture of the two can have the ironic and unintended effect of making the comedy
unendurable. There are moments in <i>8 Heads</i> when this very situation occurs, and a
ninety-minute film soon begins to feel as if it is twice its length. The sequences at the
hotel and those in which our man from the mob is shaking down Charlie&#146;s two
unfortunate friends could have used a generous application of the &quot;delete&quot; key
at the shooting-script stage; the activity slows down so much that you could almost see
the vultures circling over the screening room, and not because of the malodorous nature of
the bag&#146;s contents. Although Schulman is savvy enough to eventually get the film and
the characters back on the road where they belong, and where greater opportunities for
comedy exist, you can be forgiven for wondering whether or not Schulman had planned the
narrative structure with sufficient care. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">As characters in a farce, the actors must be judged by how well they
react to emerging circumstances more than from any amount of psychological motivation.
After years of training at the Martin Scorsese Academy for the Creation and Depiction of
Loud and Psychopathic Mobsters (and receiving an Oscar in the process for playing another
Tommy (De Vito, in <i>Goodfellas</i>), Pesci could basically recreate this persona in his
sleep, and, for most of the film, that&#146;s exactly what he does. It&#146;s as if <a href="rcasino.html" target="_top"><i>Casino&#146;s</i></a> Ricky Santoro was captured by aliens in reel
eight, only to rematerialize directly into a comedy. The effect on screen is somewhat
jarring, because the character&#146;s rigid hostility is often out of sync with the
loosely manic atmosphere around him. How jarring Pesci&#146;s presence is can easily be
illustrated by comparing a similar situation in one of <i>8 Head&#146;s</i>
contemporaries, <i>Grosse Pointe Blank</i>. In <i>Grosse Pointe Blank</i>, John Cusack
deals effectively with the dilemma of making a hit-man funny by cloaking him in an ironic
awareness of his surroundings, thus softening any potentially rough edges. Pesci&#146;s
character has no irony to speak of , a situation that often leaves him drained of humor,
and, as his situation is the critical center of the piece, the film seems to lack a source
of motivation at critical moments (this is not to belittle Pesci&#146;s acting ability;
anyone who has seen Pesci&#146;s work in the second and third <i>Lethal Weapon</i> movies
knows that the actor is more than capable of rising to the manic occasion when called upon
to do so). The script lets the character down. Part of the problem stems from what might
be described as the film&#146;s Scorsese fixation. Apart from the shared first name
between the characters in <i>8 Heads</i> and <i>Goodfellas</i>, and the literal
transposition of characterization discussed above, the audience is treated to yet another
(only semi-amusing) variation on the &quot;you-talkin&#146;-to-me&quot; speech from <a href="ftaxi.html" target="_top"><i>Taxi Driver</i></a>. On some level, it appears that Schulman wants <i>8
Heads</i> to be a satire of Scorsese&#146;s work. Instead, Schulman just shoots himself in
the foot through a lack of directorial control, and Pesci gets hit by the ricochet. To be
fair, there are some inspired gags in this film, but, lamentably, far too few for a film
that falls under the category of comedy.</font></p>

<p><font size="3"><img src="images/r8heads-2.gif" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="117" HEIGHT="179">The
real reason to see <i>8 Heads</i> is supplied by the rest of the cast, all of whom give
excellent performances because they aren&#146;t hemmed in by any prior expectations on the
part of the script. Hamilton and Cannon enrich every scene they are in, as they rip into
their roles and devour them with gusto. Swanson displays a surprisingly mature comedic
ability. Newcomers Louiso and Comeau do likewise as their characters move through the
madness around them. But David Spade is the individual who comes closest to hitting the
mark.. Stripped of the asinine accompaniment of Chris Farley, Spade&#146;s trademark
low-key, smarmy sarcasm quietly but gradually grows into a force that strengthens the
film&#146;s final scenes. Despite all of these pluses, let&#146;s have a moment of
silence, please, for the talent wasted herein.</font></p>
