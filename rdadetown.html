<p><font size="5" face="Times,Times New Roman"><strong>T</strong></font><font size="4" face="Times,Times New Roman">urn on the TV, find an all-news channel, and watch it for a
few minutes. How do you know what you're seeing really happened the way you're seeing it?
That it happened at all? At some point in his too-short life, filmmaker Russ Hexter, who
died of an aortic aneurysm in April of this year at the age of 27, began thinking this way
about news footage and, more specifically, documentary films. Working under the aegis of
Big Ol' Productions, the commercial house he formed with a group of New York University
buddies, Hexter settled on a concept at once brilliantly heretical and frighteningly
pertinent: a feature-length documentary on a hot-button American contemporary
sociopolitical issue to be made up out of thin air. Completely fake. The locations an
amalgam of upstate New York villages, the subjects a mix of interested locals and regional
stage professionals. And thus was <i>Dadetown</i> born. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">&quot;Small towns have little problems too,&quot;
understates a citizen midway through this extraordinary meta-documentary in which an
idyllic community in upstate New York must adjust and adapt to an influx of young urban
professionals and the tensions raised when the high-tech API (American Peripheral Imaging)
company quietly opens a complex on the outskirts of town at the same time local employer
Gorman Metal (airplanes during World War II, paper clips and staples now) goes into a
financial tailspin. A PBS camera crew assigned to film a short profile of the simple town
becomes swept up in a vortex of emotion and suspicion when daily life in the traditional
community takes an ugly and violent turn that given the social and economic forces at work
is perhaps inevitable.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">The film is a construction that not only comments on
the documentary form but expands upon it as well. &quot;I've always believed that <i>Dadetown</i>
could not have been made any other way without doing damage to the holistic story, which
tries to address the identity crisis among small towns in America,&quot; says director and
co-scenarist Russ Hexter of his feature film debut. &quot;I'll admit the film was somewhat
of an experiment to see just how far we could go... With a documentary, there is a much
deeper connection to the events on the screen...and with <i>Dadetown</i> we tried to
temporarily lift that veil... If you can't experiment with your first feature, then
what?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Which leads naturally to the question, why would a
filmmaker want to run the risk of violating an audience's trust in the veracity of the
material? Although Hexter didn't live long enough to speak in great detail about his
achievement, his family and friends are confident they have the answers and said so to the
New York Times: &quot;He loved the idea that it could fool people,&quot; remembers his
mother, 58-year-old Maren Hexter. &quot;Russ loved every character in this movie,&quot;
said producer Jim Carden. &quot;He didn't try to make the townspeople look like idiots. He
didn't try to make the API people look like idiots. He just wanted to state a case,
without judging either side.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">The effect of this meta-documentary on the festival
circuit was instantaneous. Audiences in Vancouver, where the film had its premiere, were
thunderstruck to see a cast list in the closing credit crawl. One woman, jumped up during
the post-screening question-and-answer session, proclaiming &quot;I think you're going to
do great in Hollywood because you're a liar and a cheat.&quot; And some critics and
festival programmers around the country were fooled into believing that <i>Dadetown</i>
was real. In the months before his death, Hexter also sent the film to the Boston and
Sundance festivals.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">In fact, those concerned by the increasingly blurred
line between fact and fiction in American media owe it to themselves to see this
extraordinary accomplishment. Russ Hexter believed that fooling the public forced them to
confront the issue of how easy it to be fooled by &quot;authentic&quot;-looking footage
and said so to this reviewer in a series of telephone conversations shortly before his
death. When urged to agree to a film festival note leaking the film's secret, Hexter
laughed then pulled up short. &quot;I'll have to think about that one.&quot; Twenty four
hours later he agreed, but with a tangible lack of enthusiasm. For him, the instructional
value inherent in the shock of deception far outweighed the dog-and-pony show label. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">This astonishing debut doesn't grab and hold right
away, but give it time: subversive and insidious, the cumulative effect is devastating.
Other films have dealt with these questions in both documentary (<i>David Holzman's Diary</i>,
<i>Roger and Me</i>) and dramatic (<i>Capricorn One</i>) form. As word of the small town
that succumbs to its &quot;little problems&quot; spreads among those who take their movies
seriously, <i>Dadetown</i> will mark an important turning point in American moviemaking.
Tragically, Hexter isn't around to see the ripples his work has caused. And, no doubt,
he'd be happy that a lot of people who see Dadetown have trouble watching television news
in quite the same way.</font></p>
