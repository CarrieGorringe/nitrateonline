<p><big><strong><big>F</big></strong>eaturing the most mischievous and appealingly sassy
performance by Jack Nicholson since at least <i>Batman</i> nearly ten years ago (1995's
underrated <i>The Crossing Guard</i> shows him at his recent dramatic best), as well as a
triumphant return to offbeat comic form by producer-director-writer James L. Brooks, the
aptly titled <i>As Good as It Gets</i> is a triumph of collaborative, intuitive filmmaking
and one funny picture in the bargain.</big></p>

<p><img src="images/rgoodas-1.jpg" hspace="15" align="right" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">Tart-tongued Manhattan-based
romance novelist Melvin Udall (Nicholson: that's funny right there) is an
obsessive-compulsive who makes life miserable for everyone in his West Village apartment
building and neighborhood. Before the title credit even appears he's casually tossed a dog
down a garbage chute, and when vexed he tends to say things like &quot;people who speak in
metaphors should shampoo my crotch.&quot; Melvin has his rituals, throwing each lock on
his door and flipping his light switches a certain number of times, avoiding <i>all</i>
cracks on <i>all</i> flooring and street surfaces, unwrapping a new bar of soap each time
he washes his hands, that sort of thing. But his most coveted regimen involves a daily
meal at Café 24, where the only waitress who will tolerate him (barely) is Carol Connelly
(Helen Hunt), who has her own problems raising a chronically asthmatic son under the
watchful eye of her pragmatic mother Beverly (Shirley Knight).</p>

<p>The other chief foil for Melvin's vituperative barbs is Simon (Greg Kinnear), the gay
artist who lives just across the hall. Riding a wave of dizzying success, Simon is
surrounded by supporters include his art dealer Frank Sachs (Cuba Gooding, Jr.). As the
relationships among these unlikely friends develop in a complex dance of missed
opportunities and unsteady alliances and culminating in a harrowingly funny trip outside
the comfortable confines of New York City to the uncharted emotional waters of Baltimore
(although it looks like nothing was actually shot there), each reveals strengths and
weaknesses that make them at once endearingly vulnerable and comically greedy. </p>

<p>While Nicholson will get the lion's share of the press for his concentrated blast of
exaggerated obnoxiousness (or maybe that's just how New Yorkers are), the movie's
quicksilver heart belongs to Hunt, who may remind savvy movie lovers with long memories of
a contemporary Carole Lombard (quick, run out and rent <i>Twentieth Century</i> [1934], <i>My
Man Godfrey</i> [1936], and especially the 1937 screwball masterpiece <i>Nothing Sacred</i>).
</p>

<p><img src="images/rgoodas-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="225">After a brief
string of less than successful comedies (that so what remake of <a href="rsabrina.html" target="_top"><i>Sabrina</i></a>,
<i>A Smile Like Yours</i>, <i>Dear God</i>), Greg Kinnear brings a concentration and light
touch missing from his previous work to the role of Simon. One suspects more to the Cuba
Gooding, Jr. role than what's in the final cut, but the surviving performance leaves a
good impression. Stealing everything that isn't nailed down from the principles is Jill, a
Brussels Griffon (that's dog to the rest of us) from Texas that Brooks called &quot;the
fourth lead in the picture.&quot; Timer and Billy are credited as well, apparently for
serving as emergency backup stunt dogs of sorts.</p>

<p>The director, who's won three Oscars and 13 Emmy Awards to date, has a knack for making
funny movies out of red-flag subjects: cancer in the Oscar-winning <i>Terms of Endearment</i>
(1983), blind ambition in <i>Broadcast News</i> (1987), the self-absorption of
contemporary creative types in <i>I'll Do Anything</i> (1994) and just about everything
else in the anarchic, irreverent humor of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (which he produces) and
last year's celebrated <a href="rjmaguire.html" target="_top"><i>Jerry McGuire</i></a> (which he
produced, and is perhaps the closest in tone &#150; call it the buckshot theory of comedy
&#150; to <i>As Good as It Gets</i>). </p>

<p>The original script by Mark Andrus (who wrote the unique but poorly balanced 1991 movie
<i>Late for Dinner</i>) was extensively reworked by Brooks, who decided to make
Nicholson's illness clinical and eventually balanced the insults with emotionally honest
moments like Melvin's confessional to Carol in a Baltimore restaurant: &quot;Your skin,
your long neck, the back, the line of you. You're why cavemen chiseled on walls.&quot; And
then the clincher: &quot;You make me want to be a better man.&quot; This from the guy who
wants somebody to shampoo his crotch?</p>

<p><img src="images/rgoodas-3.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">&quot;The tone of
this picture was always a bafflement for me,&quot; Brooks has said, &quot;I started to try
and write some of what I wanted the movie to be about. It ended up being a year of writing
for me. The tone was completely up for grabs; I'd never seen anything like it.&quot; Even
the name change during production points to initial confusion over the direction of the
film, as the original title <i>Old Friends</i> (an odd choice, given the finished film)
gave way to the current moniker.</p>

<p>As has become de rigeur for a Brooks project, in-jokes abound. Writer-directors
Lawrence Kasdan (<i>Body Heat</i>, <i>Grand Canyon</i>) and Harold Ramis (<i>Groundhog Day</i>,
<i>Multiplicity</i>) have amusing cameos as doctors, and that's <i>Welcome to the
Dollhouse</i> director Todd Solondz as Hunt's mute busmate in a brief shot that may at one
time have been part of a larger scene. </p>

<p>On <i>that</i> subject, Brooks had always been known for having a very clear idea of
what he wanted to accomplish on a movie set, but in fact re-shot and re-edited so much of <i>As
Good as It Gets</i> that it took a half-dozen test screenings &#150; maybe four more than
the rough industry average &#150; to get the film exactly where he had finally decided it
should go. &quot;The picture's about the things we do to make ourselves safe in our
prisons,&quot; he told the New York Times recently. &quot;I feel that if we're not
striving for a state, a life that's better, we're nuts. I was nuts. I've had a change of
heart. It's a new take on life for me, and God knows I needed one. I guess it says, sanity
is optimism.&quot; </p>

<p><img src="images/rgoodas-4.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="225">If there are
drawbacks to film's freewheeling approach to life and love, one cavil might be the budding
romance between Nicholson (born 1937) and Hunt (born 1963); do the math. Another might be
the length, despite Brooks' efforts at distillation; at two hours and eighteen minutes
even the freshest comedy tends to overstay its welcome. Yet for all its genial meandering
it is hard indeed to dislike a movie that has the following line discreetly tucked at the
very end of the credits: &quot;The actors used in this film were in no way
mistreated.&quot;</p>

<p>Already surfacing on a number of ten best lists for the movie-going year, <i>As Good as
It Gets</i> succeeds on sheer chutzpah alone (&quot;a comedy from the heart that goes for
the throat,&quot; proclaims the pithy tag line), but stays in the memory for its depiction
of three-dimensional characters in search of some kind of genuine human interaction in a
world that moves too fast and offers too few breaks. Just the kind of bittersweet
movie-going experience that audiences adore this time of year (if you act the way you're
supposed to you'll love these folks, you'll hate these folks, then you'll love them all
over again), <i>As Good as It Gets</i> is, to risk the obvious, contemporary American
comedy as good as it gets.&nbsp;</p>
