<p><em>Ace Ventura II</em> is supposed to be a comedy, but ends up being only a tragic
waste of Jim Carrey's innate talent. Two scenes in particular underscore the waste because
they are so indicative of what Carrey can do with good material. Even if you're not a fan
of anti-fur organizations, Carrey manages to humiliate a fur-bearing female and her much
older spouse with a gesture that, although outrageous, manages to be both funny and
thought-provoking without sinking to the level of the didactic. Later in the film, Carrey
intends to make a recalcitrant suspect talk by scraping a knife and fork across a dinner
plate (it does have an effect on the ears similar to that of nails riding down the surface
of a chalkboard). Both of these scenes are evocative the best work and characters that
Carrey brought to life on the Fox Television show <em>In Living Color</em> during the
early '90s, notably Vera de Milo, the intellectually-vapid-but-vain female bodybuilder,
and especially Fireman Bill, the psychopathic pyromaniac who always seemed to get the
worst of his own fire-prevention tips, accepting his lot with glee -- call him the Wile E.
Coyote of fire fighting, but add a masochistic streak to the analogy. Even in their
unrepentant nastiness, those characters had a perversely endearing quality that made
Carrey's work stand out from that of his equally talented colleagues; in this context,
Carrey could use his facial and vocal contortions to excellent effect by playing them both
with and against the strong satirical undercurrent of his characters. </p>

<p>In his movie career, however, Carrey has so far seemed to ignore the latter element of
satire, much to the detriment of his work, and this film is no exception. It isn't
coincidental that the above-mentioned scenes are the only ones which really have any sort
of comic charge, and that is precisely because they have reasonably firm roots in social
and/or cinematic conventions which are then turned squarely on their heads; after all, it
is, as already noted, the kind of work at which Carrey excels. But his cinematic
collaborators to date have only seen the visual manifestation of Carrey's talent and
apparently want to turn him into the equivalent of all Three Stooges wrapped up into one
package. Such a strategy might be fine for a five-minute skit, but it cannot sustain a
ninety-minute film (regardless of what Stooges fans might have to say about it). Ace
Ventura borrows the manic humor and nastiness of Fireman Bill, but, without context, the
character is reduced to spouting childishly vulgar non sequitors in lieu of witty
dialogue, and, quite simply, the non sequitors at best provide nothing more than momentary
shock value. They, all of the rubbery faces, and all of the voice work in the world, no
matter how well executed, don't coalesce often enough or effectively enough to propel this
film beyond the uncomfortable impression that everyone in it is operating just beyond the
realm of his or her abilities -- call it the Peter Principle as applied to Hollywood.
Someone should have given writer-director Oedekerk a basic lesson in writing comedy,
preferably after having tied him to a chair, and while scraping a knife and fork across a
dinner plate. The thought of someone doing just that would be at least partial
compensation for the audience's pain and suffering (although there can be none for poor
McNeice and Callow, who must wonder what they have done to deserve this assignment). As
for Carrey, who approved of Oedekirk's hiring after clashing with another director on the
set, he should share his director's fate, if only to prevent him from making the same
mistake again (he's already made it more than twice).</p>

<p>Somehow or other, it seems likely that <em>Ace Ventura II</em> will prove to be a big
hit, if the box-office returns for the original <em>Ace Ventura</em> and the eponymous <em>Dumb
and Dumber</em> are any indication. There are many who will be more than happy to fork
over their money for the opportunity to watch Carrey working his facial and vocal magic,
expecting nothing else in return, and that is a shame for those who know that Carrey is
capable of far more than he delivers here. However, it has been reported that Mr. Carrey
intends to go for yecchs rather than yuks in his next film, a black comedy entitled (at
last report) <em>Cable Guy</em>; he intends to expand his repertoire by playing a demented
cable technician who terrorizes poor Matthew Broderick. The project sounds less like an
expansion of repertoire than a long-overdue return to his roots. </p>
