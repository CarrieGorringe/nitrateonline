<p><font size="5"><strong>I</strong></font><font size="4">n the opening scene of <em>Mulholland

protests heartily to Detective Maxwell Hoover (Nolte) that this can&#146;t be allowed to
happen because &quot;this is America&quot;, as if constitutional rights had always been of
paramount importance in the Mob&#146;s operations. Max heartily informs him, &quot;This

whose chief, William Parker, would become the mentor of Chief Darryl Gates, that bastion
of racial tolerance and respector of civil rights). The squad, the moviegoer is informed,
was constituted to prevent infiltration of the L.A. power structure by mob figures. But
the crew, and Max in particular, will soon discover that, in the land of extralegal
justice, there are much higher stakes, many of them of an entirely more personal
character. While investigating the gruesome murder of a good-time girl named Allison Pond
(Connolly), Hoover soon learns from a friend of hers, Jimmy Fields (McCarthy) that he and
the lady were fond of capturing her more intimate moments with other men on 16 mm film. </font></p>

<p>Hoover&#146;s investigations soon lead him to one Colonel Tibbs (Malkovich), who, in
this story, is credited with inventing the H-Bomb. Colonel Tibbs has the mentality of the
Cold War down pat. An epicene version of Dr. Strangelove crossed with Edward Teller (the
&quot;genius&quot; behind the H-Bomb), Tibbs is a morally- and emotionally-detached
individual, to say the least; he informs Nolte that it is &quot;the cornerstone of
civilization&quot; that some people must die &quot;before their time&quot; so that others
may live. As soon becomes clear, however, Hoover and Tibbs have much more in common than
the practice of officially-sanctioned sociopathy and a weakness for trite aphorisms.
Hoover will soon discover how much of an amateur he really is in under-the-table dealings,
because his work is not informed by ideological passion, but it soon will be, especially
when the, if one will pardon the expression, fallout from his investigations hits
Max&#146;s wife, Kay (Griffith) right in her blissful unconsciousness.</p>

<p>At the very least, <em>Mulholland Falls</em> has a most auspicious title, one very much
in keeping with the tradition of depicting Los Angeles history as nothing more than a
ponzi scheme of corruption -- a truthful assessment, as anyone familiar with the situation
can attest. Screenwriter Robert Towne, in composing the script for the Polanski classic, <em>Chinatown</em>,
borrowed liberally from the scandals that revolved around the successful efforts of Water
Commissioner William Mulholland (and others) to bring water to an ever-expanding city from
its inception in the early twentieth century, efforts which were always colored with a
tinge or two or three of corruption. Thus, the film&#146;s title is at once eponymous with
the cinematic territory of neo-noir, but the title also symbolically connotes the
relationship between <em>Mulholland Falls</em> and <em>Chinatown</em>: the two films share
several elements, from the thematic motifs (among them, the obsessive pursuit of truth
leading to personal ruin) right down to the gentle sepia tone that master cinematographer
Haskell Wexler allows to waft into every scene to denote moral corruption or the portent
thereof. There&#146;s even a reference to water for good measure, as Max describes the
concept of personal responsibility to his compatriot Harry Coolidge (Palminteri) as
&quot;carry[ing] your own water.&quot; One doesn&#146;t even want to ask if evading
personal responsibility is the equivalent of passing your own water, because the
metaphorical implications for this film are truly irresistible.</p>

<p><em>Mulholland Falls</em> is, at best and , at its heart, nothing more than a bloodless
imitation of <em>Chinatown</em>. Unlike Carl Franklin&#146;s <a href="rdevilb.html" target="_top"><em>Devil
In A Blue Dress</em></a>, which also reworked those same motifs, but did so from a
previously unexplored point of view, <em>Mulholland Falls</em> has nothing unique to
recommend it either thematically or visually; indeed, there is the uncomfortable
impression of underlying fear exclusive of plot developments; while the film is playing at
its self-conscious masquerade, it seems to be desperately hoping that no one will draw the
obvious comparison between itself and its more distinguished predecessor. One might have
expected better from director Tamahori, who skillfully delineated the interconnectedness
of spousal abuse and racism in <em>Once Were Warriors</em>. Apparently, Tamahori
doesn&#146;t have the foggiest notion of the relationship between personal ambition and an
extreme ideology, and the consequences that ensue in the political arena from this
sinister combination.</p>

<p>By and large, the performances in <em>Mulholland Falls</em> don&#146;t help the
situation much. Nolte, Penn and Connolly are adequate to the task, but only just.
Nolte&#146;s acting style has always consisted less of emoting than of lumbering into the
frame and filling it with an overbearing presence and gruff demeanor, and he conforms
exactly to type here. Griffith&#146;s role as the dutiful and long-suffering wife, pale in
both appearance and spirit, is absolutely thankless, and she conducts herself accordingly,
as the film rolls on to its unbearably obvious conclusion. Palminteri contributes a few
brief sparks, when the script permits him to do so (thus leading to the question of when
the very-talented Palminteri is going to straighten out his own act and choose scripts
that are commensurate with said talent, instead of making junk like this and <a href="rdiabol.html" target="_top"><em>Diabolique</em></a>), but the incessant psychobabble pouring from
Coolidge&#146;s mouth grates just as incessantly upon the audience&#146;s nerves.
Malkovich uses his role as an opportunity to perfect his quietly creepy persona, and it
works very well. As Tibbs&#146; insanely-devoted bodyguard and factotum, Williams does
nothing more than a straight version of <em>Dr. Strangelove&#146;s</em> General Jack D.
Ripper, and it is about as interesting as one might expect. The only real surprise in this
film is the performance given by McCarthy, who breaks free from his former &quot;Brat
Pack&quot; persona and is really able, in his brief role as Jimmy, to give some sense of
the urgency surrounding this murder case. Fortunately for the film, the strength of
McCarthy&#146;s performance lingers long enough to give the film some degree of
inspiration, but, after a couple of futile hours of <em>Mulholland Falls</em>, it&#146;s
obvious that the gangster in the opening sequence isn&#146;t the only person in this film
to have taken a fall.</p>
