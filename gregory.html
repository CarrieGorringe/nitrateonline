<meta name="description" content="Mr. Avery's interest in film dates back to when he was born in San Diego, California, in 1960, on the same day that Leslie Stevens' Private Property had its world premiere engagement in New York City, his mother's interest in the films of Gregory Peck, and to when his father, a lieutenant-commander in the U.S. Navy, met Harold Lloyd at the 1962 Cannes Film Festival. Mr. Avery had the privilege of living in Wisconsin, Virginia, Florida and the San Francisco Bay Area before settling in Medford, Oregon in 1971. He studied media communications at Brigham Young University and Southern Oregon State College before receiving a degree (in 1983) and working in film and video production, and in journalism. He has previously written about film for an Ashland, Oregon publication from 1989 - 91. Other interests include music, art, literature, history, and politics and world affairs. He currently resides in Oregon with two cats. His three favorite films are Citizen Kane, The Umbrellas of Cherbourg, and The Horror of Party Beach.">
