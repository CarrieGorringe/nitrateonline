with the progress (or lack thereof) of <i>Evita</i> over the tortuous process of
conversion from stage to screen knows all too well, it is the film that almost didn&#146;t

been kicking around the studios for at least fifteen years. Along the way, so many

<p>For anyone who knows the life story of the real Eva Peron, as opposed to the nice
glossy newsreels and propaganda speeches, the casting of Madonna as her cinematic
alter-ego was a piece of inspired casting, however unintentional. Both share a ruthless
ambition, overweening egoism, and the ability to recycle shopworn symbolism into something
perceived as being both exciting and trangressive. Eva Peron, nee Duarte, was born
illegitimate and rose to become a semi-successful radio actress through the judicious
exercising of the principle of vertical social mobility through horizontal effort. Then
she captured the interest of an equally ambitious Juan Peron, who made her his mistress
and then married her once he understood her importance to his success. It was she who
wooed the crowds into supporting her husband, convincing the &quot;shirtless ones&quot;
that only she and her husband cared enough about them to improve their lot for the price
of a vote. Once installed as first lady of Argentina, Mrs. Peron established
&quot;reforms&quot; that can most charitably be characterized as piecemeal and
ineffective. She also had hospitals built under her imprimatur which did more for her
image than for anyone who required emergency care. However, milady was capable of
persuading the poverty-stricken that she really loved them, and was acting only on their
behalf, even if it meant having to raid the public purse in order to do so. Although she
was probably one of the few Argentineans of note to even go through the motions of caring
for the socially dispossessed, her altruistic tendencies must have rested somewhat easier
on her mind and purse knowing that her own money was not involved. Mrs. Peron&#146;s real
interests in life, according to several of the more honest intimates of the Peronist
circle, were apparently restricted to the insatiable collecting of designer gowns and the
extension of her personal power. In addition, her political thinking never veered higher
than the average sob-sister cliches; the newly-discovered volume of Evita&#146;s thoughts,
if one might excuse the term, goes on in nauseating detail about her love for the people
(someone had to pay for the Dior dresses, after all). She died in 1952 after a nasty fight
with uterine cancer, aged thirty-three, her beauty and image intact. Many of her financial
and ideological shenanigans might have caught up with her had she not possessed an
immaculate sense of timing, but timing, as Madonna herself might tell you, is the essence
of being a public icon.</p>

<p>Continuing in this iconographic tradition, the cinematic version of <i>Evita</i> is,
alas, as terminally superficial as its main character and one of its weakest elements lies
in its lead actress. The role of Eva Peron was supposed to be the performance that would
provide incontrovertible evidence of Madonna&#146;s apparently God-given right to become a
cinematic legend; since we&#146;ve all been waiting for at least twelve years, and through
countless unwatchable films, for her to provide said evidence, we should be grateful,
apparently, for any end to the talent drought, no matter how self-declared it most surely
is. Her Unholiness has already implied, with Her usual more-than-indecent haste, that said
performance is of an impeachable caliber. Indeed, in Her opinion, the Academy can simply
stop wasting its time assembling a list of Best Actress nominations and provide Her with
the award that She is surely going to win. Such prognostications are laughably premature
at best. To be both fair and crass -- and I know She wouldn&#146;t have it any other way
-- Madonna does give great screen presence. She physically embodies the late Evita in a
manner that is almost like a resurrection of the very artificial original, right down to
the overweening ego; when Madonna sings the new song written for the cinematic version, <i>You
Must Love Me </i>(written by Rice and Lloyd-Webber), it doesn&#146;t require much of a
stretch to imagine Evita singing it as well, and the inability to separate actress from
historical figure inspires less pathos than a sense of eerieness that borders upon the
ghoulish. It is, therefore, rather unfortunate to have to report that the entire illusion
constructed by Madonna is demolished utterly the minute that the lady opens her mouth to
exercise her octave-challenged range upon the Rice-Lloyd Webber repertoire. Moreover, the
sound engineers have obviously been working overtime to give some lift to what isn&#146;t
naturally there; the voice has been subjected to so much sweetening that a persistent and
annoying echo rings under each syllable. This may be what Hollywood means by &quot;star
quality,&quot; but the only thing that Buenos Aries needs to stand back from is the
embarrassing spectacle of a singer performing the vocal equivalent of a little girl trying
to walk in her mother&#146;s shoes. The Argentineans have every reason to be upset with
Madonna, but not for the reasons they had in mind (though they should not be upset with
Pryce, who provides as much suaveness as he can to his one-dimensional role or with
Banderas as the narrator, Che, who carries this picture single-handedly with great charm
and a surprisingly enjoyable singing voice).</p>

<p>Compounding <i>Evita&#146;s</i> problems is director Alan Parker. Never a master of
cinematic excitement, the structure of his films -- even his musicals, like <i>Fame</i>
and <i>Pink Floyd: The Wall</i> -- tends to resemble an unconditioned runner: lots of
enthusiasm for the endeavor at the start followed by flagging energy culminating in
exhaustion at the finish. Parker then compounds his own compounding by adding Oliver Stone
-- never a master of cinematic subtlety -- to Evita's credits. The result is the worst of
both worlds: risible hyperactivity and narrative neurasthenia operating side-by-side, with
neither acting as a check upon the other. The harm caused by this folie a deux is most
obvious in the staging of the musical numbers, the film's lifeblood. Why bother with the
rich metaphorical choreography from the Broadway musical when it is so much easier to
inspire passion and provide an adequate sense of sweeping geography by borrowing crowd
shots nearly whole cloth from David Lean&#146;s <i>Dr. Zhivago</i> (if it hadn&#146;t been
for the Spanish-language banners carried by the Peronist and anti-Peronist crowds, I could
have sworn that I was watching Lean&#146;s interpretation of the Russian Revolution). He
also borrows somewhat liberally from the much-reviled-but-often-imitated Leni Riefenstahl
(in particular, the sequence in which Mrs. Peron returns from her less-than-whirlwind tour
of Europe recalls the opening sequence of Triumph of the Will a little too closely for
comfort, as do those shots of a victorious Evita confronting her followers from the
balcony of the Presidential Palace). The borrowings are clumsy and confuse whatever
message the film wants to provide. Does Parker think of Evita as a Hitlerian figure, or is
she simply Argentina&#146;s equivalent of the American Dream: a bad girl made good? Is she
both, and, if she is, then what does that say about the role that Argentineans played in
creating Evita the Legend, or of any country in any context that creates legends? </p>

<p>None of these important questions are touched upon even tangentially in Parker's
version. Tim Rice&#146;s cleverly satirical lyrics capture much of the ambiguity in these
sorts of situations (as when Che reminds the audience near the beginning of the film that
Evita really didn&#146;t accomplish much of anything during her lifetime to deserve a
hero&#146;s funeral), but Parker is too preoccupied with putting a gloss on the Madonna
legend to be bothered with anything as messy as ambiguity; after all, he has to get to the
great star-making death scene as soon as is decently possible. Instead of depth with a
glossy surface, as was provided by the musical, Parker goes for the reverse, hoping that
it will be sufficient. He introduces details such as Evita&#146;s locking of her bedroom
door soon after her marriage to Juan Peron, without taking the trouble to explain just why
the marriage has come to this impasse so soon. By doing so, Parker allows the audience to
believe that the Perons&#146; marriage was a political sham. The explanation is too
simplistic -- they did love each other, in the fashion that politically interdependent
couples tend to, with each recognizing and respecting the importance of the other in the
central aim of achieving power. Again, however, this representation of &quot;fraud&quot;
is yet another example of Parker&#146;s discomfort with the uncomfortable. In refusing to
confront this central problem, Parker fills <i>Evita</i> the film with lots of
overwhelming, if empty, spectacle, but strips it of relevance.</p>
