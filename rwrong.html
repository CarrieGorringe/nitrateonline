<font FACE="Times,Times New Roman" SIZE="4">

<p></font><font FACE="Times,Times New Roman" size="3">So, just when you thought it was
safe to stay away from the movie theater (after spoof turkeys <a href="rbaseket.html" target="_top"><i>BASEketball</i></a>
and <a href="rmafia.html" target="_top"><i>Jane Austin&#146;s Mafia</i></a>), along comes the latest
escape from the mad genius of triple threat producer, director, writer Pat Proft. Who else
but one of the warped minds behind <i>Police Squad!</i> and <i>Naked Gun</i> would give us
Leslie Nielsen as Frank Drebin as &quot;Lord of the Violin&quot; Ryan Harrison, a bumbling
superstar sucked into a web of international intrigue and the attempted assassination of
the U.N. Secretary General. Yeah, and this film even has a plot (I think)!</p>

<p><img src="images/rwrong-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">Nielsen is his
usually carefree and careless self in a clone-gone-batty amalgam of Thomas Clancy&#146;s
CIA whiz and one of the most popular movie stars of the last 20 years (hint: look at the
character&#146;s name). I doubt Nielsen will ever return to the dramatic performances that
some of us old-timers remember from among his 60-plus films and 1,500 (yipes!) television
appearances, as he certainly has honed his comedy shtick in a generous string of comedy
hits (and some notable misses, i.e. <i>Mr. Magoo</i>) since 1980&#146;s <i>Airplane</i>.
In <i>Wrongfully</i> he&#146;s again in fine form, obviously having the time of his life
(especially opposite two younger women), and hence resulting in the Law of Infectious
Laughter, which expounds that watching this film with larger and more compacted audiences
logarithmically increases the amount of your twittering.</p>

<p><img src="images/rwrong-3.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">I didn&#146;t take
as many notes while watching this film as the visual and verbal jabs kept getting in the
way. And while not as cram-packed with yuks as some of its predecessors, many of the gags
work. I particularly liked the re-mastered bus/train crash (watch out for that banana
peel!) and the very determined locomotive cast in the role. Among the human support are
Richard Crenna in the Tommy Lee Jones&#146; role of overzealous and overboard U.S. Marshal
Fergus Falls, barking at his deputies when not engaging in cat-and-Marx Brothers routines
with his escaped prisoner. Love interest is provided by Kelly Le Brock as adulterous
Lauren Goodhue, the suddenly grief-stricken widow (&quot;You mean I&#146;ll have to start
dating again?&quot;) of portable potty magnate Hibbing Goodhue (Michael York). Melinda
McGraw also gets a few smooches from our hero as she tries to figure out how she relates
to all the other players. Sandra Bernhard gets fourth billing but her role lasts less than
a minute. Don&#146;t blink. Aaron Perl is the discombobulated Mr. Potato Head as the
one-armed, one-legged, one-eyed (flying purple people eater?) killer with lethal
prosthetics.</p>

<p>Finally, DO NOT LEAVE THE THEATER BEFORE THE CREDITS ARE DONE. You should know that
this is one of the more enjoyable postscripts for comedies of this ilk. Winning lottery
numbers, the director&#146;s favorite lunch on a cold, rainy day, and today&#146;s menu
are just a few to watch for. All in all, a nice follow up punch for a knockout of a film.</font></p>
