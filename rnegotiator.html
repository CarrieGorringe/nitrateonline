<p>The Negotiator</i> is one of those gloriously unbelievable screenplays and overproduced
films that escapist-prone audiences will lap up despite its shortcomings. On the plus
side, the razor-sharp talents of Samuel L. Jackson and particularly Kevin Spacey will work
up a thespian lather as they spit loud words off each other in this edgy action drama
pitting veteran Chicago hostage negotiator Danny Roman (Jackson), wrongly accused of his
partner&#146;s murder and the misappropriation of a police disability fund, against his
highly focused west side counterpart Chris Sabian (Spacey). It&#146;s <a href="rfaceoff.html" target="_top"><i>Face/Off</i></a> without the surgery, <i>Speed</i> without the
bus. <i>The Negotiator</i> even steals a plot twist from the latter film.</p>

<p></font><img src="images/rnegotiator-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="133" HEIGHT="200"><font FACE="Times,Times New Roman" size="3">Director Gray, a music video veteran with two
earlier features (<i>Set It Off</i> and <i>Friday</i>) under his belt, keeps the movement
frenetic, albeit his frenzied pacing still could have been trimmed at least 15 minutes
from its two and a quarter hour length. James DeMonaco and Kevin Fox have their first
produced script based on an actual event that happened in St. Louis. The film is re-set in
the city of the El, providing Jackson with an emotionally-wrought character hair-triggered
into an implausible situation. Within the confines of this paramilitary predicament, the
writers carry the operation along to an obvious conclusion, shuttling between the blowhard
efforts of the Metropolitan Police, the tense 20th floor Internal Affairs pawnroom where
Roman holds court, the cerebral cunning of Sabian seemingly taking charge, a citywide
media circus, the encroaching claws of the FBI, and a Roman&#146;s despairing bride
(Regina Taylor). Among the local honchos in on the action are Commander Beck (David
Morse), the humorless TAC leader more inclined to gunplay than wordplay (he also has some
of the worst lines in a film with lots of them); Commander &quot;Frosty&quot; Frost (Ron
Rifkin), the corrupt district attorney dangled out of the window in <a href="rlacon.html" target="_top"><i>L.A.
Confidential</i></a> and now a compassion-feigning hostage; and Chief Al Davis (<i>L.A.
Law&#146;s</i> John Spencer), trying to make do with a unbelievable role as Roman&#146;s
stoic boss, a troubling role from which even Houdini couldn&#146;t escape. The late J. T.
Walsh (<i>Breakdown</i>,<b> </b><i>Sling Blade</i>)<b> </b>is at the center of the
maelstrom as Internal Affairs Inspector Niebaum, holding out until the end before spilling
the beans and a few other things.</p>

<p>One of the problems is that Spacey doesn&#146;t even show up until 45 minutes into the
film in a low key domestic confrontation that plays Sabian&#146;s at-home stress. With an
actor as exciting as Spacey, it&#146;s a shame he has to wait in the wings so long. His
confrontations with Roman remind me of those electric moments that Al Pacino and Robert De
Niro appear together in <a href="rheat.html" target="_top"><i>Heat</i></a>; too few in an overlong film.</p>

<p><img src="images/rnegotiator-2.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="left" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">Offsetting the
tense dramatic moments are nearly comedic (and unheralded in the press material) offerings
by actors Stephen Lee (as a frustrated telephone go-between who nearly has a heart attack
at Roman&#146;s fast-talking expense), and Paul Giamatti (son of A. Bartlett Giamatti,
late president of Yale University and Commissioner of Baseball) and Siobahn Fallon as
hostages Rudy and Maggie. Giamatti is also seen currently in <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>
and <i>The Truman Show</i>, but his ratty inspiration in <i>The Negotiator</i> is firmly
rooted in his portrayal of Kenny &#145;Pig Vomit&#146; Rushton in last year&#146;s <i>Private
Parts</i>. SNL alum Fallon adds to an impressive filmography decorated with nearly a dozen
roles including the dopey wife of bug-man Vincent D&#146;Onofrio in <a href="rmib.html" target="_top"><i>Men
in Black</i></a> and the schoolbus driver in <i>Forrest Gump</i>.</p>

<p>Director of Photography Russell Carpenter, on a breather after a succession of films
with James Cameron (<a href="ftitanic.html" target="_top"><i>Titanic</i></a>, <i>True Lies</i>), shows
Chicago in well-lit nighttime splendor, while Holger Gross&#146;s production design shows
a decisively claustrophobic bent. But Gray is at the helm and he should have held up
production to re-write the storylines. He plays with a lot of techno gadgets and adds some
nice visual touches, but then forgets to put paramedics in an ambulance. I did like the
filmmaker&#146;s use of muted flash photograph pops as the intrusive press mongrels harp
around the anti-hero, and there&#146;s an intriguingly intercut sequence in which Sabian,
in a ground level control center, is shown rewriting the rules of engagement as a
hand-held camera quickly glimpses his interaction with the SWAT team supervisors, while
Roman&#146;s actions are shown in a more deliberate and less agitated fashion as he
verbally counter-punches.</p>
<i>

<p>The Negotiator</i> is a chess match played out with human lives. Talky and methodical.
Unfortunately the writers were writing as if they were playing checkers. It&#146;s flashy
enough for most audiences, but not nearly as intelligent as it could have been.</font></p>
