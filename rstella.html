<p><big><big><strong>V</strong></big>ery much a companion piece to 1995&#146;s <i>Waiting
to Exhale</i>, brought to you by the same novelist (Terry McMillan) and co-scripters
(McMillan and Ron Bass), although director Forest Whitaker has been replaced by feature
freshman Kevin Rodney Sullivan, a vet of many years as a television actor (<i>Happy Days</i>)
and small screen hyphenate (<i>Knightwatch</i>, which no one remembers because it aired
opposite <i>The Cosby Show</i>), <i>How Stella Got Her Groove Back</i> has some awkward
pacing problems at the hands of a novice helmer, but the strong material and the fine
delivery, especially by Whoopi Goldberg, more than make up for the directorial
inconsistencies. In fact, when Goldberg is on-screen, her every utterance makes this
romantic drama and romantic Comedy drama. That&#146;s big C, little o. It&#146;s a joy to
watch her as she bounces one good bon mot after another off the rest of the cast.
It&#146;s a let-down when she&#146;s out of the picture.</big></p>

<p><img src="images/rstella-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="158">In a relationship
reminiscent of Bette Midler and Barbara Hershey in <i>Beaches</i><b> </b>(1988), Goldberg
plays Delilah, best friend to groove-less Stella Payne (Angela Bassett), their camaraderie
expanding from a trans-continental telephonic relationship to a rum-raising tete-a-tete
when the two ladies joint together for a fortnight of debauchery (for the aptly-named
Delilah) and love (for Stella) in Jamaica. Stella, a 40-year old high-powered workaholic,
takes a break from her brokerage firm chores, ships her 11-year-old son Quincy (Michael J.
Pagan) off to her ex-husband, and imagines herself the star of a lusty travelogue
infomercial (and the tropical paradise is shown to good advantage throughout the rest of
the film, too). Between the dreary rain pounding outside her drop-dead <i>Architectural
Digest</i> home in the San Francisco hills and the badgering of her younger sisters
Vanessa (Regina King, best known for her role as Cuba Gooding, Jr.&#146;s wife in <a href="rjmaguire.html" target="_top"><i>Jerry Maguire</i></a>), a loud, ballsy, ambulance-driving
paramedic who provides Stella with some much-needed support, and Angela (Suzzanne
Douglas), a pregnant vanity case that no sibling deserves, Stella casts off her
custom-tailored business suits and pops her fat-free body into eye-catching eyewear,
underwear, and swimwear by Calvin Klein.</p>

<p><img src="images/rstella-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="14" vspace="5" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="149">Handsome local hunk
Winston Shakespeare (Taye Diggs) catches Stella&#146;s eye (and other parts of her
anatomy) and she his as the sun frolics over the lush island scenery backdropping their
budding romance. Her inner thoughts contradict her spoken words in their first meeting,
but the hormones soon kick in behind some mosquito netting in Stella&#146;s boudoir. Their
affections grow too quickly as the sultry co-stars get acquainted and then some. The only
hang-up is that Winston is half Stella&#146;s age and the robbing-the-cradle situation
weighs heavier on her than a San Francisco fog rolling in over the Bay. She grapples with
this baby-snatching problem while both Winston and Delilah try to ease Stella&#146;s
pain--her self-doubts about her new relationship, her job, and her family. A tall order
indeed. After all, can she really fall for someone who eats cocoa puffs, watches <i>Booty
Call</i>, and is so young he hasn&#146;t had time to have his heart broken. Nearly an hour
into the film, shuttle diplomacy moves the action quickly back and forth between the
Caribbean setting, New York, and San Francisco (courtesy of American Airlines, obviously a
proud sponsor and agreeable contributor to production expenses). Love blossoms, matures,
and nearly wilts as the movie tries to come to grips with the cradle-to-college generation
difference (inspired by author McMillan&#146;s real-life love affair with a Jamaican man a
generation her junior), at points nearly stopping the film dead, particularly in one
unintentionally funny shower sequence. I kept thinking to myself that this titillating
scene needed an exorcist&#146;s touch.</p>

<p>The film has a too-neat ending that rings only half-true. Will Stella return to a
$275,000 job or put the fun back in her life building furniture (possible motto: &quot;If
you build it they will buy.&quot;), a precious but forgotten pastime she has forsaken for
a life scrambling for multi-million-dollar deals. Winston, who had put off plans for
medical school (heck, he&#146;s 20, what about the rest of college first!) gets a wildly
unbelievable line from his paramour as the end credits roll.</p>

<p><img src="images/rstella-3.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="143">But, aside from
these errors, the film&#146;s life-affirming aura will certainly translate into a
mid-August chick-flick and fine date entertainment for couples young and old (no matter
what the age contrast). The soundtrack by Michel Colombier is hip, with a steady
rhythm-and-blues and reggae undertow. It should be a popular seller at your local music
store. In another marvel of packaging and promotion &quot;executive soundtrack
producers&quot; (Grammy winners Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis) are among the more prominent
credits Hollywood creatives dreamt up for this production.</p>

<p>In lesser but entertaining roles are Richard Lawson (Jack) and Barry
&quot;Shabaka&quot; Henley (Buddy) as two un-hip and suave-be-damned losers among men that
adhere themselves to Delilah as Stella finds love at poolside. Guess Delilah left her
bug-repellant at home, but her oversight is to our advantage. Jack is a lean machine (his
necklace proclaims &quot;BODY SLAM&quot;) with a stuttering problem. Buddy is a overweight
party animal that nearly does a full monty to the hilarious delight of the audience. Two
small parts filled with plenty of gusto.</font></p>
