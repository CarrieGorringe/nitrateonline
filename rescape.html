<p><font size="5"><strong>T</strong></font><font size="4">he first indication of trouble
in <em>Escape From L.A.</em> comes very near the beginning, when the assistant to
Commander Malloy (Keach) refers to the just-reincarcerated Snake Plissken (Russell) as
&quot;so retro.&quot; She is closer to the truth of the matter than she realizes, because
everything in this <em>Escape</em> is retro to a rather uncomfortable degree; take away
the fancier special effects, cast changes and a change in locale, and the new film is an
exact replica of its predecessor, warts and all. Bad ol&#146; Plissken has to go back into
another closed city to clean up the mess of an incompetent political administration with
yet another risk to his life if he doesn&#146;t succeed.</font></p>

<p>This is not to say, however, that the original <em>Escape From New York</em> was an
inferior product, or that the act of near-duplication should have resulted in nothing more
than rank imitation. For all of its faults -- including a narrative structure that seemed
at times to progress at the speed of your average snail -- that film was never without a
certain vulgar charm and fascination, if for no other reason than because of the obvious
enthusiasm that lay underneath the surface, an enthusiasm inspired in part by having to
improvise within the constraints of a five-million-dollar budget -- small change even in
1981. Consequently, <em>Escape From New York</em> was also a fresh-looking film. A year
before <em>Blade Runner</em> brought the flashy, ground-breaking special effects and a
&quot;noir&quot; patina to the post-apocalyptic, dystopian sci-fi film genre, <em>Escape
From New York</em> established the basic ground rules, borrowing vigorously from
traditional epic narratives and westerns, notably in the figure of a lone hero, with
skills superior to the rest, who accomplishes his mission, then goes on as before. There
was a postmodern twist to the tale: the hero&#146;s effect is necessarily narrow, with no
changes to the social order, and no improvement in the hero&#146;s post-mission status.
Plissken was compelled to complete this mission to buy back his life, not to enhance it.
Other than regaining his life, the prospect of winning amounted at times to little more
than a zero-sum game, and Plissken&#146;s underdog status gave the film an overall
poignancy; he was a superior individual placed in the service of the mediocre and
malicious, with wildly unkempt tresses and a loathing of authority that emanated from
every gruff syllable he uttered (and there were few), Plissken was the embodiment of the
Romantic radical who had successfully completed his own psychological withdrawal from a
corrupt society, but who couldn&#146;t quite escape society&#146;s need to keep him under
control. Under the circumstances, identifying with Plissken, and Russell&#146;s powerful,
yet low-key, portrayal of the character, was easy on both the eyes and the mind.</p>

<p>But Carpenter was also able to make the film relevant by adding topical material. By
his own admission, Carpenter was strongly influenced by a cynicism brought about in the
wake of Watergate, so there was always a strong political undercurrent in the narrative of
the first <em>Escape</em>, yet a belief in how relevant politics is, albeit in a
simplistically pessimistic fashion, along the Trotskyesque lines of history concerning
itself with you regardless of your own concerns about history. A fear of a totalitarian
state, and its attendant evils, was always evident. </p>

<p>And the political undercurrent is sustained in <em>Escape From L.A.</em>, but in a
different form. The new model for the dystopian state that Carpenter fears most is made
more apparent, to the point of embarrassment. A United States Police Force has been
instituted; their insignia -- an Imperial eagle -- and their all-black uniforms evoke
memories of an omniscient, omnipotent, ruthless force controlled by a cruel paranoiac in
thrall to a morally-twisted ideology (no points for any conclusions drawn concerning the
little Austrian corporal with the funny mustache). From this, it isn&#146;t much of a
stretch to see that screenwriters Carpenter, Hill and Russell might be attempting to
formulate a cause-and-effect chain based on (a faulty) historical analogy, one which can
be extended to American political life: protection of freedom can not be half-hearted,
especially since there has been &quot;conclusive&quot; evidence (courtesy of the hangover
obsession with Richard Nixon) that anti-democratic forces can emerge anywhere at any time,
even in the epitome of democratic principles (never mind that the safeguards built in by
the Founding Fathers worked effectively in removing Nixon from office after the evidence
against him became overwhelming -- safeguards that never existed in the Weimar Republic). </p>

<p>To this end, the screenwriters have given us the &quot;logical&quot; end product of the
increasing political influence of the religious right, a president whose mindset is only
one step away from the pale-blue-leisure-suit, white-patent-loafer, and Brylcreem cliche
that the screenwriters unquestioningly embrace as the complete embodiment of the far-right
mentality. The obviously psychotic President (Robertson) demands that his only child be
assassinated by Plissken because she has been the lover of the radical (Corraface) who has
taken over LA. As a &quot;soiled&quot; product, she is now unworthy of being alive. While
not discounting the obvious threat to American liberties that the so-called religious
right poses with its intolerance of other viewpoints and its rigid ideology, it can only
be noted that this extreme stereotype is not unlike the stereotype that right-wingers had
about &quot;Commies&quot; in the 1950s, and it bears about as much relationship to reality
and historical fact as the latter ever did; its utility in fighting the &quot;evils&quot;
of intolerance is grimly self-evident. No doubt Hollywood is finding the attacks by Bob
Dole and others on the presumed lack of morality in American films hitting a little close
to home on certain issues, but hysteria is hardly an effective response. With their
clouded vision, Carpenter et al. even manage to confuse their analogies even further by
depicting the LA under assault from without as a first-rate den of iniquity, created by
those self-same forces, one which the inmates prove to be all-too-adept at adapting to
terrorizing effect. If this is an attempt to depict LA (and, by extension, Hollywood) as
being under some sort of moral siege, then they are treading on very thin semantic ice, a
patch of which threatens to break apart right underneath them. Welcome to an
inadvertently-engineered zero-sum game; it renders the political subtexts invalid and
consequently, this film is more cartoonish than the original. </p>

<p>Despite the increase in budget, more can quite certainly be seen as less in the case of
<em>Escape from L.A.</em> Leather suits and special effects do not an improved film make.
Some of the effects-heavy sequences, such as one in which Russell has to surf his way
ahead of the bad guys, are simply so poorly executed that they are laughable. Not so the
performances given by most of the cast. It&#146;s wonderful to know that Russell&#146;s
Snake Plissken hasn&#146;t changed at all; the character is still so strong and (mostly)
silent that he threatens to make characters in a Sergio Leone film look positively verbose
by comparison. Other notables include Buscemi, as Plissken&#146;s fair-weather assistant;
he seems to be doing a first-rate job at creating fifth-rate slimeballs (he was last seen
in <em>Fargo</em> as one of the incompetent kidnappers) and makes Eddie one of the bright
points of this film, as is Fonda&#146;s wry semi-reprisal of his <em>Easy Rider</em> role
as a long-gone hippie. But the real standout is Grier, doing a brilliant turn as an old
accomplice of Plissken&#146;s. Not so well-served is Keach, whose wooden performance in
the role originated by the late Lee Van Cleef only makes the absence of the latter more
obvious. Robertson&#146;s hateful hysterics are simply ridiculous. These shortcomings
notwithstanding, it&#146;s a tribute to Carpenter&#146;s gifts as a director, as well as
to actors like Fonda and Grier, that their performances in this film are good enough to
erase all memories of their rather intermittent careers. If only <em>Escape From L.A.</em>
were as consistent in quality after its own long absence, the final product would not be
as much of a disappointment. </p>
