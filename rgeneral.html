<p><big><strong><big>T</big></strong>here&#146;s a lovely moment in this refreshingly
self-assured and altogether magnificent new film from John Boorman in which the famously
eccentric Irish criminal Martin Cahill (Brendan Gleeson) burgles a well-appointed home as
the master sneaks away from his bedroom for a liaison down the hall and the lady of the
house slumbers on with the criminal hovering inches from her face. Scored to the jauntily
seductive Van Morrison/Richie Buckley composition &quot;It Used to Be My Life,&quot; the
audacious sequence -- made all the more dreamlike by the velvety anamorphic black and
white cinematography of Seamus Deasy (the secret lies in it&#146;s printing on color
stock) -- is Boorman at his mystical, elegant best, taking the stuff of real-life legend
and refracting it through his unique visual and storytelling sensibilities. </big></p>

<p>An eccentric and popular career recidivist in Dublin over the last 15 years or so,
Cahill began as a cheeky youth (played by Neil Jordan&#146;s <i>Butcher Boy</i>, Eamonn
Owens, in dreamy, kinetic flashbacks that hark back to Boorman&#146;s debut feature, the
1965 Dave Clarke Five romp <i>Having a Wild Weekend</i> [aka <i>Catch Us If You Can</i>]).
As an adult, he cunningly plays up to the more marketable aspects of his individualistic
nature, assembling a scrappy yet quirky gang and appearing in public swathed in a hooded
parka and peeking through fingers spread over his homely yet genial face (Gleeson
apparently looks much like Cahill in his prime). He also quickly develops a reputation for
brazenness, reinforced by imaginatively planned heists of a seemingly impregnable jewel
warehouse and an art collection that includes the only privately owned Vermeer (sequences
that boldly mix agonizing tension and precocious wit). Stalked by his own private Javert
in the form of the increasingly frustrated and weary Inspector Ned Kenny (Jon Voight, who
starred for Boorman in <i>Deliverance</i>) and hounded by seemingly the entire Dublin
constabulary, Cahill tries to lead as normal a life as is possible -- normal, that is, for
a celebrated criminal who, with the blessing of his wife Frances (Maria Doyle Kennedy),
starts another family with her sister Tina (Angeline Ball, in an entirely different set of
<i>Commitments</i>).</p>

<p>Soon enough, Cahill&#146;s fiercely independent nature runs him afoul of both the Irish
Republican Army and the Ulster Volunteer Force and this inability and/or unwillingness to
conform with the ongoing operations of fellow criminals -- not his friction with the
police -- is the eventual cause of his downfall and 1994 murder (the slaying bookends the
film).</p>

<p>If Gleeson looks at all familiar -- he&#146;s a chameleon, that one -- he&#146;s had
prominent roles in Mel Gibson&#146;s laborious yet mysteriously popular <i>Braveheart</i>
(the trusty sidekick Hamish<i>), I Went Down</i> (the sideburned Bunny) and the thus-far
distributorless<i> Sweety Barrett</i>. He&#146;s also appeared in, among other films, Jim
Sheridan&#146;s <i>The Field</i>, Stephen Frears&#146; <i>The Snapper</i> and Neil
Jordan&#146;s <i>Michael Collins</i>. &quot;The key phrase in discussions with John before
we started this,&quot; he explains in the presskit, &quot;was that we would humanize
Cahill without romanticizing him.&quot; They&#146;ve achieved that goal spectacularly, as
Gleeson&#146;s Martin is an impossible yet somehow entirely plausible study in contrasts,
a distastefully shambling man who wanders around in a threadbare collection of t-shirts
featuring pigs (&quot;I Don&#146;t Do Mornings,&quot; proclaims the most dignified one)
and suffers from diabetes, yet is clearly adoring of and adored by both of his families --
when he&#146;s not administering outlaw justice to an underling by nailing the poor
man&#146;s hand to a pool table (realizing that he wasn&#146;t lying, Cahill accompanies
him to the emergency room).</p>

<p>The supporting cast is uniformly good in service to Boorman&#146;s vision, with Voight
fine as the befuddled yet oddly compassionate Kenny (it sure is good to see the actor back
in such mainstream projects as <i>Heat</i>, <i>Mission: Impossible</i>, <i>John
Grisham&#146;s The Rainmaker</i>, <i>U-Turn</i>, <i>Enemy of the State</i> and the
upcoming <i>Varsity Blues</i>) and pungent local color in the persons of Adrian Dunbar
(Hear My Song) and the fearless Sean McGinley <i>(The Butcher Boy</i>, <i>Michael Collins</i>,
<i>The Field</i> -- most Irish actors have appeared numerous times with each other) as
pivotal members of Cahill&#146;s gang.</p>

<p>A triumph of mischievous intellectualism in the face of looming deadlines, legal
hurdles and uncertain financing, <i>The General </i>was put together literally on the run
after Boorman tabled his extensive pre-production work on a complicated adaptation of
&quot;The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe&quot; and left <i>A Simple Plan</i> only weeks
before the commencement of principal photography, apparently in exasperation over a
funding snafu (as with many of history&#146;s great filmmakers, he seems to carry huge
passions for numerous projects like the rest of us juggle luggage -- most of which,
including his legendary, ironically titled <i>Broken Dream</i>, have remained unrealized).
Set against the travails of its making, the crafty energy of <i>The General</i> is even
more remarkable, as characters and situations avoided for fear of legal repercussions
result in a propulsive, fictionalized narrative thrust that is obviously surreal yet
emotionally spot-on (a word on this: born in England, Boorman has lived for a quarter
century in Ireland&#146;s County Wicklow, and his fascination for the phenomenon
represented by Cahill and his story seems to spring from an intertwined admiration for the
robber&#146;s perhaps unconsciously iconoclastic creed and an ongoing fascination with the
society that spawned him; inevitably, there&#146;s been some minor controversy in Ireland
from those who see the movie perhaps too literally as a film about one man instead of a
movie about the quirky magic of human impulse).</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important -- and certainly the most undervalued -- mind in moviemaking
today, Boorman&#146;s career is a rollercoaster of box office successes (<i>Point Blank</i>,
<i>Deliverance</i>, <i>Hope and Glory</i>) and failures (the legendary <i>Leo the Last</i>
-- to this day unavailable on videotape -- its unofficial sequel, <i>Where the Heart Is</i>,
and the exasperatingly misunderstood <i>Beyond Rangoon</i>). Financial performance aside,
these films are unified by a vision in which genre is subverted by the metaphysical. In
every case the impact on the receptive viewer can be life-altering (or at the very least
life-affirming), and it isn&#146;t necessary to subscribe to this worldview to be moved
and even changed by it.</p>

<p>Unique to the world of working filmmakers in both volume and precision, Boorman has
written eloquently and in great detail on the overwhelming minutiae of picture making, the
endless meetings and transcontinental flights in pursuit of funding for his passionate and
uncompromising films (his diary on the making of <i>The General</i>, included in the
presskit, deserves to be published, his journal on the production of <i>The Emerald Forest</i>
was published under the painfully aware title &quot;Money Into Light,&quot; and he
co-edits a yearly forum for filmmakers called &quot;Projections&quot; -- which is
essential reading). </p>

<p>He&#146;s also brooded in print about losing the mainstream profile the sporadic
success of his films has accorded him. Seen in this light, it isn&#146;t too much of a
stretch to see Martin Cahill as a surrogate Boorman, a cheerful iconoclast who is
unrepentent precisely because he believes so strongly in the essential correctness of his
actions (maybe it&#146;s best not to take this analogy too far). In fact, that previously
mentioned home invasion sequence was inspired by the thief&#146;s actual burglary of the
director&#146;s home -- which netted, presumably among other things, a gold record for
&quot;Dueling Banjoes,&quot; the theme from <i>Deliverance</i>. It is this very emotional
alchemy, conjured in a hurry after intense periods of study and meditation, which charge
all of Boorman&#146;s films with a disciplined yet unpredictable emotional power. If <i>The
General</i> reflects the great man in graceful repose (he&#146;s 68 and fretted in
&quot;Projections&quot; seven years ago that he didn&#146;t know how much more time
he&#146;d have to make the many movies that preoccupy his vibrant mind), the film also
gives notice to the Hollywood establishment that John Boorman is still in admirable
command of his provocative, inspirational and altogether astonishing storytelling powers.</p>
