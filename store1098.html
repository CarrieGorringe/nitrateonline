<p><big>The history of the horror film is also the history of movies, as examples of the
genre date at least as far back as Georges Méliès' 1896 2-minute short <i>The Haunted
Castle</i> and many of today's best moviemakers have at least dabbled in the form.
Ignoring such ephemeral titles as <i>I Know What You Did Last Summer</i>, the recent <i>Urban
Legend</i> and lazily-scripted movies of that ilk, there's a huge body of work to draw
from to construct your own home horror film festival for that special someone or a roomful
of adventurous, like-minded friends. </big></p>

<p>From silent cinema to slick modern shockers, psychological horror to semi-splatter
(most of the latter is junk anyway), here are some current favorites -- presented in
alphabetical order for ease of use and to blunt charges of favoritism and the inevitable
squabbles over exclusions.</p>

<p><big><strong><big><a name="Bram_Stoker's_Dracula" target="_top">Bram Stoker's Dracula</a></i> (1992)</big></strong></big></p>

<p>Of the many versions of this classic tale available for your holiday viewing pleasure,
perhaps the most overlooked -- and certainly the most tragically dismissed, at least by
critics (the movie was a box office hit anyway) -- is Francis Ford Coppola's sumptuous
telling of the tale, which looks positively astonishing on DVD (OK, and laserdisc, too)
but is no slouch on tape, either. Adhering much more faithfully to Stoker's book than
other versions (F.W. Murnau's 1922 silent <i>Nosferatu</i>, Bela Lugosi's immortal turn in
the 1931 Universal touchstone <i>Dracula</i> and Christopher Lee -- working with Peter
Cushing as the intrepid Dr. Van Helsing -- in the 1958 Hammer classic <i>Horror of Dracula</i>),
Coppola employs many silent film tricks and a subtle but effective battery of contemporary
special effects to spin his yarn. The huge cast is uniformly absorbing, with standouts
Anthony Hopkins (only a few films removed from the Oscar glare surrounding <i>The Silence
of the Lambs</i>) a hammy Van Helsing and Tom Waits as a grungy, funny Renfield.</p>

<p><big><strong><big><a name="The_Bride_of_Frankenstein" target="_top"><i>The Bride of Frankenstein</i></a>
(1935)</big></strong></big></p>

<p>The relatively brief, thematically singular career of director James Whale is in the
spotlight courtesy of Sir Ian McKellen's Oscar-worthy turn as the filmmaker in Bill
Condon's <i>Gods and Monsters</i> (coming soon to a discerning screen, hopefully near
you), and of the handful of genre films helmed by the gay director (including the original
<i>Frankenstein</i>, <i>The Old Dark House</i> and Whale's own apparent favorite, <i>The
Invisible Man</i>), <i>The Bride of Frankenstein</i> is the most revered -- both for the
pleasingly grotesque Jack Pierce make-up sported by Elsa Lanchester's frizzy-haired,
pop-eyed bride and the weird, off-kilter humor Whale brought to the long-dodged project to
keep boredom and bay and his English cronies in front of the camera amused. Boris
Karloff's fire-scarred creation has escaped the inferno that ended the original (and which
Universal had cut from re-release prints, to the puzzlement of those new to the story) and
been taken in by a blind hermit (memorably spoofed by Mel Brooks in the soon-to-be DVD'd <i>Young
Frankenstein</i>). With the not-so-gentle persuasion of the quite mad Dr. Praetorious
(Ernest Thesiger), the beleaguered doctor (Colin Clive) endeavors to create a mate for the
lonely monster. As Praetorious and the monster smoke cigars together in a spooky crypt
after the latter mistakes a dead girl for his new &quot;friend,&quot; the true genius of
this memorable work becomes apparent. </p>

(1927)</big></strong></big></p>

<p>If you haven't seen a silent film in awhile (or, shame on you, ever), you'll be
delighted by the mischievously knowing nature and contemporary feel of the half spooky,
half goofy proceedings in this progenitor of every &quot;Old, Dark [fill in the
blank]&quot; that's come along since. In the murky mansion of a rich old geezer, his will
is read at the stroke of midnight, 20 years to the day after his death; which of the
half-dozen larcenous relatives will survive 'til the dawn? Director Paul Leni had made a
name for himself as an avant-garde painter, stage set designer and art director in the
expressionistic film movement of the teens (directing two pivotal films of the period, <i>Backstairs</i>
and <i>Waxworks</i> -- both in print on tape) before being tapped by Carl Laemmle at
Universal to adapt the hoary stage play, becoming in the process the progenitor of the
studio's famous horror cycle of the 1930s (see <i>Bride of Frankenstein</i>, above). After
three subsequent eye-catching and atmospheric features, Leni died suddenly of blood
poisoning -- depriving the film world of what would surely have been a brilliant career. <i>The
Cat and the Canary</i> is followed on the tape by the very funny 21-minute Harold Lloyd
short <i>Haunted Spooks</i>.</p>

<p><big><strong><big><a name="Don't_Look_Now" target="_top">Don't Look Now</a></i> (1973)</big></strong></big></p>

<p>Few who've seen this disorientingly cold yet profoundly disturbing thriller in which a
grief-stricken married couple (Donald Sutherland and Julie Christie) wrestle over the
occult's ability to put them in touch with their dead child while on a working holiday in
Venice will ever forget the aggregate impact of its brooding story (from Daphne du
Maurier), the astonishingly complex visuals, intricate editing scheme and chilling score
(by Pino Donaggio, who went on to a two-decade-and-counting collaborative relationship
with Brian De Palma -- speaking of whom, and which, where's De Palma's nasty <i>Sisters</i>,
made the same year but unavailable in any home format to date?). Although the climactic
horror element of the tale has been roundly criticized as extraneous and jarring to the
mood, it remains a true shocker -- don't you dare fast-forward -- and is nicely balanced
by the legendary sequence in which the couple's lovemaking is intertwined with their
subsequent dressing for dinner. A pity this isn't available letterboxed, as the vastly
underrated Roeg (his genre titles include <i>The Man Who Fell to Earth</i> and <i>Witches</i>)
is a master of dynamic composition and provocative editing (he came up through the ranks,
photographing Roger Corman's <i>The Masque of the Red Death</i> and François Truffaut's <i>Fahrenheit
451</i>, among others). Still, this is a must-see.</p>

<p><big><strong><big><a name="The_Haunting" target="_top">The Haunting</a></i> (1963)</big></strong></big></p>

<p>Tweedy parapsychologist Dr. Markway (Richard Johnson) has the at-first bright idea of
gathering a small group of average people who've experienced psychic phenomena in a
hulking, literally off-kilter New England mansion that's seen its share of madness and
death -- it even has a subzero &quot;heart&quot; just outside the nursery where the last
surviving family member died while her nurse was necking outside. Yet the visitors,
including Julie Harris, Russ (<i>West Side Story</i>, &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;) Tamblyn,
Claire Bloom (hypnotic as Theo, one of the screen's first compassionate lesbians) and
surprise guest Mrs. Markway (Lois Maxwell, Miss Moneypenny in the best Bond movies) prove
to be lightning rods for things that go bump in the night. Filmed in England by Robert
Wise -- who began as an editor (<i>Citizen Kane</i>) and segued into a successful career
directing all kinds of films (the great <i>The Body Snatcher</i> and so-so <i>Audrey Rose</i>
are two of his genre entries), <i>The Haunting</i> benefits from a solid script by Nelson
Gidding and an extraordinary sound mix guaranteed to give lone viewers maximum willies.
And yes, this is the original movie version of the Shirley Jackson novel (&quot;The
Haunting of Hill House&quot;) that's about to be remade by DreamWorks SKG and director Jan
(<i>Twister</i>) DeBont -- so see it now, before the new version pummels you with the
inevitable, thunderous sound mix and CGI that'll probably be more literal than special.
Available to theaters for years in only a sub-par pan-and-scan version (seemingly the only
version available on tape),<i> The Haunting</i> may currently be had in a laserdisc
edition that preserves the noteworthy widescreen photography. </p>

Snatchers</a></i> (1956 &amp; 1978)</big></strong></big></p>

<p>Director Don Siegel's original is a clever twist on America's McCarthy era while Philip
Kaufman's version (featuring Siegel and his star Kevin McCarthy in pungent cameos) has
something to say about the nascent days of New Age doubletalk (with the action shifted to
-- where else? -- San Francisco); either one provides chills galore and a back-to-back
double feature is strongly recommended. In each, a mild-mannered average joe discovers an
out-of-this-world plot to replace humans with pod-grown replicants (thanks, Philip K.
Dick). Sutherland is particularly good in the later version, which also features an early,
distinctive performance by Jeff Goldblum as a spa-owning skeptic. Both movies benefit from
widescreen transfers on their recent DVD releases, with the 1956 version featuring an
interview with McCarthy (and a print struck from the original negative), while the 1978
version sports a feature-length audio commentary from Philip Kaufman, trivia, and
production notes (the film's editing was an opportunity to put the soundboard in Francis
Ford Coppola's then-new Zoetrope production facility through its paces as the director
continued to shoot <i>Apocalypse Now</i>). Along with the two versions of <i>The Thing</i>,
these movies are rare examples of remakes that respect but expand upon the originals. </p>

<p>While Carpenter's groundbreaking, much-imitated <i>Halloween</i> would've been a
natural choice here (and is in fact essential viewing, particularly since the recent,
splendid widescreen reissue on tape and DVD), this remake of the 1951 Christian Nyby film
(produced -- and many say, actually directed -- by Howard Hawks) has gained tremendously
in stature since its generally dismissed release and thus gets the nod here. As a
shape-shifting entity terrorizes a remote Antarctic research station, reluctant hero
MacReady (Kurt Russell) leads the charge to destroy the entity before the camp is
completely wiped out. Carpenter's first film for a major studio is a more faithful reading
of John W. Campbell Jr's short story &quot;Who Goes There?&quot;, and Dean Cundey's
extraordinary photography creates a palpable chill in the room. Along with Universal's
recent <i>Psycho</i> DVD, this release on the format features an exhilarating abundance of
extras, including the obligatory commentary track by Carpenter and Russell, an 82-minute
documentary on the grueling location shoot and mind-bending special effects (by Rob
Bottin), production notes and a great deal more. This edition was put together at
Sharpline Arts, the folks behind the benchmark laserdisc special editions <i>The Abyss</i>,
<i>Alien</i> and <i>Aliens</i>. Whatever format you choose, <i>John Carpenter's The Thing</i>
is a genuine surprise, an unexpectedly satisfying example of a movie that was ahead of its
time but now looks muscular and is truly frightening. </p>

<p>Worth re-viewing for the recent letterboxed VHS re-release alone (which restores the
movie to as close to its original aspect ratio as the medium allows), Alfred Hitchcock's
workmanlike, low-budget classic revolutionized the horror film and changed forever the way
an entire generation of moviegoers cleaned themselves. When Marion Crane (Janet Leigh)
breaks out of her routine and impulsively steals $40,000 from her Phoenix office, her
flight is interrupted by motel-keeper Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) and his
&quot;mother.&quot; When Marion's disappearance is investigated by her sister Lila (Vera
Miles) and Detective Arbogast (Martin Balsam), the grisly truth is discovered. Another
movie recently remade by Hollywood (<i>Good Will Hunting</i> director Gus Van Sant's
reportedly shot-for-shot remake with Anne Heche and Vince Vaughn is due in December), <i>Psycho</i>
is also available on a Universal DVD that defines the new format: the 94-minute
&quot;making of&quot; documentary features Leigh, Clive Barker, screenwriter Joseph
(&quot;The Outer Limits&quot;) Stefano, assistant director Hilton A. Green, Pat Hitchcock
(the director's daughter, who played Leigh's office-mate) and others, along with the
original 6-minute trailer in which Hitchcock leads a guided tour of the Bates Motel,
production drawings and photographs, photographs of poster and lobby card art from around
the world, newsreel footage instructing theater owners on the finer points of selling the
picture, and even the famous shower scene -- with and without Bernard Herrmann's
magnificent, shrieking score.</p>

<p>One of the better gore-fests and a movie that appeared as a breath of fresh air when
that particular strain of horror movie was at its nadir (only Sam Raimi's <i>Evil Dead</i>
series can match it for macabre wit), <i>Re-Animator</i> is as funny as it is bloody,
courtesy of some off-the-wall direction by Stuart Gordon, who worked extensively with
Chicago's Organic Theater, eye-catching production design from <i>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i>
art director Robert A Burns, a <i>Psycho</i>-inspired score by Richard Band and a witty,
knowing script -- based very loosely on some H.P. Lovecraft writings -- that knows when to
whack and when to wink. The incomparable Jeffrey Combs is Dr. Herbert West, a young,
obsessed medical student who develops a neon-green goo that, when injected directly into
the brain, brings dead bodies back to life. Inevitably, this leads to trouble, as West
cruises the morgue for fresh victims and must fight off an instructor bent on stealing his
work. Again, the recent Elite Entertainment DVD takes the prize here, with a widescreen
transfer from the original negative supplemented by 20 minutes of additional footage,
audio commentaries from Gordon and selected cast members and a dream sequence left out of
the original release altogether. Among its many pleasures, <i>Re-Animator</i> also has one
of the all-time great tag lines: &quot;Dr. Herbert West has a very good head on his
shoulders, and another one in a dish on his desk.&quot; </p>

<p>Five young people in van meet a bizarre family of butchers in rural Texas in this very
influential low-budget horror classic, directed by Tobe Hooper while still a film student
and based on the same contemporary cannibal that inspired <i>Psycho</i> (one Ed Gein).
Much has been made about the difference between the suspense of Hitchcock and the terror
of this film (and the multitude of subsequent variations and rip-offs), but one key
element unites them: as in <i>Psycho</i>, where the &quot;blood&quot; in the shower
sequence was chocolate syrup and viewers never actually see the knife piercing skin,
there's actually very little gore in <i>Massacre</i> and more suggested violence than
actual explicit mayhem. The rights situation regarding this movie was extremely
complicated, which means that there are a lot of different editions of the film
circulating in tapes of various quality. The recently issued DVD version features a
high-definition transfer and stereo surround sound remix supervised by Hooper, audio
commentary by the director, DP Daniel Hooper and Gunnar Hansen (who played the demented,
club-wielding Leatherface), and a half hour of deleted scenes, outtakes, trailers, TV
spots, still photos and even a blooper reel (much of which is on the older laserdisc as
well). Whatever version you find, <i>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i> is an unfathomably
influential movie that will explain a great deal about trends in the contemporary horror
film. </p>

<p><strong><big><big><a name="Les_Vampires" target="_top">Les Vampires</a></i> (1915)</big></big></strong></p>

<p>Another recently restored silent movie of note, Louis Feuillade's ten-part, nearly
seven-hour <i>Les Vampires</i> -- in which the surrealist-inspired gang of the title, lead
by Irma Vep (Musidora), terrorize the Parisian establishment as they are pursued by
intrepid reporter Philippe Guerande (Edouard Mathé) -- isn't strictly a horror film, even
though it sports severed heads, poisoning, at least one zombie, hypnotism, a nightclub
called &quot;The Happy Shack,&quot; and a tangible eroticism explored further in Olivier
Assayas' 1997 festival hit <i>Irma Vep</i> (starring Hong Kong actress Maggie Cheung). <i>Les
Vampires</i> was restored by David Shepard (who also supervised <i>The Cat and the Canary</i>),
and features clever tinting, authentic, idiomatic intertitles, proper running speed and a
score by Robert Israel that incorporates silent film compositions to enhance the
authenticity of the action. The hypnotic, exciting <i>Les Vampires</i> was made the same
year D.W. Griffith shot <i>The Birth of a Nation</i>, and is a stunning reminder that
we've only scratched the surface of the profound riches of the silent cinema.</p>
