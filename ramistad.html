<p><big><strong><big>I</big></strong>f those who supported the &quot;peculiar
institution&quot; known as slavery thought that the brutal suppression of the 1831 Nat
Turner Revolt in Virginia was the end of slaveholders&#146; difficulties with their
current and prospective &quot;property,&quot; there were more surprises in store. Eight
years after Nat Turner dared to dream of freedom, fifty-three would-be slaves aboard the
Spanish slave ship <i>La Amistad</i> (a Spanish word that, in the most savage of ironies,
means &quot;friendship&quot;), led by one of their own, a man named Cinqu<font FACE="Times New Roman Special G1">¾</font> (Hounsou), rebelled against their chains and

the surviving rebels are eventually defended in the United States Supreme Court by former
president John Quincy Adams (Hopkins). However, the defendants are caught in the middle of
the usual mess known as an American presidential election. Incumbent Martin Van Buren
(Hawthorne), unfairly blamed for the financial panic of 1837, is desperate for an issue
that will allow him to hold on to power. After the <i>Amistad</i> defendants have won two
court battles, led by an inexperienced lawyer named John Baldwin (McConaughey), Van Buren
simply appeals the verdict as a gesture to pro-slavery forces, most obviously those who
hold electoral votes in the South (especially after Van Buren has been subjected to

representative, Secretary of State Forsyth (Paymer) to Connecticut to oversee the trial.
Queen Isabella of Spain (Paquin) is also claiming property rights over the slaves, as are
the owners of the <i>Amistad</i>, and the American sailors who rescued the survivors.
Their lives soon become one endless round of imprisonment and temporary reprieve from yet
another round of &quot;interested parties.&quot; </big></p>

<p>The problems with <i>Amistad</i> are many, but none exist at the pictorial level. As
with his depiction the liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto in <i>Schindler&#146;s List</i>,
Spielberg proves once again, with the assistance of <i>Schindler&#146;s List</i>
cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, that he is a master at invoking empathy through the
composition of visuals loaded with unequivocal messages. If you ever wanted to know
exactly what it was like to be one of hundreds of slaves chained together in the fetid
hold of a ship making the &quot;middle passage&#146;, this is as good a place as any to
start. Spielberg&#146;s depiction is justly disgusting and heart-rending, throttling to
death any tender sensibilities you once possessed. If you have a conscience, you will
wonder just what in God&#146;s name these stupid white people were doing defending the
indefensible. Even the most merciful plantation owners, it might be thought, had to have
realized, at some level, how morally repugnant it was to hold human beings as property
&#150; Biblically justifiable, perhaps, but still morally repugnant. But, of course,
slaves weren&#146;t thought of as being completely human at the time of the <i>Amistad</i>
insurrection; until the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment in 1868, the American
Constitution declared each of them to be the equivalent of only three-fifths of a white
person, and that for taxation purposes alone. This is the reason why unrepentant,
plutocratic, pro-slavers like Calhoun could (as depicted in the film) raise as much hell
as was necessary to maintain their profitable and morally atavistic way of life with
impunity: how could any government &quot;logically&quot; defend the rights of three-fifths
of a human being against the rights of one who was presumably a &quot;whole&quot; entity?
This is the context in which the <i>Amistad</i> rebellion manifests itself as one of the
earliest semi-proxy fights over which side was to prevail in American society &#150;
freesoil or slave-holding &#150; and Spielberg does capture some of the essence of what it
must have been like to be a contemporary observer &#150; or unwilling participant.</p>

<p>But Spielberg has an unfortunate problem to contend with in the telling of this story
of those brave rebels, and that is the position of slavery within modern history. Although
still practiced in certain countries, slavery is no longer a bogeyman of sufficient menace
to terrify the contemporary Western imagination; whether rightly or wrongly, the subject
feels as if it is at a safe remove from current trends, a relic of the past and of
&quot;primitive&quot; thinkers, thus easy to disregard. Contrast this attitude with one
concerning outbreaks of genocide and racial hatred, the arbitrary cruelty of which
possesses sufficient emotional sting to make us all feel uneasy. This is the reason why
Spielberg was able to construct <i>Schindler&#146;s List</i> along the lines of a
straightforward narrative, and could even dare to risk a quasi-happy coda with impunity;
he could always count upon audience paranoia to fill in the blanks. White directors
aren&#146;t the only ones to fall prey to this tendency. John Singleton, before he
manipulated the ending of <i>Rosewood</i>, also had the audience in his grasp for
precisely the same reason: it was indeed possible to believe that the destruction of a
town controlled by one race by people of another could be, under the wrong set of
circumstances, a very viable outcome, if reminiscences about the Bosnian War were any
indication. Without this sinister jolt to modern sensibilities that such context provides,
Spielberg has to give the audience for <i>Amistad</i> more information, most notably by
underscoring the ambiguities of the rebels&#146; victory. They may have won their freedom,
but their victory was tragically hollow: it couldn&#146;t stop the rise of the Ku Klux
Klan, Jim Crow, and the doctrine of separate but unequal that polluted the dreams and
thwarted the ambitions of so many talented black people in the South and much of the
Northern United States until the first ray of hope and common decency shone through in
1954. Needless to say, Spielberg doesn&#146;t permit the annoyances of external reality to
touch the hermetically-sealed &quot;perfection&quot; of <i>Amistad</i>, preferring to
substitute pathos for truth. In one potentially fascinating sequence, as the Connecticut
prosecutor (played with wonderfully unctuous disdain by Postlethwaite) and a British
officer are enumerating, through their arguments, the facts to support the claim that an
illegal slave trading operation is taking place in Sierra Leone, Cinqu<font FACE="Times New Roman Special G1">¾</font> is permitted to disrupt the proceedings,
possibly on some mistaken belief by Spielberg et al. that histrionics are the only means
of moving the audience to accept Cinqu<font FACE="Times New Roman Special G1">¾</font>
&#146;s plight. The narrative tension is dissipated in favor of sloppy sentimentality.
What was meant to be a powerful moment becomes mere silliness, milked by Spielberg <i>ad
nauseam</i>. It is apparent that the director has learned nothing from his experience with
the history of the Holocaust; empirical evidence may seem unpleasant, but to disregard it
or downplay it in favor of emotional testimony leaves history open to the madness of
revisionist hoaxers. To say that Spielberg should have known better is an understatement
for all time. </p>

<p>More importantly, as even the film is forced to acknowledge, however fleetingly, the
legal decision that set the <i>Amistad</i> rebels free had nothing relevant to contribute
to the issue of slaves who were already captives in the United States. There was no
indication from the Supreme Court that the moral underpinnings of slavery were ever under
discussion; the decision was simply a coldly logical interpretation of international law,
and this could not have been accidental, since the country was not yet willing to face the
consequences, either of challenging the South&#146;s right to hold slaves or of the
specter of mass manumission. Spielberg&#146;s unease with such a bleak and irremediable
view of black history in America is apparent, so we get the quasi-happy ending as a method
of sweeping the historical contradictions under the cinematic rug; he even injects one
more cruel irony just before the closing credits as a sleight-of-hand gesture to distract
the audience from the ineluctable fact that <i>Amistad</i> , ironically enough, has itself
become nothing more than a pseudo-revisionist sop to those who are desperately searching
for any sense of decency in a grim past. Selling this film as a bright note of salvation
for American slaves in the midst of historical hell is a shameless misinterpretation of
the facts. The reason for this distortion effect is clear: <i>Amistad</i> suffers from
considerable semantic and narrative seepage from <i>Schindler&#146;s List</i>: Franzoni (<i>Citizen
Cohn</i>) may have been given the screenplay credit, but the <i>Amistad </i>script also
had several passes through the hands of <i>Schindler&#146;s</i> Oscar-winning
screenwriter, Steven Zaillian (in fact, there is some indication that Spielberg did not
agree to direct <i>Amistad</i> until he had seen Zaillian&#146;s version of the script).
Under the circumstances, one gets the impression that Spielberg and Zaillian are trying to
cram unfamiliar material into well-worn grooves that cannot support it, simply because
they cannot conceive of the project through any other mindset. None of the above
objections, of course, would exist if <i>Amistad</i> was not being sold to the public as a
text replete with meticulous research and (it is implied) an immaculate execution of said
research . Within said boundaries, the film is meant to act as an unmasking of a
previously unknown aspect of African-American history; by extension, the filmmakers are
bathing themselves in the warm glow of self-congratulation for having exposed some sort of
&quot;hidden truth&quot; about slaveholding in nineteenth-century America. Unfortunately,
the exposition that has taken place has served only to expose the inherent dishonesty of
the filmmakers themselves.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances, there can be no surprise that many of the principal
performances, although elegantly crafted, often seem as if they are being performed in
some sort of disconnected atmosphere, drifting in and out of focus. One has to watch
Hopkins&#146; performance as Adams, if only to see which other presidential personalities
he has grafted onto his interpretation every other scene (the performance might be best
defined by the phrase, &quot;From Washington to Adams and Back Again&quot;). McConaughey
muddles through his work as Baldwin with as much dignity as he can muster, but his
gestures and syntax, being modern, resound with too many anachronistic elements to sustain
a prolonged suspension of disbelief. Only Freeman (as the abolitionist-cum-factotum
Theodore Joadson) and the incredibly-talented newcomer Hounsou survive the muddle,
primarily because they are not being asked to carry Spielberg&#146;s contradictory package
on their shoulders, being the defendants and not the defenders. But even Hounsou and
Freeman can&#146;t escape the film&#146;s artificial undercurrent; whether suffering in
silence, as Freeman is often obliged to do, or in punctuating a dignified silence with
periodic outbursts of outrage, as Hounsou does, both men are subjected to a form of
mythification and thereby occupy a nether world; they are at once branded as social
outcasts and anointed with the holiness that comes from being designated as &quot;noble
savages.&quot; Thus, the two actors labor under a different set of contradictions, but
ones that are no more conducive to understanding the past than their white counterparts.
In this unfortunate regard may rest the only place in which <i>Amistad</i> does justice to
blacks.</p>

<p>It&#146;s giving no secrets away to reveal the eventual victory of the <i>Amistad</i>
Forty-Four, but anyone who is looking to this story as a harbinger of future achievements
by American slaves and freedmen had best not linger too long in the world of rose-colored
glasses wrought by Spielberg&#146;s film. The freedom promised in 1865 would be granted
only one hundred years later, in yet another irony, by the Supreme Court. Far be it for
anyone to deny the right of any black American to enjoy what little morsel of justice that
history chooses to throw his or her way, but clinging to scraps bears within it the danger
of making truth the first casualty of ideological imperatives. The accusations of alleged
plagiarism that have been leveled against the film&#146;s script are the least of its
problems; in fact, a little plagiarism might have resulted in a better film.</p>
