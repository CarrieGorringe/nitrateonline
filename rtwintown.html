<p><font size="5"><strong>T</strong></font><font size="4">here is an apprehension among
specialty distributors in the United States regarding the ability of foreign films in
English to attract American audiences. Their dilemma is twofold: first, that the subject
matter will be of no interest (especially outside of the crucial urban markets); and
second, that however understandable the English is, the combination of regional slang and
speed of delivery will render the film virtually unintelligible (the number of
English-language films subtitled in English being infinitesimally small). This is one of
many reasons why it was so heartening to see Mike Leigh's <i>Secrets and Lies</i> playing
alongside Sylvester Stallone vehicles in suburban shopping malls late last year &#151; and
actually doing business (the Oscar nominations helped, of course). </font></p>

<p>Arguably, this nervousness results in some good filmmakers and their work receiving
short shrift stateside, including Ken Loach (<i>Raining Stones</i>, <i>Riff-Raff</i>),
Terence Davies (<i>The Long Day Closes</i>), Leigh (until recently) and Danny Boyle (<i>Shallow
Grave</i>, <i>Trainspotting</i>). Wait a moment&#151;<i>Trainspotting</i>, short shrift?
What about the hype, you say, the reviews? Not taking any chances, the film's American
distributor had some of the dialogue re-recorded and edited out some of the naughtier bits
(all of which has been restored to the laserdisc release, apparently). </p>

<p><img src="images/rtwintown-1.gif" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="128">All this is
preamble to the new British film <i>Twin Town</i> (Welsh in all but name and official
country of origin), which is possessed of the same cheerful calculation and original,
undeniable energy of <i>Trainspotting</i>, without the explicit drug usage and
unrelentingly grungy milieu. Not surprisingly, the two films share a strong link:
Executive Producers Andrew Macdonald and Danny Boyle produced and directed <i>Trainspotting</i>,
respectively, while <i>Twin Town</i> producer Peter McAleese remembers working with
Macdonald in 1989 on the low-budget British film <i>Wild Flowers</i> &#151; where
Macdonald was a production runner. To complete the lineage, <i>Twin Town</i> director
Kevin Allen is making his feature debut after graduating from soccer-themed documentaries
and acting (he's been in TV's <em>Absolutely Fabulous</em> and Rowan Atkinson's <em>The
Thin Blue Line</em>, also on film as the hotel manager at the end of <i>Trainspotting</i>
and the TV presenter in <i>Twin Town</i>).</p>

<p>To the strains of Petula Clark's 1960s tune, <i>The Other Man's Grass is Always Greener</i>,
(an instant tipoff to the culture-based ironies to come), viewers are introduced to
Swansea, the picturesque but placid southern Wales seaside town that Dylan Thomas once
called an &quot;ugly, lovely town&quot; and one character amends to &quot;a pretty, shitty
city.&quot; The labyrinthine but logical plot comes to the fore after a plethora of local
n'er-do-wells have been introduced. Fatty Lewis (Huw Ceredig) is a handyman from the
profoundly wrong side of the tracks whose tumble off a roof is blamed on local kingpin and
contractor Bryn Cartwright (William Thomas), who promptly refuses to pay compensation.
Without losing its lunatic sense of humor, <i>Twin Town</i> very soon turns dark indeed,
as reprisals from different members of each clan escalate in direct proportion to their
eccentricities, climaxing with a waterfront confrontation that proves dramatically
satisfying, if not morally redemptive. Acting as the malicious, amoral Greek chorus to the
proceedings are the psychopathic, usually wasted Lewis &quot;twins&quot; Julian (Llyr
Evans) and Jeremy (Rhys Ifans), whose talent for conceiving and executing vicious,
imaginative and ultimately deadly retribution on anyone named Cartwright (as well as a few
who aren't) is matched only by their seemingly supernatural ability to predict what
everyone else in Swansea is going to do and plan their next move before the offense has
been carried out. Also involved in the feud are local plainclothes cops Greyo (Dorein
Thomas) and Terry (Dougray Scott), who prove in their corruption and vindictiveness to be
thinnest of blue lines between the warring clans. </p>

<p><img src="images/rtwintown-2.gif" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="174" HEIGHT="128">With ancillary
character names like Hunky, Chunky and Dodgy (not to mention Mr. and Mrs. Mort), <i>Twin
Town</i> often plays like some demented Dickens novel. The acting is, as might be
expected, of the bulging-eyed, raised-voice, broad-gestured variety, owing to the
caricaturish nature of the entire proceedings (it is unclear if any of the thick Welsh
accents have been overdubbed by stateside distributor Gramercy Pictures). While much of
the company apparently worked together on a popular Welsh soap opera (<i>Pobol Y Cwym</i>,
if you must know), only Dougray Scott as the doomed detective Terry even approximates a
realistic approach, and the actor has now graduated to playing poet Robert Graves in
Gillies Mackinnon's upcoming <i>Regeneration</i>. &quot;I understand these
characters,&quot; he told Moving Pictures' Geoffrey Macnab at this year's Berlin film
festival, &quot;their putrid disgust for this terrible place. And that desperation to get
away.&quot; This seems to be a direct link to the &quot;Angry Young Man&quot; movement of
the early 1960s, in which such disaffected young men as Albert Finney, Richard Harris and
Tom Courtenay brooded their way through a depressed, black and white Britain (in fact,
hard-edged social commentary has always been a distinguished hallmark of films from the
entire United Kingdom).</p>

<p>While the sports/drugs/cultural hostility metaphors throughout <i>Twin Town</i> have
distinct parallels to <i>Trainspotting</i>, the new project was developed independently
while director Allen was shooting a documentary on the Glaswegian ice cream wars (the same
real-life event that inspired Bill Forsyth to write the sublime <i>Comfort and Joy</i>).
Finding a kindred spirit in anarchic social criticism, Macdonald and Boyle agreed to
shepherd the low-budget ($2 milion) picture through production and release. &quot;It's a
multiplex film but we haven't toned down any aspect to make it more friendly for foreign
audiences,&quot; producer McAleese said in Berlin (where the film was the subject of the
festival's oddest yet trendiest party&#151;in a parking garage). Allen's goal was perhaps
more direct: &quot;I wanted to lay a few Welsh stereotypes to rest,&quot; he said at the
same junket, &quot;they're a puke-inducing disgrace&#151;an insult to youth culture.&quot;</p>

<p>His strategy had many British critics seething over the frantic and morally vapid
panache of the proceedings (&quot;A film depicting mindless violence by two young
thugs,&quot; fumed one paper in London, where the film opened in mid-April). Ironically,
not only is this phrase a vaguely accurate description of <i>Trainspotting</i> as well,
but it fails to take into account the fantastic nature of the proceedings in both films (<i>Twin
Town</i>'s production company is called, appropriately enough, Figment Films). But by
eschewing the iconographic resonance and forced trendiness of <i>Trainspotting</i>, <i>Twin
Town</i> emerges as an original vision in which yet another untrampled corner of the world
(Rugby! Anthony Hopkins! Sheep! Shirley Bassey! Coal! <i>Tom Jones</i>!) goes mad with
greed, revenge, ignorance, addiction and lust. As such it may be doomed to perpetual
misunderstanding, but as a cultural bellwether it feels just right (anybody remember Billy
Wilder's career-ending <i>Kiss Me, Stupid</i>, which was reviled in its day but may be the
most frighteningly acute comedy he ever made as well as one of the best films of the
1960s? No? Rent or buy it immediately). No wonder the British press couldn't stand <i>Twin
Town</i>&#151;it may be spot on.</p>

<p>Seen in this light, <i>Twin Town</i> not only surpasses the shallow theatrics of its
predecessor (most drug movies screw it up by mistaking cheap thrills for veracity,
anyway), but resembles nothing so much as the Coen Brothers' <i>Raising Arizona</i> and <i>Fargo</i>
in its withering, surreal criticism of place and time (remember, the Coens grew up within
shouting distance of the North Dakota, and Allen was born in some place called
Gosport&#151;which is, apparently, in Wales). Ultimately, then, <i>Twin Town</i>, with its
emphasis on the unmerciful skewering of family and territory, class divisions and that old
standby, revenge, should overcome its cultural obstacles and do just fine in territories
where those traits exist&#151;and need constant tweaking by filmmakers unafraid to surf
the trends in pursuit of the universal comic curl. </p>
