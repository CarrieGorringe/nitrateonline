Such flagrant behavior, it is implied, would never happen in this day and age. One critic was moved to opine that there still might be pockets of racism in the American South, &quot;but this [film] is ridiculous.&quot; One can't help but wonder if this attitude is less a matter of historical fact, than of wishful thinking.

<p><font size="5"><strong>T</strong></font><font size="4">here has been a considerable hue
and cry over the &quot;exaggerations&quot; in the latest cinematic adaptation of a John
Grisham work, <em>A Time to Kill</em>. Critics have been falling all over themselves in
their zeal to prove that this story of an African-American father, driven to vigilante

<p>Moreover, despite the strong attempts by many Southerners to overcome the past, there
are still lingering resentments in certain quarters against Reconstruction -- over 120
years after its end. In response to an article reassessing the impact of the
Reconstruction period (the military occupation of the South by the Northern Army from 1865
to 1877), the president of some organization called &quot;The Southern League&quot;, which
supposedly presumes to speak for all people of the South, irately proclaimed that the
post-Civil War South &quot;became an economic colony of Northeastern plutocrats&quot; and
accused said individuals, known among Southerners as carpetbaggers, of imposing the
sharecropping system on the South (by which newly-freed blacks were reconstituted as de
facto slaves after Reconstruction ended) through the enforced abolition of certain
traditions of freerange usufruct. It would take an entire essay to even begin to answer
the various errors and convenient historical omissions in this particular mindset; suffice
it to say that the relative ease with which the South reverted to its traditional social,
economic and racial patterns after 1877 -- albeit with some cosmetic changes -- makes it
quite obvious that Reconstruction was a first-rate failure. Substantive on any terms would
take place only ninety years later, with the Civil Rights movement grafting desegregation
onto the social and economic traditions of the &quot;Old South&quot;. The net result of
this &quot;New South&quot; is an area in which, as <em>Atlanta Herald-Constitution</em>
columnist Cynthia Tucker puts it, a white man driving a pick-up truck with a Confederate
flag draped along the rear window will stop to help an elderly black woman cross the
street. It is this uneasy coexistence of gentility and violence -- so noted by observers
such as W.J. Cash -- that was a unique factor in Southern life, one which was not
completely eradicated after 1965. It could still be a wellspring waiting to be tapped.</p>

<p>Himself a white Southerner, and hardly unconscious of these contradictions, Grisham
reworked a scenario in <em>A Time to Kill</em> which, if hardly unique and extremely
lurid, offered up great narrative promise: what would happen in the &quot;New South&quot;
if an African-American father, Carl Lee Bailey (Jackson) incensed beyond reason at the
brutal rape and near-murder of his ten-year-old daughter by a couple of good ol' boys
going nowhere except where their battered pickup and beer-swilling habit will take them,
decides to administer his own form of justice? To Grisham's credit, he is not reluctant to
address the underlying racial tensions that exist in some quarters, and the film doesn't
flinch from doing the same. Although director Schumacher has toned down the rape scene
from its description in the novel, with all of the stomach-churning detail spread out over
six pages, the scene has been edited to convey just enough material for an effect that is
both shocking and a touch suggestive (an ironic situation in either case for Grisham to
find himself in, since Grisham has been inveighing bitterly against the violence in Oliver
Stone's <em>Natural Born Killers</em>). But <em>A Time to Kill</em>, in either form, goes
no further than the simple and graphic depiction of racial violence, designed to inspire
outrage. Grisham gives us brutality without attempting to address some of the underlying
issues, such as a neo-feudalistic socio-economic structure that exploited both whites and
blacks for the benefit of a white elite, with the theoretical &quot;superiority&quot; of
all whites, regardless of income, as a sop to the sensibilities of poor whites; it was the
skill and aim of some elites to play off the poorer whites against the blacks when
necessary to quell social tension, to the detriment of the latter. More background
information could have been presented to make this pernicious aspect of the past more
comprehensible, and it wouldn't have taken much effort: some well-chosen dialogue could
have done the trick. Instead, the book and film operate upon the assumption that the mere
presentation of black poverty and white cruelty is all the audience needs to understand.
So, the critic was right: the film is ridiculous, but it is the unbearable simplicity with
which Grisham chooses to compress narrative events to the point where history is distilled
into melodrama that makes it so, not in its admission that there are still extreme
elements in the South. </p>

<p>Thus, the relationship of this film to an honest examination of lingering racial
problems in the South is as corn liquor to Dom Perignon, as the stock characters and
situations multiply with increasing ludicrousness. In another section of the film,
invoking the tradition of extralegal presumptuousness permitted to offended whites, one of
the good ol' boys' brothers (Kiefer Sutherland) sums up his nostalgia for the good ol'
days in the film when addressing what should be done with Bailey: &quot;The nigger would
be hangin' from a tree with his balls in his mouth.&quot; The presiding judge at Bailey's
trial is felicitously named Judge Noose (McGoohan) and is quite open in his belief that
the offender will be given a fair trial -- before he is hanged. In addition to the judge
with a penchant for necktie parties, we also have the oleaginous District Attorney, named
Rufus Buckley (Spacey) with gubernatorial ambitions so strong he can taste them, who
follows the dictum that lynching a black man is a popular pre-election activity, even if
one has to go through the rather tiresome process of producing evidence beforehand. In the
film, Buckley is so arch as a villain that he does everything but twirl the ends of his
mustache and chuckle evilly at appropriately dramatic moments. Other stock figures the
poor but noble defense attorney, Jake Bergance (McConaughey), his bitter and
misunderstanding wife (Judd), Bergance's mentor, the sodden Southern aristocrat, Lucien
Wilbanks (Donald Sutherland), a shady, skirt-chasing divorce-lawyer friend with the
unlikely name of Harry Rex Vonner (Platt), and, for even better measure, the Northern
liberal defense researcher, Ellen Roark (Bullock) with a mind like a tack. Better yet, Ms.
Roark has a wealthy daddy, a fortunate plot development because the one thing this defense
team is short of is money. As if all of this weren't bad enough, Elliot Goldenthal's
musical score tops the list; in its stentorian and maudlin overplaying, it compares
favorably with the worst qualities of the work of Max Steiner and Erich Wolfgang Korngold.</p>

<p>And yet, Grisham, director Schumacher and screenwriter Goldman are able to make
something from this mess. If you don't think too much about the implications of what
you're watching, the film becomes something that is reasonably compelling, and they just
about succeed in pulling it out of the bag -- but not quite; director Schumacher, who
directed a mediocre-but popular version of another Grisham novel, <em>The Client</em>, is
on familiar territory, and he generally just lets things unroll with minimal interference
from himself (a good tack to take, since he usually has a remarkable tendency to overplay
elements whenever possible, and certainly whenever most undesirable). Only in the final
courtroom scene do things begin to unravel a little too perilously; for all of his skill
in crafting conventional narratives, Grisham oversteps his minor talents, and boxes
himself in most spectacularly. Bailey has demonstrated premeditated intent, not only in
his declared hatred of all whites (up to and including his defense attorney), but also in
his confession that he intended to kill his daughter's torturers. Hence, there exist no
grounds for self-defense or insanity, legally speaking. So Grisham is obliged to go for
the heartstrings in order to find a way out, and Schumacher just keeps tugging right along
with him. If you don't think about the shamelessly dishonest implications of this
approach, the film actually works rather well. Unfortunately, I thought about them too
often, and the film didn't help matters by providing nearly-constant reminders of its
incompetence.</p>

<p>As in another mediocre Grisham offering, <em>The Client</em>, any suspense and empathy
that the film can generate is in no small measure due to the prowess of its cast (if not
in the characters themselves, who possess, in typical Grisham fashion, too much emotion
and too little common sense -- a combination that's great for melodrama, but otherwise an
irrelevance that leads to audience irreverence). As evidence, one could cite the
tightly-wound performance of Samuel L. Jackson, who is able to convey all of the rage of
fathers everywhere. Platt provides much-needed comic relief; his sly bantering with
Bullock is one of the highlights of the film. McConaughey, the latest causality of
overexposure in Hollywood, gives a performance commensurate with the material he's been
given, but this is not the role that will make him a star in acting terms (for proof that
the gentleman can really act, it might be wiser to wait for John Sayles' latest film, <em>Lone
Star</em>, in which McConaughey displays a greater presence than here, even though his
role is much smaller). McGoohan and Sutherland pere also provide some welcome
southern-fried hamminess, although each tends to forget where he left his accent at
inappropriate moments. If you're a Grisham fan, you will probably like this film. If not,
go find some <em>Perry Mason</em> reruns.</p>
