<p><big><strong><big>&quot;W</big></strong>e have no idea who anyone is,&quot; someone
says near the beginning of this sublime shellgame from playwright and scenarist David
Mamet, returning to the director's chair after a handful of journeyman screenwriting
assignments (<i>Vanya on 42nd Street</i>, <a href="redge.html" target="_top"><i>The Edge</i></a>, <a href="rwag.html" target="_top"><em>Wag the Dog</em></a>). And, like clockwork, that sentiment is taken
to it's logical and harrowing extreme: as in the intricate, delicate moral universes
charted in his previous directorial efforts &#151; <i>House of Games</i>, <i>Things Change</i>,
<i>Homicide</i> and <i>Oleanna </i>&#151; the world of <i>The Spanish Prisoner </i>(the
title refers to a complicated confidence scheme, not a period swashbuckler rescue yarn) is
a land fraught with equal parts betrayal and benevolence, risk and redemption.</big></p>

<p><img src="images/rspanish-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">At the fictional
Caribbean resort to which he's been summoned by his boss, Mr. Klein (Ben Gazzara), finicky
corporate whiz-kid Joe Ross (Campbell Scott) scrawls some numbers representing heady
profits from an unseen formula he's dubbed &quot;The Process&quot; on a blackboard before
a group of executives at first skeptical, then awed by the moneymaking potential of what
they've seen. Before flying back to the mainland, Ross banters awkwardly with his
secretary Susan Ricci (Rebecca Pidgeon), who's perky to the point of annoyance, and his
colleague George (Ricky Jay), with whom he seems to be genuinely comfortable. Only one
event seems odd: while posing self-consciously for photographs on the beach, he meets the
mysterious Jimmy Dell (Steve Martin), who is at first rude but then contrite, offering not
only to take Joe to dinner back in New York but fix him up with his sister as well.</p>

<p>Once back in the city things begin to get tense, as Joe suspects Mr. Klein of ducking
his commitment to compensate him properly for &quot;The Process&quot; and simultaneously
begins an increasingly contentious friendship with the apparently rich Jimmy that is full
of false starts and miscommunication. Magnanimous enough to open Joe a Swiss bank account
and enroll him in his exclusive club, he is also petty and inscrutable. Yet when things
become strained at the office, it is the mercurial Dell that would appear to offer Joe the
best chance to protect his interests. George and Susan also have roles to play in the
unfolding drama, as does Pat McCune (Felicity Huffman), a woman Susan introduces briefly
to Joe at the resort &#151; who may or may not be an F.B.I. agent. </p>

<p>To reveal further plot developments would be unfair, robbing the viewer of the special
pleasures to be had from this cautionary tale (big business: bad, goofy grit: good). And
while the more larcenously inclined among moviegoers may be able to figure out the gist of
the grift, the well-constructed caper has just the right balance of chicanery and chance
to satisfy even the most worldly moviegoer.</p>

<p>It is precisely this emphasis on treachery, both within the individual and amongst
like-minded groups of them, that give Mamet's morality plays their fascination and power,
whether he's preaching from the pulpit of the stage (<i>Glengarry Glen</i> Ross, <i>Speed-The-Plow</i>,
<i>Ricky Jay &amp; His 52 Assistants</i>) or screen (he also wrote that Jack Nicholson
remake of <i>The Postman Always Rings Twice</i>, <i>The Verdict</i> and <i>The
Untouchables</i>). </p>

<p><img src="images/rspanish-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="149">As in all his
work, <i>The Spanish Prisoner</i> displays Mamet's prowess with contemporary language.
Muscular in it's egotistical swagger, multilayered in it's themes and nuances and musical
in it's precisely calibrated delivery, the script is laced with intriguing verbal and
visual metaphors (the breathless and distinctly MacGuffinish recitation of the titular
scam, airport x-ray machines, St. Patrick's Day, two copies of &quot;Budge on
Tennis&quot;) that advance and reinforce the atmosphere of deceit and treachery (after
all, wasn't Kafka's first draft of &quot;The Trial&quot; called &quot;The Process?&quot;).
But another trait this film shares with the writer's other work is a sort of remorseless
complexity of language and plot. Pace is everything; he doesn't care if you can keep up or
not. As a result, to be entertained by <i>The Spanish Prisoner</i> requires that attention
be paid to it far in excess of the energy that might be expended for, say, <i>Meet the
Deedles</i> or <i>The Wedding Singer.</i></p>

<p>Regarding the Mamet universe and the players' place in it, each actor is up to the
task, calibrating his or her performance to match the needs of the elaborate subterfuge at
hand. Thus, Scott's earnest but clueless clod &#151; a selfless, substantial performance
&#151; is perfectly in tune with the upper tax bracket bluster of Martin's sardonic Jimmy.
In fact, the comedian-turned-what, exactly? has never been better, bringing his
razor-sharp sense of timing to an arena where it can finally be appreciated. Jay is a
Mamet veteran, while Gazzara's role is too modest to measure.</p>

<p><img src="images/rspanish-3.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="147">Yet it is
Pidgeon, the current Mrs. Mamet, who pulls off the greatest sleight-of-hand stunt in the
picture. At first naively annoying as a sort of blissed-out Gal Friday (she says things
like &quot;golly&quot; in what she recently referred to as a &quot;trans-Atlantic&quot;
accent of vague origin), her insufferable Susan soon turns steely, and the inept wooing of
Joe gives way to a more urgent agenda. First noticed by Mamet while performing in the
Royal National Theatre's production of <i>Speed-the-Plow</i> in London and subsequently
cast as Carol in the original stage production of <i>Oleanna</i> six years ago, Pidgeon
tackles Susan with a wide-eyed guile that strains credulity while at the same time
soothing the agitated hero of the piece (&quot;Susan is the girl next door,&quot; Mamet
recently told the New York Times from England, where he's filming Terence Rattigan's play <i>The
Winslow Boy</i> with Nigel Hawthorne and Pidgeon. &quot;I didn't say next door to
whom.&quot;).</p>

<p>Technically, the film opts for a precision that offsets the sometimes murky motivations
of the characters. Gabriel Beristain's wide-screen camerawork unobtrusively highlights the
amusingly trendy hodgepodge of the corporate suites of the unnamed company built by
production designer. Tim Galvin. The music, by Coen Brothers regular Carter Burwell, has
all the symphonic menace of a good Hitchcock score, while Barbara Tulliver's crisp editing
moves from placid to staccato as the scam unfolds.</p>

<p>In the end, it is duplicity that is at the heart of Mamet's work and provides much of
the voyeuristic fun &#151; yes, fun &#151; of <i>The Spanish Prisoner</i>. While one might
sense that having no idea who anyone is &#151; and what they're capable of doing &#151;
describes the world in which the author must survive in order to realize his caustic yet
oddly tender body of work, the high price this exacts has a tangible result. With <i>The
Spanish Prisoner</i>, David Mamet continues the elevation of betrayal to an art form. </p>
