<p></font><strong><font size="5">A</font></strong><font size="4">n admirable freshman
effort from director-writer Theresa Connelly, who returned to her working class suburban
Detroit neighborhood to film this paean to the rites of filial passage. She has extended
an invitation for us to join her as she finds a cure for the wedding bell blues infecting
a Polish-American family chock full of moonstruck women and Adonis-featured men. For those
of you looking for a break from a summer of action, adventure, comedy, and war, <i>Polish
Wedding</i> may be that small picture to tuck away in your back pocket.</font></p>

<p>The community of Hamtramck, Michigan (previously featured in <i>Blue Collar</i> with
Richard Pryor and <i>Scarecrow</i> with Al Pacino), plays center stage to a fine cast,
including the remarkable Lena Olin and thoughtful Gabriel Byrne as Jadzia and Bolek
Pzoniak, a sensuous wife and her sensitive husband who have drifted apart under the
demands of their jobs as a local baker and cleaning woman, as well as her matriarchal
position raising four sons and Hala, a promiscuous teenage daughter (Claire Danes) whose
attraction to handsome local law officer Russell Schuster (Adam Trese) forces the family
to arrange the titular occasion, better known in the Appalachians as a shotgun marriage.</p>

<p><img src="images/rpolishwedding-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="130" HEIGHT="200">The family
is coping (just barely) under the strains of congestion, including the addition of Sofie
(Mili Avital) a young Syrian sister-in-law forever exhausted by the sapping demands of her
newborn child by way of Ziggy (Daniel LaPaine, one of the bevy of GQ talent in this
year&#146;s <i>Dangerous Beauty</i> and the hunky swimmer in 1994&#146;s <i>Muriel&#146;s
Wedding</i>). It&#146;s not a dysfunctional family. Quirky and ripe perhaps. Mom chomps on
pickles by the bottle and the chain-smoking youngsters sneak in and out through a basement
window under a neighbor&#146;s lecherous stare. Jadzia&#146;s extramarital activities with
businessman Roman Kroll (the talented Rade Serbedzija, best known as the Russian crime
boss Ivan Tretiak in last year&#146;s <i>The Saint</i> but soon to be featured in a larger
role in this year&#146;s remake of <i>Mighty Joe Young</i>), stimulate a whimsical notion
that she has broken free from her family&#146;s chains, as she dresses up. Although
you&#146;ll probably remember how well Olin&#146;s character &quot;cleans&quot; the
men&#146;s washroom floor, it is just foreplay for a poignantly revealing scene showing
her powerful intensity in the tearful realization of her weakness of the flesh while also
affirming her loyalty to Bolek and her family. This Swedish-born actress (winner of the
Academy Award ten years ago for her American debut in <i>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</i>)
oozes her character&#146;s Polish gypsy origins with an authenticity that appears as hot
as the ample polish sausages that overpopulates the family&#146;s dining room table. </p>

<p><img src="images/rpolishwedding-2.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="left" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="148">Dublin-born
Byrne offers a moody performance as the restrained cuckold who finds solace in rising
dough and raising children, particularly as a strong father to the tempestuous Hala. A
much more thematically demanding role than his appearance in <a href="rironmask.html" target="_top"><i>The
Man in the Iron Mask</i></a>, earlier this season. The 19-year-old Danes, here playing a
believable curly-haired hellion, continues to grow her career after her breakthrough on
the mid-decade ABC teenagesomething drama <i>My So-Called Life</i>. At one point, as the
anxious girl waits for her awestruck lover outside the local church, she reminded me of an
adolescent Marilyn Monroe (the trademark shot of her over the subway grate in <i>The Seven
Year Itch</i>), her white skirt slightly flaring off the ground.</p>

<p>Maybe there&#146;s a little heavy handed-ness when the not-so-virginal Hala is chosen
as the chaste symbol of innocence in the Procession of the Virgin. and the
uncharacteristic reaction by a priest after the unheralded announcement of the girl&#146;s
pregnancy disrupts the crowd. Or the hockey stick posse sent out in search of the
nonplused father of Hala&#146;s unborn child. But there&#146;s a lot of magic working too
in revealing the family&#146;s passions and pains.</p>

<p><img src="images/rpolishwedding-3.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">The
locations add a silent but visual character as drawn by director Connelly,
Hamtramck&#146;s deeply religious Polish roots revealed by Canadian cinematographer Guy
Dufaux (behind the camera on the award winning <i>Jesus of Montreal</i><b> </b>and <i>The
Decline of the American Empire</i>) and production designer Kara Lindstrom. Praise also to
the spirited music by Luis Bacalov, a plucky score that sounds more Italian than Polish
(musical cues courtesy of David Franco and the Orchestra di Roma), but add a sweet flavor
nonetheless.</p>

<p>The film, shown earlier this year at the Sundance and <a href="fberlin98.html" target="_top">Berlin
Film Festivals</a>, had a strong opening weekend on 11 screens in New York, Los Angeles,
Toronto, and (of course) Detroit, with just a 23% drop-off in week two. Look for strong
and steady numbers as this film expands amid the summer film avalanche. It&#146;s a
commendable &#150; not great &#150; word of mouth film that, like a good bottle of red
wine, deserves some time to breath.</p>
