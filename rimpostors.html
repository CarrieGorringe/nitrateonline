<p></font><strong><font size="5">S</font></strong><font size="4">tanley Tucci may have
been born in 1960, but his heart and soul are steeped back in the 1930s, and his new-old
Depression Era comedy is a joyful throwback to the wonderful, wacky days of the Marx
Brothers and their theatrical-based productions. With rare exception, for all the times I
watched hundreds of great and not-so-great burlesques, farces, and related light fare from
the decade following that first stock market crash nearly 70 years ago, I&#146;ve always
wondered why they didn&#146;t make films like those anymore. Well, the drought has finally
ended. Move over, Harpo, Groucho, Chico, and Zeppo. Watch out, Laurel and Hardy. Here
comes Platt and Tucci. Or is it Tucci and Platt. No matter. A new tour-de-farce team is
born and you don&#146;t want to miss this gem of an introduction.</p>

<p></font><font size="3">Tucci, as writer, director, co-producer, and star, certainly has
his hands full, but our sophomore multi-hyphenate (following on the critically successful
debut of his <i>Big Night</i>), shows us that he is more than up to the task. As his new
film opens, it&#146;s as if it&#146;s the dawning of the age of the movie talkie. Our
heroes -- razor-thin and dagger-sharp Arthur (Tucci) and sweet-toothed, sugar-coated, and
claustrophobic Maurice (Platt) -- are two starving actors, seated at adjoining tables in
an outdoor café. They play off each other as strangers, the soundtrack devoid of dialogue
but with a chatty score. Niceties are exchanged until they each proffer a seat to a pretty
woman. They bounce the poor gal between them like a ping pong ball in the true manner of
an old Keystone Komedy sketch. Knives are drawn. Death follows. So does sound.</p>

<p>Whoa! Didn&#146;t I say this was a comedy? Well, look at the title. Take a minute.
Don&#146;t worry, no one&#146;s dead. Next scene: Arthur berates Maurice, &quot;You stole
my death!&quot; As the boys await their fame, let alone their next meal, we learn they are
passionate, hungry thespians, eager to hone their profession in hopes of some day
performing a &quot;hall of fame&quot; death scene. </p>

<p>Until that precious moment, they&#146;ll bounce technique off each other and the world
in between auditions (one involving a uncredited cameo by Woody Allen) and schemes for
their next meal, even if the latter turns out to be just a puff pastry from a local
bakery. Their over-acting (intentional or not) and missed cues often brings a hilarious
means to an end. One reward is two unwanted tickets to a hammed-up <i>Hamlet</i> featuring
egotistic Jeremy Burtom (Alfred Molina) a Barrymoresque drunk over-admired by his public.
When Burtom and his entourage overhear A&amp;M aping the maestro&#146;s performance, he
flies off in a rage after the pair.</p>

<p>The chase is on.</p>

<p>And it doesn&#146;t stop until you&#146;ve stopped laughing an hour or so later. The
harried actors end up dockside asleep in a straw-filled crate and become stowaways on the
S.S. Intercontinental, a Paris-bound luxury cruise ship, with their nemesis (oh no!)
aboard as well. It&#146;s a ship of fools (the film&#146;s working title, too) where the
large ensemble cast is unmasked in briskly directed bits and pieces. Mad hatters all.
Quirky, manic, devious, deadly. It&#146;s a who&#146;s who of Alice&#146;s wonderland and
A&amp;M get caught among them all, discovering other posers amongst the crew and human
cargo. Among those along for the ride are Happy Franks (Steve Buscemi), a depressingly
suicidal lounge singer, a mysterious deposed and distraught queen (Isabella Rossellini), a
insidious First Mate (Tony Shalhoub) who speaks a language best described as goulash, and
Meistrich (Campbell Scott), an autocratic, boot-slapping hellhound with a facial scar,
nasty bridle crop, and an overzealous passion for Lily (Lili Taylor), the head stewardess
who befriends puppy-dogs A&amp;M and tries to keep them out of harm&#146;s way. Throw in a
wealthy Moorish sheik, an over-ripe tennis pro, an Italian captain, a gold-digging
dowager, her wallflower daughter, a pair of fortune hunters, and a dozen other nutty
characters and watch the hi-jinx develop in gloriously outrageous succession.</p>

<p>Tucci has a keen sense of physical and visual comedy here, and handles the talented
cast with kid gloves. Many of the actors appeared in his earlier film and you get the
luscious feeling that each is a richly defined piece in the film&#146;s witty script. No
one shines alone; they are brilliant together. Tucci makes imaginative use of the music
track, stopping it abruptly at sudden lapses in the chase and just as quickly restarting
it moments later when the hunt resumes. He makes incredibly perceptive use of sub-titles
in one particular sequence (it&#146;s VERY distinctive and VERY funny). There&#146;s also
his marvelous blocking of the cast against the pseudo-theatrical settings. It&#146;s an
overblown game of musical rooms. The movie has a histrionic feel of cycloramas and
greasepaint that heightens the voyage (I never did see the ocean) while putting the cast
through their frantic pacing, contrived romantic ploddings (in a funny way, of course),
and sets that scream <i>Room Service</i>. Kudos to Art-Deco production designer Andy
Jackness, director of photography Ken Kelsch, and costume designer Juliet Polcsa, all <i>Big
Night</i> alumni and obviously just as enthusiastic in handling their chores as the rest
of the cast and crew.</p>

<p>This is easily one of the funniest films of the year and in many a year. A laugh riot.
Honest. Please, Mum, give me more!</font></p>
