<p><big><strong><big>&quot;N</big></strong>o one deserves a vacation more than Julie
James&quot; is one of the tag lines for this sequel to the successful 1997 teen slasher
movie <i>I Know What You Did Last Summer</i>, but without the services of currently hot
screenwriter Kevin Williamson (<i>Scream</i>, <i>Scream 2</i>, &quot;Dawson's Creek&quot;)
-- or, it seems, anyone else behind the camera of the first installment -- it's the
audience that could use some time off from the tired formula of teens in peril.</big></p>

<p><img src="images/rstill-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="147">A year after
causing the accidental death of fisherman Ben Willis and watching in horror as her friends
were brutally slaughtered by a mysterious madman in apparent retribution, Julie James
(Jennifer Love Hewitt) remains haunted by the traumatic events to the point where she's
struggling in her first year of college -- so much so that she sleeps during the day and
keeps a huge carving knife in the drawer of her nightstand. Persuaded by her best friend
Karla Wilson (Brandy) to accompany her and boyfriend Tyrell Martin (Mekhi Phifer) on an
all-expense-paid vacation to the Bahamas won in a radio station contest, Julie discovers
that the menace has followed her to paradise. With the help of would-be suitor Will Benson
(Matthew Settle) and returning boyfriend Ray Bronson (Freddie Prinze Jr.), Julie fights to
survive and understand the true meaning of the awful threat.</p>

<p>The kind of movie where the female leads hold hands while talking about boys, <i>I
Still Know...</i> preserves the original's teenaged universe by making every adult in
sight either one-dimensional or cartoonish. The latter is best illustrated by the presence
of the <i>Re-Animator</i> himself, Jeffrey Combs, as the nervous and hostile desk clerk at
the suspiciously deserted resort (his Bugs Bunny-ish dental appliance may be the funniest
thing in the film). But rather than run with the concept of crazy adults, the filmmakers
seem more interested in creating a serious backstory for Julie's unease (the actress told
at least one talk show the movie was supposed to be taking place &quot;in my character's
head&quot;) -- a conceit made all the more implausible by the ironic fact that Love Hewitt
seems too sensible and spunky of a young woman to be in such an absurdly vulnerable state.
And the movie's central plot point, a geographical quiz that involves the capital of
Brazil, is insulting fraudulent.</p>

<p>As written, the supporting roles give Love Hewitt little or no help. Brandy remains an
annoyingly chipper presence profoundly out of place in a horror movie, while Phifer (the
agent for cataclysmic change at the end of last season's &#147;Homicide: Life on the
Street&#148;) continues to believe that a perpetual scowl passes for acting. Benson is
capable in a pivotal role, while the underused Prinze remains the one character of real
interest. </p>

<p><img src="images/rstill-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="155">Nevertheless, the
achingly familiar template is enlivened by a few pleasant surprises that genre-savvy
moviegoers will clutch at like life preservers. Although he shuffles off the mortal coil
far too soon, Combs' character oversees a nifty island getaway that mixes elements of
Stanley Kubrick's <i>The Shining</i>, John Carpenter's <i>Halloween</i> (a reference
massaged by John C. Frizzell's score) and ABC's impenetrable but provocative update of
&quot;Fantasy Island.&quot; While perfunctory, the direction of Danny Cannon (<i>The Young
Americans</i>, <i>Judge Dredd</i>) and facile camerawork of Vernon Layton (<i>The
Englishman Who Went Up a Hill, But Came Down a Mountain</i>) conspire to create a fitfully
atmospheric and threatening tone, particularly during a climactic storm. And Bill Cobbs (<i>The
Brother From Another Planet</i>, <i>The People Under the Stairs</i>) lends additional
veracity as Estes, a hotel worker. </p>

<p>According to the filmmakers, the better of two possible scenarios was utilized for this
film's narrative framework. That makes the inevitable third chapter in the ongoing saga of
the killer fish stick guy a dispiriting proposition indeed. Beyond an initial flurry of
pre-holiday thrill-seekers, audiences are unlikely, as the ads scream, to &quot;get hooked
again.&quot; </font></p>
