<p></font><img src="images/rbchucky-1.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150"><font FACE="Times" size="3">Hong Kong action director Ronny Yu (<i>The Bride with White Hair</i>,
<i>Warriors of Virtue</i>) highsteps over the earlier efforts by Tom Holland, John Lafia,
and Jack Bender, providing an easy pace and effective jugular scares, although we, the
audience, are totally aware of Chucky&#146;s shenanigans and it&#146;s a matter of see and
wait for the rest of the cast to clue in to the situation. That is, except for Tiffany (an
inspired Jennifer Tilly), a white-trash platinum blonde whose push-up bra showcases two
popping-fresh reasons, one adorned with a charming heart tattoo, for guys to see this
film. She makes great Swedish meatballs, too! After some plastic surgery with a staple gun
on her boyfriend (&quot;Well, hello dolly!&quot;) and some restorative gestures courtesy
of the scholarly volume <i>Voodoo for Dummies</i>, the heartless brute gives his ex the
cold shoulder. She gives him some payback with a Barbiesque bride before the scar-faced
spoil-sport gives his tormentor some shocking news as she sips champagne in a relaxing
bubble bath, a colored flotilla of foam providing a garish death wreath. Too late, the
tiny terror realizes he needs a cohort to transfer his imprisoned human soul back into his
earthly body (belonging to serial killer Charles Lee Ray), which lies buried in a
Hackensack, New Jersey, cemetery. Thus the queen of suds gets downsized for the rest of
the film, her re-awakening accompanied with scenes from the 1930s Universal (of course)
horror classic <i>Bride of Frankenstein</i>.</p>

<p><img src="images/rbchucky-2.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="left" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="150">Along for part of
the road movie is John Ritter, the former star two decades ago of TV&#146;s <i>Three&#146;s
Company</i>, hamming it up as Chief Warren Kinkaid, a small town sheriff with an
over-protective and mean-spirited attitude. He loves playing warden to his rebellious
niece, Jade (Katherine Heigl, who effectively played Steve Seagal&#146;s niece in <i>Under
Siege 2; Dark Territory</i>) as she sneaks off for a secret rendezvous with her love hunk,
Jesse (<i>Sunset Beach</i>&#146;s Nick Stabile in his feature film debut). Chucky nails
the officer before you can say Clive Barker, and shows the nasty lawman why he&#146;s a
such a big fan of the <i>Hellraiser</i> films. Meanwhile the young lovers, innocent
fugitives suspected in the numerous murders Chucky and his bride leave in their wake,
elope with the dolls in tow, unaware of some of the other cargo hidden away in their van.</p>

<p>A brief stop in Niagara Falls provides the filmmakers a pyrotechnical tour-de-force as
some nasty thieves get a mirror-shattering shower courtesy of our pint-size Barbie and
Clyde. Chucky, in a sentimental moment, retrieves a wedding ring for his bride from among
the newly-deceased honeymoon couple&#146;s dismembered body parts.</p>

<p>As our foursome heads south, Kathy Najimy pops up in a small cameo as a cleaning woman
who discovers a few over-ripe bodies, while the much-too-innocent Jade and Jesse take too
many turns accusing each other of the dastardly deeds. Etc., etc., etc.</p>

<p>Brad Dourif, the only actor to have &quot;appeared&quot; in all four Chucky films,
reprises his role as the voice of the vertically-challenged demonic star. His intonations
are chilling and mesh perfectly with the electro-mechanical doll constructed and operated
by puppet-meister Kevin Yagher.</p>

<p><img src="images/rbchucky-3.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">Don Mancini,
creator and sole screenwriter for all four Chucky features has fondly fashioned a black
comedy with some darkly funny sequences and witty lines. I particularly liked the moment
Chucky is trying to explain his nearly incomprehensible origins and he comments that
&quot;if this was a movie, it would take two or three sequels to explain.&quot; The
Cabbage Patch Kids may have run their course, but Chucky&#146;s back in town.</p>

<p>As a final postscript, according to Lew Irwin&#146;s <b>Studio Briefing</b>, Universal
Studios indicated its Hollywood and Florida theme parks will &quot;likely&quot; be
featuring major attractions based on <i>Bride of Chucky</i> and its forthcoming <i>Psycho</i>
remake and computer-generated <i>Frankenstein</i> project. Honestly, I can&#146;t fathom
Chucky&#146;s R-rated appeal among the younger set, although one of the film&#146;s
taglines is &quot;This time, Chucky has a playmate of his own.&quot;</font></p>
