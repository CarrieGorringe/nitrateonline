<p><big><strong><big>&quot;I</big></strong> guess you think you accomplished something in
there today,&quot; a skeptical police officer asks Pentecostal preacher Euliss
&quot;Sonny&quot; Dewey (Robert Duvall) as he shoos him away from his ministrations to two
teenagers who lie bleeding and broken in a wrecked car some forty lonely miles outside of
Dallas during a fragile, important scene near the beginning of <i>The Apostle</i>. &quot;I
know I did,&quot; says Sonny with a quiet moral certitude that, along with an impulsive
kick when the cop interrupts his reading of Ezekiel (&quot;that blood passage,&quot; the
actor calls it), sets a tone of perfectly balanced ambiguity for the singular sojourn that
follows. A film as centered and confident as the flawed but effusive faith of its
protagonist, <i>The Apostle</i> accomplishes that rare thing in an art form often
distracted by sensationalism: physical, emotional and spiritual veracity</big>.</p>

<p>The subtle, provocative credit sequence and a few early flashbacks establish Sonny as a
man born to the church who modeled his first passionate sermons after a blind preacher who
impressed him as a boy. Now a dedicated man of the cloth, Sonny is one of the most popular
pastors at the Temple of the Living God in New Boston, Texas. But he's also a preening,
egotistical, hot-headed holy terror who spends much of his time on the road leading
revival meetings and is apparently prone to dalliance, violence and drink (this all
happens off-screen but is strongly hinted at). When he is home he seems to get along much
better with his mother, Mrs. Dewey Sr. (June Carter Cash) and devoted friend Joe (Billy
Joe Shaver) than with his wife Jessie (a revelatory Farrah Fawcett). As his mother tells a
neighbor who calls to complain about Sonny's joyful noise, &quot;Sometimes he talks to the
Lord, sometimes he yells at the Lord.&quot;</p>

<p>When his Jessie falls in love with younger minister Horace (Todd Allen), the two
engineer a palace coup that results in Sonny's ouster from the church. At first defiant,
he shows up unannounced during a service in an absurd pair of aviator sunglasses to show
up the scheming couple by stuffing money into Horace's jacket pocket (&quot;it was a
hundred,&quot; he corrects one parishioner who thought it was a fifty dollar bill). But
his showboating inevitably turns to anger, and in a drunken fit of rage he tattoos Horace
with a baseball bat in front of his horrified family at a community softball game.</p>

<p>With his competition &quot;on the road to glory&quot; &#150; one of Sonny's many
flowery phrases, this one a nice way to say &quot;lying in a coma&quot; &#150; the
preacher ditches his car and identification and after a chance meeting with a solitary
fisherman who gives him one night of shelter winds up in Bayou Boutté, Louisiana and the
parlor of retired preacher C. Charles Blackwell (John Beasley). In short order Sonny has
gotten a job alongside garage mechanic Sam (Walter Goggins) working for local radio
station owner Elmo (Rick Dial), is romancing Elmo's secretary Toosie (Miranda Richardson)
and has changed his name to the cryptic &quot;Apostle E.F.&quot; (Eternal Faith?
Everlasting Fire? Sonny never says). Persuading the retired Brother Blackwell to join him,
the Apostle and a small band of dedicated followers refurbish Blackwell's abandoned church
and open The One Way Road to Heaven Holiness Temple.</p>

<p>As hard as the Apostle works to establish his congregation and redeem himself through
single-minded devotion, he can't escape his past. When his mother dies and Horace succumbs
to his injuries, it is only a matter of time &#150; and some errant radio waves &#150;
before the police locate the church and come to take him away (they're polite enough to
wait until he's finished preaching, though). As the closing credits roll, the Apostle is
testifying to the roadside chain gang he's shackled to, as vocal and secure in the power
of his faith as when he read Ezekiel to the couple in the wrecked car.</p>

<p>There are no plot twists in <i>The Apostle</i>, no car chases, split-second gunplay or
excursions to exotic worlds. Well, check that last, as Duvall the writer-director does an
extraordinary job of transporting his audience to a rural outpost of dignity and faith.
This is accomplished in two ways: first, as in his previous directorial efforts, the
documentary <i>We're Not the Jet Set</i> (1977) and the docudrama <i>Angelo, My Love</i>
(1983), Duvall exhibits an extraordinary feel for and affection towards a milieu peopled
with what might be described as cheerfully hardscrabble survivors. Particularly vivid in
this new film are Zelma Loyd and Sister Jewell Jernigan as bickering parishioners who are
among the most demonstrative worshipers in the Apostle's small but dedicated flock.</p>

<p>The second virtue of the project is sincerity: skeptics may spend the whole film
waiting in vain for Duvall to drop the act, to turn from crusader to conniver, but it
never happens. The Apostle is a man who believes down to his soul, and his epic struggle
with his own humbling humanity recalls such great Duvall performances as Major Frank Burns
in <i>M*A*S*H</i> (1970), Bull Meechum in <i>The Great Santini</i> (aka <i>The Ace</i>,
1979), Mac Sledge in <i>Tender Mercies</i> (1983 &#150; he won an Oscar for that one) and
Daddy Hillyer in <i>Rambling Rose</i> (1991). </p>

<p>Yet for all his fervent faith there's a certain hucksterism to Sonny as well, a flashy
oiliness reminiscent of Burt Lancaster's Elmer Gantry (1960) and Andy Griffith's Lonesome
Rhodes in the Budd Schulberg-penned <i>A Face in the Crowd</i> (1957) &#150; two sources
that Duvall acknowledges in the press material when he explains &quot;one day's good, one
day's bad. All I try to do is expose the percentages. A lot of these guys become corrupt
as soon as they get on television or in the public eye. But there are those who don't. And
there are those in the mainstream who are wonderful people. That's why I put the scene up
front, helping the boy in the car crash, because the guy's a good guy. He errs, but he's
not a bad guy at all. He does what he does for a living, and there are pros and
cons.&quot;</p>

<p>Duvall's reading of the Apostle deliberately muddies the moral waters. All sass and
swagger, Sonny is constantly punching at the air, breaking into a hyperactive trot and
grinning off to the side as if the Lord were standing right next to him (it's a tic
immediately recognizable from some of his other performances). Nowhere is this dichotomy
more apparent than in his brief on-screen relationship with &quot;The Troublemaker&quot;
(Billy Bob Thornton). After the two brawl on the church lawn following their initial
meeting, the Apostle thwarts his efforts to bulldoze the church by laying his bible in
front of the machine and converting the troubled man on the spot (Duvall and Thornton go
back aways; the former had one mysterious, memorable scene as the latter's father in<i>
Sling Blade</i>, while the latter co-wrote the former's laid-back duet with James Earle
Jones, <i>A Family Thing</i> [1996]). Duvall even makes a kind of grubby carnality look
good, as the Apostle's almost sinister lust for Toosie subsides gracefully when he regains
control of himself. It is this very embodiment of a worldy fire and brimstone preacher, an
unstable, volatile mixture of the sacred and profane, that gives the film its edge and
focus. </p>

<p>&quot;God bless you, you're gonna need it,&quot; someone says over the course of the
film's two-plus hours (it was trimmed by between 10 and 15 minutes by the mutual agreement
of director and distributor, although the cuts are undetectable). In the same vein, <i>The
Apostle</i> needs all the attention it can muster in a noisy and crowded marketplace
(Oscar-qualifying runs in New York and Los Angeles will be followed by a wider release in
late January), showcasing as it does an endearingly fiery, completely original American
actor at the peak of his amazing but barely containable powers. There's a Best Actor Oscar
nomination in store for this movie at least, which would go a long way towards validating
Robert Duvall's pure devotion to a calling that requires a volatile mixture of both
passion and commitment in order to succeed (preaching is often compared to acting;
tellingly, Duvall's credit is positioned onscreen just under a pulpit). A complex,
rewarding story of sin, faith and contemporary redemption, <i>The Apostle</i> is an
emotional, inspirational journey &#150; and a formidable, lasting accomplishment.</p>
