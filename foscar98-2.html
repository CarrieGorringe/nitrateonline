<p><big><strong><big>I</big></strong>t was an evening of goofy sincerity mixed with
off-color humor (for television, anyway) as an obviously happy Hollywood community
congratulated and rewarded itself for a very good year and 14 weeks of record-breaking
business last night (23 March) at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles. Current all-time
box office champion <a href="ftitanic.html" target="_top"><i>Titanic</i></a> won 11 of the 14 Oscars for
which it was nominated, tying the 1959 movie <i>Ben-Hur</i> for the most Academy Awards
ever given to a single film (the 14 nominations tied 1950's <i>All About Eve</i>). This
achievement is significant on a number of levels, as each film is a fact-based epic with
strong elements of tragedy that connected with audiences of the day. Significantly,<i>
Ben-Hur</i> was only nominated for 12 Oscars to <i>Titanic</i>'s 14, and two of the 11 won
by the 1959 epic were for acting (Karl Tunberg lost the screenplay Oscar to <i>Room at the
Top</i>'s Neil Paterson), whereas neither Kate Winslet nor Gloria Stuart won for <i>Titanic</i>
(the movie also lost the make-up award to the film that became a smash at least in part
when it's release was delayed from summer to the Christmas season, <em><a href="rmib.html" target="_top">Men
in Black</a></em>).</big></p>

<p><img src="images/rlacon-5.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" alt="Kim Basinger, L.A. Confidential" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="225">Except for that splendid song-and-dance performed by
Stanley Donen when he received his honorary Oscar for lifetime achievement(a deserved
honor for the director of <i>Singin' in the Rain</i>, <i>Seven Brides for Seven Brothers</i>,
<i>Bedazzled</i> and many more Hollywood musicals and comedy/dramas), the evening was
notably light on comeback stories and tributes to Hollywood's current crop of hard-luck
veterans. Long-anticipated Oscars to Julie Christie (for <i>Afterglow</i>), Peter Fonda
(for <i>Ulee's Gold)</i>, Robert Duvall (for <a href="rapostle.html" target="_top"><i>The Apostle</i></a>),
Burt Reynolds (for <a href="rboogie.html" target="_top"><i>Boogie Nights</i></a>), Robert Forster (for <a href="rjackieb.html" target="_top"><i>Jackie Brown</i></a>) and Gloria Stuart (for <i>Titanic</i>)
failed to materialize. Instead, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences voters opted
to fete their own, giving the Best Actress Oscar to the only American nominated (Helen
Hunt, <a href="rgoodas.html" target="_top"><i>As Good As It Gets</i></a> &#150; and the same thing
happened in 1971 when Jane Fonda won for <i>Klute</i>), the Best Actor Oscar to an
eccentric, immensely popular actor who's now won an Academy Award in each of the last
three decades (Jack Nicholson, <i>As Good As It Gets</i>, following <i>One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest</i> and <i>Terms of Endearment</i>), the Best Supporting Actor Oscar to a
popular comedian in a fine dramatic role (Robin Williams, <a href="fberlin98-5.html#Good-Will-Hunting" target="_top"><i>Good Will Hunting</i></a>) and Best
Supporting Actress to a former laughingstock turned formidable screen presence (Kim
Basinger, <a href="rlacon.html" target="_top"><i>L.A. Confidential</i></a>).</p>

<p>This theme continued in the two screenplay sections, as Ben Affleck and Matt Damon's <em>Good
Will Hunting</em> bested such fine scripts as <i>Boogie Nights</i> (in fact, Paul Thomas
Anderson's impressive movie failed to win any of it's three nominations) for the Best
Original Screenplay Oscar and the skillful adaptation of a supposedly unfilmable novel
earned <i>L.A. Confidential</i> the Best Adapted Screenplay award for director Curtis
Hanson and Brian Helgeland (ironically enough, the latter also wrote two of the year's
worst movies, <a href="rct.html" target="_top"><i>Conspiracy Theory</i></a> and <a href="rpostman.html" target="_top"><i>The
Postman</i></a>). Another worthy but modest movie shut out last night was Atom Egoyan's
egregiously overlooked <a href="rhereafter.html" target="_top"><i>The Sweet Hereafter</i></a>, nominated
in this category and for Egoyan's sublime direction.</p>

<p><img src="images/ftitanic-1.jpg" alt="Titantic" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="left" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="146">And
speaking of direction, wasn't everything we love and hate about Hollywood embodied in
James Cameron's two winning speeches? During the first, for Best Director, he reprised
Leonardo DiCaprio's incongruously contemporary line from <i>Titanic</i>, &quot;I'm the
King of the World! Whooeeee!&quot; and provided the show it's most embarrassing moment
(yes, worse than Madonna's dress and the glare ex-paramour Minnie Driver was caught giving
Matt Damon as he and Affleck thanked everybody from Sunset Boulevard to Fenway Park when
they won their screenplay Oscar). But you've gotta love the chutzpah and his presence of
mind when Cameron, at about the 12:30 am mark, asked for a moment of silence to pay
tribute to the lives lost when the Titanic (boat, not movie) sank on April 14, 1912. A
bold, classy move. But that, apparently, is the contradiction that is James Cameron, a
notoriously volcanic man now without a doubt the hottest commodity in Hollywood.</p>

<p>It was a very good night for stargazing, as movie buffs who managed to stay up till the
wee hours of Tuesday morning were rewarded with the awesome spectacle of every living
actor and actress possessing an Oscar all on the same stage. Seeing Nicholson wave his
metal again was one thing, but seeing true Hollywood legends like Teresa Wright, Shirley
Temple, Luise Rainer, Sidney Poitier, Harold Russell, and Claude Jarman Jr. in one place
was a thrilling moment, and perfectly in keeping with the cheery and unforced mix of old
and new that typified the entire production.</p>

<p>The strong but probably coincidental undercurrent of sophomoric humor throughout the
telecast was as odd as it was jarring; in any other year it would have been welcome comic
relief but last night actually detracted from the lotta love in the room. Dustin Hoffman
introduced a cool clip show encapsulating the previous 69 Best Picture winners by
speculating on that number's universal significance, while Crystal revealed that his Aunt
Sheila was the only thing that retained more water than Titanic (the boat or the movie?
Not sure). Even the technical guys got into the act, as winning cinematographer Russell
Carpenter (<i>Titanic</i>, what else?) said &quot;we're running late, so this is becoming
a 'Depends' moment for me,&quot; thus giving perhaps the most unique product plug in
Academy Awards history.</p>

<p>Still, there were legitimate zingers galore, as well as some shining moments: host
Billy Crystal's early routines and scandal jokes (&quot;to think that a year ago the White
House was complaining about too much sex in Hollywood&quot;); <img src="images/fsiff97-3.gif" alt="The Full Monty" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="202" HEIGHT="165">Hunt's
pointed reference to <i>As Good As It Gets</i> director James L. Brooks' exclusion from
the Best Director category (especially ironic since the Best Actor and Best Actress winner
were both directed by the only Best Picture nominee not to see it's director nominated);
the ebullient on-stage histrionics of former film critic, Foreign Film Oscar-winning
director and true <i>Character</i> Mike van Diem (not to mention Nicholson, the
Affleck/Damon team, Cameron and &#150; come to think of it &#150; almost everybody else);
Original Comedy and Music Score winner Anne Dudley's assertion that her agent was
&quot;scraping the barrel a bit here&quot; when he called her to compose for <a href="fsiff97-2.html#The_Full_Monty" target="_top"><i>The Full Monty</i></a> (that surprise hit's only
Oscar win); Martin Scorsese's heartfelt introduction of Donen; Basinger's assertion that
&quot;if anyone has a dream out there, I'm living proof that it can come true&quot;; and
even the Oscar fashions, which can usually be counted on to be pretty hideous but were for
the most part this year tasteful and even classy (note to Robin &quot;Armani Amish&quot;
Williams and other a few other guys: a tux is a tux is a tux &#150; don't try to improve
an already flattering concept).</p>

<p>&quot;You really made this a night to remember in every way. Now let's party 'til
dawn!&quot; said Cameron after <i>Titanic</i>'s sweep was complete, and that sentiment
just about sums up the giddiness of the evening. Basking in such a mood of unified
optimism, Oscar producer Gilbert Cates and director Louis J. Horvitz were smart enough to
just let the evening flow (a particularly nifty new flourish was filling the time between
the opening of the envelope and the appearance on stage of the winner with a voice-over
delineating that winner's previous Oscar history).</p>

<p>And flow it did: for the record, if the ceremony did indeed run three hours and
forty-five minutes (do they issue an official running time?), then it ties the longest
ceremony on record, which occurred April 9, 1984 &#150; the last time Jack Nicholson won
an Oscar for acting in a James Brooks picture (<i>Terms of Endearment</i>). The ceremony
was also a full half hour longer than the winning picture itself, which is proof positive
that when Hollywood's feeling good about itself, time stands still &#150; no matter how
silly or raucous things get.</p>
