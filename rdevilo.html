<p><font size="5" face="Times,Times New Roman"><strong>O</strong></font><font size="4" face="Times,Times New Roman">rdinarily, collectors must wait to get extra footage from a
Hollywood film (outtakes, trimmed scenes and the like) on laserdisc, or, in rare cases,
videocassette, release. By virtue of its much-documented difficulties before, during and
after production, however, <i>The Devil's Own</i> offers the alert viewer some unseen
footage in, of all places, the various theatrical and broadcast trailers that can still be
seen in some theaters and sporadically on network television. Remarkably, the film, which
stars Brad Pitt and Harrison Ford in a moderately absorbing thriller about an unrepentent
but increasingly troubled Irish Republican Army soldier and the honest New York City cop
who unwittingly offers him refuge which turns out to be far from safe, shows little or no
signs of the artistic and economic catastrophes which peppered the production (including a
different ending, shot not long ago). Absorbing if not particularly exciting, <i>The
Devil's Own</i> is a good evening's slick entertainment that offers in its jaded history
an intriguing armchair tale of how Hollywood operates today. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Opening with a bloody battle in urban Northern
Ireland that could be from the evening news, the action moves quickly to New York City,
where the only survivor of the skirmish, brooding IRA footsoldier Frankie &quot;The
Angel&quot; McGuire (Pitt), is met at the airport by local judge Peter Fitzsimmons (George
Hearn), who is sympathetic to the cause. Fitzsimmons has arranged for McGuire, now
operating under the <i>nom de paix</i> &quot;Rory Devaney,&quot; to room with Tom O'Meara
(Ford) and his all-girl brood (wife Margaret Colin and three daughters). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Financed by the judge, Pitt's in town to buy a
clutch of Stinger missiles from shady entrepreneur Billy Burke (Treat Williams) and sail
back to Ireland, where he presumably will use them on the British. As he negotiates,
O'Meara has problems of his own with partner Edwin Diaz as the overzealous officer shoots
a miscreant in the back and begs his cohort to cover for him. The inflexible O'Meara
refuses, and the episode ends in tragedy.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Meanwhile, &quot;Rory&quot; hasn't done well with
Burke, and three goons show up at O'Meara's house and scare the wits out of his wife.
Deciding to take a retirement package at about the same time he discovers the subterfuge,
O'Meara tracks down &quot;Devaney&quot; and forces a subdued but cataclysmic showdown.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">As usual, everybody concerned with the film has been
all -- well, mostly -- smiles on the morning talk shows and print interviews. It appears
that, to simplify the complicated process of Hollywood development, <i>The Devil's Own</i>
has been around awhile and was acquired by Pitt, who then passed it on to Ford. Once the
latter was onboard, the project moved forward with great speed -- even as, according to
the published rumors, Ford leaned on the screenwriters to expand and develop the role of
O'Meara (as it is, he takes top billing). Everyone agrees that production was begun
without a finished script, and that friction arose from this. For awhile, the troubled
shoot was covered by the tabloid press, which even published photos of a staged fistfight
between the two stars on the streets of New York.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">This tension parallels the mood of the film. With,
essentially, two good guys, traditional action elements would seem forced and are mostly
absent until O'Meara discovers &quot;Rory&quot;'s missile money. At this point Ford starts
to look, well, Fordish, making pronouncements along the lines of &quot;I told you, I
warned you&quot; and &quot;They're not going to bring him in, they're going to kill
him.&quot; His taciturn resolution turns nasty when his house is invaded, evoking
inevitable parallels with Tom Clancy's Jack Ryan character and innumerable other
&quot;Touch-My-Secure-Life-and-You-Die&quot; scenarios. Thus the multi-faceted issue of a
messy war in Northern Ireland that nobody seems to want but is passed down to each new
generation and larger moral questions, more vividly addressed in
cinematographer-turned-director Thaddeus O'Sullivan's <i>Nothing Personal</i> (now
appearing on the North American film festival circuit in Philadelphia and elsewhere), is
reduced to tough-guy movie heroics, as if Ford could hop in the Millenium Falcon and kick
it into lightspeed (and speaking of <i>Star Wars</i>, Ford's aged well, molding the
devil-may-care insouciance of Han Solo into a can-do persona of thoughtful gravity, if
predictable action).</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">While the relatively subdued nature of the <i>The
Devil's Own</i> -- few flaming explosions, no post- post- post-modern irony, no
flamboyant, eccentric villain -- might at first blush seem to be a breath of fresh air in
Hollywood's waning but still annoying testosterone-drenched &quot;event&quot; movie
atmosphere, the studio's fear is that even with the cross-generational one-two punch of
Pitt and Ford (or Ford and Pitt, if you want to keep the agents happy) the film doesn't
deliver enough action goods to sustain boffo box office. Ironically, the film works better
in its brooding state than if Ford's heroics had been further fleshed out.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Remarkably, the finished film also plays relatively
seamlessly to the casual observer, due, no doubt, in large part to the calm even hand of
director Alan J. Pakula (<i>Klute</i>, <i>All the President's Men</i>) and his superb
pacing skills. Fortunately, the two leads aren't really required to like each other, as
&quot;Devaney&quot; is established early on as devious and O'Meara's paternal feelings for
&quot;Rory&quot; as the son he never had are sketched in just enough to provide motivation
for the climactic episodes -- and both characters are pretty stoic to begin with. Yet the
missing footage, including the aforementioned fistfight, a wider angle of Pitt taking care
of business with Burke and shots indicating more details of &quot;Rory&quot;'s brief love
affair with supportive Irish lass Megan Doherty (Natascha McElhone), hints at what the
project apparently started life as: a character study of an idealistic young man and the
flickers of conscience he sees while rolling the dice on a very big deal that serves only
to repeat the cycle of violence that the conflict has become. In this perhaps deeper
context, that recently reshot coda reinforces an earlier line in which &quot;Rory&quot;
not only provides the essential theme of <i>The Devil's Own</i> but (unwittingly?) warns
an audience expecting Lethal Weapon 412: &quot;it's not an American story, it's an Irish
one.&quot; Quite a novel idea for a big American action movie, that.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Other than the sloganeering, about all that's left
of the movie's original depth are two emotional high points of the film: in the first, the
camera lingers on a passive but obviously conflicted Pitt as a priest intones the rites of
Catholic confirmation for one of O'Meara's daughters, and in the second Pitt gives a
quietly impassioned speech (in the authentic-sounding accent he maintains admirably
throughout the film) about a government that's failed all the factions it has tried to
mollify. Given the vagaries of duelling egos, Hollywood style, this is plenty for which to
give thanks. Still, like the recently-released director's cut of <i>Das Boot</i>, which
restores more than an hour of footage excised from the release print, should the producers
of <i>The Devil's Own</i> see the value to film history of charting its labrynthine shoot
(and restoring a larger percentage of the film's estimated $90 million budget to the
screen -- any sized screen), the bells-and-whistles laserdisc oughtta be a doozy.</font></p>
