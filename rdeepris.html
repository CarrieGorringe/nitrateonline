<p><big><strong><big>A</big></strong>nother in a string of dreary January releases, this
title could be about the discovery of Chicago deep-dish pizza, but is actually about good
guys vs. bad guys vs. sea monster. Deep Rising makes a valiant attempt to become the South
China Seas' answer to the Bermuda Triangle, but off-the-shelf acting and a hackneyed plot
won't keep this oversized barge afloat. Maybe all the people who have seen <i>Titanic</i>
ten times will want to give this film their attention, but any comparisons are bound to be
disappointing. Even the creature designed by Rob Bottin (noted for his work on <i>Total
Recall</i> and <i>Robocop</i>) reminds me of giant phlegm. How enticing!</big></p>

<p>Forty-six-year-old Treat Williams (looking much younger) has been trying for decades to
find the high energy he garnered for his role as New York Detective Daniel Ciello in <i>Prince
of the City</i> (1981). Regrettably, here's another take charge role that sinks under poor
writing. As the scruffy but cool-headed John J. &quot;Finn&quot; Finnegan<img src="images/rdeepris-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="219" HEIGHT="150">, he is captain of the
Saipan, a ramshackle speedboat that, much like the Millennium Falcon, can't seem to make
the jump past lightspeed as it struggles with its second-hand equipment amid a raging
storm. Along with his handy mechanic Chewbacca, er, Pantucci (Kevin J. O'Connor) and a
soon-to-depart first mate (Uma Damon), the crew is ferrying a group of secretive
international mercenaries from the middle of nowhere to the middle of nowhere. In a series
of cross-cut sequences we are simultaneously introduced to the maiden voyage of the exotic
luxury gambling liner Argonautica, a love boat for the fabulously wealthy. So we know what
the bad guys, lead by Hanover (Wes Studi, who you may remember as Magua in <i>The Last of
the Mohicans</i> or from <i>Dances with Wolves</i>), are after and soon Finn does too, as
the ever-prying Pantucci discovers advanced Chinese assault weaponry and torpedoes in the
hold. Here's the first script boo-boo: why hire a boat when you could buy one and not
bother with the likes of Finn and crew discovering your ulterior motives. Oops.</p>

<p>Back on big boat we follow the mysterious, red-headed, bumble-gum-popping jewel thief
Trillian (former 007 beauty Famke Janssen). Caught red-handed robbing the ship's vault,
she is imprisoned in a makeshift brig. After someone sabotages the ship's mainframe (the
well-financed commando raid suggests just one possible suspect as the inside man), the
captain (Derrick O'Connor) and his frantic crew, baffled by the ship's shutdown, prove
helpless when something bigger than <i>Moby Dick</i> and certainly not as sweet as the <i>Little
Mermaid</i> attacks their charge. A dislodged life boat from the Argonautica incapacitates
the Saipan, and before you can say &quot;the good ship Lollipop,&quot; Hanover and gang
are aboard the cruiser, now dead in the water and ghostly empty. As they muck around for
answers, they uncover Trillian, the captain, and Canton (Anthony Heald), nerd owner of the
ship.</p>

<p><img src="images/rdeepris-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="229" HEIGHT="150">The ranks of the
survivors grow thin one by one as they are caught unaware and dragged to a gruesome death
through the encroaching sea waters. Director of Photography Howard Bretherton (<i>Fatal
Attraction</i>) does add a sense of urgency, playing light, steam, and shadow around the
bowels of the ship, but his efforts are not enough to plug the holes in the script. Yeah,
back to the screenplay. Another bug-a-boo: if the mainframe is fried and most of the power
out, why are the elevators running and playing musak? Yeah, it's good for a chuckle (you
can catch this joke in one of the preview trailers), but it kept me squirming from lack of
belief.</p>

<p>And for the weak-stomached few who wander into this film, there are some real yucky
moments, as the dearly departed are not really eaten alive, but drunk alive for later
digestion. Hey, there's one group of technicians credited for their work on
&quot;Half-Digested Billy.&quot; You get the idea.</p>

<p><img src="images/rdeepris-3.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="97" HEIGHT="150">The final
explosive climax is forestalled as Canton stalks Finn, Pantucci, and Trillian for his own
demented reasons. A jet ski sequence mirrors one used in <i>Hard Rain</i> (as does the
heavy use of rain and water) and as there are only a few more days left in January, there
should be no more films this month with Sea-Doo chases to bother us. Heck, I would have
taken one of the lifeboats to the island discovered nearby. But I didn't write this bowl
of decaying sushi. As the camera draws back when our trio arrive safe on shore, we learn
they are not alone. Another sequel? Not a chance. <i>Deep Rising</i> falls flat.</p>
