<p><big><strong><big>O</big></strong>ff-kilter sweet and hopelessly romantic, with a dash
of acne and a heaping of dark gray matter, is <i>Rushmore</i>, the new comedy from the
director of 1996&#146;s offbeat <i>Bottle Rocket</i>. That earlier, offbeat critical
success featuring <i>Home Fries&#146;</i> Luke Wilson (popping up now with a brief cameo)
is hereby followed by director and writer (with Bottle&#146;s co-star and co-author Owen
Wilson) Wes Anderson&#146;s sophomore effort, a far from sophomoric tale of
over/under-achievement gone strangely and hilariously amiss. After several favorable
receptions at North American film festivals (Telluride, Toronto, New York), this
$10-million film pops up for a short term, award-qualifying lease in New York and Los
Angeles in mid-December before wider unreelings next February (although originally set for
a release last summer). I don&#146;t think this portrait of a businessman as a young
student will walk away with any statues next year, but you might as well whet your whistle
for something a little different than most <i>Revenge of the Nerd</i> clones. Mark your
calendars accordingly for this freshly written and simply mounted piece of light
entertainment.</big></p>
<i>

<p>Rushmore</i> features newcomer Jason Schwartzman as 15-year-old Max Fischer, a
daydreaming prep student at the Rushmore Academy, who is very short on grades but high on
expectations and a parade of extracurricular activities (debate team captain, chess club,
calligraphy, astronomy, Yankee Review publisher, ad nauseum). On the edge of expulsion, he
is smitten with Rosemary Cross, a young, widowed first grade teacher with an interest in
aquatic life. A forced meeting by the boy finds him at her beck and call (Some lemonade,
Miss Cross?) in a relationship that sputters along in various directions, although none,
ultimately, end to the poor schlep&#146;s benefit. Olivia Williams portrays the instructor
with grace and flippant dignity in a role that she&#146;ll be more remembered for then
that of Abby in The Postman, Kevin Costner&#146;s last Waterloo. Schwartzman&#146;s
startling debut pits him against Bill Murray, sporting a harried, slept-in look,
disorienting comb-over hairdo, and salt-and-pepper mustache as Herman Blume, a local
business tycoon who looks like roses to Jason as a rich school benefactor, but is actually
losing a battle with his wits, marriage, and a quest for infidelity. It&#146;s quite a
role reversal from his usual schtick and a welcome comeback from <i>The Man Who Knew Too
Little</i>.</p>

<p>So, although Max&#146;s one-act play on Watergate got him admitted to Rushmore, his
academic career seems headed toward impeachment, as take-no-hostages headmaster Dr.
Guggenheim takes a special interest in the student&#146;s shenanigans. Scot Brian Cox
fills the role with gusto (reminiscent of Jeffrey Jones in <i>Ferris Bueller&#146;s Day
Off</i>), seemingly inspired from his roles as Chief Hatfield in last year&#146;s <i>Kiss
the Girls</i> and as the slimy Lyman Earl Collier in <i>Chain Reaction</i>.</p>

<p>The wonderful Seymour Cassel, a 40-year veteran of film and television, gives a
memorably pure performance as Max&#146;s dad (often adorned in one of those pull-down
hunting caps), a barber by profession or neurosurgeon by prevarication. Just ask Max, one
heck of a perpetual liar, yet a teller of tales whose charming allure catches the
attention of the chain-smoking Blume. The boy sweet talks the industrialist into building
a marine observatory at the school. Just a slight catch -- Max hasn&#146;t told the school
authorities of his plans and they go ballistic as he starts to dig up the baseball field.
Rounding out the lead roles is Max&#146;s sometime sidekick Dirk Calloway (Mason Gamble,
growing a few inches from his 1993 debut as Dennis the Menace), who pops in and out of a
scene here and there, his gorgeous mom playing a pivotal role in the boys&#146;
relationship.</p>

<p>It&#146;s the battle of obsessive wits between Max and Herman as they vie for the
affections of the lovely widow that makes this film a step above the rest. It gets
downright nasty (in a perfectly funny way) as both chumps fall from grace and take the
other to task. A mangled bicycle, a bee swarm, and &quot;faulty&quot; car brakes are just
a few of the devices employed in their skirmish. Only later does the depressed pupil
realize that &quot;war does funny things to men.&quot; By then, horror of horrors, Max
ends up demoted to Grover Cleveland High School, frantically trying to form a fencing team
from an indifferent student body, while Herman gets dumped by his wife and twin sons. The
rousing conclusion has our fledgling theatrical director mounting an explosive production
about heaven and hell. My, oh my.</p>

<p>Director-writer Anderson appears poised for a jump up the ladder of success. Praise is
also due his talented production staff -- cinematographer Robert D. Yeoman, production
designer David Wasco, editor David Moritz, and the music of Mark Mothersbaugh -- all
happily returning from Anderson&#146;s first film. Murray&#146;s solid performance is a
stand-out, while Schwartzman reminds me of a young Tom Cruise, sans Clearasil.</p>
