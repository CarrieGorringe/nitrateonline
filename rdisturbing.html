<p>If you&#146;re waiting for a real good horror film ... linger a little longer and
bypass the boring and predictable <i>Disturbing Behavior</i>. You might want to instead
hold your breath for <i>Halloween: H20</i> with Jamie Lee Curtis, back as Laurie Strode,
opening August 5th.<b> </b>Meanwhile, this week we have the directorial debut film of <i>X-Files&#146;</i>
David Nutter in an effort worthy of his small screen origins. So wait for it to pop up on
video shelves in your local Blockbuster before heading into the theater and spending big
bucks on a film more suitably titled Disappointingly Bad.</font><font FACE="Times,Times New Roman"></p>

<p><img src="images/rdisturbing-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">Scriptwriter
Scott Rosenberg may have scored well with the 1997 hit <a href="rconair.html" target="_top"><i>Con Air</i></a>,
but he was also responsible for the dreadful <i>Things To Do in Denver When You&#146;re
Dead</i>. In the up and down world of success, this one runs cold, as it does for
producers Jon Shestack and Armyan Bernstein, who will only see a fraction of the
box-office dollars made on their <a href="rairforce1.html" target="_top"><i>Air Force One</i></a>
(1997). Helmer Nutter brought along from his TV series the director of photography John
Bartley and composer Mark Snow. Snow&#146;s score is especially unsatisfactory in lieu of
his fine work on the wide screen version of <a href="rxfiles.html" target="_top"><i>The X-Files</i></a>.
Group effort. Group blame. Group dud.</p>

<p>The thin storyline combines elements from 1975&#146;s <i>The Stepford Wives</i> with <i>The
Invasion of the Body Snatchers</i>. Toss in a mad scientist and a flock of gullible
parents stocking a seemingly bucolic shoreline community lapping up to the waters of the
Puget Sound. This town on the fictious Crescent Island plays like a big screen sendup of <i>Beverly
Hills 90210</i>. Let&#146;s call it Cradle Bay 98210. The characters are as
one-dimensional (if that much) as their boob tube cousins and act (or react) accordingly.
Please, don&#146;t waste your time or money. This movie is extremely close in badness to <i>Species
II</i>, which was also brought to you by distributor Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. MGM&#146;s
mid-year share of the boxoffice stood at 4.6% (9th place) and with films like <i>Disturbing
Behavior</i> and <i>Dirty Work</i>, don&#146;t look for any jump in their standing anytime
soon.</p>

<p><img src="images/rdisturbing-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">In our idyllic
town resides a school system filled with motor jocks, micro-geeks, skaters, space cadets,
and the Blue Ribbons, this last a broodish coterie of super achieving teenagers that hang
out at the local yogurt shoppe and seem to be particularly influenced by one Dr. Caldicott
(a mustachioed Bruce Greenwood), a neuro-pharmacologist who has extracurricular reasons to
be the school counselor. Seems he has been experimenting these last two years on numerous
unruly teenies, who have amazing recuperative powers considering the delicate nature of
the good, er, bad, doctor&#146;s incisive incursions and mind control procedures on the
topmost parts of the student bodies. Sinister Dr. C is, unfortunately, still in beta
testing on his implant technology and some of the upperclassmen start short circuiting in
brutal and fatal (and did I mention laughable) ways. One particularly shabby sequence
involves Caldicott&#146;s psychiatric facility, where the hero and heroine walk right in
and step right down (I heard that in a song once) amongst the lunatics, apparently
subjects of earlier research projects gone bad. Dimly lit corridors, creaking doors,
spooky patients. Groan. Big Groan!</p>

<p>The cast reminded me of one of the several interchangeable young twenty-something TV
dramas that populate today&#146;s airwaves. Female lead Katie Holmes (as black
leather-clad bad girl Rachel) does indeed hail from <i>Dawson&#146;s Creek</i>, but the
other roles are filled with such up-and-comers James Marsden (pretty face Steve Clark,
just in from Chicago), Nick Stahl (drugged-out outcast Gavin), who made an impressionable
debut opposite Mel Gibson in 1993&#146;s <i>The Man Without a Face</i>, and Chad E.
Donella as the pigmentally-challenged U.V. Poor Steve Railsback (outstanding in
1980&#146;s <i>The Stunt Man</i>) is reduced to basically a walk-on role as a cop on the
wrong side of the law. At least I can rejoice that William Sadler makes a short but sweet
showing as Dorian Newberry, the disheveled ass-picking, pest-obsessive janitor at the
local high school. It&#146;s not as strong or funny role as his Grim Reaper in <i>Bill
&amp; Ted&#146;s Bogus Journey</i> (1991) or his tragicomic inmate Haywood in 1994&#146;s
enjoyable <i>The Shawshank Redemption</i>, but it&#146;ll do in a pinch.</p>

<p>As for the rest of the film, it&#146;s shameful, especially &#150; based on the
Carriesque ending &#150; the threat of even contemplating unleashing to the public a
sequel to this inbred disaster.</font></p>
