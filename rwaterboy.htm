<p><big><strong><big>T</big></strong>here&#146;s something about Sandler. Adam &quot;Big
Bucks&quot; Sandler. And, of course, funny Adam Sandler. This modern day David has doused
a slew of Goliaths, including <a href="rsiege.html" target="_top"><em>The Siege</em></a> and <a href="rjoeblack.html" target="_top"><em>Meet John Black</em></a>, while smashing numerous box-office
records with his latest &quot;block&quot;buster effort. His new comedy has already
bypassed the cumulative gross of his previous crossover effort <em>The Wedding Singer</em>,
and, by the time the game gun sounds, this silly but charming foozball bayou
farce/Keystone Komedy will outgross all of Sandler&#146;s features combined. For now
it&#146;s bound to keep the queues long and the smiles wide.</big></p>

<p><img src="images/rwaterboy-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="148">Sandler is back
in tow with <em>Wedding</em> director and college roommate Frank Coraci, with writing
partner and dorm-mate Tim Herlihy (involved with all of Sandler&#146;s starring vehicles
and a member of the New York State Bar) also returning as the boys tackle secondary
education and Cajun cookin&#146; with a flair for the over-silly, excessive caricature of
Louisiana low-brow stereotypes. Sandler&#146;s Bobby Boucher is a 31-year-old
home-schooled inbred cousin to his dumb and dumbest characters in <em>Billy Madison</em>
and <em>Happy Gilmore</em>, a childish, foolish sort that lives to serve others and to
have others beat him up. He&#146;s a perfectly contented mama&#146;s boy (unsinkable swamp
queen Kathy Bates as an over-sheltering banshee) that lives to provide a titular quality
product on the sidelines of life and a nearby institute of higher learning.</p>

<p>But a mean-spirited dismissal by Louisiana Cougar hellfire coach Red Beaulieu (Jerry
Reed) forces Bobby to take a similar position as &quot;water distribution engineer&quot;
with the hapless and moth-eaten Louisiana State University Mud Dogs, a depressing team of
washouts managed by the Fonz himself (Henry Winkler, with a more than few marbles loose
and a mid-life, mid-riff bulge, not to mention a Roy Orbison tattoo). The team&#146;s
losing funk turns to hope when the Perier Kid vents his anger at his insecure boss&#146;s
urging and becomes the most devastating tackler on earth. As in all of these sophomoric
sports comedies, reason is tossed to the wind at the expense of broadly drawn society
rejects, absurdly etched scenes, and slapstick visual humor. Be advised to leave your
brain at home for the duration of this film, but bring along your heart as the film&#146;s
high spirits will certainly buoy yours. Oh yes, don&#146;t forget your funny belt for an
ample dose of guffaws, chuckles, and chortles.</p>

<p>Bates is allowed tremendous latitude in creating one of the most memorable and wackiest
roles in the film. She cooks up a storm deep in her bayou home of sautéed snake, gator
fingers, and other fried green culinary delights (not!) that make your stomach turn but
your belly laugh. Stephen King would personally eat his heart out rather than gulp down
some of the southern swill his Misery gal concocts for her son and his guests, including
Coach Klein (Winkler) and Bobby&#146;s hotwire squeeze Vicki Vallencourt (The Craft&#146;s
Fairuza Balk), whose quite a jailbird dish (in a trailer park trash sort of way) herself.</p>

<p><img src="images/rwaterboy-2.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="left" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="151">Other roles are
filled with airheads, lunatics, and buffoons, including Blake Clark as Farmer Fran, an
incomprehensible assistant coach for the Mud Dogs and running joke whenever he opens his
mouth, and Ron Howard&#146;s brother Clint as a half-witted fan, while fellow Saturday
Night Live alum Rob Schneider overstays his welcome as a screaming townie. In tribute to
their late brother Chris (and Sandler&#146;s fellow SNLer and friend), John and Kevin
Farley appear briefly in a wrestling scene, while director Coraci puts on a demented
showing late in the film as a life-long walkout back to haunt Bobby. Among real life
celebs/stars playing themselves are Lee Corso, Dan Fouts, Jimmy Johnson, Brent Musburger,
Lynn Swann, and recently arrested Lawrence Taylor (warning kids not to do drugs!).</p>

<p>As a Disney release (through its Touchstone Pictures label), the film blatantly hammers
home co-promotions for ABC and ESPN, both Mickey Mouse house-owned entities, not that
I&#146;ll be watching more of those stations because of the film&#146;s cross plugs. But
I&#146;ll be awaiting Sandler&#146;s next comic adventure with a fresh understanding for
his special brand of comedy (but I still wish he&#146;d straighten out his face). Sandler
has proven himself a worthy alchemist with <i>The Waterboy</i>, transforming swamp water
to Evian. Quite a refreshing if moronic romp. Sandler rocks!</p>
