<p><big><strong><big>W</big></strong>hile most Oscar prognosticators saw <a href="ftitanic.html" target="_top"><i>Titanic</i></a> getting a Best Picture nod, few industry watchers
were prepared for the wave of nominations the blockbuster epic received as actress Geena
Davis read the Academy Awards roster from Los Angeles this morning (10 February). </big></p>

<p><img src="images/ftitanic-1.jpg" align="right" alt="Titantic" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="146">Almost
immediately, the true impact of <i>Titanic's</i> effect on the awards was apparent, as
Gloria Stuart and Kate Winslet became the first acting pair in the history of the awards
to receive nominations for playing the same character in the same year (Marlon Brando and
Robert De Niro both won Oscars for playing the same character &#150; Vito Corleone &#150;
in <i>The Godfather</i>, but they were a few years apart and Brando didn't show up to
accept his anyway. And as long as we're being parenthetical, when was the last time a true
box office champion was the overwhelming favorite to win Best Picture? Unscientifically, <i>Forrest
Gump</i> might be the most prominent recent example, although both <i>Star Wars</i> and <i>E.T.</i>
were nominated but failed to win. End of parentheses). </p>

<p>And while Leonardo Di Caprio failed to garner a Best Actor nod for his rather too
contemporary reading of the doomed half of the put-upon lovers, the movie also received
nominations for Best Director (James Cameron, one of five first-time nominees in that
category), Art Direction, Cinematography, Sound, Sound Effects Editing, Original Dramatic
Score (James Horner), Original Song (&quot;My Heart Will Go On,&quot; written by Horner
and Will Jennings and performed by Celine Dion), Costumes, Film Editing, Makeup, and
Visual Effects.</p>

<p>That is the most nominations for a single film since <i>All About Eve</i> in 1950, and
while Joseph L. Mankiewicz' backstage drama only won six statuettes, look for <i>Titanic</i>
to at the very least sweep or rule the technical awards. The 1959 version of <i>Ben Hur</i>
still holds the record for most Oscars won, with 11 (West Side Story is second with 10,
while <i>Gone with the Wind</i>, <i>From Here to Eternity</i>, <i>Mary Poppins</i> and <i>Who's
Afraid of Virginia Woolf</i>? are tied for second in the total nominations category with
13. And finally, <i>Cabaret</i> holds the record for most Oscar wins &#150; eight &#150;
without bagging Best Picture).</p>

<p>There were relatively few surprises among the Best Picture nominees, with <a href="rlacon.html" target="_top"><i>L.A. Confidential</i></a>, <a href="rgoodas.html" target="_top"><i>As Good As It
Gets</i></a>, and <a href="fberlin98-5.html#Good-Will-Hunting" target="_top"><i>Good Will Hunting</i></a>
the odds-on favorites to make the cut. Only <a href="fsiff97-2.html#The_Full_Monty" target="_top"><i>The
Full Monty</i></a> raised a few eyebrows, as the small but potent comedy, which recently
passed <i>Four Weddings and a Funeral</i> to become the most successful film ever at the
British box office, was seen as too lightweight to compete. Films that were seen as more
sure bets in that fifth slot but were passed over include <a href="ramistad.html" target="_top"><i>Amistad</i></a>,
<a href="rboogie.html" target="_top"><i>Boogie Nights</i></a>, <a href="ricestorm.html" target="_top"><i>The Ice Storm</i></a>,
<i>Kundun</i> and <i>The Boxer</i>.</p>

<p><img src="images/rgoodas-3.jpg" alt="Good As It Gets" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">One Best Actor nominee set a record of his own, as Jack Nicholson became the
first actor with 11 nominations when the Academy recognized him for his work in <i>As Good
As It Gets</i> (he passes Laurence Olivier, which is pause for thought). Newcomer Matt
Damon (<i>Good Will Hunting</i>) joins 1960s counterculture icon Peter Fonda (<i>Ulee's
Gold</i>) as the first-time nominees alongside veterans Robert Duvall (<a href="rapostle.html" target="_top"><i>The Apostle</i></a>) and, in a mild surprise, Dustin Hoffman for
his mischievous imitation of producer Robert Evans in Barry Levinson's <a href="rwag.html" target="_top"><i>Wag
the Dog</i></a>. Passed over in the always-crowded field were Djimon Hounsou (<i>Amistad</i>),
Daniel Day-Lewis (<i>The Boxer</i>), Samuel L. Jackson (<a href="rjackieb.html" target="_top"><i>Jackie
Brown</i></a>), Ian Holm (<a href="rhereafter.html" target="_top"><i>The Sweet Hereafter</i></a>), Al
Pacino (<i>Donnie Brasco</i>) and admitted longshots John Travolta (<a href="rlovely.html" target="_top"><i>She's
So Lovely</i></a>), Kevin Kline (<a href="rinout.html" target="_top"><i>In &amp; Out</i></a>), Ralph
Fiennes (<a href="roscar.html" target="_top"><i>Oscar &amp; Lucinda</i></a>) and Sylvester Stallone (Cop
&amp;... ah, <a href="rcopland.html" target="_top"><i>Cop Land</i></a>).</p>

<p>In a year universally acknowledged as being very thin on strong leading female
characters &#150; much less performances &#150; <img src="images/fsiff97-10.gif" alt="Mrs. Brown" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="159">Brittania ruled the waves as <i>Titanic's</i>
Kate Winslet (she of the terrific American accent and other assets) joined Dame Judi Dench
(for <a href="fsiff97-3.html#Mrs_Brown" target="_top"><i>Mrs. Brown</i></a>, not her steely M in <a href="rtomorrow.html" target="_top"><i>Tomorrow Never Dies</i></a>), Helena Bonham-Carter (<i>The Wings
of the Dove</i>) and Julie Christie (<i>Afterglow</i>) in dominating the category. Only
Helen Hunt carries the American flag for <i>As Good As It Gets</i>. Christie's road to the
category is particularly interesting, as few people have seen the film to date and she
hasn't won since <i>Darling</i> way back in 1965 (she did <i>Dr. Zhivago</i> the same
year). She's only been nominated once since, for <i>Afterglow</i> director Alan Rudolph
mentor Robert Altman's <i>McCabe and Mrs. Miller</i> in 1971. Actresses who might've been
nominated include Sigourney Weaver for <i>The Ice Storm</i> (or <a href="ralien.html" target="_top"><i>Alien
Resurrection</i></a>, for that matter), Jodie Foster (<a href="rcontact.html" target="_top"><i>Contact</i></a>),
Pam Grier (<i>Jackie Brown</i>), Julia Roberts (<a href="rbfwedding.html" target="_top"><i>My Best
Friend's Wedding</i></a>), Jessica Lange <i>(A Thousand Acres</i>) or Robin Wright Penn (<i>She's
So Lovely</i>).</p>

<p>And speaking of directors, in addition to Cameron the rookie field includes Curtis
Hanson for <i>L.A. Confidential</i>, Gus Van Sant for <i>Good Will Hunting</i>, Peter
Cattaneo for <i>The Full Monty</i> and, in a pleasant left-field surprise, Atom Egoyan for
the critically lauded but little seen <i>The Sweet Hereafter</i>. This, of course, raises
the yearly question of how Nicholson, for instance, or Christie could give Oscar-caliber
performances without Oscar-caliber direction (by James L. Brooks and Rudolph,
respectively), but never mind: this just points up the popularity contest element that has
virtually engulfed the awards. On an interesting tangential note, Spike Lee's most recent
film, <i>4 Little Girls</i>, is one of the five nominees for Best Documentary Feature.</p>

<p><img src="images/rboogie-1.jpg" width="131" height="125" alt="Boogie Nights" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4">Burt Reynolds is the most satisfying story in the Best
Supporting Actor category, as his nomination for <i>Boogie Nights</i> echoes most critics'
groups and provides him with his highest profile Oscar attention since <i>Deliverance</i>
in 1972. Also nominated were Robin Williams for <i>Good Will Hunting</i>, another comeback
kid, Robert Forster, for his sublime deadpan performance in Quentin Tarantino's <i>Jackie
Brown</i>, Anthony Hopkins for playing yet another president in <i>Amistad</i>, and,
perhaps most surprising, Greg Kinnear for his appealing turn in <i>As Good As It Gets</i>.</p>

<p>In addition to the 87-year-old Stuart's Supporting Actress nod for <i>Titanic</i>
(she's the oldest nominee by a good bit; be sure and see her genre classic <i>The Old Dark
House</i> on tape), other nominees include Joan Cusack for her comic turn in <i>In &amp;
Out</i>, Kim Basinger's Veronica Lake twist in <i>L.A. Confidential</i>, Minnie Driver in <i>Good
Will Hunting</i> and Julianne Moore's fearless performance in <i>Boogie Nights</i>.</p>

<p>Among the writers, the big news is that Woody Allen, with his 13th Original Screenplay
nod )for the self-indulgent but profoundly unique <i>Deconstructing Harry</i>), passes
Billy Wilder as the record holder for nominations in this category. Other original scripts
to make the cut include Paul Thomas Anderson's <i>Boogie Nights</i>, the Mark Andrus-James
Brooks collaboration <i>As Good As It Gets</i>, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck's moving <i>Good
Will Hunting</i>, and Simon Beaufoy's <i>The Full Monty</i>.</p>

<p><img src="images/rlacon-5.jpg" width="66" height="100" alt="L.A. Confidential" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4">Adapted Screenplay nominees are former Washington
Post film critic Paul Attanasio for <i>Donnie Brasco</i> (he also wrote Quiz Show and the
upcoming Sphere), Brian Helgeland and Curtis Hanson for <i>L.A. Confidential</i>
(Helgeland also adapted <i>The Postman</i> &#150; maybe two guys have that name?), Atom
Egoyan for <i>The Sweet Hereafter</i>, Hilary Henkin and David Mamet for <i>Wag the Dog</i>,
and Hossein Amini for <i>The Wings of the Dove</i>. Unheralded here are James Schamus for <i>The
Ice Storm</i> and Quentin Tarantino for <i>Jackie Brown</i>, among others.</p>

<p>All in all, a good year for Oscar and a conspicuous and decisive turn from independent
fare to more mainstream and big-budget event movies. The Oscars will be handed out from
Los Angeles' Shrine Auditorium 23 March.</p>
