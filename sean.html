<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I was born in 1963 and spent my early years in Oregon, my formative grade school
years in Victoria, British Columbia, high school in Hawaii, and back to Oregon for
college. My serious movie watching began with STAR WARS (no sniggering back there!), where
my love of all things science fiction kicked my burgeoning interest in movies into a
mania. Goodbye sci-fi, hello silver screen. After numerous educational tryouts I settled
into the University of Oregon in the Telecommunications and Film program. Silly me, I
spent more time watching them than making them &#150; and still do.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">My writing career (I define the term rather loosely) started in high school, where
my interests in theater and cinema prompted me to produce a mimeographed newsletter, read
by all of five people. Undeterred, I wrote for school papers, the radio, spent six years
contributing to the UO campus paper the Oregon Daily Emerald (two more years than I
attended), and have contributed to just about every fledgling publication to rear its
newsprint in Eugene (contrary to popular opinion, some of those publications are in fact
still around).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After a misspent college stint, where I earned a Masters degree in
Telecommunications and Film with my thesis on the career of Budd Boetticher (who?), I
began my glorious career in video &#150; 7 ½ years at Oregon&#146;s finest video store
Flicks and Pics (6 years as manager and resident movie buff), and 3 years at the legendary
Scarecrow Video (one year as Inventory Manager).</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Currently I reside in Seattle, Washington. In addition to writing for <em>Nitrate
Online</em> and I contribute to <em>Film.com</em> (&quot;On Video,&quot; a weekly guide to
Video, DVD and Laserdisc releases, as well as periodic features) and to the Seattle
Weekly. I&#146;ve contributed essays to local film programs dedicated to John Woo, Wim
Wenders and Orson Welles and program notes to Seattle&#146;s Grand Illusion theater and
I'm currently a member of the Online Film Critics Society.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And now the important stuff:</font>

<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">My favorite director: Howard Hawks</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">My director obsession: Orson Welles</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">My favorite films: choose from <em>The Searchers</em> (John Ford, 1956), <em>Gun
    Crazy</em> (Joseph H. Lewis, 1949), <em>French Can-Can</em> (Jean Renoir, 1955), <em>Touch
    of Evil</em> (Orson Wells, 1958), and a number of Howard Hawks films &#150; Only <em>Angels
    Have Wings</em> (1939), <em>Red River</em> (1948), <em>The Thing From Another World</em>
    (1951), <em>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</em> (1953), <em>Rio Bravo</em> (1959), and the
    vastly under-appreciated <em>Hatari! </em>(1962)</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Favorite performer: Burt Lancaster and his million dollar smile</font></li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">When I&#146;m not watching movies: I&#146;m usually writing or asleep.</font></li>
