<p><big><strong><big>S</big></strong>ix strangers wake up in what appears to be an
interlocking set of huge, hollowed out Rubik&#146;s cubes. They don&#146;t know how they
got there or why they&#146;ve been chosen but they want out. I don&#146;t blame them. Ten
minutes into this film and I wanted out too. Director Vincenzo Natali and co-screenwriters
Andre Bijelic and Graeme Manson have designed a live action puzzle come morality tale,
along the lines of a Rod Serling scripted &quot;Twilight Zone&quot; episode. But
they&#146;ve forgotten that the key to Serling&#146;s dramas isn&#146;t found in the
situation or the plot -- no matter how ingenious -- but the characters-imbedded ironies.
Serling made you care for his characters, identify with them, feel their pain. Natali and
friends have populated their antiseptic world with characters displaying all the dimension
of a video game figure. Who cares if they die? It&#146;s just another blip gone from the
screen.</big></p>

<p><img src="images/rcube-1.gif" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="150">The pre-credits scene
promises something fun, if not exactly unique. A gangly bald man in military-like olive
drab fatigues steps into a faintly glowing room, about 14 feet cubed, walls and ceiling
exactly alike. The door is found halfway up the wall. He gingerly steps onto the floor and
across to the other door when a slight crack of a sound freezes him in his tracks,
followed by a deafening whoosh. Suddenly blood rises from his skin in the pattern of a
grill and slowly, slurpily he begins to fall apart -- literally. He&#146;s been sliced and
diced like a french fry. He&#146;s been (dare I say it?) cubed. </p>

<p>The plot is simple: the six characters got to think their way through this
booby-trapped contraption before they die of thirst. As they take stock of their situation
they realize they&#146;ve been chosen according to their attributes: on of them is a
doctor, one a cop, one an escape artist, one a math whiz, and so on. Each room is marked
by a set of numbers, and those sets of numbers are the key to everything in this
monumental puzzle. They&#146;ve got the intellectual tools to solve the puzzle and steer
clear of the booby traps, but like a sadistic prank played by a malevolent God in his
imperfect minions, personality conflicts and power games sow the seeds of their own defeat
from within.</p>

<p><img src="images/rcube-2.gif" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="100">We might actually
care if there were a couple of characters in the bunch but they come off as little more
than types. The math whiz (Nicole de Boer), for instance, begins as a hysteric paralyzed
by fear and for no discernible reason turns into a pissy, pampered college girl
(&quot;Hello! Are we ready yet?!), but never suggests she has any kind of a life or a
personality outside of her role in the group. The rest of the characters play their parts
with such histrionics it plays more like a spoof: hushed tones followed by furtive glances
around, angry outbursts that escalate into pitched shouting matches in seconds flat, and
every ellipsis on the screenplay turned into a mysterious pause. It feels like amateur
night at the community center.</p>

<p>Natali, a former storyboard artist, has designed CUBE to deliver the most for his
production dollars. For all intents and purposes the entire film takes place in one mildly
claustrophobic set, a completely enclosed room measuring about 15 feet in each direction
with a single door in the center of each surface. Change the color and voila, a new room.
Natali put everything into that one set and it&#146;s a quite striking, with alien looking
etchings over each of the eight squares that surround the center door, itself a neat
little pneumatic device that opens with an expectant rush of air. Unfortunately his
brilliant budgetary talents are unmatched by any dramatic elements. He gets so caught up
in the puzzle he forgets to turn his plot into a story. This high concept science fiction
film hasn&#146;t been directed so much as designed and plotted, and with no characters to
follow and a puzzle so complicated it takes a rocket scientist to figure it, there&#146;s
simply nothing left to hold any interest. Best stay home and play the computer game
version.</p>
