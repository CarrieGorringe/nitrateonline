<h1 align="center">Welcome to Seattle</h1>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p><font size="5"><strong>T</strong></font><font size="4">he first impression to be had
from Seattle, once you stop staring in amazement at the mountain ranges that flank it on
both sides (the Olympic to the west and the Cascade to the east) is the architectural
diversity of the neighborhoods. Whether due to the various economic oscillations that have
buffeted Seattle over the past century, the presence of a strong artistic community, or
the make-do mentality that such intersections tend to inspire, every area of the city has
an impromptu feeling about it. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The boutiques of young clothing designers and their coffee shops have
sprung up all over the city, often in stand-alone buildings which are the only game on
their block. The effect is not unlike an economic form of what Levi-Strauss defined as <i>bricolage</i>,
or, the art of spontaneous creation from found objects. These businesses have almost
single-handedly transformed previously undesirable locations like Belltown into areas that
are <i>de rigeur </i>for the socially informed and the wannabes, along with the rising
rents that will, sadly but eventually, push the pioneers out. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The concept of creating from what has been found also applies to the
Seattle film community. Leave the glittering skyscrapers that have altered the downtown
landscape so very recently, with their multiplex Odeons, and head east, young man or
woman, to climb several cliffs that masquerade as hills on Pike Street. While passing the
intersection of Boren and Pike, mourn the passing of the ultimate in <i>bricolage </i>cinema,
the Pike Street Cinema (with seats that afforded the lumbar support of slate tiles, but
which offered a most unique repertoire of films, from old television commercials to Bugs
Bunny classics that could no longer pass the requirements of political correctness). </font></p>

<p><font size="3">After the wake, and a refueling at various latte shops along the
journey, you will soon find yourself in the environs of Capitol Hill. Not to be confused
with that other place in that other Washington, this Capitol Hill is a place where much
more interesting things usually happen and usually get done. <img src="images/fsiff-egyptian.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="383" HEIGHT="288"> For one thing, it is
no exaggeration to say that Cap Hill is open all night; the streets are lined with funky
boutiques, body piercing shops and at least three of the best dessert shops in the city
(much to my eternal guilt). On the edge of Cap Hill, at 801 East Pine Street, is a Masonic
Temple (pictured) that has been converted into another form of temple known most of the
year as the Egyptian Theatre (another of the festival sites, the Harvard Exit, also
started out in another guise, as the theatre for a women's club). Between the middle of
May and June each year, the Egyptian manifests another side to its personality, as it is
the home base for the Seattle International Film Festival (SIFF). </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Founded in 1975 by Darryl McDonald and Dan Ireland, SIFF has the honor
of being the most highly attended film festival in the United States (selling more than
100,000 tickets to over 270 films during its 25 day run). SIFF actually violates
international standards setting the maximum length of a festival at seventeen days, so for
years it was denied official recognition. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Aside from its size and its duration, SIFF is unique in another respect:
it is a people's festival. Although many industry figures consider SIFF to be a necessary
drop-in venue, the festival is driven purely by the love of cinema. Designer clothes, and
the attitudes that tend to accompany them, are in sparse supply here; T-shirts, shorts and
Tevas/Birkenstocks prevail. After all, comfort is an important consideration when the
outside wait in line is approximately one hour or longer, in any number of weather
conditions (Seattle is notorious for days that begin with sun and end with rain, vice
versa, or just begin and end with rain) and the internal temperature of the Egyptian
Theatre reaches its maximum after the first nightly screening, with two more screenings at
full capacity to go (however, this rather sweaty situation might be a thing of the past,
since air conditioning was reportedly installed last week). </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The film selections themselves are exemplary, as one might expect from
an organization whose mission statement promises &quot;to provide unique opportunities for
the advancement and recognition of cinema as an art form&quot;. The battle on this front
may have been won long ago, but Darryl and his staff continue to program the festival as
if cinema had something to prove, which is another way of saying that their hunger for
locating the best, the revered, the unique and the downright perverse has never abated.
Each year, the showcases never fail to amaze with their breadth and depth of material. A
special focus at SIFF this year is a series devoted to the films of Great Britain,
including Danny Boyle's <em>Trainspotting</em> and a series called Best of the British
Shorts, among them <em>Hello, Hello, Hello</em> by David Thewlis. </font></p>

<p><font size="4"><img src="images/fsiff96-1.gif" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="185" HEIGHT="149"></font><font size="3">The somewhat egalitarian approach to selecting and showcasing films, combined
with Seattle's reputation as a film town of no little discrimination, and Darryl's
tremendous contacts within the industry, has resulted in some considerable coups for SIFF.
Last year's gala film <em>Braveheart</em> also had its North American première in
Seattle. Gus Van Sant's <a href="rtodiefor.html" target="_top"><em>To Die For</em></a> came straight
from Cannes to have its second screening at SIFF, months before its U.S. debut. Continuing
in this tradition, one of two films that will close the festival this year, Robert
Altman's <a href="fsiff96-5.html#Kansas-City" target="_top"><em>Kansas City</em></a>, is also coming
straight from Cannes. Among those films having their World and/or U.S. Premières at
Seattle include John Turteltaub's <a href="rphenom.html" target="_top"><em>Phenomenon</em></a> starring
John Travolta, <em>All Things Fair</em> directed by Bo Wiederberg, Danny Boyle's <em>Trainspotting</em>
and Gilles Mackinnon's <em>Small Faces</em>. </font></p>

<p><a href="http://www.eads.com/ads/pageserv.pl?gnrl0102.cfg,CJ00075" name="The-Whole-Wide-World" target="_top"></a><font size="3">Another première more near and dear to the
heart of SIFF is the return of Festival co-founder Dan Ireland. His debut film, <em>The
Whole Wide World</em>, opened the Festival on May 16th. After a career producing other
people's films (among them John Huston's final film, <em>The Dead</em>), Ireland has taken
the opportunity to demonstrate his own story-telling skills in this charming slice-of-life
story. <em>World</em> is based upon the memoirs of schoolteacher Novalyne Price Ellis who
provides an account of her intense relationship with Robert E. Howard (better known as the
creator of Conan the Barbarian) in the wilds of 1930s Texas. Not what you'd expect, this
bittersweet relationship is a meeting of like minds, not of bodies, but Ireland's film,
despite some passages that are slightly too prolonged, is always compelling. </font></p>

<p><a href="http://www.london-calling.co.uk/fsiffumb.html" target="_top"><font size="4"><img src="images/fsiff96-2.gif" align="right" border="0" hspace="10" vspace="4" WIDTH="128" HEIGHT="186"></font></a><font size="3">Other special features this year include an expanded archival section in tribute
to the late film scholar and archivist William K. Everson, who died in mid-April. Among
the rarely-seen treasures to emerge from cinema's past will be Wanda Jakubonska's <em>The
Last Stop</em>, a masterful evocation of the lives of female inmates in
Auschwitz-Birkenau, filmed on location in 1947, and featuring many who survived the
atrocities committed there. A new print of Dziga Vertov's silent masterpiece, <em>The Man
With a Movie Camera</em> features a musical score, one which was composed by Vertov and
recently rediscovered after having been thought lost for decades. And, of course, the
series would not be complete without a screening of Jacques Demy's nearly-lost and
newly-restored 1964 musical, <em>The Umbrellas of Cherbourg</em>, featuring a
twenty-year-old Catherine Deneuve in her film debut. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">As usual, SIFF also offers up its infamous Secret Festival, a
smorgasbord consisting of films fresh from the lab, relatively unknown classics and the
occasional film whose legal troubles have prevented it from getting a fair and recent
hearing. Unfortunately, there's not much more to tell, since everyone with a SF pass must
sign an oath of secrecy (Not even the members of the fifth estate are given that
information; at the opening press conference Darryl intimated, only half-jokingly, that he
could tell us what was on the SF program, but then he would have to kill us). The SF is
usually the first program to sell out within the first day of sales to the general public,
and this year was no exception. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Industry figures who are expected to attend this year's festival include
Robert Altman, Danny Boyle, Jim Jarmusch, screenwriter Randall Wallace (fresh from <em>Braveheart</em>),
Todd Solondz (complete with his acclaimed film from Sundance, <a href="fsiff96-5.html#Welcome-to-the-Dollhouse" target="_top"><em>Welcome to the Dollhouse</em></a>), and
Mary Harron (yet another Sundance honoree with <a href="fsiff96-4.html#I-Shot-Andy-Warhol" target="_top"><em>I
Shot Andy Warhol</em></a>). In addition, an entire weekend will be dedicated to the
Filmmakers' Forum, a series of panel sessions on the nuts and bolts and dollars and cents
and fine print of filmmaking. You might call it a dose of reality in the midst of fantasy.
</font></p>

<p><font size="3">Well, here's to twenty-five days of continuous and unabashed film going,
bad meals eaten on the run and too many late-night screenings, all of which culminate in
the annual Film Festival Cold. I wouldn't miss it for anything. </font></p>
