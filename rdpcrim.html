<p></font><font size="4"><font face="Times New Roman">The tale of two criminal lovers
fleeing the law is by now so familiar that it seems, like, certain folk songs, to have
always been with us. It hasn't, of course. It's an almost pure 20th century distillate of
pop romance, not too too far from those Lichtenstein paintings that look like
hyper-magnified cartoons in which the tearful girl begs Brad (off-frame) for something
unsayable that is at once stormy and monotonous and rapturous and sexual and dark and
completely bone-headed. Films like Gun Crazy and Compulsion and later Bonnie and Clyde and
Badlands and now Kiss or Kill are kind of permutations of that sugary bubble of pseudo
apocalypse. Set that plea to a crime story and lay down a beatnik tom-tom &#150; and
voila. You have true, because utterly self-deluded, crime. In the interstices of these
films' stories about soap-cleaned James Deans and their girls who live on cigarettes and
produce corpses for a living the films come close to recommending the murder sprees as a
new jazzy form of fooling with the middle classes. First, smoke reefer. Second, kill.</font></p>

<p></font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">There's more, of course. The romance thrum
can slip down a crack in the national psyche. <em>Badlands</em> is masterful in part
because Sissy Spacek's awed, bored heroic voiceovers make a world where dumb romance can
recombines with a hundred impulses and cravings swirling around ideas about fate and
self-determination. </font><font size="4"></p>
</font><font size="3">

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Crime to you and me is something to walk to the other side
of the street to avoid. In good movies about crime it's a nearly unfathomable fascination.
In Arturo Ripstein's disturbing, gauzily photographed new version of the &quot;Lonely
Hearts&quot; murders of the 1940s the story of an overweight nurse and her Latin lover who
pose as brother and sister in order to seduce emotionally vulnerable women is
spellbindingly re-imagined. It's also emotionally harrowing, but that, in a sense, will be
part of the pleasure anyone going to the film will be going for. For some reason
unfathomable crime seems like a form of philosophical encounter. I can imagine
Wittgenstein, lover of pork pies and cowboy movies that he was, finding the meaningless
meaning of true crime utterly gripping.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">It is. <em>Deep Crimson</em>'s story is a true one and it
made headlines a half-century ago. In 1969, Leonard Kastle first adapted it as the now
notorious, Z-budget cult film, <em>The Honeymoon Killers</em>. Ripstein follows Kastle's
basic story outline, but with interpretive variations. And he transfigures it from
Kastle's exploitative world to something that feels like a much larger probe. The story is
set now in dusty Mexican hamlets and it unfolds with the daze of all hot days and
melodrama. Despite the patches of ugliness in the film <em>Deep Crimson</em> is defined by
its glimpses into the insides of the two killer lovers, not by how much blood they
produce. That gives <em>Deep Crimson</em> <em>Badlands</em> kind of ambitions: it becomes
a sepia-tinted fable about the way a murderous streak emerges from a stew of movie
fantasy, popular romance, sexual greed and narcissism. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The outsize nurse this time is a hangy-lipped woman named
Coral (Regina Orozco) whose breath is sour and whose uniform is as unkempt and
blood-smeared as a butcher's apron. Self-absorbed and addicted to over-baked romance,
Coral prepares for work by lipsticking the initials of the matinee idol Charles Boyer on
her breasts. At work she slips the hand of an elderly man in her care down her uniform.
It's her own magic alphabet and she wants the old man to lay his hands on it and heal the
way she believes it's healed her. Or that's one possible reason. (Another is an impossible
labyrinthine route that Coral travels to believe that a wheelchair-bound man is
transformed into Charles Boyer). In the evening, Coral shoos away her children, plunks
down on her couch and makes herself over again, writing &quot;missives&quot; to her
&quot;Lonely Hearts&quot; friend, Nicolas Estrella (Daniel Gimenez Cacho). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Nicolas is a pathological grifter who seduces women by
believing his own lies &#150; and with the aid of a hair piece and an affected Castillian
Spanish he manages to feed his own rank Don Juan ambitions and earn his living. After
seducing the women he steals their money. But it is Coral who turns out to have the killer
instinct. On meeting Nicolas she falls, much more than he does, into what the director
calls a &quot;mad love,&quot; though that expression hardly describes the tawdry glue of
sentiment and criminal self-absorption that comes to bind Coral to Nicholas (and he,
eventually, to her).</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Orozco and Cacho play their characters from far inside
them, and much of the film's hypnotic effect comes as a direct result of the way they
evoke their characters' malcontent impulsiveness. But as compelling as these two are, the
story is made to furnish no direct answers about the nature of their crimes. Coral and
Nicolas live inside an aura of indecipherability, and it is this condition that
differentiates True Crime from fictional movies about serial crime like <em>The Silence of
the Lambs</em>. The film is not without evidence, but what meaning Ripstein finds in the
story is underground. Indeed, the story is his opportunity to dredge the soft bottom of
human affairs where erotic attachment and homicidal impulses are co-eval. The closest we
come to an answer about this true crime is Nicolas's swollen romantic outburst near the
end: &quot;We are accomplices,&quot; he tells Coral, &quot;and nothing can tear us
apart.&quot; That's awfully good. And telling. What teenager since the 1940s has not drawn
imaginative breath on that same line?</font></font></p>
