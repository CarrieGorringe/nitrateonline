<p><big><strong><big>A</big></strong> generation after Dan Aykroyd and Steve Martin
created the comically carnal Festrunk brothers, those wild and crazy Czechoslovakian guys
whose swingin' bachelor pad was the scene of their fruitless attempts to pick up women
(remember the silly hats and fractured hipster gait?), the concept -- if not the execution
-- of that gag has been recycled by current &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; players Will
Ferrell (the demented cheerleading guy) and Chris Kattan (the swallow-your-tongue funny
Keri Strug imitation), who originally created the duo while members of the Groundlings
comedy troupe. Moving the act from New York to Beverly Hills, toning down the implied coke
snorting (they still rub their noses a lot, though) and adding just enough bizarrely
interesting bits of business to fill out 83 minutes (OK, so the window-breaking gag from
the trailer is shown twice), <i>A Night at the Roxbury</i> is, like its subjects, an
absurdly funny, relentlessly cheerful premise that overstays its welcome by half.</big></p>

<p><img src="images/rroxbury-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="149">By day, Steve
(Ferrell) and Doug (Kattan) Butabi work in retail at the southern California fake flower
shop of their father Kamehl (Dan Hedaya), who is such a successful businessman that he can
afford a hideous Beverly Hills mansion (where the boys share a cheesily decorated room), a
surgically altered trophy wife (Loni Anderson) and twin Irish setters named
&quot;Captain&quot; and &quot;Tennille.&quot; By night, Steve and Doug cruise the
nightclubs on the Sunset Strip, intent upon meeting and bedding women. Despite their
never-say-die optimism, they lack any social graces whatsoever, prompting one victim of
their spastic, aggressive dance moves to call them &quot;ugly, pathetic losers&quot; to
their faces.</p>

<p>The boys dream of opening their own club, and to that end leverage a chance meeting
with former &quot;21 Jump Street&quot; star Richard Grieco -- looking at least as embalmed
as Rob Lowe did in his <i>Wayne's World</i> turn, suggesting that it might be on purpose
(but in this case probably isn't) -- to infiltrate the legendary Roxbury club and suck up
to the jovial, goateed owner (an uncredited Chazz Palminteri, whose ongoing gag involves
accusing everyone in sight of &quot;grabbing my ass&quot;).</p>

<p>Vixenish golddiggers Cambi (Elisa Donovan) and Viveca (Gigi Rice) mistake them for high
rollers and provide what turns out to be their first sexual experiences, after which Steve
is pressured into marrying the daughter of his father's future business partner (Molly
Shannon, looking as sexy/scary as ever). Will Steve's upcoming nuptials destroy the
strangely close bond with his sulking brother (who moves to the guest house across from
the pool and disconsolately scarfs whipped cream straight from the can)? Will Richard
Grieco get sued? Will Doug find comfort in the arms of the Credit Vixen (Meredith Scott
Lynn)? And what about their trainer, Doug (wild-eyed Lochlyn Munro, the only funny thing
about <i>Dead Man On Campus</i>)?</p>

<p><img src="images/rroxbury-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="149">The film was
apparently in trouble early in production, as veteran TV director Peter Markle (&quot;The
X-Files,&quot; &quot;Homicide: Life on the Street,&quot; &quot;Millennium&quot;) was
replaced after two weeks by John Fortenberry , who helmed that great Julie Brown Madonna
spoof &quot;Medusa: Dare to Be Truthful.&quot; <i>A Night at the Roxbury</i> has the same
feel as that cable classic, drawing laughs not from pratfalls and physical humor as much
from the deadpan way in which the non sequitir-heavy material (&quot;you're mad cowing on
me!&quot;) is delivered (the script was reportedly doctored with uncredited contributions
from Jim Carrey, the <i>Look Who's Talking</i> franchise's Amy Heckerling and <i>The Usual
Suspects</i> scribe Christopher McQuarrie). That kind of comedy is a risky business, as it
can quite often come off as listless and uninspired (precisely the way most critics are
reading the film). Yet the next SNL spinoff, <i>Superstar</i>, which features Shannon's
Mary Catherine Gallagher character, also co-stars Will Ferrell and is also written by
&quot;Seinfeld&quot; alum Steve Koren -- suggesting that the troupe might be on to
something more substantial than the first reviews of <i>A Night at the Roxbury</i> would
indicate (this theory is bolstered by the submerged subplot that finds the boys
confronting their Yemenite background, a provocative subject that is dropped like a hot
potato after a couple of dinner table jokes).</p>

<p>Elsewhere, the film delivers minor pleasures, from the inspired casting of TV's
original Dobie Gillis, Dwayne Hickman, as Shannon's sunny dad to the insistent use of the
Haddaway dance &quot;classic&quot; &quot;Is This Love?&quot; (the soundtrack also manages
to find room for Bruce Springsteen's &quot;Secret Garden,&quot; the 1970s chestnut
&quot;Brandy (You're a Fine Girl)&quot; and the theme from &quot;Cheers&quot;). There are
also strong jabs at materialism (Shannon screams &quot;Ikea!&quot; at a pivotal intimate
moment), sentimentality and classic movie sequences -- including pointed spoofs of <i>Saturday
Night Fever</i>, <i>The Graduate</i>, <i>Say Anything...</i> and <a href="rjmaguire.html" target="_top"><i>Jerry
Maguire</i></a>.</p>

<p><img src="images/rroxbury-3.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="149">The print caught
was dark and fuzzy, although the previous work of busy cinematographer Francis Kenny
(whose credits include <i>Bean</i>, the SNL spinoffs <i>Wayne's World 2</i> and <i>Coneheads</i>,
as well as two projects for the legendary Nicolas Roeg, the 1989 TV remake of Tennessee
Williams' &quot;Sweet Bird of Youth&quot; and the barely-released theatrical thriller <i>Cold
Heaven</i>) suggests that might've been the venue and not the print itself. The production
design of Steven J. Jordan is particularly atmospheric, capturing the flavor of the milieu
with the same detail and wit he brought to the misunderstood <a href="rbaseket.html" target="_top"><i>BASEketball</i></a>,
<i>The Brady Bunch Movie</i> and <i>Clueless</i> (which shares the same garish Beverly
Hills sensibility, as well as Hedaya as the doofus dad). </p>

<p>As ephemeral as the club itself (which is now a Japanese restaurant), <i>A Night at the
Roxbury</i> will almost certainly join that growing list of pleasant but wispy comedies --
<i>So I Married an Ax Murderer</i> comes to mind, somewhere between the genuinely
subversive <i>Stuart Saves His Family</i> and the surreal yet impenetrable hijinks of <i>It's
Pat</i> -- destined to score as a video rental and cable perennial. Come to think of it,
had this agreeably stupid spoof started there and been shorn of an hour, maybe it'd be
getting positive blurbs in the TV Guide ads. </p>
