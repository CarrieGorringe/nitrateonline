<p><big><strong><big>T</big></strong>here's nothing in the press material accompanying the
ironically titled <i>Another Day in Paradise</i> explaining &quot;Chinese Bookie
Pictures,&quot; the presentation entity that gets top billing on the film print, but given
the collaborative, improvisational nature and thrift store chic/outlaw milieu of the work,
it's a safe bet that the co-producing alliance of co-screenwriter Stephen Chin (who
produced <i>Kids</i> writer Harmony Korine's directorial debut, <i>Gummo</i>),
photographer-turned-director Larry Clark (<i>Kids</i>) and actor James Woods were
substantially inspired by <i>The Killing of a Chinese Bookie</i> (1976) as well as the
cinema verite aesthetic of its creator, legendary independent filmmaker John Cassavetes.
And sure enough, like that fiery pioneer's most uncompromising -- and, to some,
off-putting -- work, <i>Another Day in Paradise</i> is an often exasperating, certainly
brutal and undeniably energetic look at a rural brand of thug life that is highly stylized
precisely by virtue of its concentrated aversion to stylization.</big></p>

<p>In an American midwest of no defined time or place, young Bobbie (Vincent Kartheiser)
leaves his lover Rosie (Natasha Gregson Wagner) to make money the only way he seems to
know how, cracking open some vending machines. Brutally beaten by a security guard with an
unusual and tragic zeal for his work, Bobbie is nursed back to health in part by drugs
furnished by his &quot;Uncle&quot; Mel (Woods). Seeing an opportunity to pass on the
wisdom acquired during a life of crime, Mel enlists the boy and his girlfriend to join him
and his squeeze, Sid (Griffith), as they embark on a series of cross-country capers. Their
freewheeling life of crime comes to a violent head during a confrontation with effeminate
tough Jules (an uncredited Lou Diamond Phillips), after which the surrogate family
inevitably fragments. </p>

<p>Woods tackles the role with unrestrained glee, punctuating his gunplay and drug use
with giddy shouts of &quot;boo-yah!&quot; and &quot;badabing&quot; to verbalize his
nervous energy. Audiences may be struck yet again that the same actor who brings such a
low-key intensity to mainstream work (he's won two Emmys and a Golden Globe) is able to
keep a cork on the volcanic emotions on display here (and in the snarling, outspoken and
shiny-eyed interviews he's given to the mainstream electronic press on the eve of the
movie's release on a single Los Angeles screen). One of the small but durable band of
charismatic and eternally dissolute malcontents that keep popular culture honest (think
Tom Waits), Woods may be America's John Hurt -- except he seems to be in about four times
as many films and TV shows.</p>
<i>

<p>Another Day in Paradise</i> reunites Woods with Melanie Griffith, who made her
big-screen debut as a conniving nymphet to his punk mechanic alongside Gene Hackman in
Arthur Penn's sublime 1975 noir <i>Night Moves</i> (a little-seen but key film of that
decade). As Mel's addicted girlfriend Sid, Griffith brings what shreds of moral
consciousness surface during the saga, balancing some saving gunplay with a heartfelt plea
to Rosie about her burgeoning addiction (the actress has called the movie
&quot;anti-drug&quot; in at least one television interview). The movie offers her a clever
opportunity to mold the sex kitten persona she's been saddled with into something new, and
she turns in the best work she's done in a film since her stunning turn nearly five years
ago in Robert Benton's <i>Nobody's Fool</i>.</p>

<p>Kartheiser and Gregson Wagner are more problematical in both character and performance,
as their parts require them to act both naive and grown-up in response to the almost
childish posturing of Mel and Sid. He's the more successful of the two, shedding the
mainstream wholesomeness displayed in <i>Alaska</i> (1996) and <i>Masterminds</i> (1998)
in favor of the rootless restlessness mixed with inarticulate yearning that is the heart
of this type of material. Gregson Wagner, the daughter of Natalie Wood, has the movie's
most mysterious and thankless role, and she brings to it the same vapid glaze utilized in <a href="r2girls.html" target="_top"><i>Two Girls and a Guy</i></a>, <i>First Love, Last Rites</i>, <i>Urban
Legend</i>, and that bastion of vapidity, &quot;Ally McBeal.&quot; Perhaps she can act;
her next step might be a project in which she's given the chance. Together, they're
fetishized to the point of discomfort with greasy hair, sunken eyes and general dirtiness
often seeming more a fantasy of the filmmakers (&quot;how old are you?&quot; Mel asks
Bobbie in a seemingly pointed reference to it) than an authentic expression of the realism
sought by the movie.</p>

<p>The authentically grungy supporting players are rounded out by Phillips' bravura turn
as the slimy Jules, Brent Briscoe from <i>A<a href="rsplan.html" target="_top"> Simple Plan</a></i> as a
racist cracker involved in one drug deal and James Otis as a wild-eyed, pockmarked man of
the cloth who moonlights as a gun dealer. </p>

<p>Much of the film's look comes from Clark's early photographic work, particularly the
1971 book &quot;Tulsa,&quot; which is said to be an inspiration for, among other movies,
Martin Scorsese's <a href="ftaxi.html" target="_top"><i>Taxi Driver</i></a> and Gus Van Sant's <i>Drugstore
Cowboy</i> (with which it shares quite a bit, including the cinematographer, Eric
Edwards). And if <i>Another Day in Paradise</i> feels more focused and confident than the
distasteful and overhyped <i>Kids</i>, chalk that up to the <i>Bonnie and Clyde</i>
elements of the story, the deliberate fuzziness of time and place, and the logical
resolution of the sorry-assed crime spree.</p>

<p>The atmosphere is enhanced greatly by a superb rhythm and blues soundtrack that
features a flurry of period songs by Otis Redding, Allen Toussaint, Willie Dixon, Sam
Moore and Percy Sledge, supplemented by a new tune from Chocolate Genius and others -- and
even two songs by Bob Dylan (&quot;One More Cup of Coffee&quot; and &quot;Every Grain of
Sand,&quot; the latter providing a fine underscore to the movie's coda). As an added
bonus, there's a brief but exciting cameo performance by non other than Clarence Carter,
who burns the roadhouse down as the entertainment in a drunken club scene early in the
picture. </p>

<p>As staggeringly profane and exuberantly outspoken as the star it showcases, <i>Another
Day in Paradise</i>, not surprisingly, often comes across and puerile and petulant -- like
Cassavetes' often ugly excursions into the darker regions of human impulse, it dares us to
care about these marginalized losers. Yet moviegoers who embrace Cassavetes' work, admire
the intensity of Sean Penn and think that such recent movies as <i>The Indian Runner</i>, <i>The
Crossing Guard</i> and <i>She's So Lovely</i> are neglected contemporary masterpieces will
find much to like in the skanky verisimilitude of <i>Another Day in Paradise</i>. The
pursuit of brutal truths isn't a pretty journey, and in both story and execution the film
offers no solace for those unwilling to take the hard ride. </p>
