<p><font size="5"><strong>W</strong></font><font size="4">hen the crew of the Starship
Enterprise was last encountered -- in the truly mediocre 1995 film, <i>Star Trek:
Generations</i> -- there were many problems to overcome. Aside from the usual assortment
of villains, the crew of <i>TNG</i> also had to defeat an anemic script --they didn&#146;t
win that battle -- and the overpowering ghost of the 1960s television series. It
didn&#146;t help matters much when William Shatner kept prowling around with an
embarrassingly exhausted sense of irony surrounding him like an aura, which was manifested
in a tongue stuck so firmly in cheek that it could be seen to be waggling mischievously
from every vantage point. In a cinematic franchise, the last high point of which could,
arguably, be said to date from 1982, and one not unfamiliar with low points, <i>Generations</i>
was the absolute nadir. The film was hardly an auspicious debut for Stewart et al. <i>Star
Trek</i> was in danger of becoming <i>Star Dreck</i>, and the vultures, understandably
enough, began circling for blood as the release date of <i>First Contact</i> drew closer,
especially when it became known that this was going to be another case of an actor with
limited directorial experience (Frakes had directed approximately twenty hours of <i>TNG</i>
episodes) stepping up to the camera; after all, there was no danger of anyone adding
Shatner or Nimoy to the list of cinematic auteurs, so, under the circumstances,
Frakes&#146;s willingness to direct<i> First Contact </i>must have seemed like an act of
certain career self-immolation.</font></p>

<p>Well, the vultures will have to find other prey, because <i>First Contact</i> has all
of the elements that were in short supply in its predecessor : charm and intelligence
among them. The plot is vintage <i>Star Trek</i> : you have your evil, parasitical aliens
(in this case, the Borg) who want to alter history in the service of world domination, and
the Enterprise crew has to stop them, while the Captain (in this case, Picard) battles his
own personal demons, most of which are directly related to his prior experiences with the
evil aliens. The whole enterprise (pardon the expression) revolves around a space pioneer
named Cochrane (Cromwell), inventor of the warp drive. Dr. Cochrane, somewhat of a
hippiefied Chuck Yeager, is supposed to make the first contact with alien life forms on
April 4, 2063, and the Borg, through the use of a space vortex, have gone back to prevent
this incident from ever taking place. Unfortunately for the Borg, their time vortex brings
the Enterprise right along in its wake, and Capt. Picard (Stewart) is placed on the
inevitable collision course with his old nemesis, the Borg Queen (Krige). </p>

<p>However, this bare-bones synopsis does not do the film justice, because it is what
Frakes does with the basic elements that sets a higher standard. His camera work is
surprisingly fluid for a first-time film director -- there are a fair number of
elegantly-executed sweeping pans that allow the audience to take in the important details
without lulling anyone to sleep, or in the desperate attempt to fill time when there are
no other on-screen distractions -- and Frakes shows a great deal of sophistication in his
editing style; there are some swish-pan edit matches present here that would try the skill
sets of most experienced directors. Frakes&#146; work is a labor of love, and it shows. He
has also been amply assisted by a marvelously witty screenplay (which manages to muster
its own ironic charm without undermining the credibility of the more dramatic moments),
not to mention a dramatic increase in the special effects budget; one should never
discount the power of visual verisimilitude in making a science-fiction story effective. </p>

<p>It is the acting, however, that makes <i>First Contact</i> shine. Although all of the
cast members have their wonderful moments, the show really belongs to Stewart, Dorn and
Spiner. Allowed to crawl out from under Shatner&#146;s shadow, Stewart is able to
resurrect those emotional nuances and ambiguities that made Picard intriguing in the first
place. Dorn&#146;s portrayal of Worf is as forceful as might be expected, although even he
is permitted his moments of irony, and the idea of a Klingon with an ironic sense of self
is a more difficult task to master than might be initially imagined. When last we saw Mr.
Spiner, he was playing a wigged - -out scientist who was about to offer himself up --
unintentionally, to be sure -- for alien target practice in <a href="rid4.html" target="_top"><i>Independence
Day</i></a>, and handily stole the scene from those around him (and nearly the film). In <i>First
Contact</i>, Spiner&#146;s Data holds his own and then some against Alice Krige&#146;s
quietly cold and thoroughly ruthless Borg Queen. His might have been the strongest
performance, had it not been for the wonderful dippiness of Cromwell&#146;s Cochrane, a
man who invented the warp drive simply because he wanted to retire to a desert island and
chase &quot;naked women.&quot; Civilization, and progress, is apparently built on
psychological middens and accidents, but, if <i>First Contact</i> is an accident, may the
franchise be chronically prone to them for years to come. </p>
