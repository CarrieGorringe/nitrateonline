<p><big><strong><big>C</big></strong>all this &quot;The Tube Not Taken&quot;: busy Gwyneth
Paltrow shines in what amounts to a dual role as British advertising executive Helen, a
woman whose life unfolds in two very different directions when she simultaneously catches
and misses a subway train. An estimable debut from writer-director Peter Howitt, <i>Sliding
Doors</i> is vastly superior to the other two screen romances currently in release, the
&quot;what-were-they-thinking-of?&quot; <i>Wings of Desire</i> remake <i>City of Angels</i>
and the profoundly wretched <a href="robject.html" target="_top"><em>The Object of My Affection</em></a>.</big></p>

<p>Helen's double life starts after she leaves live-in boyfriend Gerry (John Lynch) for
another day at the office, only to be abruptly sacked. Rushing into the London
underground, she swerves around a little girl playing with a doll on the steps and
narrowly misses her train. Then, in a sublimely edited bit of whimsy, she backs up the
staircase, avoids the child, catches the train, and meets the sad-eyed but silver-tongued
Monty Python fan James (John Hannah). Each Helen then proceeds on different paths,
involving personal and professional choices that comment on a broad range of issues and
topics, from fidelity to modern telecommunications to popular music (the copious
name-dropping includes major references to Elton John and a sly John Lennon in-joke). In
one life she comes home early and discovers Gerry with his American lover Lydia (Jeanne
Tripplehorn), while in the other her hesitant relationship with James blossoms into a love
that inspires her to pursue a new career.</p>

<p>First films often show signs of particular care and craftsmanship, and such is the case
with <i>Sliding Doors</i>. Howitt segues neatly from a long and distinguished career as
Art Director (with a filmography that includes three Oscar nominations, for <i>Mary, Queen
of Scots</i>, <i>Ragtime</i> and <i>Who Framed Roger Rabbit?</i>) to filmmaker with grace
and precision, offering a movie that stands above the pack for energy and attention to
detail. Refreshingly, the movie isn't afraid to be long-winded, sporting a script that is
jammed with irreverent observances and verbal flights of fancy. Although his initial
nervousness prompts Howitt to underscore rather too many early scenes with that annoying
wind chimy noise used to tip off audiences that something magical is happening, the
stories soon take on individual lives of their own, subtly aided by such ploys as
different hairstyles. It is only at the very end, when the machine that goes
&quot;ping&quot; &#151; as the Python lads might say &#151; enters the picture, that the
movie gets too weepy for it's own good.</p>

<p>Paltrow is superb, sporting a remarkably consistent British accent and giving each
Helen a distinctive personality that echoes the tribulations and triumphs of the
corresponding lives. Ironically, she reportedly passed on the role in <a href="ftitanic.html" target="_top"><i>Titanic</i></a> that eventually went to Kate Winslet (who does a
fine American accent) to make <i>Sliding Doors</i>. Previously known to American audiences
as the gay Matthew in <i>Four Weddings and a Funeral</i>, the Scotland-born Hannah brings
a whole bag of comic tricks to the exuberant James. And Lynch manages the tricky role of
Gerry &#151; who is required in the course of the film to be both a heartless cad and a
bumbling philanderer &#151; with the same intensity he brought to his award-winning
performance as the mentally unstable Harry in the little-seen Australian drama <i>Angel
Baby</i>. Even Tripplehorn, whose career has been saddled with such thankless credits as <i>The
Firm</i>, <a href="rwaterwrld.html" target="_top"><i>Waterworld</i></a> and the truly dreadful <a href="ftiff97-3.html#Office_Killer" target="_top"><i>Office Killer</i></a>, seems inspired by the
material and responds with a performance that nicely balances humor and intensity.</p>

<p>Howitt has said that it took seven years and the eventual stewardship of
director-producer-sometimes-actor Sydney Pollack to finally get <i>Sliding Doors</i> made.
In a spring movie season that resembles nothing more than revolving doors &#151; movie in,
movie out &#151; it would be only fitting if this one, pleasant, dignified and
entertaining, were to stick around for awhile.</p>
