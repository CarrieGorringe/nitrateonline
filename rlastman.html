<p><font size="5"><strong>O</strong></font><font size="4">f all of the names listed above,
the most relevant one for our purposes is not Walter Hill&#146;s, but that of Akira
Kurosawa, and is so only because of the exponential difference in the product that stems
from the same source. Kurosawa is one of only a handful -- perhaps two handsful -- of
directors that belong to a realm of talent so rare in occurrence and so exquisite in
manifestation that they have been and are the justification for classifying film as an art
form, regardless of the mediocrities and/or excrescenes of the majority of directors. And
his influence has been profound. From John Sturges&#146; adaptation of <em>The Seven
Samurai</em> (1954) into <em>The Magnificent Seven</em> (1960), to George Lucas&#146;s
borrowing of elements from <em>The Hidden Fortress</em> (1958) for <em>Star Wars</em>
(1977) to a narrative structure that utilizes multiple points-of-view to analyze how an
event unfolded (shades of 1950&#146;s <em>Rashomon</em>), many filmmakers owe Kurosawa a
tremendous debt for demonstrating how on-screen storytelling should take place. </font></p>

<p>Kurosawa never shrank from depicting the arbitrariness and cruelties that are part of
daily existence. What he did with them, however was to make them comprehensible. In a
Kurosawa film, wrongdoing or outright evil was established as a benchmark or challenge
against which the characters either rose or sank to the occasion; their true characters
were revealed for the audience to judge. Kurosawa never made succumbing to evil seem
acceptable or glamorous. Indeed, one of his most poignant works is the 1952 film, <em>Ikiru</em>
(<em>To Live</em>) is the story of a low-level civil servant who must face the ultimate
challenge -- terminal cancer. For a man whose life has been cursed with mediocrity and
monotony, the civil servant would seem ill-equipped to cope. Instead, and with no
excessive histrionics to vulgarize the situation, Kurosawa displays the development of
this man into someone with quiet, but unshakable grace and strength. Through his
acceptance of the absurdity of his situation, and his adherence to the values of duty and
sacrifice (the central theme in all of Kurosawa&#146;s work), this man will make the final
months of his life into much more than all of the years that have come before them, and,
in so doing, erase the futility of the former. Even in adapting <em>Macbeth</em> into the
setting of Medieval Japan (1957&#146;s <em>Throne of Blood</em>), Kurosawa did not create
an inferior version; Shakespeare&#146;s work and themes suffered no diminution in quality
for being translated to another place and time.</p>

<p>It&#146;s unfortunate that, given Kurosawa&#146;s respect for other people&#146;s work,
writer/director Walter Hill did not see fit to accord Kurosawa a similar courtesy. Hill is
best known for films that are all overwrought texture on the surface with very little
underneath (<em>Streets of Fire</em>) or better known for the actors appearing in them
than for any uniqueness in plot (Eddie Murphy in <em>48 Hours</em> and <em>Another 48
Hours</em>). And, if the surface flash or the actors can&#146;t cover up the subcutaneous
difficulties, then lots of ugly violence works just fine, thank you very much. All three
Hillean characteristics are on display in his latest film, <em>Last Man Standing</em>.
Hill borrowed the plot for <em>Last Man Standing</em> from the 1961 classic, <em>Yojimbo</em>.
Just like the original, Hill offers up his own mysterious stranger, the pseudonymous
&quot;John Smith,&quot; (Willis) a drifter who&#146;s been, by his own voice-over
admission, &quot;on the dodge&quot; for much of his life. Arriving in Jericho, Texas, a
town in terminal condition because of mob factions -- Irish versus Italian -- who are
warring over the right to bring bootleg liquor into a country made thirsty by Prohibition,
Smith voluntarily takes up the task of fleecing each group in turn after one of them
proceeds to wreck his car. A couple of displays of personal weakness later,
&quot;Smith&quot; isn&#146;t sure just whose welfare is at stake.</p>

<p>And &quot;Smith&quot; isn&#146;t the only one suffering under the same assumption. <em>Last
Man Standing</em> is engorged with violence without motivation, nastiness for the sake of
being nasty. The overall tone resembles the sadistic glee with which a young child might
pull wings from a fly. Beat up a couple of whores (among them Powers and Karina Lombard as
a reluctant mistress dressed up as a mysterious woman, whose life, it is later revealed,
has far less mystery and more mundane sordidness) and grind people&#146;s faces to a pulp,
thereby permitting violence junkies to get their fix without knowing that anything is
amiss in terms of quality, especially if you cut the action sequences really fast. Under
the circumstances, the violence isn&#146;t even cathartic, because the existence of
catharsis presupposes some kind of suspense and emotional involvement, neither of which is
in any great quantity here. Cinematographer Lloyd Ahern contributes to the track-covering
process by shooting the film in a golden haze reminiscent of Lucien Ballard&#146;s work in
<a href="rwildbch.html" target="_top"><em>The Wild Bunch</em></a>. But false pathos doesn&#146;t work
well with ironic detachment; contrary to what anyone connected with this film might have
thought, the two don&#146;t complement each other, but merely cancel each other out.</p>

<p>As is typical in a Hill film, the actors salvage what little there is to like about
this film. Willis is suitably ironic, as is Dern as the corrupt sheriff. Walken is
typically effective in his role of the soft-voiced psycho, even if his voice sounds like
it&#146;s coming from the end of a vacuum-cleaner hose. In his role as
&quot;Smith&#146;s&quot; sidekick, Joe Friday (Anyone for <em>Dragnet</em>?), Sanderson
proves that he&#146;s the successor to the giggly, mentally-unstable young-man role that
Michael J. Pollard did so well in <em>Bonnie and Clyde</em> (except that Sanderson
won&#146;t get the Oscar for this one -- the charm&#146;s worn a touch thin). In short, I
wouldn&#146;t be first in line to see <em>Last Man Standing</em>. </p>
