<p><font size="5">&quot;<strong>Y</strong></font><font size="4">ou&#146;ve been
erased.&quot; -- the final line spoken by US Marshall John Kruger (Schwarzenegger) to a
rather shady if cowardly character named Johnny C. (Pastorelli), as Kruger rather
violently obliterates any traces of Johnny&#146;s past life. Kruger works for the Witness
Protection Program (WITSEC), the branch of the Treasury Department that helps co-operative
witnesses disappear into thin air, conveniently out of reach of all who might wish to
eliminate them. Going one logical step further, Kruger actually stages the faked
&quot;deaths&quot; of these witnesses to provide a false sense of reassurance to their
enemies, with lots of handy explosions and immolations to persuade even the most
skeptical. Needless to say, in this sphere of work there is none better at his work, as
Kruger&#146;s supervisor and mentor, Robert Deguerian (Caan) tells him and everyone else
who cares to listen.</font></p>

<p>Of course, this idyllic stage in upward professional mobility can&#146;t continue
indefinitely, so some twists have been added to the tale. A computer expert named Lee
Cullen (Williams), working for a weapons manufacturer named Cyrez, has just uncovered
evidence concerning Cyrez&#146;s involvement in illegal arms shipments, and has much of
said evidence in her possession. Naturally, those who stand to benefit from these
transactions, many at the highest government levels, would like her to keep silent about
the information -- on a rather permanent basis. Worse, Ms. Cullen was betrayed by yet
another government agency during the process of gathering the information, and so she is
in no mood to listen to Kruger&#146;s warnings of impending danger. A conveniently-timed
fire-bombing of her home persuades her to believe otherwise. At about the same time that
Cullen enters the WITSEC program, it seems to have developed a few leaks, with said
witnesses actually encountering the unpleasant, and last-minute, realization that
protection services are no longer being rendered on their behalf. Kruger&#146;s task is to
keep Cullen safe at the same time he has to deal with the mole who is attempting to
discredit him within the agency, a situation that is easier described than accomplished;
even the head of the program, Beller (Coburn) has his own doubts concerning Kruger&#146;s
credibility rating.</p>

<p>But <em>Eraser&#146;s</em> narrative structure may not be the most thrilling aspect of
this film. For those of you whose movie-going budget has been somewhat strained by the
plethora of action-adventure films popping up this summer like the inevitable weed, you
might be gratified to learn that the filmmakers in this case have provided you with a
well-deserved break; as several wags have already noted, the resemblance between the
narratives of <em>Eraser</em> and another action-adventure film has been too close to be
mere coincidence (hint: the other film stars Tom Cruise). It&#146;s hardly a case of
giving the game away to note the number of films this summer that have plot lines
revolving around the innocent man who must fight to clear his name; either every
scriptwriter in Hollywood has been reading <em>Les Miserables</em>, or (a more likely bet)
they&#146;ve all remembered the grosses from the film version of Andrew Davis&#146; 1994
big-screen version of <em>The Fugitive</em> and decided that lightening can strike at
least several times in their favor (speaking of which, director Davis will be honoring us
later on in the season with <em>Chain Reaction</em>, his own reinterpretation, if you
will, of the society-done-him-wrong theme). This isn&#146;t to say that two films slated
for release in the same summer can&#146;t borrow similar elements from each other&#146;s
storylines. Rather, the problem stems from films borrowing indiscriminately, right down to
the very mistakes. In <em>Eraser&#146;s</em> case, its main defect is an overwhelming
impression of monotony which dampens the intended cause-and-effect chain considerably.
There&#146;s lots of flash, but very few thrills.</p>

<p>As with nearly every other action film this summer, the main source of relative
lifelessness on screen is simple to pinpoint. Despite the official credits for the
film&#146;s screenplay, there are indications that at least four or five scriptwriters
were attached to <em>Eraser&#146;s</em> evolution from rough draft to final script, and
the confusion shows. Suffering from inconsistency, the film&#146;s storyline lurches
around clumsily like Frankenstein&#146;s monster suffering from a bad case of restitching,
hemorrhaging incompetence from every seam. As with another blockbuster of the summer that
suffered from too many rewrites and not enough prior consideration (<a href="rtwister.html" target="_top"><em>Twister</em></a>), <em>Eraser</em> is another action film with
too many set pieces and not enough intelligent filler in between (the only difference
between the two films being that the special effects in <em>Eraser</em> don&#146;t inspire
insomnia, but they do inspire similar levels of incredulity, long, long before you need to
catch your breath). Having already exhausted the explanation concerning the need to make
the journey between Exciting Action Sequence &quot;A&quot; and Exciting Action Sequence
&quot;B&quot; as interesting as possible for the audience, there is no need to rehash it
here. Rather than addressing the problems in <em>Eraser</em> by citing the film&#146;s
inadequacies as the proverbial illustration of too many cooks spoiling the broth, the
analogy might better be cited as too many culinary apprentices not stirring the narrative
mixture properly from the bottom, thereby allowing it to burn irretrievably due to
inexcusable carelessness. Director Russell (of <em>The Mask</em>) provides no compensation
for the script&#146;s defects, since he directs <em>Eraser</em> in a manner best described
as pedestrian.</p>

<p>Instead of whatever subtleties in plot development that the action genre can tolerate,
the <em>Eraser</em> audience member is treated to -- take a deep breath -- the sight of
Arnold attempting to express something from the depths of his soul rather than the depths
of his automatic gun barrel. The result is less a revelation than an abomination, since
Mr. Schwarzenegger&#146;s attempts at being earnest are so marred by an extremely stilted
delivery (but not by his accent) that the lines inspire more of a sense of risible
disbelief than a sense of authenticity; his discomfort with the process of evocation is
almost tangible. The film improves somewhat only when he abandons that pretense and begins
firing off the sardonic one-liners that have worked so well for him in the past. There are
many of them (the best involving Arnold and the impending demise of a crocodile), but, at
best, they act as a pretty wrapping over an extremely inadequate package.</p>

<p>It may be no surprise that the best work in <em>Eraser</em> comes from the supporting
cast. Cobourn and Caan, two actors who have become virtual no-shows on the big screen for
a long time, bring the requisite amount of class, and then some, to any film fortunate
enough to be graced with their presence, and <em>Eraser</em> is no exception (even Arnold
gains stature as an &quot;Actor&quot; from just the shortest amount of time of on-screen
co-existence with them). Pastorelli, best known as the laid-back artist/nanny Eldon on
T.V.&#146;s <em>Murphy Brown</em>, provides a deft comedic turn as Schwarzenegger&#146;s
unexpected sidekick in crime fighting. But the real surprise in <em>Eraser</em> is
Williams, who, having been handed what is traditionally the most thankless of roles in an
action film -- the helpless heroine -- gives it a strong and badly-needed injection of
guts. There are no shrieking Perils-of-Pauline antics here, as Williams fights it out with
the baddies right alongside Arnold. Perhaps someone should have set her on the filmmakers
before principal photography began; a better-quality product might have been the end
result. </p>
