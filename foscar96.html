<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><img src="images/foscar96-1.gif" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="103" HEIGHT="121">One might have
thought that the nadir had been reached last year, when <em>Forrest Gump</em> won Best
Picture, but the Academy offerings this year are particularly appalling, almost as if they
dug a new level right out from underneath last year's lows.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With the overwhelming number of nominations from 'feel-good' pictures present and
accounted for, one could be forgiven for believing that the motion picture industry is
running scared in the face of growing calls for censorship from the so-called 'religious
right' (which, as one wag once suggested about the 'moral majority', is neither) and the
US Congress. Nevertheless, what follows are the nominees for the 68th annual Academy
Awards in what are commonly referred to as the 'money' categories (so named because a win
in any one of them can boost the total box-office receipts of a given film by as much as
thirty percent).</font> </p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">So, I'll plug my nose and probably make a fool of myself in the process of trying to
predict the voting trends present among some 5,600 Academy members...</font> </p>

<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Best Picture:</font></b> 

<ul>
  <li><em><font face="Verdana" size="2">Babe</font> </em></li>
  <li><em><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Postman</font> </em></li>
  <li><em><font face="Verdana" size="2">Apollo 13</font> </em></li>
  <li><em><font face="Verdana" size="2">Braveheart</font> </em></li>
  <li><em><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sense and Sensibility</font> </em></li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><img src="images/foscar96-2.gif" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="101" HEIGHT="102"><b>What <i>should </i>win:</b>
The best of the above, far and away, is <a href="rsense.html" target="_top"><em>Sense and Sensibility</em></a>.
It has everything: flawless acting, great direction and script adaptation. Best of all, it
has a respected literary pedigree, something which the Academy tends to favour in its
annual quest for 'respect' (otherwise known as covering over the yearly output of
cinematic swill like <b>Black Sheep</b> with the elegant petticoats of Jane Austen).</font> </p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>What <i>will </i>win:</b> The Academy has a tradition of selecting a film that
represents the best of American filmmaking, but the best film of 1995 will probably be <b>Sense
and Sensibility</b>, for many of the reasons listed above. <b>S&amp;S</b> will also pick
up some momentum from its Golden Globe win in the Best Picture category, as well as its
scooping of the <a href="fberlin96-3.html" target="_top">Berlin Golden Bear</a> award, which shouldn't
hurt its chances any.</font> </p>

<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Best Director:</font></b> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mel Gibson (<em>Braveheart</em>)</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Chris Noonan (<em>Babe</em>)</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Tim Robbins (<em>Dead Man Walking</em>)</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mike Figgis (<a href="rllv.html" target="_top"><em>Leaving Las Vegas</em></a>)</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Michael Radford (<em>Il Postino (The Postman)</em>)</font> </li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Who <i>should </i>win:</b> Ang Lee, who, in a most inexcusable omission, wasn't even
nominated for his work on <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>. The obvious choice from those
listed above is Tim Robbins, whose <em>Dead Man Walking</em> spoke eloquently and as
objectively as one could about the death penalty.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Who <i>will </i>win:</b> As anyone who has followed this category for any length of
time knows, one of the most important arbiters for determining who will win the Oscar is
the choice for the Director's Guild of America (DGA) award, which was handed down on March
2nd. It has happened only three times in the history of the Oscars (since 1949) that a
director who has won the DGA award failed to win the Best Director Oscar (the last such
unfortunate being, if memory serves me correctly, Steven Spielberg, for <em>The Color
Purple</em> in 1985). Let's just say that the DGA award is an extremely reliable source
for determining the victor.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><img src="images/foscar96-3.gif" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" "ang lee directs" WIDTH="193" HEIGHT="135">However,
this year the DGA has chosen to increase the number of discrepancies to an even four. Ron
Howard was given the award for his direction of <em>Apollo 13</em>, making any attempts at
predicting the outcome even more difficult. But, there is a clue in Howard's victory: <em>Apollo
13</em> is less about the space program in 1972 than it is about how Americans wished
things were in 1995. The film presents a vision of brilliant American technology and a
national vision that was audacious in conception but always possible in execution, and
also to the ever-present existence of American ingenuity in getting out of difficult
situations (even if they were self-inflicted). Unfortunately, the loss of the Vietnam War
and the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, among other fiascos, have put a few
dents in that self-perception over the past two decades. Under the circumstances, who
could blame Howard for extrapolating wish-fulfillment-as-history from what was in actual
fact a near-disaster averted by nothing more than the skin of someone's teeth? Not many
did, as the $300 million-plus box-office take makes evident.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">So, as in <em>Apollo 13</em>, the Academy is torn between its own version of history
versus nostalgia this year. In theory, the Academy's real choice is between Radford and
Gibson, probably because the downbeat nature of <em>Leaving Las Vegas</em> might be
considered too provocative in increasingly conservative times (notice that <em>LLV</em>
wasn't even nominated in the Best Picture category). Radford has quality on his side. But
Gibson has the edge: he's well-liked in Hollywood, and that goodwill should be enough to
tilt the odds in his favour. More importantly, he won the Golden Globe for Best Director,
and, if the track record of Globe winners in this category is any indication, Gibson will
follow in their footsteps to the Oscar podium.</font> </p>

<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Best Actor:</font></b> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Nicolas Cage (<a href="rllv.html" target="_top"><em>Leaving Las Vegas</em></a>)</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Richard Dreyfuss (<em>Mr. Holland's Opus</em>)</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Anthony Hopkins (<a href="rnixon.html" target="_top"><em>Nixon</em></a>)</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sean Penn (<em>Dead Man Walking</em>)</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Massimo Troisi (<em>Il Postino (The Postman)</em>)</font> </li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Who <i>should </i>win:</b> Sean Penn, for his spellbinding performance as the
condemned Matthew Poncelet in <em>Dead Man Walking</em>. Penn endows Poncelet with a brand
of creepiness that inspires both sympathy and revulsion. Moreover, Penn does so without
reverting to shameless histrionics; there is no shrieking deathbed repentance here. It is
Penn's finest performance, in a career of excellent work (albeit at times in films of
questionable quality). If nothing else, this performance should put to rest any
speculation concerning the extent of Penn's talent.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Who <i>will </i>win:</b> Nicolas Cage, for reasons that escape me personally. His
performance as Ben in <em>Leaving Las Vegas</em> doesn't sustain its momentum throughout
the entire film. <img src="images/rllv.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" width="203" height="138">Part of the problem is the increasingly glum trajectory of the
film's narrative; as I said once before, once your character decides to drink himself to
death, your job as an actor is fairly well determined. But Cage himself doesn't sink low
enough to the occasion; instead of gradually increasing the edginess of Ben's
self-destructive tendencies, Cage settles for a slightly mellower version of the work he
did in the first hour of the film. However, Cage, like Gibson, is well-liked and will
probably parlay good feeling (not to mention his awards from the LA and NY film critics
for best actor and his victory at the Golden Globes) into an Oscar.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Cage's only potential competition comes from Troisi; there's a very slim chance that
the Academy might give a posthumous award to an actor who literally gave his life for his
art. Generally speaking, however, the Academy likes its award winners to appear in person
(Peter Finch in 1976 being the only exception, but then, he died only a few weeks before
the ceremony took place), so Cage should probably come out ahead.</font> </p>

<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Best Actress:</font></b> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Emma Thompson (<a href="rsense.html" target="_top"><em>Sense and Sensibility</em></a>)</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sharon Stone (<a href="rcasino.html" target="_top"><em>Casino</em></a>)</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Susan Sarandon (<em>Dead Man Walking</em>)</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meryl Streep (<em>The Bridges of Madison County</em>)</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Elisabeth Shue (<a href="rllv.html" target="_top"><em>Leaving Las Vegas</em></a>)</font> </li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><img src="images/foscar96-4.gif" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="127" HEIGHT="194"><b>Who <i>should </i>win:</b>
If this award were given on the basis of endurance alone, Sharon Stone would be the clear
winner; it is no small feat to carry the last half of a mediocre-to-bad film like <em>Casino</em>
all by oneself. This Herculean task was tacitly noted at the Golden Globes, where she was
given one of the two best actress awards (Drama).</font> </p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Who <i>will </i>win:</b> There's a possibility that Academy favourite Streep, with
her usual freight of accents and longing expressions, might pull this category out of the
hat. With any luck, however, the contest will come down to Thompson and Stone, and I think
the Academy will give the award to Stone, if for no other reason than Academy members will
have admired Stone's plucky attempt to establish herself as a 'serious' actress.</font> </p>

<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Best Supporting Actor:</font></b> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">James Cromwell (<em>Babe</em>)</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Tim Roth (<em>Rob Roy</em>)</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Brad Pitt (<a href="r12monky.html" target="_top"><em>12 Monkeys</em></a>)</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kevin Spacey (<em>The Usual Suspects</em>)</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ed Harris (<em>Apollo 13</em>)</font> </li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Who <i>should </i>win:</b> Kevin Spacey. This is an actor who has given three
excellent performances this year: <img src="images/foscar96-5.gif" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="145" HEIGHT="180">as the hilariously vicious studio executive in <em>Swimming with
Sharks</em>, his uncredited cameo in <a href="rseven.html" target="_top"><em>Seven</em></a> as the
chillingly realistic serial killer, and his brilliantly deadpan work as Verbal in <em>The
Usual Suspects</em>. Spacey's versatility and talent are unquestioned, and he has had the
rare opportunity of having three great performances appear nearly back-to-back within the
space of a year. There's no question that he has earned his keep.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Who <i>will </i>win:</b> This is going to be a close race between Spacey and Harris.
Harris' likeability factor (he projected that blend of ingenuity and inner strength so
beloved of American audiences) will probably make him the winner. Moreover, Spacey's
uncredited work as the serial killer in <em>Seven</em> might turn Academy members against
him (again, the controversy factor might be a liability). Pitt has some chance of success,
because of his Golden Globe win, but his performance degenerated so badly in the last half
of <em>12 Monkeys</em> that I doubt he can pull it off. Cromwell's evocation of quiet
strength was extremely attractive, and there might be some momentum coming his way from
the box-office and critical acclaim from <em>Babe</em>, but I'm going with Harris.</font> </p>

<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Best Supporting Actress:</font></b> 

<ul>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mira Sorvino (<a href="rma.html" target="_top"><em>Mighty Aphrodite</em></a>)</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kate Winslet (<a href="rsense.html" target="_top"><em>Sense and Sensibility</em></a>)</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kathleen Quinlan (<em>Apollo 13</em>)</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mare Winningham (<em>Georgia</em>)</font> </li>
  <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Joan Allen (<a href="rnixon.html" target="_top"><em>Nixon</em></a>)</font> </li>
</ul>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Who <i>should </i>win:</b> Mira Sorvino's performance was one of the freshest and
funniest all year. Any woman who can commit the rare feat of reducing Woody Allen's
appearance on screen to the level of second banana has undeniable levels of talent.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><img src="images/foscar96-6.gif" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="190" HEIGHT="119"><b>Who <i>will </i>win:</b>
I think Sorvino will win, precisely because her performance was so strong. Allen will not
be honoured because there has been a considerable degree of controversy about how
'realistically' Stone's film captured the Nixon White House and family. Quinlan and
Winningham provided fine performances, but both were overshadowed, the former by
technology, the latter by Jennifer Jason Leigh. Winslet also provided many exquisite
moments to <em>S&amp;S</em>, but Sorvino's work, although less stylish on the surface, has
a more complex construction to it, and the Academy will decide accordingly.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What is so striking this year is the amount of fine work that wasn't even honoured. In
particular, so many great actors come to mind - among them Harvey Keitel (<em>Smoke</em>),
Don Cheadle (<a href="rdevilb.html" target="_top"><em>Devil in a Blue Dress</em></a>), Paul Sorvino (<em>Nixon</em>),
Jennifer Jason Leigh (<em>Georgia</em>) - that it's difficult to determine just what
exactly has seized the Academy voters this year. The answer should become apparent on
Oscar night, March 25th.</font> </p>
