<p><big><strong><big>A</big></strong>mong the most distinctive directorial debuts of the
last year to 18 months on the international film festival circuit, Shane Meadows' <i>TwentyFourSeven</i>
(also called 247 in the eye-catching opening credits; the phrase refers to full-time
dedication to an endeavor) has a cocky, in-your-face exuberance that is nicely balanced by
an almost sweet naivete. Vaguely autobiographical and tooled specifically for Bob Hoskins
&#150; who gives a career-defining performance &#150; the film is both inspirational and
critical, hitching social concerns to a fresh visual take on the boxing movie and the
lovable underdogs who inhabit that milieu.</big></p>

<p>In the Midlands region of England &#150; presumably Nottingham or thereabouts, where
Meadows grew up &#150; community activist Alan Darcy (Hoskins) decides to revive a
moribund boxing club to give the local lads an opportunity to focus their energies on
something productive. Equally at home in the ring or waltzing with his Aunt Iris (Pamela
Cundell), Darcy is a sensitive, mercurial sort whose sensitive diary entries belie his
gruff exterior. As he commits himself to the forging of his some dozen charges and the
inevitable triumphs and tragedies of that process, the film addresses themes of social
inequity, provides a fresh spin on the genre and gives the actor ample opportunity to show
off the bearish everyman spunk that gives him his appeal.</p>

<p>Darcy calls the place the 101 Spot (one on one emphasizing the individual's reliance on
self), and the band of young fighters the 101 Warriors. In fact, the group of lads comes
with their share of baggage. One is an addict, another has a weight problem, yet a third
has a tense home environment, and all of them lack the discipline necessary for the sport.
Yet by the film's tragic end, solid progress has been made.</p>

<p>The film is set to bloozy themes by Boo Hewerdine and Neill MacColl (they were in the
1980s band The Bible), peppered with songs from Van Morrison, Sun House, Tim Buckley,
Strauss, The Charlatans, Jan Garbarek and Paul Weller that heighten the veracity of the
working-class setting (which Hoskins has quipped &quot;makes Detroit look like Never-Never
Land). </p>

<p>A product of this environment himself, Meadows first gained attention a few years ago
when he began writing, directing and producing short films on a shoestring budget with
borrowed equipment. Using friends and family for cast and crew, he made a documentary for
Britain's Channel Four called <i>King of the Gypsies</i>, followed that with the lowlife
comedy <i>Where's the Money Ronnie!</i> (featured at the 1997 New York Film Festival) and
completed his apprenticeship with the one hour featurette <i>Smalltime</i>. To date <i>TwentyFourSeven</i>,
which was produced for around $2 million by the established team of Stephen Woolley and
Nik Powell (<i>Absolute Beginners</i>, <i>The Crying Game</i>, <i>Backbeat</i>, the
upcoming <i>Welcome to Woop Woop</i>) has won Hoskins the Best Actor prize at the European
Film Awards, the jury prize for Best Screenplay at the Thessaloniki Film Festival and the
FIPRESCI international film critics' award at the Venice Film Festival, as well as being
selected for the opening night gala presentation at the Philadelphia Festival of World
Cinema (which figures, given the film's subject).</p>

<p>Technically, the film harks back to the Angry Young Man (and Woman) school of British
filmmaking, influential films of the 1960s that combined class-conscious social realism
with a distinguished documentary tradition (key titles include the touchstones <i>Room at
the Top</i> and <i>Look Back in Anger</i>, as well as <i>The Loneliness of the Long
Distance Runner</i>, <i>A Taste of Honey</i>, <i>This Sporting Life</i>, <i>Saturday Night
and Sunday Morning</i>, <i>The L-Shaped Room</i> and <i>Sons and Lovers</i>). All of those
films are in black and white, and Ashley Rowe's lovely photography of <i>TwentyFourSeven</i>
continues that tradition: &quot;British films,&quot; Meadows told Sight and Sound earlier
this year, &quot;have earned a reputation in certain quarters for looking like they're
made for television. I think people associate black and white with cinema, and I wanted
the film to have a dignity. There are two types of black and white: there's the gritty 'we
had to make it on 16mm black and white because it was cheaper,' and there's the black and
white which is more expensive, shot on 35mm through a bleach by-pass process. This type is
quite beautiful, and it's what I was going for.&quot; Typical: in his enthusiasm for the
aesthetic qualities of his work, Meadows bypasses any mention of historical context.
Whether he's unaware of the lineage or dismissive of it is almost immaterial in the face
of such energy. Only time will tell if his skills are tempered by respect. </p>

<p>&quot;If you've never had anything to believe in you'll always be poor,&quot; is
another line from Darcy's journal. Perhaps more than any other, this line does double duty
as the emotional barometer of <i>TwentyFourSeven</i> and a strong hint that with passion
as currency, young Meadows has, at an early age, acquired substantial wealth.</p>
