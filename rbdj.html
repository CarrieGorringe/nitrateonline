<p><font size="5"><strong>D</strong></font><font size="4">uring his thirty-four years of
filmmaking, the Spanish director Luis Bunuel (1900-83) was truly one of the most brilliant
-- and controversial. From his Surrealist experimentations with Salvador Dali <em>Un Chien
Andalou</em> (<em>An</em> <em>Andalusian Dog,</em> 1929) and <em>L'Age D'Or </em>(<em>The
Age of Gold</em>, 1930) to his final film, <em>Cet Obscur Objet du Desir</em> (<em>That
Obscure Object of Desire</em>, in 1977,) Bunuel returned repeatedly to his favourite
themes: the moral bankruptcy and even degeneracy of bourgeois life and religion, the
hypocritical facades that are utilized in an attempt to conceal the bankruptcy and the
brutality of totalitarianism disguised in calls for the restoration of &quot;social
order.&quot; In short, Bunuel was obsessed with the impossibility for individuals of
distinguishing between &quot;reality&quot;, the ideological constructs around them and
their own desires, if any of the above could be defined as separable, or even separate.
Yet, in his social critiques, shades of grey, not stark black and white, often prevailed.
When Bunuel turned his eyes to examinations of injustice, there was more than a touch of
jaundice available for observing the behavior of all of the chosen participants, no matter
how downtrodden they might be; in this vein, the most immediate example that comes to mind
is <em>Los Olvidados</em> (<em>The Forgotton Ones</em>, 1950), in which Bunuel could be
rightfully outraged over a society that allowed a poor boy to be buried in a garbage dump
like so much human refuse while simultaneously refusing to portray the poverty-stricken as
one-dimensional individuals who suffer nobly (Bunuel undercuts that sort of wishful
thinking in one scene by showing a group of poor young boys as they humiliate a crippled
man with no legs by stealing his only means of transport). His themes were often delivered
in a furiously sardonic tone which, although always thought-provoking and thus at times
painfully hilarious, could be intolerable for those with more tender sensibilities. Not
surprisingly, Bunuel was a perennial favourite for condemnation by the Catholic Church,
which proclaimed that his film, <em>Viridiana</em> (1961), containing a rather vicious
parody of the Last Supper, was &quot;an insult to Christianity.&quot; Bunuel, who always
thanked God that he was an atheist, probably could not have written a better tribute to
his own work.</font></p>

<p>In 1967, Bunuel made <em>Belle de Jour</em>. This film represented a radical departure
in style, if not in his beliefs; although the trademark social satire is still present,
for this single moment in his career Bunuel chose to diffuse his usually angry
explorations of social hypocrisy threatening to erupt into social chaos into a more
lyrical format, in which atmosphere and style are paramount. </p>

<p><em>Belle de Jour</em> is the story of Severine (Catherine Deneuve), the wife of a
young doctor who is rapidly rising in his profession to the point where he has neglected
both her and their marriage. Already inclined to sadomasochistic fantasies due to some
unknown trauma in her past, Severine is increasingly drawn to acting upon her need for
degradation. Bored with her life, she works during the afternoons at a brothel which
caters to this proclivity, yet she is still the good bourgeois wife who informs her madam
that she has to be home by five p.m.(her alias at the brothel is Belle <em>de Jour</em>, a
pun on the French euphemism for prostitute, &quot;belle de nuit&quot;). She enjoys this
double life until one of her customers, a gangster, becomes so obsessed with her to the
point that he is determined to kill her husband. What follows next is a meditation on
ambiguity on all levels. Severine is morally torn between living as an upper-class ice
maiden and an abandoned fantasy woman. Although Severine is trying to stop her husband's
murder, her efforts seem to be somewhat half-hearted, almost as if she is willing to tempt
fate.</p>

<p>Thanks to Sacha Vierny's stunning color cinematography, Yves Saint Laurent's couture
and her own genes, Deneuve herself looks so beautiful that even she seems unreal (an
indication of how beautiful Deneuve is in this film can be found by recalling Grace Kelly
in her Hitchcock period, and then multiplying that beauty by a factor of at least one
hundred). Finally, the narrative structure is strained by events to the point where the
audience cannot be certain whether anything recounted in the course of the film belongs to
the realm of the physical or the psychological -- not unlike life itself, at times.</p>

<p><em>Belle de Jour</em> most definitely belongs to the realm of cinematic classics. It
is arguably the most accessible of Bunuel's films and probably the best introduction to
his work. Unfortunately, the film has been unavailable for nearly thirty years until the
release of this newly-restored print. In keeping with Bunuel's ability to offend, a
certain unnamed but wealthy individual was so offended by <em>Belle de Jour </em>that he
began buying up every print he could and destroyed each of them in a vain attempt to
eliminate the film entirely. Go and see this film, if only for the cinematography or to
gaze upon Deneuve; in the current political climate, some ideologue with offended
sensibilities could decide to take up where the last censor left off.</p>
