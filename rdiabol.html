<p>And it always seems to be the directors with the least talent who indulge in this
particular attempt at self-immolation. The latest one to light his own pyre is no
exception to this rule: one Jeremiah Chechik, he of the somewhat charming-but-dismally
lightweight romantic comedy, <em>Benny and Joon</em> (1993). His selection is rather a
departure from what one might expect of him, and it&#146;s a tall order. In his remake of <em>Diabolique</em>,
Chechik seeks to overcome the work of the venerable French director, Henri-Georges Cluzot,
an individual noted for another cinematic classic, <em>The Wages of Fear</em> (1953). For
those who are unfamiliar with the original <em>Diabolique</em>, made in 1955,
Cluzot&#146;s film is the tale of what happens -- or doesn&#146;t happen -- to a
parsimonious and brutal headmaster (Paul Meurisse) of a rundown boy&#146;s school which is
owned by his wife (Vera Cluzot), a meek ex-nun with a bad heart. This man&#146;s behavior
is so insufferable that even his mistress (Simone Signoret) conspires with the man&#146;s
wife to kill him (you know things are bad when a man&#146;s mistress volunteers for such a
grisly task). The two of them lure him to the mistress&#146;s family home, drug and drown
him, then they take the body back to the swimming pool on the school grounds and throw it
in, figuring that they have an airtight alibi of accidental drowning when the body
surfaces. But it doesn&#146;t. When the pool is drained, no trace of the body exists. Then
the suit that the dead man was wearing when killed is returned from the dry cleaners, and
other strange events follow in viciously funny lockstep to an ambiguous but frightening
conclusion. Without giving the ending away, it&#146;s enough to say that the original <em>Diabolique</em>
is a brilliant &quot;noir&quot; thriller, with a sense of wit and an attitude about human
nature that is so excoriating that it cuts right to the bone; its suspenseful edge stands
up to repeat viewings. It is this masterpiece which, in Mr. Chechik&#146;s openly-stated
and highly-patronizing opinion, could stand a little &quot;updating.&quot; </p>

<p>Unfortunately, as a viewing of the new <em>Diabolique</em> makes clear, it is apparent
that the only place in which Chechik chose to push the envelope was in the interview
sessions. This <em>Diabolique</em> is not so much an improvement as a regression. Chechik
and screenwriter Roos have accomplished the impossible: they have taken a foolproof
suspense narrative and drained it of any and all vestiges of suspense. One of the many
ways in which these bright boys did so was to take the central plot twist, which occurs at
the very end of the original, and to inadvertently give it away after only two-thirds of
the film had elapsed. Consequently, to call this film inert is to credit it with more
energy than it actually has. Of course, it doesn&#146;t help matters terribly much if a
filmmaker&#146;s idea of progress is to substitute flashy camera angles, not to mention a
considerable number of annoyingly extreme close-ups, shot in excruciatingly slow motion,
for substance. But, then, there are some trivial details that have to be sacrificed when a
filmmaker is on a Mission, as Chechik most certainly seems to be. From the triteness of
the opening shots of raindrops under the film&#146;s titles (shot in the aforementioned
manner), the audience is made to understand that Chechik means &quot;business,&quot; no
doubt of the most simian type. If the visual hijinks don&#146;t make that obvious, then
Randy Edelman&#146;s hysterically portentous music -- a barely-concealed rip-off of
Bernard Herrmann&#146;s music for <em>Psycho</em> with none of the inspiration and/or
talent behind the original -- should put the matter to rest once and for all. While
watching this tortured mess, I was reminded of the similarities between it and the
observations that H.L. Mencken made concerning the tortured syntax of President Warren G.
Harding; both are like hippopotamuses struggling to free themselves from a pit of
molasses. There&#146;s all this thrashing around, and a lot of mess and noise, but not
much progress is made.</p>

<p>The same could be said about the poor unfortunates who took up the thankless task of
appearing in this film. Stone, Palminteri and Adjani, all fine actors, deserved better
(and probably should have known better), but, nevertheless, they gamely attempt to rise
above the material. In so doing, their strong efforts have the paradoxical effect of
amplifying the weaknesses in the narrative and the resultant gap between their abilities
and the film&#146;s weaknesses become embarrassing to watch. In particular, Stone, as
Nicole, the mistress, is wasted, in all senses of the word. Her character&#146;s sluttish
presence is commanding (perhaps a little too commanding: do Chechik and Roos honestly
believe that female math teachers dress in skin-tight short skirts before going off to
teach a class of prepubescent boys?) and she hands back what snappy dialogue is allowed
her -- some of which is quite clever -- with impeccable wit and timing. This broad is so
hard-boiled that you expect her make-up to crack from the heat she radiates. However, even
she is eventually swallowed up by the molasses. As Shirley Vogel, the female detective who
begins snooping around after the questionable activities of Adjani and Stone, Bates is
given the thankless task of providing the only source of intentional humor in the film;
her entire dialogue revolves around themes of misandry and breast cancer, topics that are
always sure-fire knee-slappers at any sort of social gathering (if Chechik and Roos
believe that such sops to supposedly feminist sensibilities will gain them sympathy votes
from women in the audience, they would be well advised to think again). The actors are
also not well-served by the decision to change the ending of the film, from the
deliciously chilling and sly ambiguity present in the original, to something far more
literal and tendentious; what was supposed to be suspenseful inspired ringing peals of
laughter from the audience -- and it was the only time its members laughed. </p>

<p>To sum up: rent the original.</p>
