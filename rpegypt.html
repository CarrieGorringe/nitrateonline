<p><big><strong><big>F</big></strong>rom all accounts, it appears that 1998 will be known
in film circles as the year of the insects and of the remakes. In the latter category,
we've experienced, for the most part, pallid remakes of Hitchcock&#146;s <i>Dial M for
Murder</i> (updated but not improved to resemble <i>A Perfect Murder</i>) and, of course,
Gus van Sant&#146;s film-school remake of <i>Psycho</i>, pedantic beyond the point of
redundancy. Now, in the name of treading on (as opposed to &quot;in&quot;) the paths of
what passes for a venerable cinematic past, Dreamworks has brought us an animated version
of De Mille&#146;s <i>The Ten Commandments</i>.</big></p>

<p><img src="images/rpegypt-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="136">Or, rather, this
new production can be best described as one half <i>of The Ten Commandments</i>, namely
the first, good half, when moral lines are clearly drawn (good Hebrews, bad Egyptians) and
before that infernal Golden Calf incident which leads to the forty years of wandering in
the wilderness (there&#146;s not much dramatic value in watching people wandering
aimlessly around, unless the audience for this film consists of Beckett fans -- a highly
unlikely prospect). There&#146;s no Charlton Heston or Yul Brenner this time around, but
there&#146;s the baby in the bullrushes, his moral awakening, the &quot;let my people
go&quot; exclamation, the locusts, the deaths of the first-born sons, all culminating in
that infamous parting of the Red Sea and the drowning of evil Pharaoh&#146;s five hundred
chariots. As if this overly descriptive synopsis doesn&#146;t make the point, ominous
signs appear not too far into <i>The Prince of Egypt</i> that all will not be at all well
with this production -- less than three shots into the proceedings, as a matter of fact.
At that point, the audience is treated -- in the same shot -- to a sniveling disclaimer
about the attempts to convey historical accuracy in the face of artistic license and the
&quot;revelation&quot; that the story of Moses can be found in the book of Exodus. Such
requisite nods to political correctness, fundamentalist style, and cultural illiteracy,
respectively, set the tone for the rest of the film; it falls into the classic trap of
trying to offend and/or confuse nobody and ends up pleasing exactly that number of people.</p>

<p>The real tipoff comes in the opening sequence, featuring a group of Jewish slaves
either being subjected to genocidal practices, through the mass drowning of their sons on
the orders of a paranoid Pharaoh (for those who don&#146;t remember, this is the reason
why Moses&#146; mother gives him up to the basket and sends him down the Nile where he is
found by the Pharaoh&#146;s daughter and adopted into the Egyptian royal family), not to
mention the appalling specter of slaves singing in a musical number while they are being
beaten by royal guards. Obviously, the second construct is meant to inspire sympathy for
the downtrodden, but, frankly, it comes off as being in extremely bad taste. While a
mother&#146;s melancholy lullaby for the child she is about to send away for his own
salvation is affecting, the idea that starving slaves can sing about freedom with lash
marks on their back is simply vile (it makes Mel Brooks&#146; blackly humorous production
number about the Inquisition and converting the Jews through torture to Christianity in <i>History
of the World, Part One</i> seem positively lyrical by comparison). Presumably, historical
distance is supposed to make this sort of thing palatable -- i.e., no survivors are around
to complain about the desecration of their memories -- but, even without the immediacy of
the historical events, anyone with half a brain knows this isn&#146;t feasible. </p>

<p><img src="images/rpegypt-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="134">One could argue
that the juxtaposition of violence and dance numbers has occurred before on-screen, most
effectively in Bob Fosse&#146;s film version of <i>Cabaret</i>, and most notably in the
sequence which intercuts a musical number with the brutal murder of a Jewish man in the
alley behind the nightclub. The difference between <i>Prince </i>and <i>Cabaret</i>, and
their use of violence is profound: <i>Cabaret</i> isolates the violence outside the music
hall (and hence outside the main sphere of action), it is very carefully linked in a
metaphorical sense straight back to what is happening inside. There&#146;s no avoiding the
musical&#146;s central tenet that art imitates and is corrupted by life, and artists, by
extension, cannot claim special exemption from the political activities swirling around
them, especially in Berlin in 1933; geographical isolation is no excuse. By contrast, <i>Prince&#146;s
</i>creators expect the audience to swallow the unrealistic spectacle of singing slaves at
work. It&#146;s a violation not only of some moral standard, however vague, but of genre
expectations; musicals, until very recently, didn&#146;t lend themselves to the fusion of
overt violence with music, and even Fosse, as indicated above, couldn&#146;t achieve
complete integration. The singing-slaves number in Prince is admittedly an attempt at
evoking compassion for the characters&#146; plight, but all it inspires is a combination
of confusion and disgust, and the film is overflowing with such clumsiness that it really
doesn&#146;t need any further assistance in this particular area.</p>

<p>Moreover, it doesn&#146;t help matters much when an inability to distinguish between
affect and effect is the least of the film&#146;s problems (though the animation is, if
not exceptional in design, of the sufficiently high quality expected at this production
level). This new Moses is hardly the stuff of legend. Voiced by Val Kilmer, he is a whiny,
self-centered individual, who suffers from self-doubt to the point of paralysis. At least
Cecil B. and Chuck Heston ensured that their Moses, for all his insecurities, never
doubted the rectitude of his mission. The Moses in <i>Prince </i>has a backbone of cooked
macaroni; he may seem less superhuman, but he also seems less capable. While watching him,
you can only wonder why God, in His infinite wisdom, chose this nebbish for the task of
liberation (maybe the Pharaoh&#146;s men had been too efficient in the opening sequence,
and this is a case of beggars and choosers). As for the film&#146;s much-lauded
&quot;historical accuracy&quot; despite allowances having been made for
&quot;artistic&quot; license, this reviewer will refrain from commenting in detail, except
to suggest that such a goal was impossibly lofty from its inception, not only because much
of the evidence is still inconclusive, but also because the idea of juxtaposing historical
accuracy and art in film is as unlikely to stand as a pledge of sobriety extracted from an
alcoholic locked in a wine cellar; imbibing and creativity always win out. In the case of <i>The
Prince of Egypt</i>, the audience is being put through de Mille again and in a more
sloppily earnest and cumbersome fashion than anything de Mille could ever have dreamed up.
Fortunately, the audience will punish the filmmakers for their asinine attempts at
idolatry: they shalt not have good box-office receipts.</p>
