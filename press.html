cinemag founded by Seattle journalist Carrie Gorringe, NO contains thoughtful
film critiques, longer features (a tribute to Roger Corman, another look at the
rereleased <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>), interviews (Errol Morris, Roman Polanski),
and news-wire dispatches. The design may be minimal, but Gorringe and her crew
patently adore movies, which is why other people who adore movies will enjoy
their work. B+&quot;&nbsp;<i><br>
