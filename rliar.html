<p><font size="5"><strong>T</strong></font><font size="4">he inevitability of Jim Carrey
was, in retrospect, obvious; in a culture where explicit brutality shares equal time with
sardonic humor and forced sincerity on the evening news, if Carrey hadn't come along on
his own, our culture would've made him up sooner or later. A volatile mix of childlike
human and malevolent cartoon, a toned-down Carrey toiled in television for what seemed
like an eternity -- showing jagged flashes of wit on &quot;In Living Color&quot; -- before
bursting on the scene with a crisp string of unique, genre-bending, puerile hit comedies: <i>Ace
Ventura: Pet Detective</i> (1994) begat <i>The Mask</i> (1994), which begat (you know,
rhymes with &quot;shat&quot;) <i>Dumb and Dumber</i> (1994), which got him in to the more
mainstream <i>Batman Forever</i> (1995), which begat <a href="raceven.html" target="_top"><i>Ace
Ventura: When Nature Calls</i></a> (1995). All these films were gleefully obnoxious, and
all these films made big money; can you say &quot;acting out&quot;?</font></p>

<p>Then came the legendary $20 million deal (which, given the size of the above film's
grosses in relation to Carrey's contribution to them, isn't surprising but prompted much
legitimate criticism along the lines of why any one person should be paid that kind of
money) and the dark, malicious <i>The Cable Guy</i> (1996). Pretty unfunny by most
standards, the film perhaps unwittingly revealed the mean-spirited nature of Carrey's
demented mimicry and orifice-based humor by stripping the story of off-the-wall fantasy
elements and exotic locations and trappings in favor of a more gritty look. Audiences were
startled by its tone -- expecting as they were another flight of fancy -- and the film was
not successful (ironically, the same thing happened to the Farrelly brothers after the
conflicted <i>Dumb and Dumber</i>, although Kingpin was certainly funnier for having the
courage of its mean-spirited convictions). Clearly, a shift in strategy was needed, one
that preferably preserved the essence of his established persona without alienating the
audience: a kinder, gentler Jim Carrey, but still with that undercurrent of insurrection.</p>

<p><img src="images/rliar-1.gif" align="right" hspace="2" vspace="2" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="133">Thus was <i>Liar,
Liar</i> born. Directed by Tom Shadyac, who helmed the kinder, gentler, funnier and, uh,
larger Eddie Murphy of <i>The Nutty Professor</i> (itself a remake of the quintessential
Jerry Lewis film that is to many the root of Carrey's inspiration), <i>Liar, Liar</i> puts
one in mind of James Cameron's solution to the violence inherent in the <i>Terminator</i>
films: presumably to lessen the trauma of an effective killing machine, Cameron inserted a
plot point in <i>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</i> (1990) that had the aghast Edward Furlong
character instruct the cyborg to only shoot people in the kneecaps. Thus was wanton
violence made justifiable. In much the same way, Shadyac and Carrey (who first worked
together on the first <i>Ace Ventura</i> film) have crafted a story in which an,
unexplained bit of magic allows an insensitive father to learn the value of parenting. Tim
Allen and director John Pasquin pulled off the same trick (with the same implausibility)
in the <i>The Santa Clause --</i> another hit -- while Harold Ramis has quietly done it
with the proper panache not once but twice, in the critically praised <i>Groundhog Day</i>
(1993) and the woefully underrated <i>Multiplicity</i> (1996).</p>

<p>Carrey plays Fletcher Reede, a glib but shallow Los Angeles defense attorney with no
time for his five-year-old son Max (Justin Cooper). When his conniving boss Miranda
(Amanda Donohoe, in a role similar to the one she played in the sunset seasons of
&quot;L.A. Law&quot;) forces him to miss the boy's birthday party -- much to the chagrin
of Reede's ex-wife Audrey (&quot;Newsradio&quot;'s Maura Tierney), who may or may not move
away with her cloddish boyfriend Jerry (<i>Twister</i>'s Cary Elwes in the Ralph Bellamy
role) -- Max makes a wish before blowing out the candles on his birthday cake that Daddy
won't be able to lie for just one day.</p>

<p>For no reason at all the wish comes true, forcing Fletcher to rethink his high-stakes
defense of a conniving wife (Jennifer Tilly) out to fleece her husband of his fortune. Of
course Fletcher pulls victory from the jaws of defeat, and of course his triumph is empty
without the love of his family. At this point Liar, Liar shows an inspired bit of pure
lunacy as Fletcher chases down the plane in which Audrey, Max and Jerry are about to fly
away. </p>

<p><img src="images/rliar-2.gif" align="left" hspace="0" WIDTH="121" HEIGHT="200">Although he looks distinctly
stiff and uncomfortable in the first reel or so, the high energy level typical of all his
films soon kicks in and he pulls the movie along, as he did with his other hits, through
sheer force of will. Coincidentally, Carrey flowers at about the time Max's wish does,
conveniently allowing the comic to once again engage in his physical brand of comedy
without much attention to nuance or logic (in one scene set in a courthouse men's room, he
hits the &quot;marble&quot; wall so hard during his schtick that a mirror shakes; for all
the money they lavish on him, couldn't the producers have built stronger sets?).
Particularly memorable is the &quot;pen is blue&quot; routine, while far more mawkish is
the bookend bit in which Fletcher lovingly terrorizes his son with &quot;The Claw&quot; --
his own hand scrunched into the shape of snapping jaws. Particularly refreshing, and
wholly unexpected, are a couple of pointedly self-deprecating references, especially an
exchange between Fletcher and Max where the boy asks if it's true that people who cross
their eyes risk staying that way forever and the response is that some people make a very
good living at it. </p>

<p>But despite the clever closing credit outtakes, in which Carrey's flubbed lines and
Kurtz' rather panicky put-downs (more subtle proof that Carrey can laught at himself?)
make it seem as if the film was the high point to date in the careers of all involved,
there are telltale signs that <i>Liar, Liar</i> has been severely tweaked: where, for
instance, is 13th billed Randall &quot;Tex&quot; Cobb (<i>Raising Arizona</i>), a menacing
hulk of a character actor now glimpsed briefly in a jailhouse scene that feels severely
truncated?</p>

<p>It has been no secret in Hollywood that Carrey aspires to weightier fare, which makes
Liar, Liar oddly touching: he needs to prove his box office clout to soothe nervous
backers, but the more hits he cranks out in wacky mode the more nervous the money people
will be about funding a serious Carrey vehicle. Still, Carrey's public desire to be
considered a dependable, approachable, manageable nice guy capable of carrying a
&quot;serious&quot; film must be seen one step closer to reality, especially since at this
writing <i>Liar, Liar</i> is by far and away the most successful film of the year to date
with a torrid pace that averages out to $20 million a week over its first two months
(remember his crack at the Oscar ceremony following the film's spectacular opening
weekend?). Obviously, whatever elements disenchanted audiences about The Cable Guy have
been rotated and balanced, and fixed to spectacular effect. Jim Carrey is back among the
box office golden boys, with all the comedic baggage -- pro and con -- that special place
in the Hollywood firmament entails.</p>
