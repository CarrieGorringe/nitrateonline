<p><big><strong><big>&quot;H</big></strong>e's tough, your Yank,&quot; someone says of
Robert De Niro's character and his ability to survive the numerous gun battles, car chases
and double-crosses packed into the two hours of <i>Ronin</i> (more on that title later),
and the same might well be said of the principals behind this new, out-of-nowhere action
classic. Taut, taciturn and terrific, <i>Ronin</i> marks a defiant return to form for
veteran director John Frankenheimer (<i>The Manchurian Candidate</i>, <i>Seconds</i>,
&quot;George Wallace,&quot;), the retooling of De Niro into an international action star,
and an audacious and triumphant revival of the kind of moody thrills found in French caper
films of the 1960s and such 1970s American fare as <i>The Seven-Ups</i> and <i>The Driver</i>.</big></p>

<p><img src="images/rronin-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">Working from the
recommendations of a never-seen wheelchair-bound man, five specialists have been brought
together in a Paris warehouse by Irish tactical strategist Dierdre (Natascha McElhone, <a href="rgldneye.html" target="_top"><i>The Devil's Own</i></a> and <a href="rtrumanshow.html" target="_top"><i>The
Truman Show</i></a>) with the promise of a job. Detail-oriented Sam (De Niro) may or may
not have studied at the CIA to master elite covert operations -- &quot;I got my job
through the New York Times,&quot; he quips curtly when asked -- while gravel-voiced
Vincent (Jean Reno, <i>The Professional</i>) is a home-grown French location operative who
can get any thing for anybody. Gregor (Stellan Skarsgård, <a href="rbwaves.html" target="_top"><i>Breaking
the Waves</i></a> and <a href="fberlin98-5.html#Good-Will-Hunting" target="_top"><i>Good Will Hunting</i></a>)
probably learned electronic communication from the KGB, while weapons expert Spence (Sean
Bean, <a href="rgldneye.html" target="_top"><i>GoldenEye</i></a>) and driver Larry (Skipp Sudduth, <a href="rclock.html" target="_top"><em>Clockers</em></a>) apparently come from less pedigreed backgrounds.</p>

<p>Their mission? Steal the distinctively shaped silver case chained to the wrist of --
who cares? They're being paid a lot to get it, and that's that (&quot;my friend, I need
the money,&quot; says one). After an early cash-for-guns swap goes awry, they regroup and
begin planning in earnest.</p>

<p>As they pursue the mysterious case from Nice to Arles and back to Paris, cautious bonds
begin to form and each man's character is glimpsed: Sam and Vincent have a distant but
loose camaraderie (&quot;what would I profit from your death?&quot; asks the Frenchman in
the film's closest approximation to tenderness), Spence is released for melting down under
pressure, and Larry shows the most outward fear. It is only after the arrival of Dierdre's
handler Seamus (Jonathan Pryce, <i>Brazil</i> and <a href="rtomorrow.html" target="_top"><i>Tomorrow
Never Dies</i></a>) that things begin to spin out of control, involving the mysterious
Jean-Pierre (Michel Lonsdale, <i>The Day of the Jackal</i> and <i>Moonraker</i>) and the
larcenous Russian impressario Mikhi (Feodor Atkine, <i>Sorcoress</i> and <i>Three Lives
and Only One Death</i>) in a furious scramble to possess the case and stay alive. Adding
one final note of tension is Sam's never-articulated but nearly fatal fondness for
Dierdre, who hasn't exactly been straight with him... </p>

<p>Though this may sound like tough-guy posturing on the page, a combination of canny
writing and astonishing execution propel the story over some stilted rough spots. Such
lines as &quot;I never walk into a place I don't know how to walk out of,&quot; &quot;You
ever kill anybody? I hurt someone's feelings once,&quot; &quot;at the end of the day we're
likely to be punished for our kindnesses&quot; and &quot;I once removed a guy's appendix
with a grapefruit spoon&quot; are pure David Mamet, and sure enough, working from a story
by J.D. Zeik, the playwright and director imbues the script with static bursts of
epigrammatic information, part post-Cold War paranoia and part multi-leveled gamesmanship
(for whatever reasons he later had his name taken off the credits and replaced with the
pseudonym &quot;Richard Weisz&quot;). </p>

<p><img src="images/rronin-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">The movie's central
metaphor is that of the ronin, the masterless samurai forced into the life of a wandering
outlaw through the humiliation of their masters' deaths (the Japanese characters for the
word literally mean &quot;wave man&quot;). It is a lonely life and to survive one must
live by his or her wits, trusting nobody and adopting a mercenary, if honorable, view of
the world. While this is spelled out explicitly late in the film when De Niro talks with
Jean-Pierre about the latter's hobby of carving these Ronin figures for a huge model (and
rejects the comparison out of hand), the script is shrewd enough to build the references
gradually, with a running gag involving all these tough guys asking variations of the
question &quot;where do I know you from?&quot; at the moments of greatest tension. The
cumulative effect is that of a whole underworld of these specialists, all of whom know
each other, running around the world knocking each other off for faceless bosses. That
Sam's handlers are Irish, bidding against the Russians for the case, is as big a McGuffin
-- Alfred Hitchcock's nickname for the seemingly important plot mechanism or physical
thing that ultimately has no value -- as the contents of the case itself (which you won't
learn here). In a sly refuting of <i>The Manchurian Candidate</i>'s Cold War posturing,
even the concept of nationality itself is rendered meaningless, as Sam repeatedly hints
he's only in it for the money and even the Russian mastermind Mikhi, when cornered, offers
a Chilean passport.</p>

<p>The 68-year-old Frankenheimer, who just won an Emmy for the TNT miniseries &quot;George
Wallace,&quot; brings this world of deceit effortlessly alive through a muscular, assured
approach that manages to incorporate the same brand of distinctive compositions and
provocative blocking of actors he brought to <i>The Manchurian Candidate</i>, tempered
with the sheer love of speed that was the best part of the otherwise stilted <i>Grand Prix</i>.
And what a love of speed it is: there are essentially two car chases in <i>Ronin</i>, the
first through the old quarter of Nice and the second, six minutes that seem like sixty
two-thirds of the way into the picture, through the tunnels underneath Paris (has anyone
else had the thought that the car slamming into an underground pillar -- a featured shot
of the trailer -- is an uncomfortably close visualization of a recent real-life tragedy?).
During these chases nobody in the cars even talks, much less wisecracks, and the sheer
concentration De Niro brings to his driving (clutch -- downshift -- emergency brake --
turn -- NOW!) speaks volumes about the giddy combination of fear, pride, desperation and
thrills that these rogue warriors must feel during the course of a job (&quot;of course
I'm afraid, you think I'm reluctant because I'm happy?&quot; the ever-pragmatic Sam asks
at another juncture).</p>
<i>

<p><img src="images/rronin-3.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">Ronin</i> isn't
without precedent, incorporating as it does such fundamental icons as the honorable loner
and the femme fatale from Jacques Tourneur's <i>Out of the Past</i> and Burt Lancaster's
debut <i>The Killers </i>(expanded from the Hemingway short story and directed by Robert
Siodmak) -- two among many classic American films noir. Also pertinent is the entire
ouevre of French director Jean-Pierre Melville, with <i>Second Breath</i>, <i>Bob Le
Flambeur</i> and <i>Le Samourai</i> particularly recommended (as is anything with Alain
Delon; start with <i>Purple Noon</i>, Rene Clement's loose adaptation of Patricia
Highsmith's &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot; -- another character Sam brings to mind,
immortalized in Wim Wenders' <i>The American Friend</i> and who'll be played in an
upcoming film version by Matt Damon). With its percussive score and fast cars, <i>Ronin</i>
also brings to mind that genre of 1970s caper/chase movies, particularly <i>The French
Connection</i>, its unheralded and unofficial sequel <i>The Seven-Ups</i>, Walter Hill's
singular noir tribute <i>The Driver</i> and even <i>The French Connection II</i> -- which
takes place partly in Marseilles and was directed by none other than John Frankenheimer
(as sleek as the high-performance BMW's Volvo's and Audi's are in <i>Ronin</i>, they can't
hold a candle to the Detroit boats raced and destroyed 20 years ago).</p>

<p>As exhilarating as <i>Ronin</i> is, it can't quite mask its pulp origins. Thus, there's
the old truck-backing-into-the-path-of-a-hillside-car-chase bit, the hoary
kiss-me-so-the-cop-thinks-we're-lovers-and-not-sitting-here-casing-the-chalet routine, and
the ever-popular
pretend-to-be-my-wife-so-we-can-have-our-picture-taken-in-front-of-the-entourage-with-the-case
dodge. </p>

<p>But these are quibbles, and it would be a mistake to dismiss this movie for not
resembling the glib supermen that American action heroes have devolved into since <i>Die
Hard</i>. There was a time and a place for that kind of heroic posturing (and some of
those films remain genre touchstones); with its unglamorous honor and no-nonsense approach
to entertainment (not to mention the strong analogy with Frankenheimer's own journeyman
career), <i>Ronin</i> is something at once reverently classical and cockily new, a
stripped-down action movie that takes its time and knows enough about the history of its
genre to concentrate on the strengths of plot and character. <i>Ronin</i>'s tough, all
right. Tougher than the rest.</p>
