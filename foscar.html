<p><font size="5" face="Times,Times New Roman"><strong>W</strong></font><font size="4" face="Times,Times New Roman">hether it wanted to or not, Hollywood this morning (11
February) officially acknowledged what everybody already seems to know: when it comes to
the Academy Award nominations for the best films of 1996, Independent's Day has arrived.
Four of the five Best Picture nominees -- <i>The English Patient</i> (leading the pack
with 12 nominations), <i>Fargo</i> (seven nods), <i>Secrets &amp; Lies</i> (five) and <i>Shine</i>
(seven) -- were made well outside the remnants of the old studio system, with only<i> <a href="rjmaguire.html" target="_top">Jerry Maguire</a></i> (five) representing a recognizable
&quot;Hollywood&quot; (read: big stars, huge ad budget) movie. And the Oscar field stuck
close to the Golden Globe winners, which isn't so much a sign of conservative voting as it
is a reaffirmation of the nominated films as being the most highly-regarded of the year.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Some prominent titles that at one time or another
had been touted nominated for Best Picture but were bypassed include <i>The People vs.
Larry Flynt</i>, <a href="revita.html" target="_top"><i>Evita</i></a>, <i>The Crucible</i>, <i>Ghosts of
Mississippi</i>, <a href="rtincup.html" target="_top"><i>Tin Cup</i></a> and <a href="rransom.html" target="_top"><i>Ransom</i></a>
(the last two of which were iced out completely), as well as acknowledged long shots <i>The
Portrait of a Lady</i>, <i>Hamlet</i>, <i>Lone Star</i>, <i>Big Night</i>, <a href="rbwaves.html" target="_top"><i>Breaking the Waves</i></a> and <i>Trainspotting</i>. In the case of
<i>Larry Flynt</i>, the anticipated faceoff between director Milos Forman and <i>Patient</i>
producer Saul Zaentz (who teamed up for the Oscar-winning films <i>One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest</i> [1975] and <i>Amadeus</i> [1984] has been averted. As is the tradition,
the year's unchallenged blockbusters, <a href="rid4.html" target="_top"><i>Independence Day</i></a> and <a href="rtwister.html" target="_top"><i>Twister</i></a>, were relegated to a couple of technical awards
each. In fact, of the top ten moneymakers for the year, only number nine, <i>Jerry Maguire</i>,
has any high profile Oscar presence at all, and you'll pass only <i>Primal Fear</i> (27)
and <i>The Mirror Has Two Faces</i> (35) before arriving at <i>The English Patient</i>
(38). Once again, so much for popularity equaling kudos.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Unlike 1992, which the Academy weakly declared the
&quot;Year of the Woman&quot; -- a designation widely misinterpreted and not at all
indicative of that year's distaff behind-the-camera nominees -- the field for Best Actress
and Best Supporting Actress represents the richest group of roles and performers in many a
year. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">The Best Actress nominees are Brenda Blethyn for <i>Secrets
&amp; Lies</i>, Diane Keaton for <i>Marvin's Room</i>, Frances McDormand for <i>Fargo</i>,
Kristin Scott Thomas for <i>The English Patient</i> (not the provocatively creepy <i>Angels
&amp; Insects</i>) and Emily Watson for <i>Breaking the Waves </i>-- an extraordinary
roster by anyone's standards. Not making the final cut but deserving of the Oscar in
almost any other year were Meg Ryan (<i>Courage Under Fire</i>), Courtney Love (<i>The
People vs. Larry Flynt</i> -- a leading performance regardless of reports speculating her
nod would've been in support), Madonna, (<i>Evita</i>), Debbie Reynolds (<i>Mother</i>),
Meryl Streep (<i>Marvin's Room</i>), Gwyneth Paltrow (<i>Emma</i>), Renee Russo (<i>Ransom</i>
or <i>Tin Cup</i> -- take your pick), Gena Rowlands (<i>Unhook the Stars</i> and/or <i>The
Neon Bible</i>), Laura Dern (<i>Citizen Ruth</i>), Heather Matarazzo (<i>Welcome to the
Dollhouse</i>) and Winona Ryder (<i>The Crucible</i>). Notable here are the exclusions of
Love (terrific but appearing in her first major role), Madonna (despite her assurances of
a nomination at the Golden Globes, the Oscar voters didn't love her) and Streep (whose <i>Marvin's
Room</i> co-star Keaton -- a Hollywood insider -- for once overshadows the perennial
nominee). Also, Rachel Portman's lush score for <i>Emma</i> is a finalist in the Original
Musical or Comedy Score category. On the downside, Jane Campion was passed over for a Best
Director nod for her sumptuous <i>The Portrait of a Lady</i>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">For the second year in a row, Joan Allen is a
finalist for Best Supporting Actress, following her quietly powerful turn as the First
Lady in <i>Nixon</i> with the Golden Globe-nominated turn in <i>The Crucible</i>. Lauren
Bacall gets her first Oscar nomination ever as Barbra Streisand's acerbic mother in <i>The
Mirror Has Two Faces</i>, as does Barbara Hershey for the amoral Mme. Merle in <i>The
Portrait of a Lady</i>. Juliette Binoche continues the <i>Patient</i> tidal wave with a
nod, and, in a development applauded by critics who felt her understated and slightly
mysterious lightning rod Hortense was the heart and soul of the movie, Marianne
Jean-Baptiste takes the fifth slot for her magnificent screen debut in Mike Leigh's <i>Secrets
&amp; Lies</i>. Actresses missing in action through no fault of their noteworthy
performances include Renee Zellweger (<i>Jerry Maguire</i> and/or <a href="fsiff96-1.html#the Whole Wide World" target="_top"><i>The Whole Wide World</i></a>), Elizabeth
Peña (<a href="fsiff96-4.html#Lone Star" target="_top"><i>Lone Star</i></a>), Marion Ross (<i>The
Evening Star</i>), Kate Winslet (<i>Hamlet</i>) and Mary Tyler Moore (<i>Flirting with
Disaster</i>).</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">1996 was also a fine year for the fellas, with Best
Actor nods going to Tom Cruise (<i>Jerry Maguire</i>), Ralph Fiennes (<i>The English
Patient</i>), Woody Harrelson (<i>The People vs. Larry Flynt</i> -- not <i>Kingpin</i>),
Geoffrey Rush (<i>Shine</i>) and, perhaps most surprisingly, Billy Bob Thornton (<i>Sling
Blade</i>, only now seeing a wide release). Actors deserving inclusion by not surviving
the cut include Denzel Washington (<i>Courage Under Fire</i>), Chris Cooper (<i>Lone Star</i>),
Kevin Costner (<i>Tin Cup</i>), Daniel Day-Lewis (<i>The Crucible</i>), Brad Pitt (<i>Sleepers</i>),
Nicholas Cage (<a href="rtherock.html" target="_top"><i>The Rock</i></a>), Nathan Lane (<a href="rbcage.html" target="_top"><i>The Birdcage</i></a>), Mel Gibson (<i>Ransom</i>), Al Pacino (<i>Looking
for Richard</i>) and Kenneth Branagh (<i>Hamlet</i>). Traditionally, Hollywood loves
actors and actresses who play mentally or addiction-challenged characters (call it <i>The
Lost Weekend</i>/<i>Forrest Gump</i> factor), which might explain three of the five
nominees -- not to mention Watson's character in <i>Breaking the Waves</i> and, arguably,
South Dakota lawperson Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) in <i>Fargo</i>. On an
irreverent note, Jackie Chan seems to be outdoing the action stars, with <i>Supercop</i>
and <i>Rumble in the Bronx</i> scoring with audiences. And when was the last time the
deserving actress list was larging than the actor's?</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">The Best Supporting Actor nominees include early
favorite (&quot;Show me the money!&quot;) Cuba Gooding Jr. (<i>Jerry Maguire</i>), William
H. Macy (<i>Fargo</i>), Armin Mueller-Stahl (<i>Shine</i>), Edward Norton (Paramount's <i>Primal</i>
<i>Fear</i>, although it just as well could have been for the independents <i>Larry Flynt</i>
or Woody Allen's <i>Everyone Says I Love You</i>), and current Film Comment cover guy
James Woods (<i>Ghosts of Mississippi</i>). Cheech Marin (<i>Tin Cup</i>), Joe Morton (<i>Lone
Star</i>), Robert Carlyle (<i>Trainspotting</i>), Samuel L. Jackson (<a href="rtimekll.html" target="_top"><i>A Time to Kill</i></a> and/or <i>The Long Kiss Goodnight</i>) lead
the list of also-rans.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">In the Best Director category, the nominees are
Anthony Minghella for <i>The English Patient</i>, Joel Coen for <i>Fargo</i>, Milos Forman
for <i>The People vs. Larry Flynt</i>, Mike Leigh for <i>Secrets &amp; Lies</i> and Scott
Hicks for <i>Shine</i>. Elbowed out by the Independent wave include Lars von Trier (<i>Breaking
the Waves</i>), Cameron Crowe (<i>Jerry Maguire</i>, a Best Picture nominee), Ron Howard (<i>Ransom</i>),
Ron Shelton (<i>Tin Cup</i>), Billy Bob Thornton (who directed himself to a Best Actor nod
in <i>Sling Blade</i>), Jan Sverak (<a href="rkolya.html" target="_top"><i>Kolya</i></a>), Kenneth
Branagh (<i>Hamlet</i>), Nicholas Hytner (<i>The Crucible</i>), Jan De Bont (<i>Twister</i>),
Alan Parker (<i>Evita</i>), Woody Allen (<i>Everyone Says I Love You</i>), the team of
Stanley Tucci and Campbell Scott (<i>Big Night</i>), and Danny Boyle (<i>Trainspotting</i>).</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Other random observations: Central and Eastern
Europe dominate the Best Foreign Film category, with Georgia's <i>A Chef in Love</i> and
Russia's <i>The Prisoner of the Mountains</i> joining odds-on favorite <i>Kolya</i> from
the Czech Republic as well as Norway's <i>The Other Side of Sunday</i> and France's <i>Ridicule</i>
in this often-overlooked but vitally important sweepstakes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">One of Hollywood's favorite statistics is the one
pointing out that only four times since 1949 has the winner of the Directors Guild of
America award (given 8 March) not gone on to win the Best Director Oscar. This year, all
five of the DGA nominees are first-timers (a first since the 1950s), and two of them --
Scott Hicks and Mike Leigh -- aren't even Guild members. Only Cameron Crowe (<i>Jerry
Maguire</i>) isn't on both lists -- his Oscar slot is occupied by Milos Forman who,
ironically, has won DGA awards for <i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest</i> and <i>Amadeus</i>.
</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">And Woody Allen, who can usually be counted on for
an Original Screenplay nomination (if not a Best Director nod) in any given year, is
conspicuously absent this year. But that's OK, as he'll have no distractions from his
regular clarinet night at whatever bar it is he plays in instead of going to the ceremony.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">The 69th Academy Awards ceremony will be broadcast
over ABC 24 March at 9:00 pm (EST), live from the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles.</font></p>
