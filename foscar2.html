<hr size="4" width="60">

<p><font size="5" face="Times,Times New Roman"><strong>T</strong></font><font size="4" face="Times,Times New Roman">he headline of the 69th Academy Awards ceremony, held last
night (24 March) at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, is that the British import <i>The
English Patient</i> won nine of the 12 Oscars for which it was nominated, including Best
Picture (Saul Zaentz, producer) and Best Director (Anthony Minghella, whose only previous
movie was the little-seen British import <i>Truly, Madly, Deeply</i>). This places it in
the exalted company of the 1959 remake of <i>Ben-Hur</i> (11 awards), <i>West Side Story</i>
(10), <i>Gigi</i> (9) and <i>The Last Emperor</i> (9) as one of the most decorated films
in Academy Awards history.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">But the big news of this high-profile event is just
below the surface. In a year in which Oscar embraced perhaps its most traditional Best
Picture winner in a decade, it was a slew of &quot;little,&quot; &quot;independent&quot;
people and pictures that dominated the balloting and the awards. At the precise moment
that Juliette Binoche from <i>The English Patient</i> bested &quot;Old Hollywood&quot;
icon Lauren Bacall (<i>The Mirror Has Two Faces</i>) for the Best Supporting Actress
Oscar, the hip elements of the nominees coalesced with the freshness of the proceedings to
send a very clear message to the world: the old guard is out, and the new guard,
unorganized and clubby though it may be, is in. Think about it: who were the oldest, most
prominent celebrities to appear on stage all evening? Jack Valenti? Arthur Hiller? <i>Mary
Poppins</i>? In place of old reliables like Jack Lemmon and, uh, well, you know, the
producers trotted out the likes of Beavis and Butt-head and the odd couple teaming of
Chris Farley and David Spade (the real-life B &amp; B) to do their bidding. This, not to
mention Jim Carrey playing his expensively-swathed butt-cheeks, marks a wholesale change
in the way Oscar does business. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Actually, the &quot;independent&quot; moniker may be
slightly misleading. Miramax, whose films won precisely half of the 24 statuettes
available last night, has been gobbled up by the Disney empire, and Gramercy, whose <i>Fargo</i>
interrupted the <i>English Patient</i> tsunami with wins for Best Original Screenplay and
Best Actress, is owned by the conglomerate Polygram. Tri-Star, the relatively youngish
studio once considered laughable (one critic wag used to call it &quot;One-Star&quot;),
was the only identifiable Hollywood studio to win a major award, Best Supporting Actor for
a plainly exuberant Cuba Gooding Jr. in <a href="rjmaguire.html" target="_top"><i>Jerry Maguire</i></a>
(incredibly, the only people on the west coast he didn't thank were his team of agents).
Universal won one (Best Makeup for <i>The Nutty Professor</i>), Paramount won one (The <i>Ghost
and the Darkness</i>, for Sound Effects Editing), and Twentieth Century-Fox, the studio
that pulled the plug at the 11th hour on <i>The English Patient</i>, also won a single
Academy Award (Best Visual Effects for <a href="rid4.html" target="_top"><i>Independence Day</i></a>).
Other single winners included Buena Vista, DreamWorks (with their initial nomination),
Fine Line and Sony Pictures Entertainment. Left out in the cold were October Films, the
distributor of surprise art-house crossover hit <i>Secrets and Lies</i>, Warner Bros. and
MGM. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">As usual, the evening was full of good sports
putting on brave faces in defeat. Reynolds joked good-naturedly with daughter Carrie
Fisher (one of the show's principal co-writers and, to her eternal credit, Princess Leia
in the first three <i>Star Wars</i> films) about missing out for <i>Mother</i>; Madonna
showed up and performed a moving version of &quot;You Must Love Me&quot; from <a href="revita.html" target="_top"><i>Evita</i></a> even though she and the film were snubbed (the song
won, prompting speculation that &quot;They Must Have Told Her&quot;); Celine Dion filled
in for an ailing Natalie Cole and sang not only her Oscar-nominated (and winning) tune
&quot;Because You Loved Me&quot; from the snoozefest <i>Up Close and Personal</i> but
&quot;I Finally Found Someone&quot; from <i>The Mirror Has Two Faces</i>; on the subject
of <i>Mirror</i>, Bacall was graciously reticent when Binoche impulsively tried to shift
attention to her from the podium. John Sayles reacted with stoic calm to the news that his
masterwork <a href="fsiff96-4.html#Lone Star" target="_top"><i>Lone Star</i></a> had lost the Best
Original Screenplay Oscar to Ethan and Joel Coen's <i>Fargo</i> (well, that was a tough
category to pick a favorite in anyway&#151;they all deserved it); David Letterman cameoed
in the elaborate pre-festivities sendup of the winning films starring returning
toastmaster Billy Crystal (who should be made Oscar Host for Life) and Best Actress
nominee Brenda Blethyn, whose extraordinary performance in <i>Secrets and Lies</i> always
looked like caricature in out-of-context clips, was gracious in defeat to <i>Fargo</i>'s
Frances McDormand after making no secret of the fact that she <i>really wanted to win</i>
(a pity Emily Watson couldn't have bested them both for the emotionally raw <a href="rbwaves.html" target="_top"><i>Breaking the Waves</i></a>).</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">On the other side of the coin, the producers cattily
cut to Barbra Streisand, who had refused to sing &quot;I Finally Found Someone&quot; to
protest the exclusion of <i>The Mirror Has Two Faces</i> from the main categories, at just
the moment Crystal larded on the praise for Madonna's bravery in performing &quot;You Must
Love Me.&quot; Similarly, that Tim Robbins and Winona Ryder were even allowed onstage in
their cadaverous outfits sort of negates the existence of personal handlers; aren't they
supposed to be looking out for the best interests of stars? And who knows what to make
anymore of David Helfgott, the real-life emotionally and mentally-challenged pianist whose
life is the basis for <i>Shine</i>. After swearing he wouldn't do it, the producers
brought him out to play a version of &quot;Flight of the Bumblebee&quot; that had just
been featured in a clip from the film. It sounded nimble in tempo, but decidedly choppy in
overall quality. Do the music critics, who&#146;ve been panning his performances during
his sold-out concert series, have a valid point? Is this guy a genuine prodigy, or one
whose talents have long since been damaged beyond repair, so much so that he has been
reduced to nothing more than a sideshow act with a nice high-culture sheen?</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">And speaking of <i>Shine</i>, it was rookies' night
out, as Geoffrey Rush won Best Actor for the Australian drama (the wrong
Helfgott&#151;Noah Taylor as the young David should've been nominated). Although
prominently featured in the audience, Mel Gibson, with whom Rush co-starred in the first <i>Mad
Max</i> film, showed no signs of recognizing him (maybe that's what Hollywood'll do to
you). In a similar vein, Binoche, Minghella and Billy Bob Thornton were first-time
nominees and winners; only McDormand, who was nominated in the supporting actress category
for 1989's <i>Mississippi Burning</i>, had been there before.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Zaentz's Oscar for producing the unkillable English
Patient joins his other two, one for <i>Amadeus</i> and the other for <i>One Flew Over the
Cuckoo's Nest</i>. A fourth statuette marked his conveniently timed receipt of the Irving
Thalberg Award&#151;in a year when his third producing Oscar ties him with Sam Spiegel (<i>On
the Waterfront</i>, <i>The Bridge on the River Kwai</i> and <i>Lawrence of Arabia</i>) for
the most Oscars ever won by a producer. See a trend here?</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">To the surprise of no one in the know, <a href="rkolya.html" target="_top"><i>Kolya</i></a> won the Best Foreign Film statuette (the first ever
win for the Czech Republic, newly split from Slovakia), prompting director Jan Sverak to
patiently explain to it that it was going to Prague, &quot;a city you've probably never
heard of.&quot; Little-known fact: this is his second Oscar, the first being a Student
Academy Award in the late 1980s for a short film called <i>The Oil Gobblers</i>.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">What does all of this mean? Ironically enough, the
bottom line to this wholesale revolution may be business as usual. Look for more
independently produced, big epics with lots of sand to cash in on <i>The English Patient</i>
(do you think it would've won had Fox prevailed upon Zaentz to cast Demi Moore in the
Kristin Scott Thomas role?) and more quirky, smaller, character-driven films to ride the <i>Fargo</i>/<i>Sling
Blade</i> wave (a cheery thought, that). So, big &quot;event&quot; pictures on one side,
little &quot;cutting edge&quot; pictures on the other. And in the middle ... the same
stuff Hollywood's been churning out for nearly a century (admittedly, much more of this
cannon fodder might now be made by independents: <em>Happy Gilmore</em> without
compromises?). So, yes, it is a new era in Hollywood ... for now</font></p>
