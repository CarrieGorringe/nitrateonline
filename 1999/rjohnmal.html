<p class="MsoBodyText"><font size="5"><b>T</b></font><font size="4">hank you,
Spike Jonze! Thank you, Charlie Kaufman! And, of course, thank you, John
Malkovich! <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Being John Malkovich</i> is one
of the oddest, funniest, imaginative fantasies to fall off the screen since
Buckaroo Banzai heroically dropped across the Eighth Dimension fifteen years
ago. Wacky, wild, side-splitting, and refreshing as all hell. And then some. For
this skewered cautionary fairy tale you’re the Pinocchio and director Jonze
(graduating from award-winning music videos and commercials in his brilliant
feature debut) and screenwriter Kaufman (his inspired first produced work) are
the Geppettos casually jerking your strings, much like they are manipulating
Craig Schwartz (John Cusack), a creative yet failed puppeteer. His ten-year,
passionless marriage to the schlumpy Lotte (Cameron Diaz), a pet store employee,
is just as frayed as everything in their dumpy apartment. The diapered Elijah, a
pet chimp staying with them, has his own psychological troubles, Lotte insists,
and damned if his childhood traumas don’t get revealed in the simian’s own
sepia-toned flashback. Cool.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Jonze, who appeared as the loutish Private Conrad
opposite George Clooney in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Three Kings</i>,
now turns positively Conradian, strutting his dark stuff behind the camera,
propping sight gags and outlandish situations up in domino fashion for one
hilarious Rube Goldberg cascade after another. Kaufman’s marvelous creation is
molded with such blistering, yet absurdly spontaneous force, that its
breath-taking originality induces you to keep putting you hand up to catch your
jaw from dropping. Good thing it’s late in the season (well it is here in the
East), otherwise we’d all be catching flies.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The premise, which doesn’t do the film justice when
reduced to printed words, finds Craig on the other side of the marionette and
emotional strings when he begins work as a filing clerk for LesterCorp., located
in a seemingly routine Manhattan office building, except for being stuck in the
cramped half-floor between the seventh and eighth stops on the elevator (bring
your crowbar). It’s a Twilight Zone world filled with the batty perhaps
secretive, 105-year-old (and still horny) Dr. Lester (Orson Bean) and his ditsy,
hearing-impaired receptionist Floris (Mary Kay Place). When a folder drops
behind a filing cabinet in the Deep Storage room, Craig discovers a small
doorway with a glass knob. It’s big enough for a white rabbit, but there’s
none (visible) pulling him in, yet he enters and finds himself inside you know
who, reading the morning paper and munching on toast, an observer for a quarter
hour before being dumped, damp as a mop, in a ditch on the side of the New
Jersey Turnpike. This fascinating portal offers Craig a chance to seduce fellow
worker Maxine (Catherine Keener), but she’s more interested in the commercial
aspects of this surrealistic window, offering $200 tickets to all takers for
their 15 minutes of fame, advertising the excursion with the come on “Ever
want to be someone else?”<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Of course, it’s not all that simple, as sexual
identities and repressed desires begin to unravel, while Craig overstays at the
Malkovich Red Roof Inn a little too long (and with a decided Machiavellian
slant), pulling strings while hiding out in the actor-turned-master
puppeteer’s head. The film takes a decidedly bleak turn as it nears its
conclusion, with anxious intrigue and plot twists around every corner. It’s
all devilish and delicious in its own goofy way.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">There are millions of dark laughs here, none hurled at
you like a custard pie. They’re served up over easy, like the LesterCorp
orientation video, a spoof of those badly-acted industrial films, a mockumentary
delving into the history of the shortness-obsessed company. Or a running gag,
starting with a confused cab driver insisting he liked Malkovich portraying a
jewel thief, despite the actor’s insistence that he never played such a
character. There’s also evidence of a Maxine action figure (send me one!).
But, oh, when J.M. takes matters into his own head, that’s one of the most
imaginative cinematic conundrums you’re ever likely to see, outside of an
episode of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Star Trek</i>.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The cast couldn’t be better in evoking the madness
found here, and they jump into this revisionist Coen/Gilliam world with earnest,
deadpan glee, particularly Cusack as the frazzled, long-haired second banana
puppet meister. As Craig, he’s a genius in his own mind, stuck in neutral, be
it his profession or his life, screaming for recognition and relief. Diaz dumps
her gorgeous façade for an unrecognizable, greasy lunatic spin. Keener shines
as the lust object for Craig, Lotte, and Malkovich. I’ve admired her ever
since Tom DiCillo’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Living in Oblivion</i>,
another well-scripted effort. Of course John Malkovich’s expedition into
self-parody will further cap a career already filled with success. Mary Kay
Place and Orson Bean rise to the occasion with offbeat interpretations, while
Charlie Sheen pops up as himself, a confidant to Malkovich concerned about his
sexual underpinnings, innocuously wondering if John might be interested in
“hot lesbian witches,” a throwaway thought that might be closer in truth to
the film’s insane reality than you think. Sean Penn and Brad Pitt get a few
seconds of screen time too, joining in on the fun.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Technical kudos to frequent Jones collaborators K.K.
Barrett for simple, effective production design, and director of photography
Lance Acord for capturing the mayhem with appropriate gloom. Carter Burwell, a
Coen brothers’ alumni, has rearranged the same motifs he used in last year’s
<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Gods and Monsters</i>. It works just as
well the second time around.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This is a film YOU MUST SEE TO BELIEVE. Ripley’s, move
over!</p>
