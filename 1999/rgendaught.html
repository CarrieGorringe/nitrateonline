<p><big><strong><big>E</big></strong>ven though there's only one scene where characters
creep around nervously trying to avoid hidden land mines, the actors in the goofy murder
mystery thriller <em>The General's Daughter</em> behave with that same stiff uneasiness
throughout the duration. That's a particularly surprising disappointment when your lead is
played by John Travolta, who can be a such a comfortable, engaging presence. Here, playing
Army investigator Paul Brenner, who works to uncover the truth behind the apparent rape
and murder of the titular female Army officer, his every movement indicates a desire to be
somewhere else. That may be because the script by Christopher Bertolini and veteran
William Goldman moves so uneasily itself, between over-baked drama, silly action, sexual
sordidness, and sarcastic humor. Or it may be because the vapid dialogue has more cliches
per minute than a commercial jingle. Or maybe because the director has done nothing but
work on commercials and one previous sarcastically-minded action fiesta. Or maybe Travolta
is just slumming. Whatever the case, he and his costars appear very much lost at sea, and
by the time the film's plot runs its course, that seems as good a place for them as any.</big></p>

<p>The most likely reason for Travolta's awkwardness is that there just isn't all that
much for him to do. Since absolutely nothing is at stake for Paul Brenner in his
investigation of the murder, <em>The General's Daughter</em> has all the dramatic weight
of an episode of <em>Murder, She Wrote</em>, or an Agatha Christie novel, where the energy
is dedicated not towards an emotional exploration of the investigator, but the satisfying
revelation of the killer's identity. <img src="Images/rgendaught-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="147">What's irksome about <em>The General's Daughter</em> is that it
doesn't invest much energy there either. Besides the fact that none of the numerous
suspects are particularly interesting, the final revealing light bulb that pops up over
Brenner's head isn't provoked or justified by anything but the need to (graciously) end
the film, and the revelation itself is as head-scratchingly arbitrary as possible. So what
does <em>The General's Daughter</em> care about? Oddly enough, political statements,
spelled out for us in postscripts regarding the importance of giving equal opportunity to
women in the military and to remind us that rape victims need love and care. But therein
lies the heart of the film's problem - frivolous entertainment is the overriding agenda,
not substance. It's hard to get both, and this attempt, like most, delivers neither.</p>

<p>The mystery plot that overwhelms all other possible concerns combines the sexually
charged undercurrents of <em>Presumed Innocent</em> and the military self-investigation of
<em>Courage Under Fire</em> or <em>A Few Good Men</em>, but the overriding tone - which
doesn't always feel intentional - is closer to the hyped-up jokiness of something like <em>Con
Air</em>. Since <em>The General's Daughter</em> has been directed by Simon West, whose
last (and first) directorial effort was, in fact, <em>Con Air</em>, that's a pretty cheap
and easy comparison to make. <img src="Images/rgendaught-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="147">But it is not an inaccurate one. It's difficult to take anything seriously
here, no matter how serious and sordid the material becomes. For instance, Brenner gets a
sidekick, a tough-as-nails rape counselor (Madeleine Stowe) who also happens to be a past
love interest. (And it's typical of the film's awkwardly multiplied personality that one
of its characters can be labeled as both a rape counselor and a sidekick). Stowe and
Travolta throw half-hearted verbal barbs at each other in an attempt at something
approximating romantic wit (and as stiff as Travolta is, multiply that times two for
Stowe), and it plays as nothing but a gracelessly grafted on attempt at lightness to
soften the more unpleasant nature of the storyline. But these paints don't mix well, and
the end color isn't pretty. <em>The General's Daughter</em> is one big hedged bet, with
West, Bertolini, and Goldman constantly undercutting what the film is trying to accomplish
at any given time. When Brenner isn't facing tediously heavy-handed, banal realities about
military and political opportunism, he's shoving cardboard bad guys into motorboat
propeller blades. </p>
