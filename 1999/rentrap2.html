<p><big><i><big><strong>E</strong></big>ntrapment</i> is not a particularly good movie,
but it raises some interesting questions about today&#146;s action genre. In this age of
high-school shootings and nihilistic, Tarantino-inspired gangster mayhem pulsating from
screens everywhere, there&#146;s something refreshing about a film where the
flesh-piercing bullets and abrasive verbiage are kept to a minimum. <i>Entrapment</i>
emphasizes the classy grace of a neo-Bond Sean Connery and the magnetic, fiery energy of
Catherine Zeta-Jones over the roar of violence that accents the current state of the
actioner art form. In fact, the incredibly attractive duo doesn&#146;t kill anyone. But if
looks could kill, this pairing could start a massacre. The movie knows this, and spends
much of its time on facial close-ups. The glory days of watching interesting faces on the
screen, when the profile of a Newman, a McQueen, or, well, a Connery, packed as much
energy as a Terminator face-off, is echoed in this glitzy, star-focused approach. But is
this approach still relevant in the age of Joel Silver and Michael Bay state-of-the-art
techno-slaughters?</big></p>

<p><img src="Images/rentrap-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="100">Box office
receipts will tell. However, the fact that <i>Entrapment</i> is also boring and hollow
makes one realize that the power of the scriptwriter&#146;s pen is, in the end, stronger
than the mugs of even the most charismatic screen personalities. Telling the
none-too-original tale of a professional thief and the admiring sleuth-come-apprentice
that trails him, the movie is a series of double-crosses and plot twists that aren&#146;t
terribly kinetic or surprising. Connery plays Mac, an aging art thief who lives a hermetic
life on an island castle in the UK. After a priceless Rembrandt is stolen from a high-rise
apartment suite, insurance company investigator Gin (Zeta-Jones) is called in by her
swooning employer Cruz (Will Patton) to shed some light on who committed the theft. Gin
immediately suspects Mac, and follows him from New York to Scotland. </p>

<p>All the while, Connery&#146;s wary crook is several steps ahead. He confronts and
blackmails Gin, persuading her to team up on an elaborate scheme to lift a jewel mask.
This she accomplishes via a gymnastic bout of wriggling, writhing, and sliding past
hundreds of surveillance lazers. This sequence, and those which follow as the duo embark
on a series of increasingly daring capers, could most aptly be described as James Bond
lite. There&#146;s a mildly suspenseful climactic setup in which Connery and Jones
tightrope across a series of metal planks atop the Petronas Twin Towers in Kuala Lumpur,
with the millenium -- and security SWAT teams -- closing in behind them. But dangling this
rather light-alloy stuff in front of a generation of <i>Matrix</i> fans is a risky gamble.
Action doesn&#146;t necessarily need a Wild Bunch-style bloodbath to make it exciting, but
if you lay off the firepower, you&#146;d better have some compelling characters to hold
the viewer&#146;s attention in this jaded age.</p>

<p><img src="Images/rentrap-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="100">However, the script
is so concerned with moving its heist elements along, it doesn&#146;t stop to consider any
real personality details. Most of the dialogue is expository, clearing up the many plot
twists. The fact that both leads are guarding crucial identity secrets seems more an
attention-holding gimmick than a key to any real character psychology. And the supporting
players, including Ving Rhames as Connery&#146;s sidekick-with-a-secret and Will Patton as
Zeta-Jones&#146; jealous boss, have to trudge through some truly by-the-numbers terrain.</p>

<p>There&#146;s a cookie-cutter feel to the rhythm and structure of <i>Entrapment</i> that
brings to mind other generic thrillers from hit-or-miss directors, like Ridley
Scott&#146;s all-style, no-substance Michael Douglas vehicle, <i>Black Rain</i>, or Robert
Towne&#146;s <i>Tequila Sunrise</i>, which paired the equally gorgeous Michelle Pfeiffer
and Mel Gibson with a so-what story. Director Jon Amiel has been all over the map with
past projects, including the serial killer thriller <i>Copycat</i> and Bill Murray&#146;s
recent comedy flop<i>, The Man Who Knew Too Little</i>. In the hands of a more
self-assured action director like John Woo or James Cameron, <i>Entrapment</i> might have
evolved into a leaner, meaner action machine. But there are plenty of those around. What <i>Entrapment</i>
really needs is a script that gets us inside the drop-dead gorgeous heads of these two
stars, instead of one that merely scans their beauty from the surface.</p>
