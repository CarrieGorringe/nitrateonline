<b><big><big><a name="bulworth" href="../rbulworth.html" target="_top"><i>

<p>Bulworth</i></a> (USA, 1998)</big></big></b> </p>

<p>&quot;The populace is unaroused,&quot; notes the opening credit crawl drily, referring
to the American political landscape as of mid-March 1996. Popular incumbent California
democrat Jay Billington Bulworth (Warren Beatty) seems more unaroused than most, bored
with his stump speech and reduced to sitting catatonically at his desk surfing cable. In
an early plot twist that could have spun the film to a lower level but doesn&#146;t, the
senator hires a hitman to kill him over a critical weekend, then decides life is worth
living when he meets the mysterious Nina at an otherwise catastrophic fundraiser. Diving
headfirst into contemporary black culture, Bulworth begins to rap his speeches and even
dresses the part -- all while eluding the hit he&#146;s trying desperately to cancel.
Drenched in neon greens and dusky blues, the movie looks first-rate, thanks to Vittorio
Storaro&#146;s lensing and Dean Tavoularis&#146; production design. And like his veteran
collaborators, Beatty brings an old-guard energy to the proceedings missing from most of
today&#146;s mainstream movies: there&#146;s simply no one coming up behind him with the
shrewd combination of idealistic energy and sincere cynicism necessary to make a satire
like this work. And nobody is better at the multilayered moral befuddlement that made such
anti-heroes as Clyde Barrow palatable to a broad audience. Alongside Hal Ashby&#146;s <i>Shampoo</i>
(produced, co-written by and starring Beatty), Michael Ritchie&#146;s <i>The Candidate</i>
and Robert Altman&#146;s landmark <i>Nashville</i> (as well as, on a more serious level,
Beatty&#146;s <i>The Parallax View</i> and <i>All the President&#146;s Men</i> -- both
directed by the late, great Alan J. Pakula) on the short list of great American political
burlesques, <i>Bulworth</i> has much to arouse, confuse and inspire the idealist.
Available in full-frame and widescreen video editions, as well as a Spanish subtitled tape
and a DVD edition.</p>

<p><i>Ever After</i></a> (USA, 1998)</big></big></b> </p>

<p>Against all odds, this genre-busting spin on the Cinderella story works, sort of:
currently busy Drew Barrymore -- she&#146;s also in the much less successful new video
release Home Fries -- stars as Danielle, a buff scullery maid in 16<sup>th</sup>-century
France who navigates the touchy demands of her hapless betrothed (Douogray Scott) and evil
stepmother Rodmilla (Anjelica Huston) while keeping her eyes firmly on the twin prizes of
emancipation and autonomy. That sounds like a mouthful for a mall movie, but Ever After is
endowed with a peculiar blend of styles that result in a fresh twist on the old tale. The
sumptuous period décor is populated simultaneously by young people who speak as if
they&#146;re strolling about the mall and authority figures (including Patrick Godfrey as
conveniently wise and accessible Leonardo Da Vinci) with imposing English accents. The
authentic tone of the screenplay by Susanna Grant, director Andy Tennent and Rick Parks is
undercut somewhat by an uneven focus that leaves the audience confused about how to feel.
Peril is peril and laughs are laughs, but the two rarely mesh without diluting each other.
The whole thing is scored to that pulsing kind of music that the kids are really going for
right now (even terrible movies gain legitimacy with eclectic, radio-friendly tunes). This
savvy brew has even aged well in a year, as it fits snugly among the slew of upcoming
Shakespeare-inspired teen traumas that are currently all the rage. There&#146;s a dubbed
Spanish language tape available.</p>

<p><b><i>Living Out Loud</i></a> (USA, 1998)</b></big></big> </p>

<p>A fatally muddled focus is also at the heart of screenwriter Richard La
Gravenese&#146;s directorial debut, a highly-anticipated but underwhelming comedy of urban
manners that manages to be fleetingly charming entirely on the strength of a wistful
performance from OllyHollHolly Hunter. She&#146;s Judith, a very upscale New York
thirtysomething whose doctor-husband Bob (Martin Donovan) dumps her for this year&#146;s
model. Looking around for any kind of legitimate human contact, Hunter develops a hesitant
relationship with Pat (Danny DeVito), the genial elevator operator in her building who is
slowly drowing in gambling debts. She also befriends singer Liz Bailey (Queen Latifah),
who takes her to an after-hours club that, like a few sequences in the film, may or may
not be a fantasy come to life. Although his first original screenplay, <i>The Fisher</i> <i>King</i>,
was nominated for an Oscar, La Gravenese has specialized in literary adaptions of late:
his resume now includes the scripts of <i>The Horse Whisperer</i>, <i>The Bridges of
Madison County</i>, <i>Beloved</i> and<i> The Mirror Has Two Faces</i>. It&#146;s that
last work that&#146;s closest in tone to <i>Living Out Loud</i>, as genuinely quirky
characters whine unconvincingly while stuck in lives a huge percentage of the
country&#146;s population can only dream about. In the end, Judith and Pat and Liz and Bob
inhabit a kind of tastefully decorated alternative universe and their problems, while
genuine, never really matter a hill of beans in this crazy world. For a more successful
treatment of the same kind of provocative material, check out Alan Rudolph&#146;s 1984 gem<i>
Choose Me</i>. <i>Living Out Loud</i> is also available in a bare bones DVD edition.</p>

<p>One Hundred and One Dalmations</a></i> (USA, 1961)</big></big></b> </p>

<p>Vastly superior to the 1996 live-action remake, the original animated version of the
uh, tale, is one of the studio&#146;s most genial, solid and reality-based cartoon
features (note the proper title, which is spelled out onscreen as opposed to the number
used on the video box). Set to a swingin&#146; score by George Bruns, the movie is
narrated by the dalmation Pongo, whose &quot;pet&quot; Roger, a songwriter, is a bachelor
who marries a woman who just happens to have a girl dalmation. The memorable villainness
is the immortal Cruella De Vil, who snatches the puppies of the title. Also out this month
from the Disney machine is their by-the-numbers remake of the beloved <i>Mighty Joe Young</i>,
a perfunctory exercise in SFX that somehow manages to enervate the awesome technology used
to bring the annoyingly cuddly beast to life. Pssst: want to see some real special
effects? Rent any movie directed by Ray Harryhausen, who can be glimpsed in the party
scene of <i>Mighty Joe Young</i> with 1950s starlet Terry Moore (he started as an
assistant on Ernest B. Schoedsack&#146;s Oscar-winning 1949 original -- the club scene of
which outdoes anything here). Try the 1956 <i>20 Million Miles to Earth</i> or <i>1958&#146;s
The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad</i> and go from there. Now <i>those </i>are some special
effects. One final note: two of the six directing animators on <i>One Hundred and One
Dalmations</i> were Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, whose friendship and work is
celebrated in the 1995 documentary <i>Frank and Ollie</i> -- which is also newish on tape
(last final note: among the many lasting creations of Thomas and Johnston were Baloo and
Mowgli in the great Disney classic <i>The Jungle Book</i>. When will they stop remaking --
and diminishing -- these things?). Neither title is on DVD.</p>

<p><b><i>One True Thing</i></a> (USA, 1998)</b></big></big> </p>

<p>This glossy weepie, accomplished yet manipulative, falls back on the same kind of
family medical crisis that could be it&#146;s own genre by now (<i>Terms of Endearment</i>
comes to mind, and look how successful that movie was). So it came as no surprise to see
Meryl Streep garner her thirteenth Best Actress Oscar nomination as Kate Gulden, supermom
to Renee Zellweger&#146;s grown up daughter Ellen and uberwife to strong-willed and more
than a little self indulgent college prof George (William Hurt). When Ellen is summoned
home by a clearly annoyed George to care for the increasingly ill Kate, the
picture-perfect family begins to crack under the strain of the individuals within it. As
much as one would like to be moved by this emotional material and the skillful playing of
it, the fact remains that there&#146;s very little here that hasn&#146;t been represented
more successfully elsewhere, leaving <i>One True Thing </i>as a technical exercise in
sentimental dramatics which can&#146;t really stand up to the big-screen treatment.
Surprisingly, the film was directed by Carl Franklin, who burst on to the scene with the
ultraviolent 1992 Billy Bob Thornton-penned <i>One False Move </i>(interesting title
dichotomy, that) and also directed the Denzel Washington starrer <i>Devil in a Blue Dress</i>.
Sure, he&#146;s a competent filmmaker and <i>One True Thing</i> goes through it&#146;s
paces admirably, but it&#146;s hard to work up a lot of enthusiasm for another movie in
which audiences are instructed how to feel in part by the songs of Bette Midler. The DVD
has numerous extras, and there&#146;s a Spanish tape as well.</p>

<big><big><a href="../rpsntville.html" name="pleasantville" target="_top">

<p><b><i>Pleasantville</i></a> (USA, 1998)</b></big></big> </p>

<p>Reacting to the litany of pessimism in his life, teenager David (Tobey Maguire) has
become addicted to the &quot;Father Knows Best&quot;-ish 1950s television show
&quot;Pleasantville,&quot; where life proceeds without crisis or stress in picture-perfect
black and white. His popular sister Jennifer (Reese Witherspoon) thinks he&#146;s a jerk.
Yet when the two are somehow injected into the show itself -- the result of a magical
remote control device given to them by repairman Don Knotts -- their very presence begins
to upset the small-screen citizenry and as each townie becomes more aware and emancipated
they begin to turn (gasp!) <i>color</i>. What begins as a genuinely ingenious idea
succumbs to the temptation of a Serious Message as themes of injustice and intolerance
presented in the third act overwhelm the technical razzle-dazzle of the first two. Still, <i>Pleasantville</i>
has some subversive digs at sexual metaphors and bohemian posturing, and this may be the
only film to date on home video that has a series of screens prior to the opening credits
allowing the viewer to adjust fleshtones. For a time a pleasing antidote to the raft of
teen sagas currently the hot commodity in the market, it&#146;s a measure of
Hollywood&#146;s often delusional faith in high concept material that there was a point
just prior and immediately after <i>Pleaseantville</i>&#146;s release when it was being
heavily touted as an Oscar favorite. Inevitably, the DVD has a director commentary from
Gary Ross and another with composer Randy Newman, storyboards, an &quot;Art of&quot;
featurette and the music video for Fiona Apple&#146;s cover of the Beatles&#146;
&quot;Across the Universe.&quot; </p>

<big><big><a href="../rringmaster.html" name="ringmaster" target="_top">

<p><b><i>Ringmaster</i></a> (USA, 1998)</b></big></big> </p>

<p>Publicized with the possessive title <i>Jerry Springer&#146;s Ringmaster</i> (but a
puzzling tag in either form), this vehicle for the alternately cherished and reviled king
of daytime trailer trash TV talk shows springs from an authentically good idea: by the
time his, uh, agitated guests take the stage, ponders the movie (but not very deeply) what
part of their story is true and which comes from their anger-fuelled combination of fear
and ignorance (presuming, of course, that any of them are real people)? To that end, the
movie follows two extremely dysfunctional extended families, a white one from Florida and
a black one from Detroit, on their emotionally complex but inevitable paths to the Chairs
of Doom. Individual tolerance levels will depend entirely on patience with the lowbrow
material and top-of-the-lungs performances, although an actress named Molly Hagan is
unexpectedly touching at times as spunky mother Connie Zorzak, whose daughter Angel (Jaime
Pressley) is coupling with her layabout husband (direct-to-video martial arts star Michael
Dudikoff? Is that really you?). The absolutely worst part of the movie is the feigned
astonishment Jerry (who doesn&#146;t even have the cojones to use his last name here,
opting for Farrelly) continues to show at the rude and violent antics of his guests, as if
he&#146;s just wandered in to the studio and can&#146;t believe what he&#146;s seeing.
Otherwise, he&#146;s more of an excuse to get the story moving than an integral part of
the action, as unlike Howard Stern&#146;s vanity project <i>Private Parts</i> there&#146;s
nothing to be learned about Jerry&#146;s life or personality beyond a kind of benevolent
tolerance for his guests (he signs Connie&#146;s tight T-shirt at one point) mixed with a
faint contempt (&quot;Are thos people OK?&quot; someone asks of the combatants. &quot;No,
they&#146;re not OK,&quot; Jerry says, &quot;they&#146;re guests on my show.&quot;).
&quot;I&#146;m a disorder?&quot; he says at another point, with no visible show of emotion
(Jerry&#146;s a lousy actor). &quot;I made the big time.&quot; Maybe so, but sincere or
not this guy&#146;s got icewater in his veins. The DVD has an audio commentary track from
producer Neil Abramson as well as production notes and the mandatory trailer (not that
kind).</p>

<p><b><i>The Rugrats Movie</i></a> (USA, 1998)</b></big></big> </p>

<p>If this is the future of commercially viable theatrical experiences for a new
generation of children who can be counted on to drag their parents to the theater due to
previous small-screen exposure to any given animated franchise (Doug&#146;s First Movie is
a more recent example of the phenomenon), then <i>The Rugrats Movie</i> is decidedly a
good-news, bad-news affair, an ingratiating animated romp that unfortunately overstays
it&#146;s welcome by a good bit (the premise is more suited to television than the
multiplex). Revolving around the efforts of newborn Dylan Preston Pickles (called
&quot;Dil&quot; by one and all, of course; get it?) to be returned to the hospital by his
indignant brother Tommy, cousin Chuckie Finster, twins Lil and Phil and bossy older sister
Angelica, the movie places the group of children in comic and barely threatening
predicaments that include a talking wagon called Reptar, a forest adventure involving some
crafty Russian circus monkeys and situations which spoof <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>, <i>The
Fugitive</i>, and even<i> 2001: A Space Odyssey</i>. The comic highlight of the movie for
kids and adults alike comes early on in the maternity ward of Lipshitz hospital, where an
all-star collection of musical talent voice a group of newborns singing &quot;This World
is Something New to Me&quot; choreographed in part to their synchronized dancing, uh,
waters. Musician Mark Mothersbaugh also resurrects his old band Devo&#146;s cover version
of &quot;Witch Doctor&quot; by Ross Bagdasarian (remember the Chipmunks?), and Lisa Loeb
does a song under the closing credits. The Klasky Csupo animation is vivid and quirky,
giving the whole thing a child&#146;s-eye-view sense of wonder. Also available on
DVD.</p>

<p><b><i>Slam</i></a> (USA, 1998)</b></big></big> </p>

<p>Winner of a clutch of high-profile film festival awards -- including the top award at
the 1998 Sundance Film Festival and two prizes at Cannes -- <i>Slam</i> comes to home
video with just about the best pedigree an American independent film can have in a
marketplace currently crowded, if not glutted, with such fare (the film got critical raves
but did tepid business during it&#146;s theatrical run). And in some ways, the movie
delivers on the advance hype: documentarian Marc Levin&#146;s dramatic directorial debut
is smooth yet harrowing, and Saul Williams gives a soulful, appealingly mysterious
performance as the wrongly imprisoned drug courier who is released from the hell of the
notorious Washington, D.C, jail to find fame as a street poet (the title refers to the
slang term for public readings). Yet the whole is less than the sum of its parts, as <i>Slam</i>
is too dependent on the kinetic urban poetry of its protagonist to propel itself over
sketchy exposition, leaving the final impression that this is that rare movie that would
have benefited from an additional half hour or so of character development. Of much more
interest is <i>Thug Life in D.C.,</i> the documentary Levin was in the midst of making
when he had the idea for <i>Slam</i>. Stripped of the dramatic contrivance, <i>Thug Life</i>
concentrates on the agonizingly slow path through the system of a single young inmate and
is thus as harrowing as <i>Slam</i> but with the undiluted punch of cinema verite.
Produced in association with HBO, <i>Thug Life in D.C.</i> is as of this writing scheduled
to be aired on the cable channel in early May. The DVD edition of slam has audio
commentary from Levin and co-writer Bonz Malone, a trailer and the music video for &quot;I
Dare You.&quot;</p>

<p><b><i>The Waterboy</i></a> (USA, 1998)</b></big></big> </p>

<p>Love it or hate it, <i>The Waterboy </i>proves that Adam Sandler and childhood
chum-turned-director Frank Coraci have an uncanny feel for what young people are prone to
laugh at these days. How else to explain the out-of-nowhere success of this genial comedy
(which continues in the sports vein of the unexpectedly hysterical golf spoof <i>Happy
Gilmore</i>)? Neither as physically vicious as the Farrelly brothers nor as cerebral
as&#133; well, OK, forget that thought, Sandler&#146;s prototypical onscreen slacker is
the late 1990s reincarnation of Jerry Lewis, an overgrown manchild who just wants to have
friends and a bit of success in the world via a previously untapped talent that comes to
the fore in a helpful fashion. Here he&#146;s &quot;aquatic distribution engineer&quot;
Bobby Boucher, a 31-year-old who drives a decrepit riding mower to work from his
Mama&#146;s house on the bayou every day. Fired from his job with the slick Louisiana
Cougars college football team, Bobby finds work with the rundown South Central Louisiana
State (South Central LA, get it?) Mud Dogs, a team so lame that the cheerleaders are all
drunkards and Coach Klein (a beguiling Henry Winkler) is afraid of his own shadow. Do they
team up to beat the big boys with the aid of Bobby&#146;s productively channeled rage at a
lifetime of taunts? You bet. Is any regional gag overlooked? Not a chance. Stuffed with
cameos from prominent jocks and broadcasters (as well as Coraci in a weird bit as
Bobby&#146;s long-lost father), <i>The</i> <i>Waterboy</i> is one of those films in which
the audience is cued how to feel at every turn by popular music riffs, but since the
soundtrack alternates between classic rock along the lines of Creedence Clearwater Revival
and a clutch of new tunes (culminating in Goldfinger&#146;s terrific cover of &quot;More
Than Yesterday&quot;), this isn&#146;t such a bad thing. Neither is the movie as a whole.
The DVD features a featurette on the film&#146;s production.</p>

<p><b><i>What Dreams May Come</i></a> (USA, 1998)</b></big></big></p>

<p>What Dreams May Come certainly means well: cerebral director Vincent Ward has explored
similarly metaphysical themes in his provocative features <i>Map of the Human Heart</i>
(1992) and <i>The Navigator</i> (1988); Ron Bass is one of the most prolific and respected
screenwriters in Hollywood (he shared an Oscar with Barry Morrow for writing <i>Rain Man</i>);
and the source material is from the nearly iconic Richard Matheson (his novel &quot;I Am
Legend&quot; alone has made into a movie at least twice with a third edition currently
bouncing around Hollywood). So what went wrong with this saga of a successful couple so
devoted to one another that the husband in heaven pursues the wife who committed suicide
literally to hell and back? Part of the problem is the impenetrable series of buzzwords
that make up the script, another part is the squishy acting of Robin Williams and the
increasingly annoying Cuba Gooding Jr. (although Max Von Sydow is never bad and
idiosyncratic German director Werner Herzog can be glimpsed as one of a sea of faces on a
vast muddy floor on the way to Hades). And the special effects are nothing short of
astonishing (note to techheads: the DVD is scheduled for release on May 25).
Unfortunately, for all its supposed humanity, there isn&#146;t the slightest trace of
humor or joy in this exercise, that giddy feeling of indomitable love that might make the
quest thrilling -- or even involving. There&#146;s just one indescribably imaginative SFX
sequence after another, stretching off into a distance as ill-defined as the afterworld
Williams wanders in. And that&#146;s a pity; in the right hands (Terry Gilliam?) and with

<p><b>The Best Man</a> (Il testimone dello sposo</i>, Italy, 1997)</b></big></big> </p>

<p>Like many movies recently, this Italian import is timed to coincide with the new
millennium. But unlike most others, <i>The Best Man</i> comments on the phenomenon by
setting it&#146;s tale of of an arranged marriage in 1899 and emphasizing the dreams and
fears of rural Italians as the dawn of the century now about to close first glimmered in
an apprehensive world. Immediately smitten with Angelo (Diego Abatantuono), the successful
millionaire who&#146;s returned from America just in time to be the best man at his older
friend Edgardo&#146;s (Dario Cantarelli) wedding, reluctant bride Francesca (Ines Sastre)
spends the rest of the film trying to ditch Edgardo and win Angelo. Veering crazily
between opposing views of Francesca as tortured martyr (think Truffaut&#146;s The Story of
Adele H.) and take-charge proto-feminist (think Drew Barrymore in <i>Ever After</i>), the
movie finally crumbles under these contradictions -- but no before weaving a seductive
spell of rural ritual and unpredictable love. After stints as a salesman and jazz
musician, director Pupi Avati began his filmmaking career in the late 1960s and early
1970s with an emphasis on the supernatural, but has gradually moved to stories of history
and nostalgia which emphasize his strongest trait, which is the directing of young actors.
His 1990 biopic Bix, the story of 1920s jazz legend Bix Beiderbecke shot in English on
authentic Iowa locations, and 1989 drama <i>The Story of Boys &amp; Girls</i>, are both
available on tape.</p>

<p><b><i>Carla&#146;s Song</i></b></a> <b><i>Carla&#146;s Song</i> (United Kingdom/Germany/Spain, 1996)</b></big></big> </p>

<p>In a career spanning almost four decades of social change, Ken Loach has been
acknowledged as the master of the British realist tradition (his latest work, <i>My Name
is Joe</i>, played selected theatrical dates earlier this year). <i>Carla&#146;s Song</i>
is shot in the same you-are-there documentary style that gives all of his films their
emotional propulsion (he works largely with the same crew from project to project). The
movie follows the combustible, love-smitten Glaswegian bus driver George (Robert Carlyle
of Trainspotting and The Full Monty fame) and the object of his affection, troubled
Nicaraguan dancer Carla (Oyanka Cabezas, remarkable in her first English language film) as
they journey to her native land in the politically unstable atmosphere of the 1987 war
between the Contras and the Sandanista government. Along the way they meet human rights
worker Bradley (Scott Glenn, in a fierce performance) and learn that their love,
mischievously portrayed in a scene where they remove each other&#146;s clothes with their
teeth, may not survive the chaos and confusion. &quot;It is,&quot; says the tremendously
gifted Loach, &quot;a film about the possibilities of people when they decide they will be
together.&quot; A number of the director&#146;s other movies, including <em>Riff-Raff</em>
(1990), <em>Raining Stones</em> (1993) <em>Ladybird, Ladybird</em> (1994) and <em>Land and
Freedom</em> (1995), are also available on tape and make for absorbing and rewarding
viewing. In a new record for leadtime, the DVD is scheduled to street on the last day of
this year.</p>

<p><b><i>Crows</i></a> (<i>Wrony</i>, Poland, 1994)</b></big></big> </p>

<p>One of the most distinctive visual stylists at work in the world today, Polish director
Dorota Kedzierzawska makes short yet remarkable features that brood on her twin themes of
anthropology and childhood. In Crows, 10-year-old Wrona (Crow), the product of a broken
home, leaves her mother (who is distracted by work and a new boyfriend) to find a world of
her own. Along the way she befriends Malezstwo (Little One), a four-year-old street urchin
who is only too happy to fall under the Crow&#146;s control. &quot;I&#146;m not really
crazy about anything other than my daughter and filmmaking,&quot; Kedzierzawska told a
journalist in 1994, and went on to explain in the film&#146;s presskit &quot;I wish this
film to focus on the simplest matters: the lack of love and the need to be loved. Love
bears love. Let&#146;s go out into the street and have a look around. Each one of us is a
&#145;Crow.&#146;&quot; Those taken with her remarkable vision are going to want to order
her debut feature <i>Devils, Devils</i> (1991). Kedzierzawska&#146;s latest work, <i>Nothing</i>,
is a gorgeous widescreen experimental-tinged feature currently popping up at regional film
festivals across North America. All three films are highly recommended.</p>

<p><b><i>Everest</i></a> (USA, 1997)/<i>Into Thin Air: Death on Everest</i> (USA, 1997)</b></big></big>
</p>

<p>For those who might be interested in the creative decisions that are brought to bear on
documentary and narrative treatments of the same material, these two films make for a
fascinating comparative study. In the early months of 1996, more than a dozen separate
expeditions were massed at the base of Mt. Everest, preparing to make the climb during the
brief window of opportunity afforded by the weather. In the resulting traffic jam, a
series of mistakes compounded by a fierce storm lead to multiple deaths on the mountain.
As tragic as the events were, there are also stories of determination (two words: Beck
Weathers) and teamwork that make for absorbing drama -- hampered, of course, by the fact
that everything takes place in a howling wind among people swathed in protective clothing
scattered on a mountainside over a period of days. Produced by the MacGillivray Freeman
team, Everest is a 45-minute documentary made in the huge IMAX format that looks great in
those theaters but logically suffers on the small screen -- there are virtually no
close-ups, and the nature of most IMAX theaters dictated the film&#146;s public television
mentality (simple emotions, swelling score, panoramic vistas). Worse yet, the closing
credits indicate that some of the climbing scenes were staged. Of course the climbing
scenes were recreated for <i>Into Thin Air</i>, a Columbia TriStar TV production filmed in
the Tirol with an Austrian/Czech crew. Adapted from the best-selling memoir by Jon
Krakauer (a journalist along to cover the commercialization of organized climbs), the film
does the best it can with an undistinguished but capable cast (Christopher McDonald plays
Krakauer) but creates an unnecessary good-guy/bad-guy dynamic between two guides -- one of
them played by Peter Horton -- and squanders its climactic scenes on a horribly
mawkish portrayal of an actual event (despite this, Nathaniel Parker is terrific as the
&quot;good&quot; guide). While neither film is completely satisfying, each communicates
the sheer drama of this dark episode in the history of climbing and is possessed of a
palpable sense of panic that overwhelms the technical challenges and limitations. Note:

<p><b><i>The Farm: Angola USA</i></a> (USA, 1998)</b></big></big> </p>

<p>Winner of the Grand Prize at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival and among the Final Five
in this year&#146;s Best Documentary Oscar race, this frank, forceful documentary profiles
a year in the life of six inmates at the Louisiana State Prison at Angola, a thriving
slave plantation throughout the Civil War and, with 18,000 acres total, now the
nation&#146;s largest maximum security prison (many of the 1,800 employees live in an
adjacent town often called &quot;the safest in America&quot;). Young, old, white, black,
each of these men -- as well as the other 5,000 convicts (80 per cent African American)
incarcerated there -- must make his own peace with the system and himself. These are
stories of inspiration and injustice, punctuated by thoughts from controversial warden
Burl Cain and lifer Wilbert Rideau, who edits the award-winning &quot;Angolite&quot;
magazine and has interviewed every prisoner on death row in the last two decades
(he&#146;s also co-director of the film with Jonathan Stack and Liz Garbus). Serious
issues are brought forth in this deliberate, contemplative film, issues which have been
successful in stirring debate on the methods used in this country to incarcerate convicted
felons. The tape box may be labeled <i>The Farm: Life Inside Angola Prison</i>.</p>

<p><b><i>From Dusk till Dawn 2: Texas Blood Money</i></a> (USA, 1998)</b></big></big> </p>

<p>&quot;What the <i>hail</i> are vampires doin&#146; robbin&#146; a <i>bank</i>?&quot;
someone asks towards the end of this direct-to-video sequel to the Quentin
Tarantino-penned and Robert Rodriguez-directed genre celebration/spoof <i>From Dusk till
Dawn</i>, and the answer -- &quot;I guess they need money just like everybody else&quot;
-- does double duty as an absurdist punchline summing up the affection for the genre at
the core of this franchise and the motivation for keeping it alive (after making more
money than anyone apparently expected with the original, the rumor at the moment is that
the third chapter, <i>FDTD 3: The Hangman&#146;s Daughter</i>, will see a commercial
release). Not nearly as wretched as some early reviews have indicated, the vigorous
direction of Sam Raimi disciple Scott Spiegel (who wrote the screenplay with co-star Duane
Whitaker) is, if anything, overly stylish. The absorbing and solid action work is
punctuated by a flood of film school-ish point of view shots, including but not limited to
a cooler-cam, desktop fan-cam, bat-cam (bats are key to the plot), mirrorball-cam, parking
meter poll-cam and, of course, the ever-popular skull-cam. He also lifts the shower scene
from <i>Psycho</i> (prompting the movie&#146;s best line from an awed cop), does a neat
tribute to Sam Peckinpah&#146;s <i>The Wild Bunch</i> (one of that film&#146;s co-stars,
Bo Hopkins, plays a lawman named Otis here), and even has a brief bit as a Rodriguezish
porno movie director who gets a load of buckshot in the chest. &quot;They&#146;re
makin&#146; Happy Meals out of our ass,&quot; Otis wails as the genuinely creepy showdown
goes on (and on, and on, and on), yet while purists might sniff at the derivative hipness
of it all, the casual fan will find precious little difference between this and
Rodriguez&#146; own <i>The Faculty</i>. They&#146;re both dumb, campy fun -- and <i>TBM</i>
is superior in concept and execution to the month&#146;s other two mainstream horror
releases, <i>Bride of Chucky </i>and <i>Dee Snider&#146;s Strangeland</i>.</p>

<p><b><i>Girls&#146; Night</i></b></a> <b><i>Girls&#146; Night</i> (United Kingdom, 1998)</b></big></big> </p>

<p>An interesting, if probably unintentional, companion piece to <i>One True Thing</i>
(spiced with a bit of the same plot contrivance that fuelled <i>Waking Ned Devine</i>), <i>Girls&#146;
Night</i> stars Brenda Blethyn as Dawn, one of a pair of northern England birdies who win
100,000 pounds at their weekly bingo game and decide to escape their stifling jobs and
disasterous home lives for a shot at happiness, Las Vegas style. The more domestic of the
two, Blethyn is in stark contrast to Julie Walters&#146; party girl Jackie, a responsible
family type who initially opts to pay off the mortgage before being persuaded to make the
trip. The other deciding factor is the return of doctor-shy Dawn&#146;s breast cancer,
which prompts Jackie to buy the tickets. Once in the gambling mecca, Dawn finds a soulmate
in genuine cowboy Cody (Kris Kristofferson, in a part much smaller than his billing might
indicate). Blethyn is without peer at creating vivid yet pitiable creatures, which is what
made her star-making turn in Mike Leigh&#146;s remarkable <i>Secrets and Lies</i> so
convincing and memorable. But taken in tandem with her annoying Oscar-nominated turn as
the braying Mari in <i>Little Voice</i>, it seems clear that Blethyn has opted for an
ill-advised course of scenery chewing over substance. Much better is Walters as the tarty
Jackie, a woman of conflicting urges whose inspiring faithfulness to her sick friend
emerges as the one truly inspiring element of the story -- seemingly the exact opposite of
the the filmmaker&#146;s initial focus. Co-produced by Showtime, <i>Girls&#146; Night</i>
debuted in the competition section of the 1998 Berlin International Film Festival before
being broadcast.</p>

<p>Bookended by his genre landmark <i>Solaris</i> (1971) and vastly more linear <i>Stalker</i>
(1979), Russian director Andrei Tarkovsky&#146;s autobiographical <i>The Mirror </i>is a
demanding work that mixes black and white with color footage and finds different actresses
playing his mother at different times during his boyhood in an artists&#146; colony
outside Moscow. The dramatic footage is intercut with documentary sequences from the
Spanish Civil War and Soviet-Chinese confrontations, lending the film a strong feeling of
historical allegory. Ultimately, Tarkovsky was a tragic figure (he became an increasingly
embittered and artistically self-indulgent exile after completing <i>Stalker</i>), yet the
sheer force of his unique vision is here undiluted by despair and pessimism. </p>

<p><b><i>Mother Wore Tights</i></a> (USA, 1947)</b></big></big> </p>

<p>There was a time in the history of American movies when musicals were perceived as a
balm for pressing social ills, including the Great Depression and World War II. Produced
by 20<sup>th</sup> Century-Fox at the height of Betty Grable&#146;s popularity --
she&#146;d been the most popular pin-up girl for our boys overseas, with one studio
famously insuring her legs for a million dollars with Lloyd&#146;s of London -- <i>Mother
Wore Tights</i> paired the veteran hoofer with Dan Dailey, himself a returning war vet and
established dancer who was a year away from his own lone Academy Award nomination (<i>When
My Baby Smiles at Me</i>). Exploiting the strong strain of nostalgia that even then made
for box office success, the two play a song-and-dance team who travel the USA at the turn
of the century (the last one, of course). The framework affords them plenty of opportunity
to showcase the Mack Gordon/Josef Myrow tunes and Seymour Felix/Kenny Williams dance
numbers, and the whole thing is redolent of the kind of glossy Hollywood cheer they just
don&#146;t make anymore. <i>Mother Wore Tights</i> won Alfred Newman an Oscar for Scoring
of a Musical Picture (see how popular the genre was?) and was nominated for Harry
Jackson&#146;s vivid color photography (in those days a separate award was given for color
films; the Oscar rightly went to Jack Cardiff for <i>Black Narcissus</i> -- one of the
most stunning achievements in the history of cinematography) as well as the song &quot;You
Do,&quot; which was beat out by &quot;Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah,&quot; from Walt Disney&#146;s <i>Song
of the South</i>. If you&#146;re in the right mood, <i>Mother Wore Tights</i> can be a lot
of fun -- and is priced to own.</p>

<p><b><i>Point of Order!</i></a> (USA, 1964)</b></big></big> </p>

<p>While the precise reason for this reissue is unclear, in light of recent political
events involving the president the timing of this groundbreaking documentary couldn&#146;t
be better. Supposedly rejected by the programmers of the 1963 New York Film Festival on
the grounds that it wasn&#146;t &quot;a real film,&quot; this dispassionate look at the
notorious televised Army-McCarthy hearings of 1954 is a precursor to the cinema verite
movement that was constructed entirely at the editing table by peripatetic Marxist Emile
de Antonio from the voluminous and primitive video material shot during the event. Nothing
less than a rigorous inquiry into the nature of the national hysteria known as
&quot;McCarthyism,&quot; the film succeeds not only in deconstructing those fears but
revealing the slimy back room politics at work in the US Senate at the time (Bobby Kennedy
and Stuart Symington are among the identifiable faces). Prior to his 1989 death de Antonio
-- who is credited with inspiring Andy Warhol to experiment with film -- also made the JFK
assassination film <i>Rush to Judgment</i>, the radical Vietnam documentary <i>In the Year
of the Pig</i>, <i>Milhouse: A White Comedy</i>, <i>Mr. Hoover and I</i>, and other pithy
works. </p>

<p><b><i>The Wonderful Ice Cream Suit</i> (USA, 1998)</b></big></big></a> </p>

<p>This unrelentingly sunny direct-to-video musical fantasy marks the unlikely but
moderately successful collaboration of writer Ray Bradbury, <i>Re-Animator</i> director
Stuart Gordon and Walt Disney&#146;s producing brother Roy. As such, it is an item of some
interest for fans of any of these factions. Updated from it&#146;s mid-1950&#146;s
origins, Bradbury&#146;s story of honest longing is set in contemporary South Central Los
Angeles (it was shot in Boyle Heights) and concerns the efforts of conman Gomez (Joe
Mantegna) to persuade three of his like-sized friends and an enthusiastic bum to
contribute twenty dollars towards the purchase of a glowing white suit which each man can
share. Sure enough, the clothes have an immediate effect on the men, as each gets to wear
the ensemble for an hour. The musician Dominguez (Esai Morales) attracts a huge crowd in
the street; poet Villanazul (Gregory Sierra) finds that people actually listen to his
work; Martinez (Clifton Gonzalez Gonzalez) finally gets the attention of the woman of his
dreams; and even filthy Vamenos (Edward James Olmos) finds adventure in a local club (the
movie&#146;s most energetic and cartoonish sequence). Drenched in vibrant colors and
passionately played by an all-star cast to the bouncy score of Mariachi Sol de Mexico, <i>The
Wonderful Ice Cream Suit</i> is this month&#146;s justification for the entire format, the
kind of movie that probably wouldn&#146;t have been successful in commercial release but
will provide 90 minutes of silly, satisfying diversion. Fans of the groundbreaking TV
program &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot; will note the brief re-teaming of Sid Caesar and
Howard Morris as the Zellman brothers, two panicked tailors.</p>
