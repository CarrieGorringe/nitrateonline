<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="5"><b>T</b></font><font size="4">hat
snoring you hear is <i>Drive Me Crazy</i>, the Melissa Joan Hart vehicle which
crept into theaters this last weekend, on little cats' feet, found a place to
curl-up, and went into a snooze. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Hart,
star of the TV sitcom <i>Sabrina</i>, and Adrian Grenier play Nicole and Chase,
childhood friends who still live next door to each other but have drifted apart
in their teenage years into different social groups: she's with the shiny, peppy
&quot;in&quot; people, he's with what he himself terms &quot;disaffected
youth&quot;, hanging out in a club called the Pit and listening to loud rock
music from an all-girl band called the Electrocutes. Prom time looms, and when
Nicole looks like she'll have trouble getting a date from a tall, blond thing
with broad shoulders (Gabriel Carpenter) who plays on the school basketball
team, she turns to her old friend Chase for help, ridding him of his moptop hair
and fashionably-disheveled clothing style in the process. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">One
of the problems with the film is that, when one of Chase's old friends
criticizes him for looking like a walking ad for the Gap, it doesn't seem to
make any difference, because all the kids in the film, no matter what social
group they're in, have the same fresh-scrubbed look to them. (The picture was
made in Ogden, Utah, with the mighty Wasatch looming in the background, which
may have something to do with it.) Trying to avoid being strident or crass, the
filmmakers tone down the material to the point where it goes slack: large
amounts of dead air seem to exist in the picture, even though people are moving
about and talking on-screen. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Hart,
who, with her blond flip-curl hairstyle and turned-up nose, looks like a junior
Meg Ryan (or Samantha Stephens, for that long-rumored big-screen adaptation of <i>Bewitched</i>),
tries for an offhand style of humor, letting her quips drop into scenes and fall
like dying swans. She looks like she knew the picture wasn't turning out as
everyone expected it would, and, maybe, that she wasn't getting any chemistry
going in her scenes with Adrian Grenier, who has big almond eyes, big cushy
lips, and is otherwise thoroughly undistinguished. He does briefly spark to life
in a couple of scenes with Keri Lynn Pratt, who has a beautifully bright screen
presence and sweet smile; Pratt, in a secondary role, lights up every scene
she's in. As &quot;Designated Dave&quot;, the kid who's always expected to drive
his friends home from parties but never gets to have any fun himself, Mark
Webber also puts in some good screen work. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Amy
Robinson, who produced this picture, co-produced some of the best pictures of
the Eighties with Griffin Dunne. While she and the filmmakers were trying for a
different type of teenage picture, here, they inadvertently fell into the shadow
of two other pictures that came out ahead of them, this year. The prom stuff in <i>Drive
Me Crazy</i> looks like it's from <i>She's All That</i>, while the makeover
business is similar to <i>10 Things I Hate About You</i>; the former had the
dazzling Rachel Leigh Cook as one of its leads, while the latter was generally
more spirited, and funnier, in comparison. (So funny, I mixed up Jared Leto with
Jeremy Sisto in my review.) That may not entirely account for the air of
despondency that hangs over <i>Drive Me Crazy</i>, like gardenias left behind by
someone in a room, or rowboat passengers bailing out a leaky boat in the middle
of a lake.
