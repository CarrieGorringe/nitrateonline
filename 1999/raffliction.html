<p><big><strong><big>T</big></strong>here are a helluva lot of things more depressed than
the economy in the eternally cold, fictional New Hampshire town that is the diseased heart
of <i>Affliction</i>, and you&#146;ll be aching for a mental pick-me-up and a hot cup of
java by film&#146;s end. You won&#146;t get it (until after you leave the theater), but
director-writer Paul Schrader fashions a marvelous tale of one man&#146;s downward
emotional spiral in a world in which he alienates/eliminates his family and friends.
It&#146;s entrancing in its slow pacing and lingering, sparse score (by Michael Brook),
and only after repeated viewings might you fully appreciate this film.</big></p>

<p>Behind the snow drifts of this overcast, fictional New England community are the
secrets of past abuse and the onslaught of future progress, with a dash of contemporary
murder mystery tossed in as a link. Russell Banks&#146; 1989 novel forms the core of this
dark tale, effectively lensed by cinematographer Paul Sarossy, who was also behind the
camera for the adaptation of the author&#146;s <i>The Sweet Hereafter</i>. Shrader,
responsible for writing some of the greatest</p>

<p>screenplays of the last twenty years (<i>Taxi Driver</i>, <i>Raging Bull</i>), brings a
distinctive style to <i>Affliction</i>, apparently following closely the imagery of
Banks&#146; underlying material. The visual style nearly plays like another character on
screen, be it the somber footage filled with long, wintry shadows, the hand-held visions
of the protagonist&#146;s childhood, or the monotone re-enactments of possible criminal
behavior in the backwoods and back rooms of snow-bound, four-wheel-drive Lawford.</p>

<p>Our story begins on Halloween as the town&#146;s children parade in costume before the
local officials, but the horrors lay within the mind of Wade Whitehouse, part-time
sheriff/glorified traffic cop in this one horse town. Bitterly divorced from his ex, his
limited visits from their young daughter, Jill, are fraught with her excessive whining and
ill-at-ease pleas for a quick return to comfort of the home of her mom and stepfather.
Meanwhile, the local diner fills with provincials who harp on sad accounts of purported
&quot;bad blood&quot; beatings at the Whitehouse farm when Wade was growing up.</p>

<p>Wade also puts in countless hours plowing snow for prominent businessman, land owner
Gordon &quot;Our Business is Going in the Hole&quot; Larivierre (Holmes Osborne), who
appears steeped in dubious shenanigans with Mel Gordon (Steve Adams), the rich son-in-law
of soon to be deceased Massachusetts union leader/ugly American Evan Twombley (Steve
Adams), vacationing in town and out hunting deer on a disastrous hunt with guide Jack
Hewitt (Jim True), Wade&#146;s best friend whose baseball career in semi-pro short
circuited.</p>

<p>Nick Nolte fills the snow boots of the lawman whose neurons misfire, and he&#146;s
primed for another Academy Award nomination this time, putting in a controlled performance
as a repressed aggressive. What&#146;s on screen is much better than his shouting match
show in <i>The Thin Red Line</i>. Nolte tempers his breakdown through deliberate synaptic
freezes and disposition losses, obviously well tutored under the eye of his director. I
don&#146;t feel the actor will win, but I&#146;d put even money on James Coburn in the
supporting category as Glen Whitehouse, Wade&#146;s abusive, hard-drinking father,
relishing in the role of a lifetime, much like Burt Reynolds&#146; bolt-out-of-the-blue in
1997&#146;s <i>Boogie Nights</i>. Coburn, also seen in a small part in <i>Payback</i>
opposite Mel Gibson, explodes in a damning, vicious character, and is barely recognizable
in the grainy, home movie style flashbacks that haunt his son&#146;s memories. One
definitive sequence of Coburn&#146;s thespian power follows the death of the family
matriarch, bringing together father, both brothers, and their sister, a devout catholic
(bumper sticker: &quot;Are you ready for the rapture?&quot;) for an impromptu prayer
session in the family living room, brought to disruptive end when the depraved father
rants on about his kids being Jesus freaks and candy asses.</p>

<p>Willem Dafoe, who starred in the Shrader&#146;s <i>Light Sleeper</i> and whose career
took a nose dive after his appearance in mega-turkey <i>Speed 2: Cruise Control</i>, is
acceptable in basically a voice over role, providing narration and long-distance comfort
as Wade&#146;s younger brother Rolfe, a Boston University professor. Rounding out the top
talent is Sissy Spacek as sensitive, sensible earth mother Maggie Fogg, long-time waitress
at Wickham&#146;s diner and potential marital material for Wade. She warms the screen like
a downy quilt, fighting a battle against loneliness, learning, too late, that her hulking
ally and bed partner is a walking time bomb. Look for her appearing a very different,
hilarious role this month as a wacky housewife in the nuclear comedy <i>Blast From the
Past</i>.</p>

<p>It is Wade, eventually, who flakes out. The like-father, like-son analogy lies beneath
the surface through much of the film, erupting after the offspring plays home dentist and
pulls his own bothersome tooth with a pair of pliers. It&#146;s a short, painful scene,
with the extracted molar prominent against his red-eyed, tear-streaked face, the
tooth&#146;s removal lifting the physical pain that perhaps has obscured the
patient&#146;s mental anguish. Earlier in the film, Wade commiserates with his brother
that he feels like a whipped dog, about to bite back. Affliction doesn&#146;t carry any
fore-warnings for its viewers of the depression to follow. If your looking for action,
adventure, romance, etc., pick a different auditorium at your local multiplex (hence the
few walk-outs at a public preview). But if you want a personal, compelling tale with a
touch of intrigue, let <i>Affliction</i> haunt you for a couple of hours.</p>
