<p><big><big><strong>W</strong></big>arner Brothers' <i>The King and I</i> is an animated
retelling of the Rodgers and Hammerstein stage classic, or at least that's what it claims;
in truth, it's more mockery than homage. The film is the cinematic equivalent of
Cliff-notes, to be employed by those who don't have the attention span for anything longer
or more intellectually challenging than a &quot;Road Runner&quot; cartoon.</big></p>

<p>At cursory glance, the plot appears to be the same: a British schoolteacher named Anna
(Miranda Richardson) is offered a job as tutor to the King of Siam's children. She
accepts, on one condition: she wishes to be given a house of her own, located outside the
palace walls. Although the king (Martin Vidnovic) agreed to this stipulation via letter,
he is much less reluctant to grant the wish once Anna and her son actually make it to
Siam. But the teacher is a fiercely</p>

<p>determined woman, not afraid to stand up for her rights; soon the king grows fascinated
with the intelligence and charisma of the new arrival. Although the monarch and the
teacher come from varying backgrounds, they are eventually able to put aside their
differences and strike up a friendship.</p>

<p>That's about where the similarities between the two versions of the story end. This new
animated incarnation cheerfully jettisons all the thought-provoking aspects of the
original work (like the conflicting emotions the king feels over the issue of slavery, or
his confusion over how the world could've been created in six days according to the Bible,
when science clearly says it took millions of years). This &quot;adaptation&quot; (I call
it butchery) is strictly vanilla fare, with all the meat watered down to the point where
it tastes indistinguishable from the broth.</p>

<p>So what does director Richard Rich do with the leftover space which remains after he's
stripped away half the story? Why, add a bunch of cartoon staples, of course. Since it's
impossible to make an animated feature without including a number of easily marketable
animal sidekicks, the film gives Anna's son Louis (Adam Wylie) an obnoxious pet monkey.
The King himself gets a jet-black panther named Rama, and slave-girl Tuptim (Armi Arabe)
befriends an adorably big-eyed baby elephant that seems to be in this movie for no other
purpose than to give Warner Brothers a stuffed animal that's guaranteed to fly off toy
store shelves.</p>

<p>The original <i>The King and I</i> had no central villain, per se. The King wasn't a
bad man, just ignorant of British culture. But since you can't make an action figure out
of &quot;ignorance,&quot; this adaptation has turned the King's Prime Minster, Kralahome
(Ian Richardson), into an archetypal evil villain stereotype. He appears to be the twin
brother of Aladdin's Jafar, both physically and mentally: Kralahome possesses sorcerer's
powers, has mad ambitions of ruling the kingdom, and will stop at nothing to dethrone the
king (although he takes time periodically to leer and break into demented laughter, to
make sure the audience knows that he's evil). And just as Jafar had the obnoxious Iago for
a sidekick, the prime minister is followed around by a short, fat, incredibly stupid
companion named Master Little (Daryl Hammond). Little is just as flat and cliched as his
boss; although the children at the screening I attended seemed delighted by his madcap
antics, I found him infuriating, particularly during a ridiculous subplot involving
Little's tendency to involuntarily lose his teeth. Why does a story that's supposed to be
a tragedy need such obnoxious comic relief?</p>

<p>I say &quot;supposed to be,&quot; because this film turns the thought-provoking scenes
of the original story into a trite, giddy smile-fest. Gone is the heartwrenching moment in
which the king dies of a mysterious illness (which appears to be a broken heart), replaced
with a chase scene involving a hot-air balloon and a couple of elephants. I expected the
king to be a brave man, but who knew he was a Jackie Chan-wanna be?</p>

<p>Perhaps most disappointing is the way the original tale's emotional axis, the forbidden
love affair between Tuptim and a freeman, is relegated to a status of irrelevance. The
affair ends tragically in the original film, giving the king (and the audience) much to
think about. But here, Tuptim's love interest is none other than the crown prince himself
(who was a boy in the earlier version, but appears to be roughly sixteen here); therefore,
all sense of tension is immediately irradicated. Obviously the king is not going to harm
his son, so these scenes play off as nothing more than cheap formula: the conclusion that
they'll live happily ever after is foreordained, but nonetheless, cliche' requires the
inclusion of a romance, leaving a story that proceeds so transparently that there is no
way for us to be surprised by anything we're seeing.</p>

<p>The movie is not devoid of merit, however. The animation is spectacular-- so good that
the film may actually be worth a peek simply to bask in its remarkably vivid colors. Of
particular note is a montage of scenes in the palace gardens, which are rendered so
brightly and beautifully that I actually whispered the word &quot;Wow.&quot; The tune
&quot;Getting to Know You&quot; also puts in a stellar appearance here: in the original
movie, the song is performed by Anna and the children in their palace classroom; here,
Anna takes the kids on a field trip to the village just outside the palace gates (which
the kids have never seen). It gives new meaning to the lyrics, and is clever and touching
at the same time. Had the film been daring enough to reinterpret the material more often,
rather than &quot;dumb it down,&quot; it could've provided a fresh new slant on a beloved
story; as it stands, it's the only fresh moment in the movie.</p>

<p>This remake of <i>The King and I</i> is painfully disappointing. It adheres to the
belief that children are idiots who won't be able to fathom a tale that possesses any
depth or intelligence, and steadfastly refuses to raise any issues worthy of thought and
discussion. Instead, we're given an overabundance of cuteness, a false-feeling happy
ending, and cartoon cliches. This isn't so much <i>The King and I</i> as <i>The King and I
and His Kids and the Villagers and a Pointless Romance and a Bunch of Animals and
Cardboard Villains and our Merry Life Together in the Magical Land of Dreams...</i>; or,
as the king himself might say, &quot;Et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.&quot;</p>
