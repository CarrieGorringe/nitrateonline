<p><big><strong><big>I</big></strong>t&#146;s become startlingly clear that Robert Altman
is more fun to watch riffing on the lightweight screenplays of other people than producing
his own work anymore. <i>Cookie&#146;s Fortune</i> is rich in characters, quirky and
informed by an enveloping sense of community. Altman&#146;s prowling camerawork is more
elegant than ever, ever creeping through scenes to discover and rediscover character, and
with a cast of fine performers (and some not so fine that Altman coaxes to their best
performances to date) there&#146;s plenty to discover. Or at least there should be. When
you get past the subtle flourishes, the warmth generated by the ensemble, and the
individual character marvels, <i>Cookie&#146;s Fortune</i> is so slight a work it&#146;s
amazing it was ever made at all. </big></p>

<p><img src="Images/rcookie-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="107" HEIGHT="150">The plot revolves
around the death of a beloved old woman, Jewel Mae Orcutt (Patricia Neal in a delightful,
and all-too-brief appearance), known to her friends as Cookie, in a small southern town
where everyone knows everyone and grudges and reputations are both taken deadly seriously.
But I get ahead of myself. The always great Charles S. Dutton is Willis Richland, who
furtively swipes a bottle of Wild Turkey from his favorite bar, climbs through the window
into a house, and starts grabbing handguns from a case. The aging Cookie starts down the
steps and a confrontation appears imminent, but it&#146;s just a typically cute bit of
character business. Willis is Cookie&#146;s handyman who&#146;s locked himself out and is
cleaning her guns because he promised her he&#146;s do so &#150; never mind that it&#146;s
3am. The two stay up late swapping stories, playfully scoring wrongs against one another
in a tally that reaches into the hundreds (they&#146;ve obviously been at this a long
time), and simply sharing lives that have seen many years pass together. They&#146;re just
two people in a town of characters (it&#146;s an Altman film &#150; would we have it any
other way?), but become the central characters in the drama about to unfold.</p>

<p>But I get ahead of myself again. An Easter play is rehearsed down the street, planned
to the last detail by the town&#146;s matriarch of all things artistic Camille (Glenn
Close, vamping it up so much she feels like one of the overacting performers in her
amateur hour). Her ditzy sister Cora (Julianne Moore) is the star, a rather lifeless
Salome who walks through her part much like she walks through life, under the constant
direction of her controlling sister. These two are among Cookie&#146;s last living
relatives but they spend little time with their socially disinterested aunt. Emma (Liv
Tyler), Cora&#146;s estranged daughter and Cookie&#146;s favorite relative, has returned
home and taken a job as a catfish gutter and delivery driver for the lovesick Manny Hood
(Lyle Lovett). Tough luck, Manny, her destiny lies with rookie cop Jason (Chris
O&#146;Donnell), a hopelessly brain dead figure of a lawman and something of a klutz as
well (Altman indulges though him some rather overworked slapstick moments the film could
have done very nicely without). Jason works for the no nonsense police Lieutenant Lester
(Ned Beatty), a laid back figure with little use for bullshit but plenty of understanding
for the colorful characters that populate his district.</p>

<p>One day Cookie decides she&#146;s been lonely long enough and wants to join her
husband, who just happens to be dead. Camille discovers her suicide and panics &#150; how
dare anyone in the family commit suicide?&nbsp; It&#146;s simply not done. With the
dubious help of Cora, they turn the suicide into a crime scene and transform Cookie into
the victim of a robbery (not too far off the truth as Camille pockets some of her favorite
pieces from Cookie&#146;s collection, including her jewel studded &quot;C&quot; she wears
proudly around her neck &#150; a piece of costume jewelry she treats like the crown
jewels). With the crime scene carefully in place, she calls the cops.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the evidence all points to Willis, whose fingerprints are on the gun, the
window and all over the house. Into this cozy town of secrets and friendships walks the
city-bred police investigator Otis Tucker (Courtney B. Vance), and off to Willis&#146;
side charge Emma (who joins Willis in his jail cell &#150; which incidentally is left wide
open throughout his incarceration) and Jack (Donald Moffat), Willis&#146; lawyer and the
play&#146;s King Herod. As Tucker checks into Willis&#146; alibi and analyzes the evidence
from the crime scene (which is in constant danger of being eradicated by Camille, who
blithely ignores crime scene tape to take possession of &quot;her&quot; house),
Cookie&#146;s will is found and secrets are soon to be revealed.</p>

<p><img src="Images/rcookie-2.jpg" align="right" WIDTH="107" HEIGHT="150">Altman must have seen something in this
material for he does wonders with it short of finding the drama hidden in the plot. What
he does uncover is a dozen or so character sketches that he fills out just short of full
portraits &#150; but then that sketchiness that rumbles under every character is another
hallmark that makes even Altman&#146;s least films comes to life in moments. Patricia Neal
delivers such a winning performance as Cookie you wonder where she&#146;s been all these
years, and Charles Dutton is wonderful as usual, filling Willis with a loyalty and love
explains why everyone rallies around him. Ned Beatty finds facets in his easy going charm
that gives his support of Willis all the weight of the world, all loaded into a simple
statement: &quot;I fish with the man.&quot; Apologizing profusely for incarcerating
Willis, he spends his free time hanging out in the cell with Willis and Emma. Altman even
finds a seeming spontaneity in Liv Tyler and Chris O&#146;Donnell, the young lovers who
keep running off to the storeroom for a little nooky while the adults turn a blind eye and
a wry smile. In fact the only weakness in this otherwise funky old town is Glenn
Close&#146;s performance. She seems to be having the time of her life as a small-town
Norma Desmond, gesturing like an opera star and taking the responsibility of bringing
culture to this backwater single-handedly (she takes writing credit with Oscar Wilde for
her &quot;adaptation&quot; of &quot;Salome&quot;). Her overworked, arch performance is out
of place in the kooky underplayed folks around her.</p>

<p>Where the film falls is in the conflict &#150; is there any worry that Willis will be
sent up for murder? Altman throws all pretense of a mystery out with the old bait and
trades any suspense for a lollygagging character comedy. It&#146;s as if he&#146;s entered
an agreement with the audience that, since we all know that these things work out in the
end, he&#146;s going to give us something different. Which is fine as far as that goes,
but with the suspense tossed to the wind and the conflict turning entirely on the brassy
ego of Camille, there isn&#146;t much narrative on which to hang the film. Altman is often
at his best in the tensions between his lanky style and the narrative demands of
screenplays, but this one, a first from former producer Anne Rapp, simply doesn&#146;t
give him anything to work against.</p>

<p>I&#146;ve found Altman&#146;s work of late to suffer from the same problem (and
I&#146;m surely to find some arguments here). With his critical rehabilitation in the
1990s beginning with <i>The Player</i>, his work has varied greatly and his most personal
projects, films in which he adapted the screenplay (<i>Short Cuts</i>) or wrote an
original script (<i>Ready To Wear, Kansas City</i>) have either collapsed under its own
weight of self importance or fizzled away in meandering self indulgence. Then came the
eerie, unsettling <i>The Gingerbread Man</i>, a stock John Grisham story (his first
original for the screen and his weakest story to date) transformed by Altman into an
unusually compelling thriller grounded in quirky character and an overwhelming sense of
unease and danger, his most cinematically exciting work in years. Given the challenge of
material seemingly ill-suited to his style, he made something new, unique, exciting out of
it (though it was ultimately dumped by PolyGram and flopped theatrically, despite a number
of good reviews).</p>

<p>Would that he found something that fine in <i>Cookie&#146;s Fortune</i>, which
ultimately reveals itself to be like the costume jewelry owned by Cookie. It sparkles and
entices and looks to be something more than it is, and Altman shows it off as if, like
Cookie and Camille, he mistakes it for the real thing. Under close scrutiny, however, it
reveals itself as nothing more than paste and pretties standing in for actual jewels. <i>Cookie&#146;s
Fortune</i> is a genuinely sweet and generous visit with a handful of characters, but
bereft of a story worthy of them and a mystery that all too easily wraps itself up, the
film is all good company and no drama. Finally it concludes in juvenile &quot;just
deserts&quot; that feels unearned and uncharacteristically mean spirited. I quite enjoyed
the film, but while <i>Cookie</i> may not rank among Robert Altman&#146;s least, it&#146;s
far from his best.</p>
