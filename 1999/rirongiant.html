<p><big><strong><big>&quot;I</big></strong>&#146;m the luckiest kid in the world,&quot;
cheers adolescent Hogarth, halfway to sci-fi heaven in the hand of a friendly ten story
robot -- a clanking metal man who acts like a combination little brother, big brother and
playful puppy dog all rolled into one magnificent structure who looks like he stepped off
the cover of &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; -- as they march through the forest of his rural
coastal Maine town in search of scrap metal. The giddiest moments of <i>The Iron Giant</i>
deliver the most amazing little-boy wish fulfillment fantasies: the kid with his own
playmate robot. But there&#146;s much more to Brad Bird&#146;s adaptation of the Ted
Hughes novel &quot;The Iron Man.&quot; Using the rich conflicts inherent in the setting of
1957, he twines nostalgic simplicity and rural serenity with cold war paranoia and space
age fears (this is the height of Sputnik-mania and the Russian eye-in-the-sky has American
terrified to attack from space) and injects it with the (now) retro look of 1950s futurism
and (then) mix of wild and mellow beatnik cool. </big></p>
<i>

<p>The Iron Giant</i> is a fable in science fiction clothing and fairy tale trappings, but
it begins with portends of doom. A tiny boat is tossed on a stormy sea like a toy in a
bathtub when something crashes into the water, like a meteor. The aging captain searches
for the lighthouse beacon and thinks he sees it, but as he steers toward the ray his ship
is crushed by a huge metallic object. Thrown from his boat the old salt sees what is
surely a creature from outer space (if not a super secret Soviet experimental weapon,
perhaps the real story behind Sputnik?), a hulking gray behemoth with foglight eyes. Of
course no one believes him. No one except Hogarth (voiced by Eli Marienthal), the
imaginative only child of a single mom, and Annie Hughes (Jennifer Aniston), the harried
and overworked but sensitive and sweet young waitress at a local diner. </p>

<p>Hogarth is a freckle-faced, rambunctious boy whose knack for finding pets is only
topped by his ability to lose them in the most inopportune places. This time his newest
foundling, a squirrel, escapes and scurries about the diner when he overhears the story
and meets up with Dean (Harry Connick Jr.), an easy-going beatnik in basic black who
chimes in to defend the old man. Dean is instantly identified as an okay guy when he keeps
Hogarth&#146;s secret about the escaped squirrel even as it crawls up his pant leg (which
leads to the film&#146;s first genuinely bizarre moment, involving public disrobing to the
THX-enhanced sound of a zipper -- trust me, it&#146;s no Farrelly Brothers moment, but it
manages to combine juvenile farce with adult surrealism in a truly unique way).</p>

<p>Hogarth is left on his own as Mom has to work late once again, so of course he&#146;s
up late with junk food and junkier science fiction movies on the late show (an endearingly
wooden recreation of B movies with shadowing B&amp;W animation), but when the reception
suddenly frizzes out during the climax he climbs up on the roof and finds the aerial has
been eaten and the reverberations of the culprit are shaking through the forest. Soon
it&#146;s Commando Hogarth off to investigate, equipped with space helmet and BB gun.
He&#146;s not at all prepared for what happens next: a square-jawed mechanical man the
size of a six story building leaps out and attacks the power station. Well, not exactly.
Hogarth realizes that he&#146;s not attacking as much as foraging -- he eats metal -- but
he becomes tangled in the wires start to fry with high voltage current (the sound sputters
and buzzes like a small electrical storm). Terrified, Hogarth runs off, but he can&#146;t
let the creature, no matter how scary, die. Not when he has the power to save him.</p>

<p>He has no idea that his simple act of courage is the beginning of a beautiful
relationship. When his mother finds him, she&#146;s simply &quot;not in the mood&quot; for
his tall tales of comic book monsters, so he decides to get proof the next night. He
stakes out a likely meadow and puts out a lure -- a rather small chunk of scrap metal --
to catch the thing on film. But the iron giant wants to make friends with Hogarth and
after scaring the bejesus out of the boy (quite by accident, mind you) he embarks on a
friendly game of monkey see, monkey so. Before you know it, Hogarth is teaching his
friendly giant how to talk, lending him comic books (from &quot;Atomo the Metal
Menace&quot; to &quot;Superman.&quot; Hogarth has discovered his new role model. With his
head cocked like a puppy and big, dumb smile emerging from his hinged jaw and pale white
eyes, he repeats the words &quot;Sooper-man.&quot;</p>

<p>Meanwhile Agent Kent Mansley (Christopher McDonald), a tall, angular fellow who looks
serious, supercilious, and silly all at the same time, comes to investigate the rather
outrageous claims. This self-important bureaucratic boob has obviously been given a chump
assignment, and you get the feeling this guy is regularly relegated to dealing with all
the nuisance calls. Disdainful of everyone, convinced he&#146;s out in the middle of
nowhere surrounded by provincials, his plan is simply to file his report and get back to
civilization when his own car is eaten. Suddenly he&#146;s possessed, checking out every
half -eaten vehicle and farm implement (not to mention a power station bent, eaten, and
torn out of shape), until he finally makes a connection between Hogarth and half-obscured
words on the bent BB gun discovered at the power station. Hogarth becomes the key to his
investigation and while the boy is scurrying to hide his pal, Manley is dogging his steps.
Like a truly devious kid he resorts to devious bathroom humor to make his escape and see
his pal, safely hidden in Dean&#146;s junk yard. The three of them become an exclusive
little club, playing, swimming, making art out of the junk in the scarpyard (okay, just
Dean and the now excitedly creative robot, giddy with the discovery of his own ability to
make art).</p>

<p>Like most children&#146;s stories this follows a fairly simple, straightforward plot,
but that&#146;s not to suggest it&#146;s simplistic. Bird quite beautifully combines the
utopia of summer fun and unconditional friendship, a child&#146;s paradise of innocence
and trust, with the fall from grace represented by Manley, the paranoid government agent
who sees conspiracies, invasions, and America&#146;s compromised security with every piece
of evidence. Manley&#146;s fears are easy to understand -- the launching of Sputnik heated
up the cold war with a fire that finally raged into Vietnam and the Cuban Missile Crisis
-- but as the film progresses he turns from comic foil to power-mad fascist, no
one-dimensional cartoon villain but an all-too-scary patriot transformed into a
fear-driven zealot. In his zeal to save America from forces beyond his understanding he
threatens Hogarth with some really scary grown-up meanness: &quot;I can do anything I
want, whenever I want. If I think it&#146;s in the people&#146;s interest,&quot; he smirks
as he threatens to take Hogarth from his mom and put him in an orphanage -- if he
doesn&#146;t tell where the robot is.</p>

<p>His fears are confirmed in one respect only: Hogarth has no idea what the Iron Giant
really is. In fact, neither does the giant himself. The little dent on his metal skull
seems to have left him without any sense of identity -- he doesn&#146;t realize how strong
he is or know what powers he possesses, but he discovers a love of nature, a zeal for
friendship, a knack for playing, a passion for imagination&#133; he&#146;s a big kid who
wants to be a superhero. But when he sees a deer killed by hunters a second personality
emerges -- for brief seconds -- that turns his eyes fiery red and his temperament
vengeful. Like a split personality, it returns later while playing with Hogarth and the
Iron Giant&#146;s true origins are revealed in a scary, destructive explosion of weaponry.</p>

<p>Warner has struck out twice in attempting to break Disney&#146;s monopoly of must-see
animation. I haven&#146;t seen all of either of their first two films, but the moments
I&#146;ve glimpsed of <i>Quest For Camelot</i> from my niece&#146;s tape looks awfully
derivative and dull, and truly wretched clips I glimpsed in the trailers for <i>The King
and I </i>made that mundane animation look brilliant by contrast. <i>The Iron Giant</i>
takes a different tack. It doesn&#146;t look like any recent animated film, except
possibly the sleek, stylized look of the <i>Batman</i> TV series and feature film, and
eschews the fluidity and detail of Disney&#146;s house style for a look built on the
strong lines and simple designs, sort of a cross between a 1950s comic book and the
animation of a 1950s TV ad. The look is enhanced by excellent sound design. Most animated
features sound good -- they must to give weight and presence to the animated figures up
there -- but this is better than most, creating fantastic sounds to match the glorious
possibilities of what&#146;s up on the screen: booming crashes, flying whooshes,
sputtering electricity, screeching metal, all cranked up to levels of THX thunder that
echoes through the auditorium. </p>

<p>All this would be mere doodling if not for a resonant story, and that&#146;s the heart
of <i>The Iron Giant</i>. &quot;You are what you choose to be,&quot; insists Dean as
Hogarth, a kind of loner, explains how everyone at school thinks he&#146;s too small, too
weird. Hogarth discovers the truth of that when confronted with the violent second nature
of the Iron Giant, a destructive, unthinking malevolence completely at odds with the
cheery, fun loving, boyish best friend Hogarth has come to know and love. Bird gives that
moral true dimension when the Iron Giant risks all to prove his true nature -- the nature
he wants, not one that&#146;s been imposed by programming -- in a climax of chilling,
quiet apocalyptic terror that is sure to affect adults with its subdued hush more than
children.</p>

<p>I sat next to a kid, probably about five, and his Mom when I saw the film. The kid was
into it by the opening credits, simple titles that nonetheless overwhelmed the screen with
their monstrous size. He repeated to himself &quot;Oh no, oh no, oh no&quot; like a mantra
in a mixture of excitement and dread. Like most kids he chattered with his mom, who
shushed him politely but firmly, until he became so caught up in the film that he stopped
tossing off random thoughts and started engaging the film with smart questions. His
innocence enchanted me -- at the end, when Manley spins lies to the General in order to
push his own paranoid, hateful agenda of destruction, the kid turned to his mom genuinely
upset with this character&#146;s lies (too innocent to be outraged) fishing for some
answer as to exactly WHY he&#146;s spinning such hurtful fabrications. I knew then that
the film was really working.</p>

<p>I think <i>The Iron Giant</i> is well on its way to being a modern classic, a charming
fantasy with a moral that grows from within the heart of the film. For kids, it&#146;s a
simple tale of how hate and fear are destructive forces and can spin out of control. For
adults it uses the giddy story of a boy and his robot for a fun house mirror look at the
cold war and the politics of fear. But for everyone open to it, the story is about
friendship, about love, and about taking control of your own destiny. In the climactic
scene, as the Iron Giant repeats to himself his role model, &quot;Superman,&quot; in a
hushed voice of self-realization, I found myself taken in completely by the film. Perhaps
it unlocked the kid inside of me</p>
