<p><big><strong><big>W</big></strong>hat&#146;s a studio hiding when it refuses to
schedule a press screening for a new release? In the case of the high tech monster movie
Virus the answer seems obvious: the producers realized they had a lifeless dud on their
hands. A perfectly serviceable cast and millions of dollars of neat robot effects have
been wasted on the least exciting thriller since last summer&#146;s flat-footed film
version of <a href="../ravengers.html" target="_top"><i>The Avengers</i></a> (which not so
coincidentally also didn&#146;t screen for critics).</big></p>

<p>An energy field in space (a pastel cloud like you&#146;ve a half dozen times in Star
Trek movies and TV shows) zaps the Russian Space Station MIR, taking over the equipment
and then using their communications array to travel down to a monitoring science ship on
the Earth below. (A digression -- what is it with this sudden Hollywood assault on MIR?
After the merciless insults lobbed at the station during <a href="../rarmaged.html" target="_top"><i>Armageddon</i></a>
and now this attack you&#146;d think we were pathologically jealous of the Soviets.) Seven
days later an ostensibly American salvage tug foundering in a hurricane finds the ship
resting in the eye of the storm, a dead in the water, seemingly deserted salvage goldmine.
Tug Captain Robert Everton (Donald Sutherland), a desperate, dog-eared old salt drummed
out of the military for insubordination and a nasty temper, lights up in dollar signs: he
sees millions of dollars in this ghost ship, all legal salvage fees according to maritime
law. His navigator Kelly (Jamie Lee Curtis) is dubious; I mean, why the hell did the
Soviets abandon a $300 million ship in the middle of the Pacific? </p>

<p><img src="Images/rvirus-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">The rainbow crew
sets about investigating the craft, looking for survivors and anything else. Engineer
Stevie (William Baldwin) and his Cuban partner Squeaky (Julio Oscar Mechoso) discover the
power has been completed disabled but manage to bring the ship back to life, and in the
process waking the space cloud energy creature. Within minutes the Russian ship&#146;s
anchor plunges through the deck of the tug, almost killing Maori crewman Hiko (Cliff
Curtis) and stranding the crew on the Soviet vessel. Everton&#146;s number one, Woods
(Marshall Bell), a loyal but rather cowardly character with bug eyes and a battered
continence, and impatient hothead and former military weapons specialist Ritchie (Sherman
Augustus) fill out the crew, but one more is about to join the team. A Soviet scientist
survivor, Nadia (Joanna Pacula), is discovered in a state of agitation, obviously
terrified by something. She babbles on about &quot;it&quot; and &quot;them&quot; killing
the crew and taking control of the ship. Everton will have none of it, but the undeniable
evidence of blood stained decks, bullet riddled hallways, and armies of tiny recon robots
scuttling around the ship convinces Kelly to listen to her story.</p>

<p>At root <i>Virus</i> is an unimaginative reworking of earlier, better films, notably <i>Alien</i>
and, of all things, <i>Deep Rising</i>. The twist is that instead of some slimy monster
this motley crew of high seas salvage sailors put their wits up against a creature of pure
energy and thought -- &quot;Like lightning that can think,&quot; observes on character.
This super intelligent being is like living electricity, zipping through the vessel
through cables and communications lines and building an army of robotic warriors from the
conveniently fully functioning machine shops on the generously equipped science ship. Once
the electrical system is back on line these shops whir into a veritable Santa&#146;s
cyborg workshop of activity. To this non-corporeal life form, humans are spare parts at
best, and a virus on the Earth at worst. Thus while the being goes about exterminating the
humans, the rag-tag group battles to keep the ship from docking and allowing the force
access to a land based electrical grid where it can continue its holocaust unchecked. Once
again the fate of mankind rests in the hands of a shaggy crew of losers and low rent
survivors, but luckily for them this mastermind over matter</p>

<p>isn&#146;t quite as quick as his light-speed reputation would have it. For no apparent
reason humans are allowed to roam the ship and plot their attack while this being can only
think to send giant cyborgs made from a synthesis of robot parts and human flesh and
organs after them. It makes for pretty standard monster movie fare -- while the creature
was absorbing the ship&#146;s computer he must have tapped the Sci-Fi channel as well.</p>
<i>

<p>Virus</i> is derivative to a fault, but more damning is a complete lack of cinematic
intelligence or stylish fun. First time director John Bruno, a former special effects
supervisor for James Cameron, seems to have learned nothing from his mentor. Bruno&#146;s
idea of menace consists of a backlighting his hulking robots as they lumber down dark
hallways. <img src="Images/rvirus-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">It&#146;s an
effective image the first time, but after three or four of these things have made such an
entrance it doesn&#146;t have much bite. Even worse is his complete waste of the most
potentially horrific element of the film: the crew members turned into spare parts for the
all cyborg army. When first casualty Squeaky makes his re-entry decked out in robotic
headware and bionic limbs (resembling nothing less than a skid row version of the dreaded
Star Trek foe The Borg), the scene bursts with possibilities: Stevie seeing his best
friend transformed physically and mentally (there&#146;s a line in the trailer that echoes
<i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</i> where Squeaky says &quot;I&#146;ve never felt
better&quot; that for no logical reason has been removed from the finished film), the fear
of a fate worse than death, the weapon of the enemy wearing the face of a friend. Bruno
bobbles it entirely, at once so determined to give us an action scene that he neglects to
make us care, and so unimaginative in his direction that the action might as well be a
random series of cuts. He shoots everything head on, giving a flat monotony to scene after
scene. A nicely framed low angle could do wonders for his robot attacks, and an overhead
during a chase could really inject some much needed energy into this otherwise dutifully
edited piece. As the film nears its conclusion the cuts come faster, but the narrative
drive seems washed overboard in the storm.</p>

<p>There&#146;s not a single character that makes any impression in this film, completely
wasting the talents of Sutherland and la Curtis in roles which go absolutely nowhere (if
anyone can explain Capt. Everton&#146;s mad turn halfway through the film, I&#146;m all
ears). Bruno has no facility with his ensemble -- there&#146;s no chemistry between any of
the characters and only Curtis manages to pretend she cares about anyone. Dennis Feldman
and Jonathan Hensleigh, who wrote the screenplay based on Chuck Pfarrer&#146;s &quot;Dark
Horse&quot; comic, have together been responsible for such big, loud, dumb films as <i>Armaggedon</i>,
<a href="../rtherock.html" target="_top"><i>The Rock</i></a>, and <a href="../rspecies2.html" target="_top"><i>Species</i></a>
between them (Pfarrer&#146;s own record reveals <i>Navy SEALS</i> and <a href="../rbarbwir.html" target="_top"><i>Barb Wire</i></a> among others), but this paint by numbers
exercise is easily their most anonymous work to date. Producer Gale Anne Hurd has shown
her savvy talents as a smart script doctor on James Cameron&#146;s screenplays to <i>The
Terminator</i> and <a href="../ralien.html" target="_top"><i>Aliens</i></a>, but can work no such magic
here. </p>

<p>Nothing -- I mean nothing -- works in this film. <i>Virus</i> is the worst kind of bad
film out there. It&#146;s not simply inept, it&#146;s downright dull. </p>
