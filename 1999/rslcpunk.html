<p><big><strong><big>D</big></strong>on&#146;t take the exclamation point in the title too
seriously. This small, in-your-face, nostalgic slice of punk life found and lost in
mid-1980s Salt Lake City (a.k.a. SLC) is a moderately enjoyable scourging of red-necks and
Ronald Reagan. This anarchic, sometimes violent, fiction is based on the rebellious
recollections of its writer and director, James Merendino, a Catholic searching for his
identity in a Mormon state. As narrated by anti-abstinence Stevo (Scream&#146;s
hyper-kinetic Matthew Lillard, last seen in the dreadful <i>Wing Commander</i>), the film
spurts backward and forward in jigsaw puzzle fashion, force-filling in the story and
character gaps. It&#146;s the first role that seems well-fitted for its star, whose
nagging, earlier efforts tended to leave a noxious feeling in my stomach. Dolled up with
blue hair (perhaps in tribute to the film&#146;s creative entity, blue tulips productions,
formed by Speed&#146;s Jan De Bont and Michael Peyser to cultivate emerging cinematic
talent), he pairs off well with navy blue rubber-booted, mohawk-coiffed,
&quot;Heroin&quot; Bob (Party of Five&#146;s Michael Goorjian), so named because of his
fear of drugs and needles, yet, surprise!, he&#146;s a chem major.</big></p>

<p>Merendino uses a lot of strong colors, aptly captured by his long-time collaborator,
director of photography Greg Littlewood. &quot;The colors are in the form of an arc,
starting off cold, progressing to warm, then getting cold again&#133; The punk movement
was about color. They colored their hair, put make up on their faces and used a lot of
ugly colors like florescent green and puke yellow.&quot; Thank goodness this film
wasn&#146;t shot in black-and-white. The parade of vegetative characters that embellish
Merendino&#146;s vision include Sean (Devon Sawa, starring in next week&#146;s gross-out
comedy-horror fiasco Idle Hands), a green-haired acid freak who gives the appearance that
he recently stuck his hand in an electrical outlet, except for the fact that he&#146;s
always wearing mittens. Annabeth Gish (Mystic Pizza, Wyatt Earp, Nixon) is nearly
unrecognizable under the heavy makeup, Cleopatra wigs, and multiple costume changes, but
she fits in perfectly as Trish, Bob&#146;s Bohemian goddess girl friend.</p>

<p>Stevo and Bob hustle from grunge party to slam pit, careening off their comrades and
grabbing drugs from their radical carousel&#146;s brass ring. As Stevo recounts meeting
the witty and sexy Sandy (<i>American History X&#146;s</i> Jennifer Lien), a geekish Mike
(Jason Segel, resembling a Matthew Modine clone), or the rich and paranoid Mark (Til
Schweiger), who lives off the blood money that wiped out his family in a European air
wreck but spared a then eleven-year-old to suffer psychotic bouts with himself for years
to come, our &quot;hero&quot; keeps bouncing back to milestones recalled from his past.
Chief among these non-linear remembrances is the strained relationship with his baffled,
divorced parents. Dad&#146;s a red sweater pullover type who went to Woodstock before
selling out to corporate America. He hopes only the best for his son, namely that he
follow in his own false footsteps and attend Harvard Law School.</p>

<p>The rebels do find an occasional cause, such as fleeing the fascist state Utah for
neighboring &quot;Like No Place on Earth&quot; Wyoming to score something better than the
weak junk beer available at home. The blond-haired Eddie (Adam Pascal), a womanizing
bloke, handles the gas-guzzling, black-finned Cadillac as it coasts into a border liquor
outpost. Their appearance is greeted by the mom-and-pop owners much as if Martians just
landed, until Eddie calmly explains that the proprietors should lend them countenance
because they&#146;re British. It&#146;s a short, throw-away segment that exposes the weak
script and attempt at witty dialogue. It customarily resolves itself in a brawl, an
oft-used plot device battling punkers against members of the white rural working class or
the cops.</p>

<p>SLC Punk ends on a disquieting note as the group slowly disbands and moves on to a
responsible or other-world existence. Bob attempts to re-connect with his old man, but
gets greeted by paranoid rantings about the CIA and gun shots, apparently a warning that
it&#146;s time to get on with your life. Soon after Bob takes an unexpected journey,
forcing Steve into a dull, off-putting &quot;like father, like son&quot; fadeout. Having
missed the punk scene entirely (I don&#146;t regret it one bit), I found the film
marginally disquieting and its characters described more through voice over and attire
than by acting. It&#146;s an adequate effort. No more, no less.</p>
