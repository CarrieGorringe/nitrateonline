<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="5"><b>T</b></font><font size="4">here's
a moment partway through <i>The Hurricane</i> that may cause you to catch your
breath. It's a cramped shot, as are most of those showing Ruben Hurricane Carter
(Denzel Washington) in his New Jersey State Prison cell. The camera frames his
face and upper body in deep shadow as he reads a letter from a new
correspondent, a boy who's been moved by the inmate's autobiography, which
details his unjust incarceration. As Ruben reads the letter, you notice a
photograph that he has taped to his cell wall, just above his shoulder. It's the
famous image of Malcolm X, kneeling in prayer in the Middle East.</font> <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
shot is striking because it so clearly juxtaposes two remarkable black
historical figures, both renowned for being persecuted and resilient. It's
perhaps more striking, however, because it shows two incredible roles for Denzel
Washington. The irony is that, while Washington was roundly praised for his
performance as Malcolm, there was no way in hell that he would have ever been
awarded mainstream prizes, like the Oscar, for it, as it was a gigantically
ambitious, wild-ass movie directed by a loud-mouthed, incredibly talented black
director, Spike Lee. That Malcolm was a larger than life angry black man, not to
mention stubborn, politically astute, and brilliant, surely didn't make Academy
type people feel any easier about the film, the character, the filmmakers, or
the points they might have been making. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">So
now, just a few years later, Washington is appearing as another angry black man
who is also legendary, articulate, and honorable. Only this time, he's playing a
character who turns his attitudes about race and injustice around, who is
actually <i>saved</i> by a group of white people. His historical and
metaphorical anger is ameliorated, in other words, by a plot that makes it all
right to like nice white folks. Jewison's film makes Ruben a much less alarming
black man than Lee's Malcolm. It's not a little ironic, either, that Jewison was
the man who directed <i>A Soldier's Story</i>, the film that made Denzel a movie
star, or that he was one of several white directors scheduled and unscheduled,
over many years, to direct <i>Malcolm X</i>. At the time, Lee argued
specifically that a white man could not do the story justice. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
Hurricane</span></i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'s
Ruben Carter is hardly as volatile as the cinematic Malcolm. This despite the
fact that there are any number of reasons for him to be furious, and the movie
doesn't skimp on them. Most of its scenes take place in Ruben's various cells or
during the brief moments of his release, when he's really only waiting to be
thrown back inside (punctuated by repeated images of large, loud prison doors
and gates closing). And the movie closes at the point when Ruben, standing
before a crusty federal appeals judge (Rod Stieger), learns that, after spending
22 years in prison for a triple homicide he did not commit, he will be set free.
It's as if, once the character no longer behind bars, the story is complete, or
has lost its dramatic capacities, or has run out of steam. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">This
character is, of course, based on a real life person, a 1966 welterweight boxing
champion named The Hurricane because of his fury and beauty in the ring, his
resemblance to a &quot;natural force.&quot; It's appropriate that the movie
begins in the state penitentiary where Ruben spent so much of his life, just as
his cell is about to be &quot;tossed&quot; (searched). He's all charged up,
prepared to fight off the intruders with all his skills and instincts. He's
eventually calmed by a friendly guard (Clancy Brown), and the manuscript is
rescued. It also makes sense that the film begins with a conflict about Ruben's
book, <i>The 16th Round</i>, which gives him a voice (which, in real life, won
real responses from 60s celebrity activists interested in freeing him).
Throughout, the film's prison scenes are awful, in particular, one sequence
where he's in solitary, and Washington in effect acts three characters, three
versions of Ruben, frightened and humbled, aggressive and enraged, and the self
caught between them, thoughtful but suspicious of his own beliefs, unable to
make sense of this incredible situation. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It's
incredible -- but all too true and even mundane for so many minority prisoners
in the U.S. -- that he's in jail for something he didn't do, that lawyers and
judges for years ignore the obviously inconsistent evidence against him in the
three murders case. But <i>The Hurricane</i> means to persuade, not alienate,
its viewers It's not about to leave you feeling as righteously and completely
incensed as Ruben Carter felt during his life, or as Washington conveys. And so,
the movie backs off, and constructs a singular and cartoonish villain, a
Lieutenant Della Pesca (Dan Hedaya, looking even uglier than usual, especially
when they layer on the old-man makeup for later scenes). It's not clear why
Della Pesca despises Ruben --from the time he is a child -- so much that he uses
nefarious means to frame him for that triple homicide. It is clear that Della
Pesca is a metaphor for institutional and irrational racism (which you might
intuit from the film's use of many background tv images of police brutality
against black people and Civil Rights workers). But he's a clunky metaphor,
unconvincing as a character and too easy for audience members to dismiss as
unreal. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Rather,
viewers are allowed to identify with the well-intentioned (and eventually
successful: otherwise there would be no story to tell) do-gooders. They are led
by Lesra (Vicellous Shannon), black and Brooklyn-born, now living in Toronto
with a threesome he calls &quot;the Canadians,&quot; Terry (John Hannah), Lisa
(Deborah Unger), and Sam (Liev Schreiber), who make their living by &quot;fixing
up&quot; old houses. So well-intentioned are these white people, that they have
rescued Lesra from his illiterate life, brought him home, and prepared him to
apply to college. His discovery of Ruben's book at a used book sale (some ten
years after its initial publication, as its author continues to languish in
prison) makes a dramatic connection. As Lesra reads, his own background is
intercut with Ruben's, and it becomes clear that they are fated to come
together, to help and cherish one another in ways that no one else has been able
or inclined. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
love story between Ruben and Lesra is beautiful and tactfully told -- how many
mainstream films do you know that might show a romance (wholly asexual as it
is), between two black men? -- but the movie can't leave it alone. Rather, it
frames and reframes their intimacy with images of the white folks. Surely, the
&quot;true story&quot; fell out something like this: after coming to know
Hurricane, the three Canadians and Lesra moved to New Jersey and devoted their
time and energies to digging up the old corrupt evidence and making a case
strong enough to go before that federal appeals court and win. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">But
to shape this story so neatly, the screenplay -- by Armyan Bernstein and Dan
Gordon, based on <i>Lazarus and The Hurricane</i> by Sam Chaiton and Terry
Swinton (two of the Canadians), and Carter's own autobiography -- reduces
complications and short-shrifts characters like Della Pesca and Ruben's wife,
Mae Thelma (Debbi Morgan), who appears for just enough scenes to be upset and
supportive (and to give Ruben a son), and is then disappeared, to make emotional
room for Ruben's new &quot;family.&quot; All this coherence and rearrangement
make <i>The Hurricane</i> disturbing. For all the courage and vitality it grants
its protagonist, it's not a brave film. <o:p>
