have to pity poor Joel Schumacher. Not only is he accused of single-handedly
destroying the <i>Batman</i> franchise, but his last film, the bleak <i><a href="http://www.ipass.net/~jbarlow/8mm.htm" target="_top">8mm</a></i>,
was ridiculed by the majority of critics in America. I can visualize
Schumacher's conversation with himself: &quot;Hmm... I've just made several
critical duds in a row. What am I doing wrong? Let's see. The <i>Batman</i>
films and <i>8mm</i> all share dark, creepy atmospheres, and that genre's
obviously not working for me. Let's go the opposite route on the
follow-up.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></h4>
<p style="mso-outline-level:5"><span style="mso-font-kerning:18.0pt">It's almost
cute the way Schumacher rolls with the punches, and it's no surprise that in <i>Flawless</i>,
a title that almost dares critics not to like the movie, the writer/director
tries to play it safe... or at least as safe as any film which centers around a
flamboyant transvestite can be considered to be. Everything here seems
specifically constructed to avoid offensiveness or friction, and it's the
movie's single biggest problem: everything has been so homogenized that what
could have been a fascinating film comes out as a cinematic vanilla pudding,
lacking any sort of flavor whatsoever. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p style="mso-outline-level:5"><span style="mso-font-kerning:18.0pt">Walter
Koonz (Robert De Niro) is a cranky ex-cop and raging homophobe who finds himself
partially paralyzed and unable to speak after suffering a stroke. Embarrassed by
his condition, Koonz begins taking voice lessons from Rusty Zimmerman (Philip
Seymour Hoffman), a local transvestite who adheres to every gay stereotype and
cliche' imaginable. You'll no doubt be shocked to learn that as they grow
closer, they form a deep bond. Just consider this the low-calorie version of <i>As
Good as it Gets</i>. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p style="mso-outline-level:5"><i><span style="mso-font-kerning:18.0pt">Flawless</span></i><span style="mso-font-kerning:18.0pt">
desperately wants to be <i>The Odd Couple</i>, and there are moments in which it
comes close, drawing us into the lives of the characters as they come to terms
with each other and their differences. Both De Niro and Hoffman are engaging
actors, with Hoffman's bubbling screen persona serving as a brilliant
counterpoint to De Niro's gruff demeanor. They each have a firm handle on two
very challenging characters (De Niro actually wore weights in his clothes to
help him prepare for his role as a stroke victim), and they work well together. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p style="mso-outline-level:5"><span style="mso-font-kerning:18.0pt">But sadly,
the performances are all <i>Flawless</i> has going for it. The few sparks of
fire De Niro and Hoffman are able to inject into the story are quickly
extinguished by Schumacher's adherence to the lowest common denominator, such as
the laughable finale, which is so deeply mired in clichés that it's hard to
resist the temptation to hurl popcorn at the screen. Nor is the drama helped by
the unimaginative shooting methods employed by Schumacher. We may as well be
watching a TV sitcom--or a play. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<span style="font-size:12.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;color:black;mso-font-kerning:18.0pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-US;
mso-fareast-language:EN-US;mso-bidi-language:AR-SA">I'll give Schumacher an 'A'
for effort: with <i>Flawless</i> he's demonstrated a willingness to deviate from
his previous work, and he's created a film with the potential for power and
drama. Unfortunately, the director does not yet appear to have either the
confidence or ability to helm a project which requires such depth; hence, we're
treated to countless gay stereotypes and unimaginative plot twists (Stolen drug
money? Yawn). Oh well. It was a nice try, Joel, and I mean that. Maybe next
time.</span>
