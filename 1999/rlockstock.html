<p><big><strong><big>A</big></strong>fter last week&#146;s screening of <i>Lock, Stock and
Two Smoking Barrels</i>, I came to the conclusion that many people in Seattle have been
drinking too much coffee during the past Prozac Season (known as Winter to the rest of the
nation). One of the local film fans, who had obviously imbibed one too many triple-shot,
no-foams during his daily routine, took it upon himself to treat the waiting audience to
an extemporaneous film review. Said review consisted of the following outburst: &quot;This
film rocks, man! You are so lucky to be seeing this film for the first time. I wish I was
seeing this film again for the first time!&quot; So amazed was our unknown sage at his own
eloquence that, over the next twenty minutes, he broke the normal buzz of pre-film
conversation three more times, never once deviating from the script except to add greater
emphasis and volume. Reactions were mixed: some just shielded their faces with their coat
collars and turned away (the avoiding-the drunk-next-to-you-on-the-bus approach), some
wanted to provide him with some Valium (the pharmaceutical approach) and some wanted to
avail themselves of the closest-possible Uzi (the critical approach). Fortunately, the
individual toddled off into the night before anything could happen, but the episode served
as a reminder, if one were necessary, that Seattleites are passionate about film. This
week, someone was shot in a suburban Seattle movie theater &#150; for talking during a
screening. What others might see as just further evidence of naked aggression and
spreading incivility in our society, we here in Seattle would interpret as dedication to
the art form. What better place, then, to unspool the latest dark-horse darling from
Sundance, a black comedy about a heist gone wrong shot in thirty-six days and with a
budget of less than a million dollars?</big></p>

<p>As a debut film, <i>Lock, Stock</i> has the distinction of looking as if its director,
Guy Ritchie, had gotten fifty pounds for every pound he collected; the film&#146;s gritty
look stems from the necessity of the setting, not its economics (he should moonlight as a
financial advisor, given his obvious talent for stretching a pound past the point of
screaming). Moreover, Ritchie is truly a gifted storyteller, able to create sophisticated
narratives and characterizations on a dime; <i>Lock, Stock</i> is constructed on a
circular platform, involvingthe various interactions of (take a deep breath) four
trying-to-do-well friends, one of whom (Moran) fancies himself quite a card shark, a porn
king (Moriarty) with a crooked poker game, two thuggish underlings, and a penchant for gun
collecting, two antique rifles, a half-million pound debt, three upper-class twits with a
lucrative marijuana-growing business, a drug kingpin who also has several thuggish
underlings, and the usual treachery, rivalry, and bald-faced incompetence thrown in to
make life interesting. Saying anything more would give away the jeweler&#146;s intricacy
with which Ritchie assembles all of these discrete elements and keeps them moving in
logical, entertaining lockstep, and he even manages to lace the various characters with
enough backstory to elevate them above the one-dimensional realm (it also helps to have
dedicated and talented people in said roles, most notably former soccer star Vinnie Jones,
hilarious in the part of Big Chris, the laconically nasty enforcer). Very occasionally,
some of the film&#146;s momentum slows down a wee bit too much, but surviving the
traditional peril of the transitional middle section of any story is a challenge for the
best of directors, and Ritchie&#146;s ability to slog through it and come out charging is
proof of his right to membership in that group. Lock, Stock is a movie for fans of the
nuts-and-bolts of storytelling with a flourish to savor. However, be prepared to sit
through the entire 110 minutes; if you leave, you&#146;ll be lost, and, if you live in
Seattle, don&#146;t try asking the person next to you for a quick synopsis&#133;</p>

<p>Alas, not everything about <i>Lock, Stock</i> is as trouble-free. Ritchie has
accumulated some annoying habits from his previous role as a director of commercials which
must be lost &#150; and without any hesitation. One hint: using freeze-frames during the
opening credits, a la Richard Lester and <i>A Hard Day&#146;s Night</i>, is a charmingly
cheeky reference; using the same technique repeatedly in lieu of anything intelligent to
say is a bloody pain where a pill won&#146;t reach. Mercifully, the flaws are few. <i>Lock,
Stock</i> both rocks and smokes.&nbsp; </p>
