<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="5"><b>I</b></font><font size="4">n 1976, Martin
Scorsese’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal"><a href="../ftaxi.html" target="_top">Taxi Driver</a></i> exploded from the screen
like a flaming molotov cocktail. More frightening than any conventional horror
film, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Taxi Driver</i> blindsided its
viewers with a crazed protagonist, whose inability to connect with others --
coupled with his day-by-day immersion in the red-light hell-pits of New York
City -- becomes a recipe for carnage. If ever there was a film destined for the
time capsule, which accurately captured the motives, routines, and sad logic
that packed the twisted minds of urban vigilantes and assassins<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">,
Taxi Driver</i> was it.&nbsp; Viewers attained a reluctant understanding of the
frustration oozing from the cranium of disturbed cabby Travis Bickle.&nbsp;
Later, they winced at his destructive means of dealing with rejection by the
seemingly uncaring masses teeming around him.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Taxi Driver</i> also
projected a certain renegade, youthful attitude in its filmmaking style:
dreamlike, slow motion sequences paraded alongside sinister bird’s eye
perspectives, before a blood-soaked finale threatened the film with an X rating.
During a year when the feel-good boxing fantasy <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Rocky</i>
took Best Picture honors at The Oscars, few films had dared to paint violent,
seedy characters with such intimate, truthful strokes.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Fast forward to 1999, and Scorsese’s latest offering, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Bringing
Out the Dead</i>, echoes the Dante’s Inferno of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Taxi
Driver. </i>There’s a tortured hero on the brink of a breakdown. There’s a
doomed female in need of salvation. There’s an inner-city landscape of crazed
street people, pregnant hookers, and suavely sinister drug lords. However,
it’s clear that the veteran director and his screenwriting partner Paul
Schrader, who teamed up with Scorsese twenty three years ago to bring Travis
Bickle to life, are seeing life through the eyes of mellowing pros.&nbsp;
They’re not the restless upstarts they were while parenting <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Taxi
Driver</i>.&nbsp; Salvation, not slaughter, is prioritized in this surprisingly
understated, optimistic trip into the trenches of paramedic life.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Nicholas Cage plays Frank, a burnout EMT whose life is
spent prowling the streets in his ambulance, waiting for calls from his
dispatcher and answering them like a mailman tossing letters from postbox to
postbox. Oh sure, the work is harrowing, but Frank is so accustomed to the
life-and-death routine that all the drama has been sapped out of this medical
rat race. This isn’t <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ER</i>, where the
camera’s jittery movements project a pulse-raising immediacy. Instead,
Frank’s rather bleak adventures are matter-of-fact and somber. When he bursts
into the apartment of a heart attack patient and performs CPR, there’s a quiet
hush to the proceedings. Then he breaks the silence, by instructing the dying
man’s daughter to “play some music that he liked. ”Such an unlikely
icebreaker establishes an awkward relationship between Mary, the daughter trying
to shake a drug-addled past, and Frank, who gains a sort of human sanctuary in
their connection.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It’s a bond that Frank is unable to find in the neurotic
company of his EMT partners.&nbsp; There’s Larry (John Goodman), who refuses
to let the horrors of the job come between his mouth and a good subway sandwich.&nbsp;
Marcus (Ving Rhames) guzzles booze on the job but relies on scripture to give
meaning to his plight, while the bullying Walls (Tom Sizemore) allows a sort of
gleeful psychosis to charge his battery. To this twisted brute, the sight of
blood just adds to the excitement of another night on the town.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At the heart of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Bringing
Out the Dead</i> is the ghost of Rose, a young transient whose life Frank failed
to save. Like Iris, the teenage prostitute whom Bickle attempts to “rescue”
from a life on the street, Rose becomes a persistent obsession. Her haunted eyes
peer from the faces of other unlucky patients, her specter lurking behind
tenement doorways and down dark alleys. Meanwhile, Frank walks a thin tightrope
of sanity, losing patients at an escalating rate and desperate to save a life.
Frank’s twisted logic dictates that by rescuing another, perhaps he can shake
the phantom of Rose, before finding some long-sought refuge in the arms of Mary.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The best thing about <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Bringing
Out the Dead</i> is its portrayal of Frank’s redundant routine, as he spins
circles in this dizzying health care carousel. As dispatchers instruct him to
seek out a familiar gallery of drunks, transients, and schizophrenics, Cage
depicts the despair that comes with rescuing the same dependent faces night
after night. Noel (Marc Anthony), a psychotic street person, is a revolving door
presence at Frank’s hospital.&nbsp; Indeed, his wild-eyed face and impatient
demands for water are as familiar as the haggard nurses and security guards
roaming its halls. Schrader’s wise screenplay takes pains to show that the
majority of these human rescue resources are spent catering to a select audience
of repeat customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Meanwhile, there are those like Cy Coates (played by the
familiar Cliff Curtis, of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Three Kings</i>),
a drug dealer who plays host at The Oasis, a sinister sanctuary for the addicted
masses. But unlike the relationship between Harvey Keitel’s
prostitute-peddling Sport and De Niro’s Bickle, his pent-up nemesis and
eventual executioner, there is a low-key amiability when Frank and Cy spar off.&nbsp;
Indeed, Frank is such an obvious bundle of nerves, Cy doesn’t expend much
effort to interest him in the ingestion a mind-altering pill or two.&nbsp;
Later, when the frayed paramedic storms into The Oasis to retrieve the
backsliding Mary, the scene doesn’t end in a halo of gunfire like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Taxi
Driver</i> did when Travis unleashes his wrath at Iris’ house of ill repute.
Instead, Cy lets his guard down and lets the duo leave peacefully. God knows,
he’ll have other customers.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Cage is tailor-made for the role of Frank, a far more
sympathetic figure than De Niro’s creepy cabby. Frank is out to save the
masses: Bickle’s destructive quest to remove Iris from her shackles was also a
self-serving catharsis. Frank demonstrates a sincere empathy with his patients,
where Travis proved entirely unable to relate to anyone in his lonely urban
bubble. With his haunted eyes and edgy ticks, Cage is eccentric enough to
project a man on the verge of losing his hold on reality. On the other hand,
he’s always tempered such weirdness with a sympathetic edge.&nbsp; When he
bashes in car windows with the manic Noel, it’s as if he knows he’s just a
step away from street-bound insanity himself. He could <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">be</i>
Noel.&nbsp; Later, when Frank rescues this sad case from the sadistic Walls, the
good-hearted paramedic realizes that his humanity is in check, even if his
mental balance isn’t. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Goodman is perfect as the food-obsessed Larry, who bundles
up his on-the-job identity like a tidy sleeping bag when he’s not sounding the
ambulance siren.&nbsp; Larry’s a master at compartmentalization of his bloody
job routine. Rhames’ Marcus conveys a smug inner peace, as the Bible-quoting
Christian who perceives each life saving deed as a God-directed miracle.&nbsp;
The most memorable supporting role belongs to Sizemore. It’s difficult to find
another actor who boasts such a degenerate smorgasbord of psychos on his acting
resume: Walls merely adds to the list. “All <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">right</i>,”
he cackles as a dispatcher places a call to his ambulance.&nbsp; “More
blood!”When the red stops flowing, Walls creates his own.&nbsp; Watching he
and Frank take a hallucinatory joyride into the bowels of Hell’s Kitchen, to
the bouncy tune of REM’s “What’s the Frequency, Kenneth?”, is a
priceless image of two men negotiating fantasy and reality.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Bringing Out the Dead</i>
ends with Frank finding his redemption. But it’s a kinder, gentler resolution
than <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Taxi Driver</i>’s mid-seventies malevolence. After his spiritual foray
into Zen Buddhism, 1996’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Kundun</i>,
perhaps Scorsese is attempting to pay penance for the violent images of his past
work. It’s a refreshing contrast. The final scenes of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Taxi Driver</i> exploded with pent-up frustration. In <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Bringing
Out the Dead, </i>the guy who makes a living cleaning up the carnage left by
madmen like Bickle is afforded a night of peace. It’s well deserved.&nbsp;</p>
