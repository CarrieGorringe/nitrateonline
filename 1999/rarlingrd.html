<p><big><strong><big>I</big></strong>n <i>Arlington Road</i>, the first major Hollywood
film to deal with the current rise in domestic terrorism, Michael Faraday (Jeff Bridges),
a history professor who teaches a course on terrorism at George Washington University, is
driving home one day to his house in an upper-middle-class suburb -- all peaked roofs and
cupolas -- on the Virginia side of the Potomac, when he sees a young boy, walking down the
middle of the street, in shock, slowly bleeding to death. After taking him to the
hospital, he's greeted by the boy's parents, Oliver and Cheryl Lang (Tim Robbins and Joan
Cusack). As it turns out, they live just across the street from each him; as Michael's son
starts playing regularly with theirs, the adults soon become friends, as well, with indoor
dinners and cookouts in the backyard. </big></p>

<p>But something about the Langs' explanation for their son's injury doesn't quite gel
with Michael, nor do other things that he begins seeing happening around them, as well.
Michael lost his wife, a Federal agent, during a botched Ruby Ridge-like operation, and
his son, Grant (Spencer Treat Clark), has grown diffident towards him and towards the
perfectly nice woman, Brooke (Hope Davis), whom Michael has started seeing. Are Michael's
increasing feelings of suspicion towards the Langs rooted in something real, or are they
coming from his resentment over seeing his son transferring his affections towards the
more traditionally paternalistic Oliver? </p>

<p><img src="Images/ralingrd-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">Oliver turns out
to be living under an alias, and he indeed has a past, one that includes a Federal offense
involving explosives and for which he served time. Michael is shown becoming alternately
argumentative and underhanded. Why doesn't he just walk across the street and tell Oliver
that he has trouble being friends with someone who is not living under his real name?
Instead, it is Oliver who confronts Michael, telling him that, &quot;if you have issues
with me,&quot; he could at least come to him directly. Jeff Bridges' Michael is left with
an almost drunken look on his face that suggests he's in a stupor confounded out of
confusion, nervous fatigue, and incredulity. </p>

<p>For a while, it looks as if <i>Arlington Road</i> might not be as square as we might
expect it to be. However, whatever mystery might have been generated over whether the
Langs are subversives or not is squelched by their being presented as strange and unreal
right from the start. Tim Robbins portrays Oliver with flat-cut hair that overemphasizes
his wide brow, and with the hulking, glassy-eyed, slightly distracted appearance of
someone who is just waiting to go over the edge. Along with his son, he has two daughters
who scowl at the camera with the spooky, reproachful look of twins in a Diane Arbus
photograph. Joan Cusack, on the other hand, gives her character, a woman who lives behind
a veneer of forced pleasantries and bland politeness, just the right tone of someone
struggling to maintain perfection which, in retrospect, seems almost poignant. </p>

<p>What is Oliver's agenda? What, if any, group is he aligned with, and what are their
objections? The filmmakers are utterly ambiguous on this point. The subversives depicted
in the film are simply an amorphous &quot;them&quot; out there, wreaking havoc, not all
that unlike the great, big amorphous &quot;them&quot; in authority who are supposed to be
responsible for everything that's gone wrong with the country. But what does Oliver
consider to be &quot;wrong?&quot; Only that those in power must be made to &quot;pay&quot;
for what they've done. Oliver simply seems like he's anti-authoritarian, but he never
offers any specifics that would justify why he would turn into a bomb-thrower who would
willingly kill innocent people to make a point. </p>

<p>The film might have worked if it had shown Michael, obsessed to the point where he
could no longer bear to stand by while his neighbor plots mass murder, trying to stop
Oliver by resorting to the same renegade tactics that we've seen him earlier deploring in
his class, objectifying how widespread the malaise of violence has become. Instead, the
filmmakers resort to having Jeff Bridges madly hurtling himself, wide eyed, through one
scene after another (something I'd hoped I'd never have to see him do again after his
misadventures in <i>Blown Away</i>) while Robbins is reduced to the level of a sibilant,
hissing devil -- all stuff that we've seen a thousand times before in a thousand other bad
movies -- and a crucial plot turn that requires a great, nay, tremendous leap of faith on
the part of the audience. </p>

<p><img src="Images/rarlingrd-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">I'll give the
filmmakers credit for opting for a downbeat ending, one that acknowledges that there's no
easy solution to the social problems that it addresses. But I wonder if the filmmakers
fully understand what they're dealing with. Michael is shown telling his class that
domestic terrorism is a mystifying &quot;Resistance&quot; movement that has sprung forth
during our &quot;age of prosperity,&quot; and that the public, unable to deal with the
idea of organized anarchy, prefer to reduce the problem to that of one lone man, acting on
his own. I don't think anybody believes that Timothy McVeigh, or Lee Harvey Oswald, for
that matter, acted alone. And grass-roots terrorism isn't in response to
&quot;prosperity,&quot; it's a response from people who feel powerless. Unemployment is
down, but thousands of homeless people have long since dropped out of the percentile. The
agricultural communities in the Midwest have never fully recovered from the widespread
bankruptcies and foreclosures of the Eighties, during which the Reagan administration
stood by and did nothing. Most couples I know of have to work two jobs in order to support
their families, while still remembering a time when they only had one parent who was
working. And politicians on Capitol Hill are still, 18 years after the snowball fight
first got started, playing right down along Party lines, with little or no apparent
concern for the public well-being. People become so disillusioned and apathetic towards
the voting process that they stop exercising the right to do so. We could do with a
dynamite film on domestic terrorism which would be thrilling and yet wake-up the audience
a bit. <i>Arlington Road</i> is not only ambiguous, it's ultimately so afraid of pushing
anyone's hot button that it ends up rendering itself totally ineffective on any level.</p>
