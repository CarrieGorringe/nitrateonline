<p><big><strong><big>Q</big></strong>uebecois filmmaker turned auteur without borders
Francois Girard has only made three features, and most of the world doesn&#146;t even have
the chance to see his first film, a French language feature that, like many of the French
Canadian films, never received distribution outside it&#146;s borders. That&#146;s
starting to change for Canadian filmmakers, who in the past few years have flex their
creative muscle on the independent circuit. David Cronenberg has effectively kept his
filmmaking base in Toronto and utilized Canadian talent at least behind the scenes while
using Hollywood for stars and distribution, and the past decade Atom Egoyan, Bruce
MacDonald, Patricia Rozema, Denys Arcand and others have carved out a small but vital
filmmaking presence while remaining in their own country. Girard is one of Canada&#146;s
genuine success stories, creating a stir with his quasi-experimental art-house hit <i>32
Short Films About Glenn Gould </i>(1993) and this year receiving critical accolades for
his ambitious, international musical epic <i>The Red Violin</i>, a film that travels time
and borders with equal ease. The winner of 8 Genie awards in Canada, including Best
Picture and Best Director, and one of Canada&#146;s biggest homegrown hits of all time
it&#146;s finally making it&#146;s American debut.</big></p>

<p>I talked with Mr. Girard while he appeared with his film at the Seattle International
Film Festival, where his screenwriting collaborator Don McKellar (who also appears in both
<i>32 Short Films </i>and <i>The Red Violin</i>) was presenting his directorial debut <i>Last
Night </i>(which will see an American release in the Fall). Girard is a young looking man,
enthusiastic and excited to talk about his films. He spent over 5 years making <i>The Red
Violin </i>and we talked about the genesis of that and <i>32 Short Films</i>, about films
without borders, and the problems of making films in his own Quebec culture.</p>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p><em><strong>Sean Axmaker:</strong></em> I&#146;ve only seen two of your films, <i>32
Short Films About Glenn Gould </i>and <i>The Red Violin</i>. Can you tell me about your
career before those features?</p>

<p><em><strong>Francois Girard:</strong></em> I did a number of things. <i>32 Short Films </i>was
my second feature film, my first film was <i>Cargo </i>(1990), shot in French in Quebec
and it couldn&#146;t get distribution here. I started as a video artist and I did all
sorts of things after that. I founded a company that eventually became my film school
where I would work with experimental stuff like architectural films and dance films, short
dramas and eventually it drifted into the feature film side. But my main efforts for the
past 10 years went to developing and shooting feature films.</p>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p><em><strong>SA:</strong></em> The features I&#146;ve seen show a different kind of
narrative background. They aren&#146;t exactly what one might expect when they walk into a
theater to see a biographical drama.</p>

<p><em><strong>FG:</strong></em> I&#146;m a firm believer that film can be so many things.
The film language is very powerful and still hasn&#146;t delivered. There are so many
things to explore. As a filmgoer I&#146;m really easy. I&#146;m seeing very conventional
stuff, I can enjoy almost anything as long as it&#146;s good, but as a filmmaker I&#146;m
really tough on myself. I&#146;m really trying to make films that I haven&#146;t seen, for
myself first. It&#146;s not a presumptuous thing where I think I can contribute in a very
special way to the film world, it&#146;s just me, I automatically turn down every project
that feels like something I&#146;ve seen before. I&#146;m really asking myself &quot;Is it
worth giving up three years of your life to repeat something that was made before?&quot;
We have a lot of that in the film industry. Repetition is a big threat to creativity and I
really like to challenge myself with forms or ideas that would bring me into an area that
is not saturated with 20 treatments or films that already exist.</p>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p><em><strong>SA:</strong></em> How did the idea of shooting Glenn Gould&#146;s life as
32 separate short films come about to begin with?</p>

<p><em><strong>FG: </strong></em>Well bio-pics, you know, this is something you realize
and rationalize in writing and shooting those films, but I came to the conclusion that one
of the toughest things with bio-pics is to condense one&#146;s life into an hour and a
half or two hours. It&#146;s a very tough thing and I think the worst thing is the idea of
trying to show everything, and if you look at bio-pics in general, like <i>Amadeus </i>by
Milos Forman, is maybe of the best examples of a good bio-pic an it takes a very specific
angle on Mozart and it&#146;s not trying to show everything but it&#146;s looking at a
very narrow moment in Mozart&#146;s life which is his final years and confrontation with
Saliari, but from that you can understand and it resonates beyond that and you can
actually access the whole. So in <i>32 Short Films</i> I had to solve that problem and
also the most important piece in his recording career was like the Goldberg variation,
that was his first recording also almost his last, the day of his death they put on the
market the second version, so it&#146;s sort of framing perfectly well his entire
recording career and working life and life, almost. So that became the trigger for a
fragmented angle and when you allow yourself to look at details, the game really became:
What are the 32 most essential fragments? Throw those fragments onscreen and it becomes
those dots that the audience is linking by a line and eventually you get an image, a
larger image. I think if I didn&#146;t have that I would have been, like&#133; Glenn
Gould&#146;s life and work is so complex and so layered that as soon as you start to
picture the whole thing I think you&#146;re cooked. I don&#146;t see how you can do that.</p>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p><strong><em>SA:</em></strong> In the early process of developing <i>The Red Violin </i>did
you have more stories?</p>

<p><em><strong>FG: </strong></em>No, that came quite early. The structure in five episodes
came quite early. The beginning of <i>The Red Violin</i> was: We&#146;re going to tell the
life of the violin and no one ever survived 300 years. We knew that the film had to cover
three centuries therefor the first indication of that was that we had to deal with a
number of owners so I guess you go instinctively for an odd number. Three is not enough,
seven is too much, you end up using five. It&#146;s really a natural answer, it&#146;s
almost organic answer to the problem. And then from there you work for years writing the
script trying and to make those five episodes feel like one. It was actually the opposite
process of <i>32 Short Films</i>, where it was one film pretending to be 32. In this case
it&#146;s five pretending to be one. It&#146;s going the other way around but still
dealing with a fragmented style. I think every film is fragmented, it&#146;s the nature of
cinema to fragment time and space. But I guess I&#146;m interested in exposing those
problems in the structure of my films.</p>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p><em><strong>SA: </strong></em>Where did you get the idea of suturing the stories
together with the fortune teller of the first episode and the auction of the last episode?
It&#146;s like it&#146;s bookended by these two events, one which predicts what&#146;s
going to happen and one which draws back the history from what already happened and ties
it all together.</p>

<p><em><strong>FG: </strong></em>That came very early and in response to that problem that
I just told you about. I guess that the most difficult challenge, the biggest challenge of
<i>The Red Violin </i>is to give life to an inanimate object, and I would say that the
other big challenge is to turn those five stories into one, make them feel like one story,
so almost every structural idea, including the double narrator idea, is totally responding
to that problem. We are with two narrators bridging the whole thing and tying things
together and then you have the convergence at the auction at the end where all the stories
are represented and you have the progression through age, like the whole film is based on
the lifetime progression thematically. You have the unborn child and then the child and
the young adult and then maturity and then eventually you back to the age of the master so
all those things are there in an effort to tie things together and build one story, the
life of the violin, and escape from the five episodes as much as you can.</p>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p><em><strong>SA:</strong></em> On the one hand it&#146;s a very international production
and on the other it&#146;s a Canadian production, if I&#146;m not mistaken. It&#146;s a
Canadian production company and primarily Canadian money, isn&#146;t it? </p>

<p><em><strong>FG: </strong></em>Actually no, not for the most part. It is like Canadian
in the sense that the filmmakers are Canadian. I was asked that question at home, at home
there was a lot of discussion, like in Quebec, in Montreal, people would say &quot;Yeah,
great, but is this a Quebec film or what? It doesn&#146;t look like a Quebec film.&quot; I
think this is one aspect of the film I like very much, it&#146;s actually challenging
people&#146;s sometimes limited definition of cultural identity and stuff like that. This
is a game we&#146;re very much caught in up in Canada. The way it works, the film is in
total continuity with the filmmaking traditions in Canada, Toronto or Montreal, because we
are from that tradition. This is where we grew up and we learned with the people who
learned with the people who funded those tradition 40 years ago, but at the same time the
story goes beyond our borders so therefore the collaborators came from all over the place
and the money also. Technically it&#146;s an Italy-Canada co-production, and then Film
Four (Britain) came in for a substantial part of the budget, and all that together was
half of the budget, and then New Line International paid the other half, so the financial
structure looks a little like the script.</p>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p><em><strong>SA:</strong></em> That the way a lot of European films are being made.
You&#146;ve got French films with German and Italian money. There seems to be an
internationalization of filmmaking.</p>

<p><em><strong>FG: </strong></em>Even American films are financed internationally more and
more. Money&#146;s moving around and I think it&#146;s good, I like this notion that
things are tied up in complex ways. It&#146;s quite fluid, it makes the film industry more
fluid and it&#146;s more interesting for artists.</p>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p><em><strong>SA:</strong></em> It&#146;s also nice to see that Canadian films are
breaking down a lot of American borders. Ten years ago, except for David Cronenberg&#146;s
movies, you didn&#146;t see Canadian films in American cinemas. Then <i>32 Short Films </i>came
out, Atom Egoyan&#146;s films came out, Bruce MacDonald&#146;s film, Patricia Rozema,
Denys Arcand.</p>

<p><em><strong>FG:</strong></em> So you know your Canadian cinema pretty well.</p>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p><em><strong>SA:</strong></em> I know my Canadian cinema somewhat. I still have a real
kinship to it. I grew up in Canada watching the National Film Board of Canada shorts, so
when <i>The Grey Fox </i>came out I realized I&#146;d seen one of Phillip Borsos&#146;
films when I was in the 4<sup>th</sup> grade.</p>

<p><em><strong>FG: </strong></em>In Quebec we&#146;ve been making our own films for 40
years and it was often made with nothing and it forced a highly imaginative, creative way
of making film and our artists developed into a system that was not providing a lot of
resources in the first place but then eventually developed because the public is actually
more and more connected with the Quebec films and eventually those guys worked with big
European co-productions and American films coming in, so the artists I&#146;ve worked
with, the set designer Francois Seguin, the costume designer Renee April, the DP (director
of photography) Alain Dostie, we&#146;re talking about guys who know not only how to run a
small big show, but also remember how to run it in a small way. <i>The Red Violin </i>is
absolutely about that. Those guys allowed me to work big when it was necessary but work
small when we didn&#146;t need 50 trucks at the door, and so the film would breath like
that and allow us to make it for a smaller budget than most people would think of and
eventually that gave me more freedom because the smaller the budget is, the more
independent and free you are.</p>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p><em><strong>SA:</strong></em> There&#146;s an amazing lushness to that film. Every
national sequence has a different look to it. The Italian sequence looks like Renaissance
paintings the way the candlelight seems to cast a warm glow over everything. The China
scenes are the opposite, they look almost chalky. How did you plan each look?</p>

<p><em><strong>FG: </strong></em>I think those sequences look different because those
locations were different, and in the same way I was telling you earlier that in the
writing process we tried to tie things together as much as we could, in this when it came
time to discuss with my DP and my designers the whole film, what I was asking them to do
was to not change their way of working. We basically looked at the world with the same
eye, stylistically we try to be constant and not underline those differences, but of
course the greens of Oxford are creating a different look than the dust of Shanghai or the
bricks of Crimona. And that was welcomed, that the different places would eventually look
different and of course the tone, the language, the texture, the feel of the actors would
eventually create a number of differences, but the way we looked at them was as constant
as possible in the sense of filming. I didn&#146;t try to film a different way each time,
I just told tell my story with basically the same visual language all over. There&#146;s a
small drift in tones, the beginning of the film is a bit warmer and it goes a bit colder
toward the end, but it&#146;s really subtle and Alain tried to be as constant as possible
in the film look.</p>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p><em><strong>SA:</strong></em> I think the change in colors don&#146;t just separate
place they separate period, they kind of make you feel like you&#146;re traveling through
time.</p>

<p><em><strong>FG: </strong></em>Yeah, there&#146;s no doubt that eventually traveling
through 300 years and five countries becomes like a huge aesthetic element, it expresses
itself in the visual. I remember at one point that some people thought I should be writing
onscreen that we are in Austria in 1793 and to me it was always clear. But I though who
could miss that? Centuries have passed and we&#146;ve traveled around, and even if you
don&#146;t know exactly where you are, it&#146;s impossible to miss the fact that
you&#146;ve been around the world in 200 or 300 years. You don&#146;t want to write a
history book on those characters, but convey to the audience the journey around the world.</p>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p><strong><em>SA:</em></strong> The costume, the language, I thought it was pretty
obvious. I didn&#146;t know the actual history or what city we were in, but I had the
general area. I think Austria was actually mentioned at one point.</p>

<p><em><strong>FG: </strong></em>The cities end up being named but in a small way. The
auctioneer would talk about Crimona: &quot;The last violin of Nicolo Bussotti of
Crimona,&quot; and then Poussin would say that Vienna is awaiting him, and you always have
those signs for precise dates. Poussin talks about the recent death of Mozart and of
course I don&#146;t expect everybody to really get the 1792 date to come bold in their
mind, but if you&#146;re really looking for an answer you have clues, it&#146;s there. But
really you don&#146;t want to draw the audience too much into the mechanics: &quot;Listen,
we&#146;ve been moving from here to here and the date has moved a hundred years.&quot; You
want to travel, you want to move and moving doesn&#146;t imply that you have to know
exactly where you are and when you are at all points. Moving is moving, it&#146;s going
from one point to another and those things eventually become quite clear in the film.</p>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p><em><strong>SA:</strong></em> I know this is a fictional film but was it inspired by a
real life legend?</p>

<p><em><strong>FG: </strong></em>I&#146;m much more interested in this notion that fiction
and reality are very artificial notions and the border between the two is blurred and
confused and I like that, it&#146;s where we can, I think, explore a lot. While <i>Glenn
Gould </i>was a bio-pic telling the life of somebody who existed, the game in that film
was actually to create facts that would tell the higher truth of his life. A number of
scenes in <i>Glenn Gould </i>were invented from scratch. There was no document that said
this happened in this way. A number of things were just invented to be truer to his life
and his work. <i>The Red Violin </i>was quite the opposite, where technically we are
dealing with fictitious characters, none of them existed, but in fact to create Nicolo
Bussotti you have to study the three other masters living in the same town at the same
time: Stradivari, Amati and Guarnieri. And then Nicolo Bussotti only exists because you
know the three other masters, you start there and build your fictitious character, but is
he really fictitious? And is that violin really fictitious? Yes it is, we built it from
scratch and it&#146;s a story we invented, but are we really inventing things? We&#146;re
redigesting things that are there in time and in space. For instance when I&#146;m asked
&quot;Why did you go to China?,: I&#146;ve been asked that a lot of times, and the real
answer is we went to China because the violin was there. It&#146;s like the whole thing
ended up being a little bit like digging, like archeologists, digging into clues and
finding the path of that instrument. You think it can go to India so you start
brainstorming it on something in India, but you feel that you&#146;re not on the path of
your violin and it ends up being the violin bringing you back to where it is, where it
should be, instead of it going where your fantasies go. It&#146;s an organic process where
you start with an idea and the implications of that idea will unfold before your eyes out
of your own will and wish. You follow your own idea after a while so the notions of
fiction and reality can be quite artificial.</p>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p><em><strong>SA:</strong></em> That sounds like a moment in the film <i>Camille Claudel</i>,
where a little kid is watching her carve a statue out of a rock and he asks her &quot;How
did you find that in the rock?&quot;</p>

<p><em><strong>FG: </strong></em>And she says &quot;It was there.&quot;</p>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p><em><strong>SA:</strong></em> It&#146;s just a matter of figuring out where it is.</p>

<p><em><strong>FG: </strong></em>The comparison to the sculptor is very much&#133; the
sculptor&#146;s only freedom is to choose a piece of stone or of wood and eventually the
nature of that thing will express itself through his talent, maybe, but the notion of the
artist as the creator of things, the free will of the artist, I think are totally foolish.
I don&#146;t believe in that. I believe that we submit ourselves to ideas and we
eventually enslave ourselves and the only freedom we have is to say &quot;I&#146;m going
to tell the life of Glenn Gould.&quot; That day you&#146;re free, when you decide to do
it, and then when you start doing it it&#146;s a subject that expresses itself through
you, you&#146;re not creating in the sense that most people talk about it. The notion of
creation is sort of misleading.</p>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p><em><strong>SA:</strong></em> John Corigliano did the score for your film, only his
third score. He wrote the score for <i>Altered States </i>and then he wrote <i>Revolution </i>and
I understand he had a bad experience with that.</p>

<p><em><strong>FG: </strong></em>Yes sir. After that he decided he would never again deal
with soundtracks for the film guys.</p>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p><em><strong>SA:</strong></em> How did you wind up getting him, and why?</p>

<p><em><strong>FG: </strong></em>I have to give credit to Joshua Bell (the violin soloist)
and Niv Fichman, my producer. He was introduced to me by Joshua and I went to see him and
at first it was a bit tense because John was really scared of not having a good ---- for
us, or that we would not understand his process and he didn&#146;t want to submit himself
to it. It&#146;s tough for composers because they are used to creating worlds that are
self sufficient. John Corigliano, when he writes a symphony, the nature of it is the
symphony itself and it grows on it&#146;s own. Making music for a film, he has to submit
his music and his writing to the film idea, as we all do. I had to submit myself too, my
life eventually. We all contribute from different angles to that idea that we out in the
center of our process. But it ended up being a very interesting collaboration and I had a
great time working with John, and the mutual trust built through the years. John worked
for two years on this and it was very far from the feeling of &quot;Here&#146;s a film
director hiring a composer to lay a track of music on his film.&quot; John and Joshua,
both of them, became part of our writing. We were not finished with the script, which they
were reading with every draft, that they were composing music for the boy or Frederick
Pope so they were actually defining those characters with music as we were defining them
with words and both processes were tied together. The ideas would bounce from one side to
the other and we would react to their music in the writing somehow. It was an interesting
process.</p>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p><em><strong>SA:</strong></em> How did you wind up choosing Corigliano?</p>

<p><em><strong>FG: </strong></em>If you look at John&#146;s career and what <i>The Red
Violin </i>meant to a composer it&#146;s really hard to think of anyone else. He has an
immense range in his writing, he has a very solid signature, a very solid identity as a
composer. John Corigliano is very recognizable and when you listen to <i>The Red Violin </i>the
music is Corigliano. At the same time we needed to travel in time and we needed to compose
in the manner of Tellerman and the manner of Inyavksy and the manner of Bach and take from
the different periods the music manners, and I don&#146;t know if you&#146;ve heard of
&quot;The Ghouls of Versailles.&quot; John had composed an opera that is doing exactly
that, it has a very contemporary signature but at the same time is pastiching different
music periods in a very specific manner. So John has that capacity of developing a very
strong identity but at the same time also connecting with distant references in time and
space and cultures and I think he was the most appropriate composer for this film for that
very reason.</p>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p><em><strong>SA:</strong></em> When I was watching the film I didn&#146;t think of it as
a separate soundtrack because so much of the music is organic to the scenes. It&#146;s not
overlayed as a piece of dramatic music from without, it grows from within.</p>

<p><em><strong>FG: </strong></em>We often say that <i>The Red Violin </i>is a film in five
languages but the truth is it&#146;s in six languages, the first one being the music. The
music is very much connected with the narrative progression. This tune that Anna is
humming in Italy in the first phase that is transported through the violin and grows
through the underscore to the end is a constant reminder of the film premise. So the music
becomes really active narratively, it points at characters and it points at the origin at
the whole thing and it reminds the audience of the number of places of that beginning, of
the origin of the violin&#146;s life, and also it builds characters and it shapes the
travel in time and space so it was really part of the writing process. It&#146;s not only
a post production process, it&#146;s rooted very deeply in the writing of the film.</p>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p><em><strong>SA:</strong></em> Your first film was a French language film and you
followed it up with an English language film. Was that a response to get it to a wider
audience or because Glenn Gould was an English speaker?</p>

<p><em><strong>FG: </strong></em>It does have an impact in the distribution of films,
whether you shoot in French or English, there&#146;s no question about that, but I never
started by saying &quot;I&#146;m going to do a film in French&quot; or &quot;I&#146;m
going to do a film in English.&quot; You make a film about Glenn Gould and Glenn Gould is
a man who lived in English all his life, never spoke another language, or barely, he spoke
a bit of this and that, but he spoke English, that was his life. And the film has to be
English, there was no question about that. After <i>Glenn Gould </i>and still today
I&#146;m often asked, as you know it&#146;s national obsession in Quebec to deal with that
duality, the language duality, and as an artist I&#146;m always asked &quot;Are you going
to shoot your next film in French or are you going to shoot it in English.&quot; In a way
I didn&#146;t mean it exactly that way in the beginning but <i>The Red Violin </i>is
really a statement about that, it&#146;s not going to be in English, it&#146;s not going
to be in French, and we should start thinking that the world is not simply speaking French
and English, it&#146;s more complex than that. That was in a way, maybe a subconscious
way, a way to escape from that very limiting and threatening notion of national identities
being defined through languages. That was my response to it. I believe it&#146;s all
connected. Of course when you think about it shooting in French is something that&#146;s
very important to me and I will do it again because I grew up in French and my family and
my communities speak French and I could only return to them and shoot for them, but at the
same time we&#146;re in a very tough situation where Quebec films are cut from their main
market, which is France, like it&#146;s really not happening with the Quebec films.
It&#146;s much easier for me to enter in Paris with an English than with a French film.
This is post-colonial remnants, it&#146;s not happening. It&#146;s a sad thing for Quebec
filmmakers and so I&#146;m constantly dealing with those tensions, but again I think no
matter how much you are involved or you are thinking about those things, I think that a
film should never start by you saying &quot;I will do a film in French.&quot; Your heart
brings you to a subject matter and that subject matter will tell you what language it
should be.</p>
