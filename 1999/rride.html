<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="5"><b>T</b></font><font size="4">he
Civil War has been treated so many ways -- in books and films and on television
-- that it's hard to imagine that you could see it in any way that seems
remotely &quot;new.&quot; You might feel haunted by those familiar
representations of the War Between the States (or simply, the War, as I've heard
it called in the American South), those that deal with the conflicts between
brothers (say, in Ken Burns' celebrated PBS miniseries), the nobility of Abe
Lincoln, the boldness of Ulysses Grant or Robert E. Lee, the courage under fire
by any number of unknowns (for example, Ted Turner's <i>Gettysburg</i>), the
historical significance of actions by John Brown or Crispus Attucks, or the
blood spilled on too many battlefields, the pain suffered by any number of
mothers and sweethearts left behind.</font><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Indeed,
the history seems well-rehearsed and infinitely fictionalized. And yet, <i>Ride
With the Devil</i> arrives in theaters with yet another version to tell.
Directed by Ang Lee and written by Lee and his usual collaborator James Schamus
(who adapted Daniel Woodrell's novel, <i>Woe to Live On</i>, a novel inspired,
says the author, by today's warfare in the Balkans), the film is rather
surprising, and not only because it stars Jewel as a Southern widow. Telling
stories that don't usually get told, <i>Ride With the Devil</i> focuses on some
of the War's more disgraceful and outrageous aspects, both personal and public.
This isn't to say that the movie doesn't privilege the occasional graces of its
Southern-inclined protagonists -- namely, Daniel Holt (Jeffrey Wright), Jake
Roedel (Tobey Maguire), and Jack Bull Chiles (Skeet Ulrich) -- but it likewise
doesn't shy away from the ways that the War inspired self-serving definitions of
loyalty, nationalism, and individualism, or specious claims for democracy and
states' rights.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Most
reviews of <i>Ride With the Devil</i> have noted -- for good or ill -- the
romantic pairing of Jack and Jake, best friends in rural Missouri (near Kansas)
in 1860, who, when the War begins, join the bushwhackers, essentially a gang of
Southern pillagers and raiders (and occasionally, rapists). Jake is the son of a
German immigrant and Union supporter, who pointedly avoids going to the Southern
gentlemen's parties Jake attends, where folks deride &quot;that black Republican
Abe Lincoln.&quot; though he admires his father, Jake sees himself as a
Southerner (perhaps especially when his so-called friends call him out for not
being one) and decides to follow his aristocratic buddy Jack into what amounts
to guerilla warfare, after the latter's father is killed by some Kansas-based,
Union-favoring raiders called &quot;jayhawkers.&quot; The film thus presents the
War as less principled than it is vengeful and basically adolescent: the boys --
and they are pointedly boys, immature and afraid and often confused -- are
fighting because they're pissed off that their properties, names, and
birthrights seem to be at stake.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">While
Jack and Jake's difficult but vital friendship takes up most of the film's
running time, Holt's story is easily its most compelling. In part this occurs
because Wright (who made the otherwise unconscionable <i>Basquiat</i> watchable)
gives another performance of almost alarming subtlety and depth. But you're also
drawn to Holt because of his impossibly complex circumstances. A former slave
whose freedom has been purchased by his childhood friend George Clyde
(Australian actor Simon Baker-Denny), Holt has decided, much like Jake, to fight
for the Confederacy because of loyalty to his friend.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">With
no other reasons driving him -- certainly no devotion to the ostensible Cause --
Holt is constantly challenged by his fellow Southern soldiers. At best they call
him &quot;George's nigger&quot;; at worst they assume they can kill or abuse
him, by definition. Holt's dilemma increases daily, until it climaxes with
George's death. Suddenly, Holt must figure out what he's really doing there,
shooting at people who ostensibly want his human rights secured. That the
Northerners were often inconsistent on this point is not the film's immediate
concern, but Holt's relentless sense of desperation and dislocation surely is. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Though
Holt's situation is existential, it's resolutely material. And the film, when
it's not distracted by Jake's romantic longings -- for Jack and then for Jack's
sweetheart Sue Lee (Jewel) -- attends to Holt in serious and intriguing ways.
Incredibly, <i>Ride With the Devil</i> allows Holt and Jake's faces (rather than
more traditional vehicles, like dialogue or voice-over explication) to
communicate the war's awful distresses. Almost like the repeated images of
icicles in <i>The Ice Storm</i>, Holt's unbelieving and sad eyes tell you most
everything you need to know about the film's themes. In Holt's case, his eyes
reflect the moral and spiritual paucity of those characters who never grasp that
he's not property. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As
Holt and Jake become friends (both left stranded without their best friends, who
are killed and/or distracted), it becomes clear to Jake that his initial
concerns with conforming to ideals of Southern masculinity are trivial. More
important are his emerging efforts to understand what it means to be human, that
is, generous and forgiving, vulnerable and accountable. The film itself only
seems able to acknowledge the acute significance of this friendship when it
concludes with their parting (there's nothing more interesting to consider in
the narrative). Before then, however, it spends too much time watching Jake
discover his sexuality and self-consciousness amid the perpetual lunacy of the
War. When he loses his finger in one shootout, he considers it a sign of his
uniqueness, assuring Jack afterwards, &quot;It makes me notable by the
loss.&quot;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Such
perverse self-conception and rationales are, of course, what permit wars to go
on. <i>Ride With the Devil</i> offers glimpses of the absurdity. The chaos is
well captured in cinematography by the brilliant Frederick Elmes (<i>Blue Velvet</i>,
<i>Wild at Heart</i>, Lee's <i>The Ice Storm</i>). Whether you're looking at
riotous battlefields or burning townscapes, you're left feeling a little
dizzied, not so much by the commotion (combat scenes full of hard-to-read body
parts close-ups resembling <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>'s will never be so
stunning again) as by what feels like an incomprehensible contradiction between
weight and lightness.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
camera pans slowly over these “violences” as well as moments of serenity --
the boys exhausted, resting by campfires, or wounded, seeking refuge at
Rebel-friendly homes -- as if their surfaces are all you might be able to
fathom. For all the pain you're asked to witness, the imagery remains strangely
discreet, flitting and fragile instead of in-your-face ugly. And yet, the action
is tenaciously ugly, as when Jake and Jack take part in the ambush of a couple's
roadside vending stand, because they've catered to the Northern Aggressors, or
in the infamous Lawrence, Kansas, massacre (where bushwhackers slaughtered some
180 townspeople). <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Such
chaos is perhaps best embodied by the character who most hates Jake and Holt, a
sniveling cur of a villain named, appropriately, Pitt Mackeson (Jonathan Rhys
Meyers, last seen slithering in Todd Haynes' <i>Velvet Goldmine</i>). Like Jack,
Jake, Holt, and George, Pitt's a member of the &quot;Missouri Irregulars,&quot;
Black John's (James Caviezel) bushwhacking squad. Unlike them, he is openly
hellbent on maiming and murdering anyone who appears to cross him. The others,
of course, are also tending to mayhem, but they tell themselves they're adhering
to a moral code. Lee's movie, however, makes it increasingly clear that this is
at best a story they tell themselves to stay sane amid the brutality they face
and enact each day. It's to the credit of <i>Ride With the Devil</i> that it
shows this much.&nbsp;</span></p>
