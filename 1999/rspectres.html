1991, a lot of talk began circulating about a film called <i>Tribulation 99:
Alien Anomalies Under America</i> The film suggested that, in 99 steps, the
Earth had not only already been invaded by extraterrestrial creatures, but was
in the process of being completely conquered on every level, causing, in the
process, everything from the Roswell, N.M. incident, to the political
assassinations in the Sixties and the political upheavals and unrest in South
America in the Seventies. And that, as we reached the end of the century, the
aliens were in the process of undertaking the very last steps on their agenda. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">What
was even more surprising was that the film's maker, Craig Baldwin, made the
entire film presenting this scenario out of &quot;found footage&quot; -- old
16mm. film that had been thrown out in the trash or used as &quot;filler&quot;
material on reels going to or from processing labs. Baldwin had to cull through
tons and tons of stuff in order to get the shots and footage which could match
his fantastically complicated narrative, but the results were nothing short of
breathtaking: a phantasmagoria that took on vast proportions, one whose very
complexity did not keep one at a distance but, instead, drew you further and
further into what was unfolding on the screen, taking on a logic and sensibility
all of its own. One of the great feats of filmmaking in the 1990s, <i>Tribulation
99</i> was a little difficult to see because it was entirely self-distributed,
but if you had the chance to see it, you often didn't stop talking about it for
days, even years, afterwards. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Since
then, Baldwin made <i>O No Coronado!</i> (1992), about the Spanish conquistadors
and their subjugation of the indigenous American cultures; and <i>Sonic Outlaws</i>
(1995), which was inspired by the real-life instance where the music group
Negativeland was sued when they appropriated satellite footage of one of U2's
concerts. Now, Craig Baldwin is back, with a new film, <i>Spectres of the
Spectrum</i>, which premiered in October and was recently shown, just in time
for the end of the century, as part of a retrospective of Baldwin's work at the
venerable Clinton St. Theater in Portland, Oregon, just up the road from
Baldwin's home base in San Francisco. This time, the danger comes not from
without (as with extraterrestrials in <i>Tribulation</i>, or conquistadors in <i>Coronado</i>),
but from within, from the corporate-military complex that seeks not just to
control not just the land, but the very sky itself. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It
is the beginning of the 21st century, and the Earth is a flickering, blighted
ruin, seared under holes torn in the atmosphere or by the irradiated remains of
what has been left. Birds and animals are vanishing. People themselves are
fading, like newsprint under direct sunlight. Others, stumbling &quot;through
the electronic miasma, their memories obliterated,” exist as zombies. From a
pirate radio station in the Nevada desert (sitting on what is now the Pacific
coastline, after the melting of the polar icecaps), a former intelligence
operative who goes by the &quot;moniker&quot; of Yogi (Sam Kilcoyne) transmits
to the world information on how things got this way. The monopolization of the
emerging industries of electric power, radio, television, and the Internet -- a
&quot;great extruded space&quot; that is &quot;both internal and external,” a
means for 2-way communication and a repository of &quot;the whole contents of
the media culture's memory,” only now reduced to a mere place for buying and
selling, a narcotizing cyberspace collection of &quot;shopping malls and theme
parks&quot; -- has joined together to form an oppressive &quot;New
Electromagnetic Order,” with but one land left to systematically conquer in
order to complete its agenda: the &quot;imagination,” or the mind itself. This
it will do when it initiates its plan to blast the sky with tons of particle
beams, flash-frying the planet in the process. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Yogi
has a daughter -- born on the same day, in 1984, when Ridley Scott's commercial
introducing the Apple Macintosh computer aired during the Super Bowl -- a
&quot;fuzzy ball of energy&quot; able to &quot;move around during the full-on
electromagnetic day,” a full-fledged telepath capable of reading the thoughts
of the cosmos itself. This is how she discovers a way to save the world from its
horrible fate: a coded message left by her recently-deceased grandmother, who
had worked, years ago, as an assistant on a live TV program, <i>Science in
Action</i>. All the daughter needs to do -- a cinch, given her wildly advanced
mental and intellectual capability -- is to rig a way to travel back in time and
decode her grandmother's message. She's anxious to blow this joint, anyway:
&quot;First chance, I'm outta here.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When
night falls, &quot;Pops&quot; and daughter sit in their &quot;biosphere,” a
converted Airstream trailer, and share Spam baked over the flames of lighted
flares. When the zombies come out, they keep them at bay by turning up the
volume on their &quot;contraband&quot; video tapes of Korla Pandit, an obscure
Fifties TV personality who plays the electric organ, never speaks, and looks
just like Sabu. (&quot;Korla Pandit now presents his interpretation of the
haunting strains and violent rhythms of 'Blue Tango'....&quot;) The daughter's
name is Booboo. This in no way impedes one's enjoyment of the picture. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Spectres
of the Spectrum</span></i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
depicts the history of the &quot;invisible wars&quot; that led up to the state
of things under which the characters now live. The &quot;wars&quot; have had
their heroes, and martyrs: Benjamin Franklin, who &quot;democratized&quot;
electricity by showing that anyone can pluck it out of the sky. Nikola Tesla,
the brilliant inventor and physics engineer whose discovery of alternating
current, more efficient and practical than Edison's direct current, eventually
led him to be driven into obscurity, but only after his methods were
appropriated. Philo P. Farnsworth, the boy from Rigby, Idaho who invented the
method for basic television transmission and reception, only to have his ideas
appropriated by David Sarnoff, the creator of R.C.A. and, later, N.B.C., the
first electronic media network. (The message left by Booboo's grandmother
happens to be on the one &quot;lost&quot; episode of <i>Science in Action</i>,
when a representative of Sarnoff's appeared as a guest on the program.) And then
there is Bill Gates, first introduced in the film via footage of <i>Twiki</i>,
the stump-shaped, blithering robot in the 1970s remake of <i>Buck Rogers</i>.
Not only do Microsoft and N.B.C. couple to produce a cable channel, MSNBC (I
always wondered what the &quot;MS” stood for), but Gates helps advance the
concept that everything -- home entertainment, communications, information,
commerce -- can eventually be done on fiberoptic cable, a further funneling of
all daily social activity into one single entity. Paranoia? Maybe. But rather
believable paranoia. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Spectres
of the Spectrum</span></i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
works on so many levels, and to such a mind-boggling extent, that it's hard to
know where to begin. (After three viewings of the film, I'm still only picking
up half of what's there.) Along with being an invective and a warning against
the privatization of communications, it also works as an amusing trip into the
past (see which film clips ring bells in your head that you haven't heard rung
in years), an adventure story (complete with charming in-house special F.X.),
socio-political commentary (<i>Spectres</i> expands on an idea first introduced
in <i>Tribulation 99</i>, that figures in authority would create advanced
technology only to turn it against their own people, subverting the whole
concept of science as something to be used for the betterment of mankind), a
David and Goliath story, and further proof that Baldwin and his associates
(which include editor and, on the new sequences, cinematographer Bill Daniel,
and sound designer Gibbs Chapman) can take anything, from anywhere, and use it
to convey messages that the original makers never dreamed of telling. (Who knew
that <i>Twiki</i>, whom everyone in the late Seventies agreed was the most
unbearably annoying robotic creation ever to be foistered upon the public, would
turn out to be the perfect representation of Bill Gates?) <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
filmmakers have collected and put together footage from a vast and formidable
array of sources: kinescopes (along with Korla Pandit, there is also footage of
a program starring a hypnotist who puts his subjects to sleep on the air,
clicking his fingers and causing cameramen to keel-over onto the studio floor),
corporate films (one of which features an early-Seventies version of William
Shatner!), educational films, preview-trailers, clips from both TV programs <i>The
Twentieth Century</i> and its short-lived successor <i>The 21st Century</i>.
Clips depicting 1965 are drawn from the 1959 Japanese science-fiction film <i>Battle
in Outer Space</i>. The ones depicting Tesla are from an obscure 1980 film by
Yugoslavian director Krsto Papis, <i>The Secret of Nicola Tesla</i>, in which
Strother Martin played George Westinghouse, and, as J.P. Morgan, who initially
backed Tesla but then turned against him when the inventor came up with a new
energy source that everyone could use but which could not be monopolized for
profit, Orson Welles (who, in Papis' film, arranges for a meeting with Tesla so
that he can find out for himself if the man is a &quot;bunkum artist&quot;).
Baldwin's film effectively uses music ranging from the haunting themes written
by Dominick Frontiere for TV's <i>The Outer Limits</i> (the Bill Gates sequence
is accompanied, very cleverly, by the music Frontiere composed for the episode <i>The
Hundred Days of the Dragon</i>, where a sitting U.S. president was replaced,
overnight, by a malevolent dopplegänger from another country), to Akira
Ikufube's mournful children's choral from <i>Godzilla</i>. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">&quot;Corporate
raiders? Even out here? Probably trying to privatize the past!&quot; fumes
Booboo as she fights off incoming fighters during her time trip into the past.
However didactic <i>Spectres of the Spectrum</i> may seem at times -- and it
does, although it is both entertainingly and engagingly didactic, and for a good
cause -- it has its own sense of humor. And there is also a poignant strain
regarding loss running through it, of hopes and utopias which were thwarted or
never to be realized. Tesla died, bankrupt and in seclusion, in 1942, within the
shadow of the towers of Rockefeller Center, where David Sarnoff's NBC studios
were located, and questions remain as to whether Tesla's death took place under
nefarious circumstances or not. Philo P. Farnsworth wound up appearing as a
guest on <i>I Got a Secret</i>, on the very medium that he helped create but for
which he would receive only belated credit for; later, he would wind up an
employee of I.T.T., one of the first big commercial computer companies. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When
asked by the editors of the San Francisco Chronicle to contribute, for their
special 1976 Bicentennial edition, what he thought the world of 2076 would be
like, designer Rudi Gernreich speculated that everyone would be able to fly,
independently, from one place to another, on wings propelled by solar power. An
conception of complete freedom at the time Gernreich came up with it, one now
wonders who would hold the copyright of the image and design if it ever came to
pass. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
conclusion of <i>Spectres of the Spectrum</i> is left a little open. Will those
living in the new world know better than to make the mistakes of those before
them, or will they end up falling into the same traps as they did? (Power and
wealth, can be powerful, and terrible, incentives.) You expect a title to come
on, just like in a hokey 1950s science-fiction thriller, announcing &quot;The
Beginning&quot; instead of &quot;The End.” (Not just in those films, either:
Romain Gary also used it to conclude his totally deranged 1971 anti-narcotics
film, <i>Kill</i>.) Instead, early <i>Today</i> show host Dave Garroway, that
most utterly Zen, and hence most possibly subversive, of television
personalities, puts in an appearance -- looking a little puzzled, perhaps, but
ready for whichever way things go. And the makers of <i>Spectres of the Spectrum</i>
show that people working outside of the commercial system are still producing
some of the most vital, exciting, challenging, involving, and surprising work
today. We need that. So, here is one of Garroway's famous closing salutations --
an outstretched palm, accompanied by the spoken word, in Garroway's most
beautifully assuring tones, &quot;Peace.” And more power to them.</span></p>
