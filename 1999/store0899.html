<p><big><big><strong><a href="raffliction.html" name="affliction" target="_top">Affliction</a></i> </strong></big>(USA,
1997, July 6)</big></p>

<p>To call Wade Whitehouse (Oscar-nominated Nick Nolte) a ticking time bomb would
trivialize the demons and dark forces that rage within him. The sheriff of a small New
Hampshire town, Wade is charged with keeping the peace in Law ford but can barely control
his own confused, alcohol-fuelled emotions. When the helpless lawman finally breaks, the
focus of his fury is the cause of his problems, his domineering, monstrous father Glen
(James Coburn, who won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar this year for his fine
performance). Writer-director Paul Schrader has covered this territory in screenplays for
others (Martin Crosse&#146;s upcoming Nicolas Cage stirrer <i>Bringing Out the Dead</i>
and the classic <i>Taxi Driver</i>) as well as his own films (which include the intense
and little-seen <i>Blue Collar</i> and <i>Hardcore</i>). Here Schrader finds the diseased
heart of Russell Banks&#146; novel in much the same way Atom Ego an succeeded with
Banks&#146; &quot;The Sweet Hereafter,&quot; juxtaposing the serene and bucolic
surroundings of snowbound communities with the dark secrets of those who live -- no, make
that cower -- within them. &quot;There are no losers,&quot; someone says to a group of
children at a church social early in this remarkable, affecting movie. &quot;Everybody
gets a nice ribbon.&quot; In the worlds of both Banks and Schrader, the excruciating irony
of life is that there are no ribbons and, in the end, everybody loses. The videocassette
is priced for rental, and the wide screen DVD includes a featured.</p>

<p><big><big><strong><a href="../rcentral.html" name="CentralStation" target="_top">Central Station</a></i>
</strong></big>(<i>Central do Brazil</i>, Brazil/France, 1998, July 13)</big></p>

<p>Desultory ex-teacher Dora (Oscar-nominated Fernando Montenegro) and the orphaned waif
Josie (newcomer Vinci&#146;s de Oliveira) she rescues but doesn&#146;t want take a bus
ride across Brazil that transforms them both as it takes the pulse of a country in flux.
He&#146;s looking for a father he&#146;s never known and she&#146;s in search of an
elusive peace. By turns tough and tender, theater vet Montenegro brings to Dora a
world-weariness made fresh by the sheer tenaciousness of the character; in such scenes as
her harrowing rescue of Josie from some unscrupulous types, she seems not at all in
control of the valiant side of her nature, and this crusading impulsiveness is both
enthralling and endearing. <strong>When </strong>this subtly magnificent new movie from
Brazil won the coveted Golden Bear award for best film at the 1998 Berlin International
Film Festival, many saw the unexpected yet welcomed honor as a continued validation of a
more accessible and financially responsible cinema being pioneered for the global
marketplace by filmmakers who understand the fundamentals of simple yet elegant dramatic
structure and the universality of human emotion. <i>Central Station</i> is performed in
the native Portuguese of director Walter Sales, yet its human feelings and command of
filmmaking render it a work capable of speaking to audiences in all corners of the earth.
The videocassette and DVD are presented in Portuguese with English subtitles, and the
latter includes a trailer and commentary from Sales, Montenegro and veteran producer
Arthur Cohn.</p>

<p><big><big><a href="rcivil.html" name="CivilAction" target="_top"><strong>A Civil Action</strong></a> </big></i>(USA,
1998, July 13)</big></p>

<p>One of the hazards of being the prolific John Travolta is the danger of over
saturation, a trap he seems to have largely and miraculously avoided (well, OK, he did
make <em>White Man&#146;s Burden</em>, <em>Michael</em>, <em>Mad City</em> and the recent <em>General&#146;s
Daughter</em>). Yet in all the films in which he&#146;s starred since resuscitating his
career with <em>Pulp Fiction</em>, good and, uh, not so good, few present him in such a
morally complex light as <em>A Civil Action</em>. Startlingly retooled from the
non-fiction book by Jonathan Harry, the film benefits tremendously from the rock-solid
storytelling instincts of writer-director Steve Zillion (who wrote <em>Schindler&#146;s
List</em> and directed <em>Searching For Bobby Fischer</em>). The movie presents
ambulance-chasing attorney Jan Schlichtmann as a churning vessel of conflicting impulses,
as he spurns the attempts of a small town citizens group to hire him to investigate the
deaths of local children from what they suspect is exposure to a poisoned river -- only to
take the case when he smells a huge corporate payoff, finding himself involved to the
point of bankruptcy. The irony of the title -- below the surface, there&#146;s nothing
civil about this lawsuit -- is not lost on the movie&#146;s makers, as Zillion and
Travolta conspire to create a situation where nothing is as simple as black or white. Also
fine is Robert Duvall as a bizarrely eccentric corporate lawyer, John Lithgow as a
distastefully prejudiced judge and James &quot;The Sopranos&quot; Gandolfini as a witness
whose guilt finally brings him forward to turn the tide. There&#146;s a Spanish subtitled
VHS of this title available, as well as a DVD with a production featured. </p>

<p><big><a href="../rdelta.html" name="Delta" target="_top"><strong><big>Down in the Delta</big></strong></a></i>
(USA, 1998, July 20)</big></p>

<p>&quot;Something new happens in this world every day,&quot; a character advises during
this warm, overlooked gem of a movie -- the directorial debut of poet Maya Angelou.
&quot;You just gotta keep at it,&quot; they add, and that philosophy is what&#146;s best
and worst about the film as a whole. At her wits&#146; end over the irresponsible behavior
of her daughter Loretta (Alfre Woodard), Rosa Lynn (Mary Alice) ships the single mother
and her two children from their cramped apartment in the dangerous Chicago projects to the
Mississippi home of her estranged brother Earl (Al Freeman Jr.) and his Alzheimer&#146;s
afflicted wife Annie (Esther Rolle, in her last performance). Under Earl&#146;s gruff
tutelage, Loretta learns the true meaning of family and even plays a role in bringing Rosa
Lynn and Earl back together. While Freeman Jr. and Alice anchor the picture,
Woodard&#146;s journey from urban crack house to rural entrepreneur is the film&#146;s
most satisfying story arc. She&#146;s aided in her efforts by cousin Will (co-producer
Wesley Snipes), who encourages Loretta to think for herself even as he struggles with
challenges in his own family. Unfortunately, the movie&#146;s sheer idealism often
intrudes on the hard lessons being learned to the detriment of the overall impact (this is
one very artfully lit crack house). Still, this is a minor quibble in the face of
screenwriter Myron Goble&#146;s thoughtful story and Angelou&#146;s soothing, assured
filmmaking rhythm. &quot;I wasn&#146;t born here but I kinda got reborn here,&quot;
Loretta says in sincere wonderment, and it&#146;s a sentiment echoed in the cumulative
effect of this admirable movie. The no-frills DVD edition highlights William Wages&#146;
golden photography. </p>

<p><big><a href="r8mm.html" name="8MM" target="_top"><strong><big>8MM</big></strong></a></i> (USA, 1999,
July 20)</big></p>

<p>Since winning an Oscar for <i>Leaving Las Vegas</i> and staking a claim to the action
film genre with <i>Con Air </i>and <i>Face/Off</i>, Nicolas Cage has made some, uh,
interesting career choices (Brian De Palma&#146;s sinewy <i>Snake Eyes</i>, while visually
ravishing, is a dramatic disaster). On the surface, the appeal of <i>8MM</i> is obvious:
in meek Harrisburg, Pennsylvania detective/family man Tom Welles, Cage has the opportunity
to play very nearly the direct opposite of the kind of strutting live wire on which
he&#146;s built his newfound success. As the deliberate detective is drawn into a case
involving the supposed filming of a young girl&#146;s murder, the theory must&#146;ve
gone, Cage&#146;s Welles could teeter between his love of family and a growing outrage
over the horror of the crime and the scuzziness of it&#146;s perpetrators. Good theory.
What it doesn&#146;t take into account is the essential naivete of Andrew Kevin
Walker&#146;s script and the lackluster direction of Joel Schumacher. The director, in
particular, seems so profoundly uncertain of the proper tone of the material --
sensational? Brooding? Foreboding? -- that the legitimate homilies of the story (porn bad,
family good) are mocked by the simplistic approach. Not that there&#146;s much in the
movie that&#146;s shocking, as the raunchy stuff in Los Angeles and New York happens
largely offscreen. An actress named Amy Morton is terrific as the distraught mother of the
supposed victim (her scenes with Cage are the best things in the picture), and with the
success of cable&#146;s &quot;The Sopranos&quot; this is probably the last time first rate
character actor James Gandolfini will have to play these kinds of crude, hulking toughs --
unless he wants to, of course. Want to see this theme handled with confidence and
veracity? Affliction director Paul Schrader did it 20 years ago in the 1979 <i>Hardcore</i>,
in which conservative businessman George C. Scott searches for his runaway daughter. <i>8MM</i>
is also available in a Spanish subtitled tape and a DVD that includes a featured on
it&#146;s making. </p>

<p><big><a href="../rhiljack.html" name="HilaryAndJackie" target="_top"><strong><big>Hilary and Jackie</big></strong></a></i>
(United Kingdom, 1998, July 6)</big></p>

<p>If all this music-themed biopic had going for it were the spectacular performances of
Emily Watson and Rachel Griffiths as the sibling prodigies Jacqueline and Hilary du Pre,
that would be one thing (they were both nominated for Oscars, Watson as Actress and
Griffiths in support). But it is the complex yet elegant story structure of debuting
writer-director Anand Tucker, working from the sisters&#146; autobiography &quot;A Genius
in the Family,&quot; that gives this movie a flamboyant urgency and satisfying emotional
wallop. The gifted daughters of warm yet disciplined parents, cellist Jackie and flautist
Hilary are natural rivals from an early age, each vying for the approval that comes with
success. Separated for the first time as teenagers by Hilary&#146;s abrupt marriage and
Jacqueline&#146;s equally sudden success on the international recital circuit, the film
follows the life of the former but then confidently backtracks to fill in the questions
that have arisen about the latter&#146;s adventures. As the successful Jackie&#146;s
increasingly bizarre behavior forces the more modest Hilary to make some hard choices
about her family life, the bond between the two sisters is seen as doggedly durable.
Reminiscent of the fiery sexuality first on view in Lars von Trier&#146;s <i>Breaking the
Waves</i>, Watson&#146;s performance is made wholly believable by the mischievous passion
in her twinkling eyes. Saddled with the stodgier sister, Griffiths brings a sympathetic
determination to her role that rescues it from saintliness (maybe that&#146;s why she got
the Supporting Actress nomination). Tucker brings a fresh spin to the story, moving it
away from obvious Shine territory to a more involving, life-affirming look at the burdens
of talent and the pitfalls of fame.</p>

<p><big><a href="rhurlyburly.html" name="Hurlyburly" target="_top"><strong><big>Hurlyburly</big></strong></a></i>
(USA, 1998, June 22)</big></p>

<p>Sean Penn keeps threatening to quit acting altogether, and <i>Hurlyburly</i> is the
most recent example of why that&#146;s an idea he should continue to reconsider. A jittery
and scabrously funny realization by David Rabe of his 1980s play about a passel of
drug-fuelled lowlifes living high on the Hollywood hog, the movie achieves the twin
victories of being a showcase for some terrific acting and an unexpectedly complex visual
treat. Penn is the substance abusing Eddie, a casting agent who shares a house and office
with sarcastic bottle blonde Mickey (Kevin Spacey) -- who, when forced by the increasingly
desperate, soul-searching Eddie, describes their friendship as &quot;adequate.&quot;
Suspicious that Mickey&#146;s sleeping with his girlfriend Darlene (Robin Wright Penn),
Eddie&#146;s frazzled frustrations spill over into an evening of debauchery with power
player Artie (Garry Shandling), thuggish actor wannabe Phil (Chazz Palminteri),
&quot;sexual care package&quot; Donna (Anna Paquin) and, in the most unexpected casting
turn in a movie full of them, Meg Ryan as a dissolute stripper named Bonnie who is also,
in her own words of tattered dignity, &quot;a drug person.&quot; Inevitably, director
Anthony Drazen has opened up the play to include scenes not in the sprawling modern house
in which it was set, and in this conceit he is aided immeasurably by cinematographer
Changwei Gui -- who shot <i>The Gingerbread Man</i> for Robert Altman and two movies each
by Chinese directors Chen Kaige (<i>Farewell My Concubine</i> and <i>Life on a String</i>)
and Zhang Yimou (<i>Ju Dou</i> and <i>Red Sorghum</i>). They&#146;ve turned the house
itself into a glittering metaphor for the lost lives on display, a sleek and complex
series of corridors that, while lovely, go nowhere. The DVD includes audio commentary by
Rabe, Drazen and Penn, who in his career has played tragic characters inarticulately
searching for absolution in such films as <i>The Falcon and the Snowman</i>, <i>At Close
Range</i> (the real-life inspiration for which just escaped from prison), <i>Dead Man
Walking</i> and <i>She&#146;s So Lovely. </p>

<p><big><a href="../rrushmore.html" name="Rushmore" target="_top"><big><strong>Rushmore</strong></big></a></i>
(USA, 1998, June 29)</big></p>

<p>Along with the newly-released <i>American Pie</i> the most imaginatively subversive of
the current breed of teen-themed comedy/dramas (&quot;dramedy&quot; is a term someone
coined awhile back), <i>Rushmore</i> is infinitely more sophisticated in it&#146;s
approach to the thorny issues surrounding puppy love but no less gleeful in it&#146;s
skewering of societal norms. Smarmy and obnoxious, scrawny 15-year-old phenom Max Fischer
(Jason Schwartzman) is an ambitious go-getter at the eponymous prep school who does
everything from pen a play set amidst the horrors of Vietnam to wrestle on the
school&#146;s team. His secret? &quot;I think you just gotta find something you like to do
and then do it for the rest of your life. For me it&#146;s going to Rushmore.&quot; He
makes this pronouncement to forlorn industrial tycoon and hesitant Rushmore benefactor
Herman Blume, who, in an operatic mid-life funk over a slew of issues from his thuggish
sons to failing marriage, becomes his rival for the affections of widowed first grade
teacher Rosemary Cross (Olivia Williams, whose only previous credit was as Kevin
Costner&#146;s love interest in <i>The Postman</i>). The resulting comic battle for
superiority results in a film possessed of a quirky internal logic all it&#146;s own, a
fearless approach to what&#146;s funny and a wit quick enough to zip past what isn&#146;t.
The whole thing is played to one of the freshest and most imaginative collection of
influential 1960s British rock songs ever assembled, a list which includes The Who&#146;s
&quot;A Quick One While He&#146;s Away,&quot; &quot;Ooh La La&quot; by The Faces and songs
from Creation, Paul Desmond, The Kinks, Vince Guaraldi, John Lennon and more. Admittedly a
love it or hate it proposition, <i>Rushmore</i> is as precocious as it&#146;s fearless
young star and about as successful in ambition. The inventive visual scheme of the movie
is preserved not only in a no-frills DVD edition, but a letterboxed VHS tape as well.</p>

<a href="rvarsity.html" name="VarsityBlues" target="_top"><strong><big><i>Varsity Blues</i></big></strong></a>
(USA, 1999, June 29)</big></p>

<p>The recent aforementioned slew of teen-themed movies included the inevitable percentage
of misfires (see <i>Jawbreaker</i> and <i>The Rage: Carrie II</i> -- or better yet,
don&#146;t), but there were a couple of cautious keepers as well, movies that tried to
rise above the formulaic and were rewarded with box office success. <i>She&#146;s All That</i>
is a relatively charming and glossy update of the Pygmalion story that benefits enormously
from the casting of Freddie Prinze Jr. in prime hunk mode as the popular high school jock
and Rachael Leigh Cook (who slings the frying pan in those &quot;this is your brain on
drugs&quot; ads) as the absorbed art student who blossoms into the prom queen when watered
with a little attention. Matthew Lilliard is the loudest of the who&#146;s who supporting
cast as a Real World party type who distracts Prinze&#146;s popular girlfriend long enough
for the subterfuge to take hold (Prinze and Lilliard also co-star in the overly busy <i>Wing
Commander</i>). The DVD has no additional features but serves to showcase the soundtrack,
which includes Sixpence None the Richer&#146;s &quot;Kiss Me&quot; as an appropriate
musical motif for the swan&#146;s awakening.</p>

<p>The most memorable promo line from the philosophical David and Goliath Texas high
school melodrama <i>Varsity Blues</i> is star James Van Der Beek, the Dawson of
&quot;Dawson&#146;s Creek,&quot; staring at his offscreen father and flatly stating
&quot;I don&#146;t want. Your life.&quot; This could well be the motto of this earnest but
predictable and thus lifeless fable about a nice high school athlete and his twin
struggles with personal dignity and an egotistical coach (Jon Voight in Meryl Streep mode
as a crazed southern Napoleon of the gridiron). Capable first-time director Brian Robbins
goes through the yee-haw motions of life in a football-mad small town but seems more
interested in the dynamics of maturation between Van Der Beek and his variously motivated
pals. Still, it&#146;s the scenes in which the team discovers the sex ed teacher
moonlighting as a topless dancer and the football groupie who greets her conquests wearing
a whipped cream bikini that probably have the greatest resonance with the film&#146;s
target audience. There&#146;s a Spanish subtitled tape of this title and the DVD includes
a selection of trailers.</p>

<p><big><a name="StillCrazy" target="_top"><strong><big>Still Crazy</big></strong></a> </i>(United
Kingdom/USA, 1998, June 29)</big></p>

<p>One of those genial, sporadically funny movies you keep wanting to be better than it
ultimately is, <i>Still Crazy</i> was written by the team responsible for <i>The
Commitments</i> (Dick Clement and Ian La Fresnais) in obvious hope of scoring the same
kind of underdog-themed musical success. In this case the object of their sincere musical
affection is the fictitious British band Strange Fruit, which is bullied into a
semi-triumphant reunion tour by keyboard player turned Ibiza contraceptive salesman Tony
(Stephen Rea). Mike Leigh regular Timothy Spall is the beery drummer, comedian Billy
Connolly plays the roadie and reformed wildman narrator, Bill Nighy is on his very own
planet as the self-important and thus often hilarious lead singer and Jimmy Nail is the
typically sedate but volcanic bassist. One of the movie&#146;s most satisfying conceits is
the band&#146;s pursuit of their Syd Barrettish lead guitarist, the frail but talented and
charismatic Brian -- who is played to perfection by <i>Withnail and I</i> writer-director
Bruce Robinson. The music by producer Clive Langer and others is surprisingly quite good,
although for all their vague glam trappings the band sounds more like vintage Bad Company
than Mott the Hoople or the later Psychedelic Furs (to name two groups whose names are
dropped repeatedly). &quot;Our lives peaked too early,&quot; says one bandmate mournfully.
Unfortunately for all concerned, so does the film. There&#146;s a Spanish subtitled tape
of this title, and the DVD includes a making-of featurette and no less than six subtitle
options, including Thai.</p>

(USA, 1998, June 29)</big></p>

<p>Had this sprawling, surrealistic World War II epic been released prior to Steven
Spielberg&#146;s <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>, last year&#146;s Oscar race might have had a
similar but very different victor. But it wasn&#146;t, and they didn&#146;t, and therein
lies a tale that is, depending on who&#146;s doing the telling, either unjust or perfectly
befitting a movie of as torturous a gestation period as <i>The Thin Red Line</i>.
Immediately identifiable as the work of Terrence Malick, the brilliant cinematic recluse
who made <i>Badlands</i> and <i>Days of Heaven</i> in the 1970s and hasn&#146;t directed
since, the movie is prodigiously cerebral, taking James Jones&#146; novel of the battle of
Guadalcanal and moving it from an exploration of character under duress to a meditation on
the effects of battle on environment and, to a lesser extent, the human psyche. Thus,
while there are stories of cowardice and heroism among the large cast, the human side of
the story, revised, reshot and re-edited throughout the production, is balanced and often
overwhelmed by a kind of metaphysical hush that takes time to breath the soil and prowl
effortlessly through the grassy hillside prior to battle. As in the work of Stanley
Kubrick, this kind of moviemaking takes the most valuable asset of all to achieve -- time
-- and the success of the venture is inevitably offset by the dashed anticipation of it.
Still, Nick Nolte gives a fierce performance as a gung-ho officer, John Travolta is
quietly riveting in his single scene as a brooding brigadier general, and Adrien Brody as
Corporal Fife, a major character in the novel, has been reduced in the editing of the film
to a wordless cameo. The very large cast also includes Sean Penn (prominent in the
trailer), Elias Koteas, Ben Chaplin, Woody Harrelson, James Caviezel, John Cusack, Dash
Mihok, John Savage and, in a brief cameo near the very end, George Clooney. The film is
available in Spanish and widescreen video editions, with the DVD due November 2. The more
conventional 1964 adaptation of the novel, starring Jack Warden and Keir Dullea (who would
play one of the doomed astronauts in Kubrick&#146;s <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i> four
years later), is available in all formats.</p>
