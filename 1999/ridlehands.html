<p><big><strong><big>I</big></strong>dle Hands</i> is all thumbs. Ten of &#145;em, black
and blue and bloodied, all pointed down in deference of the Siskel and Ebert rating
system. Yuck.</big></p>

<p>The first produced screenplay from Terri Hughes and Ron Milbauer is a mottle of rotting
flesh stretched out between lame jokes on death, crotch sniffing digits, and splotches of
gratuitous nudity, with unwanted formulaic pokes at Sam Raimi, John Landis, The Exorcist,
and numerous other horror classics. This is either just the right combination to turn your
stomach or, if you&#146;re a teenager, make you want to see this film. Director Rodman
Flender (<i>Leprechaun 2</i>, <i>The Unborn</i>) still appears to be cutting his teeth on
the horror genre while retaining a high body count and shamelessly flaunting the drug
culture.</p>

<p><img src="Images/ridlehands-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="100">The corpses
begin falling early in the kitsch-saturated, Halloween-bedecked home of Anton Tobias (<i>SLC
Punk&#146;s</i> Devon Sawa), a 17-year-old slacker who sleeps oblivious to the connection
between a local serial killer and the deadly dust balls beneath his parents&#146; bed.
Ditzy Ma and Pa (Connie Ray and Fred Willard) see the writing on the ceiling &quot;Im
under the bed,&quot; unaware that a monstrous entity with horrible grammar is taunting
them, the kind that terrorizes its victims by ridiculing them with missing apostrophes. In
true selfless spirit, Anton doesn&#146;t seem to mind the sudden absence of his folks the
next morning, other than there&#146;s no dog food or milk in the house. He has a bigger
problem&#133;he&#146;s out of grass! So our pot-smoking couch-potato begs off a few hits
from best buds, fellow losers, and dim-witted neighbors Mick (<i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>
and <i>Austin Powers&#146;</i> Seth Green) and Pnub (<i>The Mighty Ducks&#146;</i> Elden
Ratliff, now using the Elden Henson moniker as credited in She&#146;s All That and The
Mighty).</p>

<p>Meanwhile in Beaver, Utah&#133;. Debi Liquor (luscious Vivica A. Fox, a.k.a. Will
Smith&#146;s squeeze in <i>Independence Day</i>) is a hot-to-trot exorcist in search of
some devilish icons. Quicker than you can say &quot;Triple-A,&quot; she looks a road map
and plays a simpleton&#146;s game of connect-the-dots that will lead her to Bolan,
California, Anton&#146;s hometown in her Airstream 290.</p>

<p>Speaking of that small California town, Anton finds his parents have been home all
along, but somehow he couldn&#146;t smell their decaying flesh. Gee, guess this is an
anti-drug movie after all: &quot;Don&#146;t smoke dope -- decomposing bodies won&#146;t
smell like roses anymore!&quot; Then again, the filmmakers make no attempt to explain away
the fact that no one in this town seems to care that Anton&#146;s folks are dead, as no
one calls them on the phone. Yeah the police show up, briefly, but they have another
agenda altogether.</p>

<p>Soon the orphan&#146;s right hand takes on it&#146;s own evil death grip that&#146;s
hard to unclench, much like an IRS audit. The slapstick continues when Anton whacks a soda
bottle into the side of Mick&#146;s forehead and frizbees a rotary saw blade through
Pnub&#146;s neck, his head rolling off and a nonchalant &quot;kewl&quot; seemingly its
epithet. If you&#146;re hoping for a quick exit for the boys, think again. For no apparent
reason (there&#146;s hardly any reason in or to this film, now that I think about it),
they reappear as marblized zombies, perfectly costumed for the school&#146;s Halloween
party.</p>

<p><img src="Images/ridlehands-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="179" HEIGHT="144">From here on out
it&#146;s a race against time as that crafty homicidal hand continues its killing spree
towards its warped, idiotic, chiller theater end. There&#146;s a sub-plot involving
Anton&#146;s fear of the opposite sex and his cautious courtship of next-door sexpot Molly
(Jessica Alba), who unexpectedly appreciates her neighbor&#146;s prankish pawing, in a
purely Jekyll and Hyde sequence. In desperation, Anton seeks the advice of local punk
Randy (Jack Noseworthy), who brown noses the harried teen and notes that &quot;idle hands
are the Devil&#146;s playground.&quot; Duh. Coincidence teams Randy with
exorcist/priestess Debi and the film gets hornier and wilder as it creeps its way to a
Carriesque conclusion.</p>

<p>In my scrawl of notes I wrote &quot;Can anyone explain this movie&#146;s plot?&quot;
People who like this movie will retort &quot;who cares?&quot; For me, I&#146;m throwing up
my hands (both of them, attached). I&#146;m sending <i>Idle Hands</i> straight to the
video bin, where this Columbia release joins its studio sister <i>Jawbreaker</i>. I refuse
to give the devil his tasteless due and you shouldn&#146;t either.</p>
