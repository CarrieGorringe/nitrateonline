<p><big><strong><big>N</big></strong>o more Mr. Nice Guy! If you thought crime in the
streets was a problem, wait till you take a gander at <i>Payback</i>, a violent, sadistic
mess guaranteed a number one finish its opening weekend based on star Mel Gibson&#146;s
allure, yet tarnished by his Machiavellian intentions. Who says crime doesn&#146;t pay!
Don&#146;t take a seat expecting to find any role models (and don&#146;t bring the kids!),
as all the characters in the film have a dark side, just a few being a lighter shade of
gray. Debut director Brian Helgeland, who wrote the screenplay with a late rewrite by
Terry Hayes (<i>Dead Calm</i>), has churned out scripts for the Oscar-winning hit <i>L.A. </i><em>Confidential</em>
(with Curtis Hanson) and Gibson&#146;s lackluster <i>Conspiracy Theory</i>, as well as the
Kevin Costner clunker <i>The Postman</i> (with Eric Roth). His graduation to hyphenate
status here hasn&#146;t been all that easy. <i>Lethal Weapon 4</i>, Gibson&#146;s last
release in mid-1998, was shot after <i>Payback</i>, but Gibson, also a producer here
through his Icon Productions, disliked the director&#146;s first cut. When Helgeland
refused to honor the star&#146;s request for re-shooting the film in Gibson&#146;s vision,
Helgeland left the project (although keeping his name on screen in lieu of the designated
disgruntled pseudonym Alan Smithee). Reportedly, Mad Mel had nearly a third of the film
replaced by an unidentified director (not John Boorman, who helmed a brilliant version of
Westlake&#146;s novel more than 30 years ago in the still enjoyable <i>Point Blank</i>,
starring Lee Marvin in the Gibson role), forcing the picture to be moved off of last
summer&#146;s release schedule. </big></p>

<p>There must be an audience (beyond Mel&#146;s adoring fans) for this type of punishment,
namely over-weight liquor-guzzlers, gnarly chain-smokers, scum-sucking drug dealers (be
careful with your nose ring!), crooked cops, slimy con men, and toe-crunching gangsters.
Not that I&#146;m prudish, being of a fan of Sam Peckinpah, Todd Solondz, and Quentin
Tarantino, it&#146;s just that I found <i>Payback</i> pointless.</p>

<p><img src="Images/rpayback-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="112" HEIGHT="150">As the film
begins we find low-life scam artist/pickpocket Porter, our &quot;hero,&quot; recovering
from a near death experience courtesy of his double-crossing partner Val Resnick (Gregg
Henry) and the adulterous Mrs. P (<i>The Game&#146;s</i> Deborah Kara Unger) following the
theft of $140,000 in laundered money from Chinese gangsters. An opening credit sequence
shows Porter&#146;s knack for deception and light-handedness. As he follows the money
trail up the criminal food chain, he reconnects with Val, who used the cash to buy his way
into &quot;the syndicate,&quot; or is it &quot;the outfit,&quot; a secret bad boy
organization that seems lightheaded in protecting it&#146;s executives. Dead bodies
accumulate and the cast is decimated as the increasingly intimidating Porter manages to
easily out-maneuver the gang that couldn&#146;t shoot straight, leaving it to the audience
to figure out his methods. Maybe it&#146;s the Marine Corps tattoo on his arm that alludes
to his cunning and ingenuity, or maybe it&#146;s a case of bad screenwriting.</p>

<p>Joining Porter in his quest is ER&#146;s Maria Bello as Rosie, a hooker with a heart of
gold. She holds up the best in the film, protected by Porter the man and Porter the dog,
and appears headed toward a future sequel as the story turns out (and if the grosses -- at
the box office, that is -- are high enough). In that sense, the film seems like it&#146;s
written backwards, with the concept for <i>Payback II</i> left chained to a tenement
radiator and hissing at Porter from a bullet-ridden car.</p>

<p>When the male audience isn&#146;t holding their collective groin to protect it from Val
and Asian girl friend/dominatrix Pearl&#146;s sado-masochistic well-placed kicks and
punches, the women are probably wondering why they&#146;ve been dragged alone for this
uneven ride, although Chris Boardman&#146;s score adds a jazzy dimension to the noirish
look filmed by cinematographer Ericson Core, a music video veteran.</p>

<p><img src="Images/rpayback-5.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="112" HEIGHT="150">Cast-wise, Ally
McBeal&#146;s Lucy Liu pushes the envelope in a breakthrough big-screen role, well above
her litigious boob tube character Ling Woo. She&#146;ll pop up later this year in Clint
Eastwood&#146;s <i>True Crime</i>. William Devane and an uncredited James Coburn are a
pair of crime lieutenants answering to Kris Kristofferson (appropriately renamed Bronson,
apparently in deference to master vigilante himself, Charles &quot;Death Wish&quot;
Bronson). Underlings David Paymer, Bill Duke, and Jack Conley provide textured, but
one-dimensional roles. And my condolences to John Glover, as one of the mob henchmen, on
the sad demise of his role as the devil on the now-cancelled Fox series Brimstone. R.I.P.</p>
<i>

<p>Payback</i> is not for the faint at heart. It&#146;s a groin-wrenching, bone-crunching
exercise in excess, pickled with an occasional good line or amusing piece of forced comic
relief, which are more off-putting than welcomed. You&#146;re more likely to emerge after
nearly two hours counting your blessings (and your toes) that you made it through the
loathsome ordeal of <i>Payback</i>.</p>
