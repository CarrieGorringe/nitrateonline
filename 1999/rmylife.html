<p><big><strong><big>B</big></strong>ritish director Hugh Hudson, best known for his
award-winning 1981 freshman feature <i>Chariots of Fire</i>, the compelling tale of
exhilarating personal victory at the 1924 Olympics, returns to the pre- and
post-Depression decades with a smaller, intimate effort worthy of your time (a brisk
90-minutes) and dollars, but which, unfortunately, may get lost in the continuing summer
onslaught of mega-films. Hudson, whose last fictional effort bombed here in the States
over a decade ago (<i>Lost Angels</i>, featuring Beastie Boys&#146; Adam Horovitz), has
shaped an intimate world of an eccentric Scottish family, based on the precocious
red-headed childhood memoirs of Royal Opera House director Sir Denis Forman</big>.</p>

<p>Stunningly bucolic Argyll, Scotland is Never Never Land to the large family of
ten-year-old Fraser Pettigrew and his doting parents Edward and Moira to the maternal
estate of Kiloran House. Father, ever so plain, but filled with a stern yet childish
nature by Colin Firth (the fickle foil of the Bard and his lady love in <i>Shakespeare in
Love</i>), spends his time creating inventions of dubious merits. He is the &quot;kind
fool,&quot; reluctantly accommodated by his six children and his staid, indulgent wife
(American Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio, a.k.a. Maid Marian opposite Kevin Costner in <i>Robin
Hood: Prince of Thieves</i>). Fraser, played by newcomer Robbie Norman, is a terrifyingly
adventuresome child (as an infant he nonchalantly ventured out one afternoon for a crawl
-- along the steep ledge high above his terrified clan), who absorbs life with wide-eyed
eagerness, much like the sphagnum moss that envelopes the area (and which soaked up the
blood of the Allied wounded in World War I). The moss provides a small cottage industry
for the family, until Moira&#146;s iron-fisted mother, Gamma Macintosh (Rosemary Harris),
and selfish Uncle Morris (Malcolm McDowell) arrive from London with grand plans for the
property, to the horrifying dismay of the current inhabitants.</p>

<p>As Edward&#146;s resourceful dabbling with the local plant life brings central heating
to the mansion, his romantic fires are stoked by the arrival of Heloise (Irene Jacob),
Morris&#146;s fiancée, a striking young French cellist who also plucks at the
heartstrings of the sexually curious Fraser. Edward&#146;s attention to his family is
strained by his repressed infatuation with the 24-year-old mademoiselle, who instead
favors the company of the clever youngster, in a seemingly harmless older-sister manner. </p>

<p>Left alone by a father pre-occupied with his own failings, Fraser learns of the
pleasures of the flesh by thumbing through his late grandfather&#146;s library and
happening upon explicit Greek texts. This extracurricular reading plays off amusingly at a
pre-nuptial dinner, joined by some cross-dressing guests and a wine-guzzling reverend,
with Fraser&#146;s unabashed comments about the financial viability of prostitutes raising
money for the poor. Still later, a peaceful Halloween party erupts into a melee when
Fraser is accused of feeling up a friend&#146;s sister. Wet dreams of Heloise follow for
the ever-confused lad, and an even more ill-at-ease father who suggests a cold plunge in
the river as a solution to his son&#146;s condition.</p>
<i>

<p>My Life So Far</i> fills its short time very well. The cast carries their roles
exceedingly well for such a small film, built on imperfect characters and strained
relations. Even smaller roles, such as Tcheky Karyo as a daredevil aviator who lands at
the estate in search of repairs, Kelly MacDonald as Fraser&#146;s sister smitten in love
by the flyer, and Freddie Jones is the red-faced Reverend Finlayson, register
refreshingly.</p>

<p>The film lingers like a good after-dinner mint, a repast sumptuously capturing the
strong picturesque landscape of the Scottish highlands (where Hudson also filmed his <i>Greystoke:
The Legend of Tarzan</i>) by cinematographer Bernard Lutic, formerly aboard with Hudson on
their 1985 disaster, <i>Revolution</i>. Innocence lays revealed before you and you relish
it in all its repressed glory, much like how Fraser sneaks off to enjoy old recordings of
Louis Armstrong (his classically-trained father brow-beating his son with the opinion that
&quot;Beethoven is God talking in his sleep; jazz is the devil&quot;). We all have family
secrets and it&#146;s nice to see that someone of Hugh Hudson&#146;s stature can show them
an apt place on the cinema&#146;s mantle. </p>
