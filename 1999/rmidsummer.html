If you&#146;re looking for romantic fizz, A Midsummer Night&#146;s Dream comes out of the pack like a can of flat soda. It&#146;s not wretchedly bad, but for the lovelorn and mischievous among us, it lacks that certain snack, crackle, and Puck that wowed audiences with last year&#146;s shot-out-of-nowhere Shakespeare in Love, which is still pulling in viewers on over 900 screens nationwide, only 200 below the total prints circulating for the newer, lesser Dream. Lightning doesn&#146;t strike -- once or twice -- in this weak, watered-down ensemble piece. The talents of its stellar cast are lost under the weight of Hoffman&#146;s lethargic direction.">

<p><big><strong><big>S</big></strong>ure, it&#146;s only coincidence that the recent stock
market downturn coincided with the release of this latest ode to The Bard, but Michael
Hoffman&#146;s adaptation is a lackluster effort, a mild drop-off despite a splendid
collection of well known performers. If you&#146;re looking for romantic fizz, <i>A
Midsummer Night&#146;s Dream</i> comes out of the pack like a can of flat soda. It&#146;s
not wretchedly bad, but for the lovelorn and mischievous among us, it lacks that certain
snack, crackle, and Puck that wowed audiences with last year&#146;s shot-out-of-nowhere
Shakespeare in Love, which is still pulling in viewers on over 900 screens nationwide,
only 200 below the total prints circulating for the newer, lesser Dream. Lightning
doesn&#146;t strike -- once or twice -- in this weak, watered-down ensemble piece. The
talents of its stellar cast are lost under the weight of Hoffman&#146;s lethargic
direction.</big></p>

<p><img src="Images/rmidsummer-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="100">Updated from
ancient Athens to late 19th century Tuscany, the Northern Italian hills are alive with
dew-drop fairies and flower-packed potions, mountain bicycles (an odd addition), and a
tendency to lull the audience into occasional yawns. Perhaps it&#146;s the overwhelmingly
sumptuous production design by Oscar-winner Luciana Arrighi (<i>Howard&#146;s End</i>, <i>Remains
of the Day</i>) or the sunny, luscious landscapes captured by director of photography
Oliver Stapleton (previously teamed with director Hoffman on <i>One Fine Day</i>, the
Academy Award winning <i>Restoration</i>, and <i>Restless Natives</i>), giving off a
malaise much like that tired feeling you get after a long day at the beach. Despite
Hoffman&#146;s lack of passion and wit in dealing with the iambic pentameter of the
original, his film shines only during the last 15 minutes of a nearly two-hour time frame,
from the moment the play within a play brings some life and well-needed humor to the
stage. Otherwise, this production will be one of several early summer disappointments.</p>

<p>At least Hoffman provides equal time for nearly all the top-billed names, even if some
of them seem to be sitting by the dusty roadside, hoping to hijack one of those
renaissance bicycles and heigh-ho off screen, instead of harping to and fro in this tale
of crisscrossed lovers, pawns to the whims of Oberon (Rupert <i>My Best Friend&#146;s
Wedding</i> Everett) and Titania (the everlastingly stunning Michelle Pfeiffer), the fairy
queen and her complacent, yet snubbed, counterpart. One level down, and unaware of the
pixie kingdom prancing in the neighboring woods, are stiff, crusty Theseus (David
Straitharn), a local duke, and the fair and open-minded Hippolyta (French actress Sophie
Marceau), his bride-to-be. Straitharn, as most of the players, are constricted in
one-dimensional shells handcuffed on them by director/writer Hoffman. It&#146;s
unfortunate the characterizations aren&#146;t made bigger than life (excepting Kevin
Kline) and hence more enjoyable. The beautiful Marceau, here walking around in a
broadminded role, is best remembered for <i>Braveheart</i> and best forgotten in this
year&#146;s <i>Lost and Found</i>.</p>

<p>The duke stubbornly presides over the local subjects and quickly earns the antipathy of
the headstrong, jealous and/or broken hearted, a group including Demetrius (Christian
Bale), Lysander (Dominic West), Hermia (Anna Friel), and her bumbling, Ally McBealish
friend Helena (Calista Flockhart). Somehow I don&#146;t think Mr. Shakespeare meant for
the ladies&#146; highlight in his play to be a mud-filled cat fight rivaling TV&#146;s
Dynasty bitch brawl between Krystle and Alexis back in the late 1980s.</p>

<p><img src="Images/rmidsummer-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="100">Tossed amongst
the royal love salad is a group of amateur thespians, including the enchanting ham Nick
Bottom, a buffoon in ass&#146;s clothing, enlivened with a gutsy, sparkling pathos by
Kline, one of my favorite actors and soon to fill the screen opposite Will Smith and
Shakespearian wunderkind Kenneth Branagh in the mega-production update of <i>The Wild,
Wild West</i>. Stanley Tucci adds a comical, minor role as Oberon&#146;s roguish
lieutenant Puck, whose misidentification of the principals is the core of the mismatched
lovers&#146; undoing. His appearance in this film reminded me how much more enjoyable was
last year&#146;s <i>The Impostors</i>, Tucci&#146;s triple-threat (director-writer-star),
too-quickly-forgotten ensemble farce which I&#146;d recommend in a heartbeat as a better
evening&#146;s viewing as a video rental or DVD purchase than this midsummer&#146;s
nightmare.</p>

<p>Bottom and his band of inept performers put on a devastingly funny, mishap of a
presentation of &quot;The Most Lamentable Comedy, and Cruel Death of Pyramus and
Thisbe,&quot; as the film draws to its close, at least leaving you with a pleasant enough
aftertaste even if you&#146;ve had sat through a gorgeous bowl of mush. Frankly though,
it&#146;s too little too late. </p>
