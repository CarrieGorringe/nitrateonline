<p><big><strong><big>V</big></strong>alentino began doing his own stunts during the
filming of <i>The Eagle</i>, including a scene involving a team of runaway horses where
the actor was accidentally dragged for a hundred feet. After <i>The Eagle</i>, he appeared
in <i>The Son of the Sheik</i>, where he re-teamed with Agnes Ayres, reprising her role
from the earlier film, and Vilma Banky, with whom he had worked in <i>The Eagle</i> and
whom he was supposedly having an off-set romance with, as well</big>. </p>

<p>He was seen around town with a variety of women, including Jean Acker. But the woman
with whom he was most seen was Pola Negri, a film star in her own right at that time, and
who was also sharing time with the actor at Falcon Lair. &quot;Call it fatalism,&quot; the
actress wrote, years later, of her first encounter with Valentino, &quot;but from our very
first meeting I knew that, somehow, this man had the power either to destroy my life or to
so irrevocably alter its course that it would never again be the same.&quot; </p>

<p>Pola Negri had, literally, worked her way up from nothing, vaulting from a position as
a dancer for the Imperial Ballet of Poland to one as a performer with Max Reinhardt's
theatre company, then playing Madame du Barry in Ernst Lubitsch's 1919 film, the success
of which brought them both to Hollywood. She carried on a famous rivalry with one of
Valentino's previous co-stars, Gloria Swanson, was on even worse terms with Tallulah
Bankhead, and by the mid-Twenties was making $10,000 a week. The Hungarian playwright
Ernest Vajda, after meeting and visiting with her in Hollywood, called Pola &quot;the
greatest actress of our time&quot;. She had a pet panther which she took for walks on a
leash, something which must have caught Valentino's fancy after his experiences in the
Sunset Boulevard bungalow with Zela. </p>

<p>It was not long before people started speculating about the development of their
relationship. &quot;Engaged? I do not like the word,&quot; Pola told reporters. &quot;It
sounds too much like a prison or a business engagement.&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;I do not like the word 'engagement',&quot; Valentino told reporters. &quot;It
sounds too much like a contract one has to perform by a certain date.&quot; </p>

<p>So, it was up to Pola's mother to spill the news. Mme. Eleanora Chalupec, concluding a
visit with her daughter in the U.S., told reporters in June, 1926 that her daughter and
Valentino were to be married the following March. Mme. Chalupec was on her way back to her
home at Villa Reull, a sixty-room house set on 75 acres of gardens, outside Paris.
&quot;My daughter is very fond of Rudolph and he is fond of her,&quot; she stated.
&quot;He would make Pola a splendid husband. But she doesn't believe in divorces, and her
first marriage ended that way. If she and Rudolph are still fond of each other next March,
they will probably be married in France.&quot; </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Valentino quietly proceeded with plans to do a film adaptation of a James
Branch Cabell novel, <i>The Silver Stallion</i>, a medieval fantasy which would provide an
opportunity for him to work once more with Natacha. Even while he was out and about with
Pola Negri, he had never stopped wearing a piece of jewelry which Natacha had given to
him, a &quot;slave bracelet&quot;, as it was referred to, made of flat pieces of silver
formed in the likeness of links in a chain. Friends started noticing that Valentino's hair
was thinning. </p>

<p>As Pola started work on <i>Hotel Imperial</i> with director Mauritz Stiller -- who had
just come to Hollywood with a young Swedish actress named Greta Garbo -- Valentino began
an exhaustive tour of the country, making personal appearances in all the major cities
where <i>Son of the Sheik</i> was opening. It was during this time that the Chicago
Tribune ran an unsigned editorial wherein the writer expressed absolute appallment and
outrage over finding a face powder dispenser positioned in the men's room of a new
nightspot -- presumably so that men could attain the same translucent pallor that
Valentino had upon the screen. &quot;Rudy, the beautiful gardener's boy, is the prototype
of the American male. Hell's bells. Oh, sugar.&quot; </p>

<p>There was a flip side to Valentino's popularity. Women adored him, but he also had to
put up with numerous slights from men who saw him as an adversary, either because of his
influence over women or, worse, his ethnic background. The results could be staggering,
such as in this, again unsigned, missive that appeared in pages of &quot;Photoplay&quot;
in 1922. Try imagining this appearing in one of today's issues of &quot;People&quot;:
&quot;I hate Valentino! All men hate Valentino. I hate his oriental optics; I hate his
classic nose; I hate his patent-leather hair; I hate his Svengali glare; I hate him
because he's the great lover of the screen; I hate him because he's an embezzler of
hearts;&quot; [What exactly is that supposed to mean?] &quot;I hate him because he's too
apt in the art of osculation;&quot; [That's &quot;kissing&quot;, to you and me.] &quot;I
hate him because he's leading man for Gloria Swanson;&quot; [Not when Joseph Kennedy was
around.] &quot;I hate him because he's too good-looking.&quot; [Does Tom Cruise get
letters like this?] </p>

<p>Valentino's response to the Chicago Tribune editorial was swift and unhesitating: he
challenged the writer to a boxing match, at wherever and whenever the writer saw fit. The
writer of the editorial never came forward, although Valentino, while he was in New York
City, participated in a public sparring match with Frank O'Neil, sports writer for the
Evening Journal. In hindsight, O'Neil was very sporting about the whole thing, especially
when Valentino decked him with two punches. Along with fencing and horseback-riding, the
actor regularly sparred at the Hollywood Athletic Club to stay in shape, and counted Jack
Dempsey among his friends. </p>

<p>All of this came to an abrupt halt in Valentino's suite at the Ambassador Hotel, on
August 15. The actor was initially diagnosed as having acute appendicitis and severe
gastric ulcers, and operated upon accordingly. He was placed in the best room at the
Polyclinic Hospital, the one known as the &quot;lucky suite&quot;. As pleurisy set in, the
actor's temperature and pulse rose, then fell, then rose again. Blood donors were called
upon. While Joseph Schenck was allowed in to see the actor, Norma Talmadge (who was also
Mrs. Schenck) and Lowell Sherman were turned away. Pola Negri, looking suitably careworn
and haggard, met with reporters in Hollywood and told them that she would rush to the side
of her &quot;betrothed&quot; as soon as she finished work on her current picture. Gloria
Swanson telephoned the hospital for news on Valentino's condition. The switchboard at the
Polyclinic was so busy that it was sometimes handling as many as eight to ten calls a
minute. Flowers began arriving for the actor in such abundance that they had to be banked
against the walls outside his hospital room. </p>

<p>During all the hullabaloo, the actor's mind was focused on someplace else entirely: a
fishing trip that he had scheduled to take, the following month, in Maine. He spoke of it
to Joseph Schenck, and to one of the team of doctors who were treating him at the
hospital. &quot;I hope you have plenty of fishing rods,&quot; the actor asked. &quot;Mine
are in California.&quot; Shortly afterwards, Valentino lapsed into a coma. </p>

<p>When news of his death reached Pola, she abruptly halted work on <i>Hotel Imperial</i>
-- at great expense to both herself, and to the picture -- so that she could immediately
go to Valentino. The actor's brother, Alberto Guglielmi, insisted that a High Mass be said
before Valentino's body left New York City, and this was done, at St. Malachy's, after
Alberto arrived from Italy. Douglas Fairbanks, Charles Chaplin and Joseph Schenck were
among the pallbearers. Jean Acker collapsed during the ceremony. So did Pola, or, as a
famous newspaper headline put it, the actress &quot;faints! Faints! FAINTS!&quot; George
Ullmann assumed control of both the actor's estate and of the funeral arrangements, and it
was he, Alberto and his family, and Pola who stewarded Valentino's body home, one last
time, to California. </p>

<p>And, even then, there was still some confusion about where to place the body. At first,
it was placed in a crypt in the mausoleum of Hollywood Memorial Park, above that of
Virginia Ruth Mathis, June Mathis' mother. 5,000 people visited the crypt after
Valentino's interment, not one of them knowing that Valentino's body would have to be
again moved, in 1928, when June Mathis herself passed away. The actor's body was placed in
a third, borrowed crypt beside the Mathises, but speculation about further relocation was
abated when June Mathis' husband, Sylvano Balboni, arranged for the Valentino estate to
purchase the crypt and allow the actor to, finally, rest undisturbed. </p>

<p>All of the belongings, antiquities, and &quot;objects d'art&quot; that Valentino had so
extensively and meticulously collected during his life were sold. The estate catalogue was
published extensively. (And copies of it, today, fetch enormous prices.) The house and
property at Whitley Heights were sold to make way for the new Los Angeles freeway, but
souvenir hunters systematically took the house apart, piece by piece, before it could ever
be moved. No such fate occurred to Valentino's second house, Falcon Lair, which quietly
went through a succession of owners, including the heiress Doris Duke. </p>

<p>&quot;Aspiration&quot;, a soaring bronze Art Deco statue by the sculptor Roger Noble
Burnham, was unveiled in Los Angeles' DeLongpre Park in 1930, in memory of Valentino. The
statue was beset by a bizarre series of vandalisms until, finally, the city's Parks
Department removed it in 1954, depositing it in a warehouse where it languished for years.
</p>

<p>Natacha was not present for any of the memorials to her former husband, nor did she
contest the actor's will, which left her the sum total of $1.00. When she reunited with
her parents following her departure from California, Natacha found that they had become
believers in theosophy, the spiritualist movement founded by Madame Blavatsky which
included both the belief in a spiritual afterlife and of the soul evolving through
multiple lifetimes. (Spiritualism, and communication with the dead, acquired a great
following in both the U.S. and Europe following the First World War, and Natacha and Rudy
had done some dabbling in it themselves, even consulting the spirits over career
decisions.) Natacha did not receive news of her former husband's hospitalization until
only a few days before his death. Now, she found herself in a position where she was not
even notified in a timely enough fashion so that she could be present at his bedside
during his final hours. It was theosophy, or her belief in it, that came to her aid the
most at this time. Through a medium, she contacted Valentino's spirit, and she received
messages of comfort and reassurance. She included these at the end of a book she wrote
about her life with the actor, which was first serialized and then published in book form
in 1926. </p>

<p>George Ullmann got his own book about the actor onto the stands by the end of 1926.
Ullmann had spent four sleepless days and nights at the Polyclinic Hospital towards the
end, and when he was no longer able to remain in the actor's hospital room, he stood just
outside the door during Valentino's final hours. When finally informed of the actor's
death, Ullmann broke-down completely. </p>

<p>Jean Acker wrote the words and music to a sheet music song, entitled &quot;We Will Meet
at the End of the Trail&quot;. When she first heard about the publication of Natacha's
spiritual communications with the actor, her tart response was, &quot;He was intelligent,
and if he had lived the world would have heard of him in other ways. Even if such messages
were received, they should have been too sacred to broadcast.&quot; Acker would continue
working in Hollywood for another 25 years, mostly in bit parts, uncredited, although they
were sometimes bit parts in very good pictures, such as <i>San Francisco</i>, <i>Remember
the Night</i> and <i>Spellbound</i>. </p>

<p>Pola Negri managed to squeeze just a little bit more juice out of her &quot;troth&quot;
to the late actor. After all, she had spent $2,000 on roses and $13,000 on wardrobe for
the occasion, not to mention complying with the attentions of the ardent press, who
recorded her every sound and move on both coasts. And she even got help from the family!
Alberto Guglielmi stated, although there was &quot;no ring and no announcement&quot;, that
&quot;we all knew the engagement existed and were very much glad. We liked Pola very
much.&quot; The following April, the offices of the London Daily Mail received a radiogram
from the S.S. &quot;Aquitania&quot; announcing the engagement of Pola to Prince Serge
Mdivani, who was traveling on-board the Transatlantic liner with her. They were married in
the small village of Seraincourt, outside Paris, on May 14. </p>

<p>Pola's career zigzagged wildly after 1926, due in part, some felt, to her histrionics
over Valentino's death. While she gave an excellent performance in the anti-war film <i>Barbed
Wire</i>, she vacillated with the arrival of &quot;talkies&quot;, which the public
embraced wholeheartedly, causing many bad sound pictures to push some exemplary silent
ones out of the movie houses. Pola went to Europe, made some pictures in Britain, returned
to the U.S., then went abroad again, this time to work at the gigantic Ufa studio
facilities in Germany, which were now under the control of Joseph Goebbels' Reichs
Propaganda ministry. She was said to have been a favorite actress of the Fuhrer himself,
and both Hitler and Goebbels could show great deference towards performers whom they
favored, such as Leni Riefenstahl, the actress-turned-filmmaker who was given unlimited
resources with which to film the 1936 Olympic games in Berlin. When the Nazis invaded
France in 1940, Pola went straight back to the U.S. and took out American citizenship. (At
the end of that year, the Wannsee conference would put into effect plans for the
&quot;final solution&quot;. And Pola was part Jewish.) The actress made only a few more
films, the last being <i>The Moonspinners</i>, opposite Hayley Mills, in 1964, before
retiring to the clear-air environs of Texas to write her memoirs. </p>

<p>Natacha would have considerably more extraordinary experiences of her own. She returned
to America, became a successful independent designer and couturier, and even did some
journalism, writing about the 1927 trial of Ruth Snyder and Henry Judd Gray, who conspired
to kill Ruth's husband, Albert, as he slept at the couple's home in Queens, New York,
while their 9-year-old daughter was asleep in an adjoining room. Natacha's reporting seems
to reflect the air in which the proceedings were held: &quot;Through one crowded hour
yesterday I sat in Queens County Court House at what is generally known as the Snyder-Gray
murder trial. To me it was a big business conference. I was in the Office of Crime!&quot; </p>

<p>Natacha then went to Spain, remarried, remained there with her husband during the
outbreak of civil war, took some remarkable photographs of the events that occurred, and
then went to Egypt, where she visited and photographed the sites and tombs of the
Pharaohs. She left behind two collections of antiquities, one of Nepali and Lamaistic art
which resides in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, and one of Egyptian artifacts which is on
display at the Utah Museum of Fine Arts, in Salt Lake City.</p>

<p>Possessing the jewels of the earth, Holding within my grasp the scepter of the universe
All these would but make me more the pauper -- Were I beggard of your love. -
&quot;Poverty&quot;, from Valentino's book of poetry, &quot;Day Dreams&quot;.</p>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p>Among the throngs who attended the first showings of &quot;<i>Son of the Sheik</i>&quot;
in London, there was Edith Maude Hull. When stopped, by a surprised reporter, in the lobby
of the Regent Street cinema where it was playing, she explained that she had wanted to see
the picture as a ticket-buying member of the audience, just like everyone else. </p>

<p>Hollywood made its first attempt at filming the life of Valentino in 1951, with Anthony
Dexter, who won the part, over 75,000 other aspirants, because of his facial similarity to
the actor. A 1975 TV film got most of the facts right, and scored two casting coups,
Yvette Mimieux as a cool, stylish Natacha Rambova, and the indomitable Suzanne Pleshette
as June Mathis. Ken Russell's 1977 film about Valentino generated a great deal of
anticipation when it was announced that Rudolf Nureyev would play the lead. It was to have
premiered at the Cannes Film Festival that year, but, for reasons never fully explained,
was not included on the final program. Then the film opened, in the fall, and one could
see why such a horror was kept out of nice, clean, sunlit Cannes. (The film also leaves
you in a doubly foul mood once you can tell that Nureyev brings great physical agility and
expression to the part and to the screen, something which Russell mean-spiritedly mocks
and subverts in the film at ever single opportunity.) </p>

<p>&quot;Not too long ago, when Valentino was accelerating the heart action and increasing
the blood pressure of the female, she saw herself, in her mind's eye, before their
luxurious tent pitched under a desert moon sipping a champagne cocktail. Today the
squealing female adolescent -- dressed in pink hair curlers, a halter, blue jeans and
dirty feet -- sees herself in her optimum vision of romance in the back seat of a
convertible in a drive-in theater under a smog-filled sky, chomping on a pizza and
sniffing airplane glue, the better to appreciate an orgiastic movie that stars Hysterical
Hector and His Hysterectomy Five, who are all narcissistically in love with their own
acne. 'I want to take you in my arms' has become, as electric guitars plunk their way into
young America's heart, 'I whonner hol' yer han'.' Finally, to plight their troth, the
adolescent driver will permit the jill of his choice to join him in a contemporary
ceremony of fidelity: together they will hold up a liquor store.&quot; </p>

<p>Thus spoke Irving Schulman, in the epilogue to his mammoth 1967 biography of Valentino,
which devotes its entire first 87 pages to turning the actor's lying-in-state in New York
City into the riot scene at the end of Nathaniel West's <i>The Day of the Locust</i>. 499
pages later, after one has gotten the distinct impression that the author does not like
either teenagers or the Beatles, there is still no acknowledgment of sources or
references. Schulman does get one observation right, that many people tried to take
advantage of Valentino while he was a star. &quot;You know, you're like a big gold mine
that is not staked out, but everyone is doing all they can to get control of this
mine,&quot; Luther Mahoney recalled telling Valentino. </p>

<p>Today, there is still no definitive biography on this most highly influential screen
star, although Michael Morris, in his 1991 book on Natacha Rambova, &quot;Madam
Valentino&quot;, provides the most detailed and fair-minded portrait of their
relationship, drawn in part from interviews Morris had with surviving people who knew both
of the Valentinos, together and apart. Alexander Walker's slim volume on the actor resorts
to erudite speculation as to how the actor's private life influenced his professional one.
And a new biography published last year, in Britain, attempts to ascribe to Valentino
public displays of behavior which would shame a dockworker, as well as pairing him up with
both male and female lovers. Whether this is pushing Valentino into a closet, rather than
out of one, is anyone's guess, at this point. </p>
