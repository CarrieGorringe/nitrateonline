<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="5"><b>W</b></font><font size="4">ithin the
still-emerging genre of computer animation, <i>Toy Story 2</i> is and will be
considered a visual milestone.What Lasseter and his merry band of cyberanimators
have to offer the public after nearly fifteen years of programming and
passionate commitment are design advances that are, quite literally,
breathtaking, even for those who have only the most vague concept concerning how
difficult the medium is to master (as a point of reference, each of Pixar’s
computer animators can complete four to five seconds of footage per week, so the
process of getting code and microchips to produce cinematic magic may produce
better results, but not without any less effort).Much of the “flatness” so
characteristic of early computer animation has nearly been eliminated;the
backgrounds and characters appear more organically related, rather than one
looking like the other’s afterthought.Even in comparison to the first <i>Toy
Story</i>, the progress has been exponential.Marry visual excellence with
three-dimensional characters (psychologically speaking), impeccable voice-over
work from seasoned veterans, and a wit-laden script which takes full advantage
of all of these elements, and this Pixar-Disney collaboration will become part
of most children’s “must-see” list. Unlike with <i>Pokemon</i>, coercing
parents into attending won’t be necessary:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>it wouldn’t be surprising if the parents were victorious in the race to
the car.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the first episode (a.k.a. <i><a href="../rtoystry.html" target="_top">Toy
Story One</a></i>), you’ll recall that it was Woody’s (Hanks) responsibility
to undo the effects of his own jealousy and rescue Buzz Lightyear (Allen) from
the budding sociopath-next-door named Sid;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>this time, it’s Buzz’ turn to repay the favor, when an unethical
toy-shop owner named Big Al takes advantage of a situation to add Woody to his
collection of vintage toys (Al himself seems to never have left his childhood;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>his apartment, filled nearly to the breaking point with the totems of
1950s décor, would send most of today’s nouveau-retro design aficionados in
search of a sturdy pick-lock).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The audience comes to understand the source of Al’s
obsession, less a matter of sentiment than of economics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Woody, you see, was not a mere action figure, but the foundation of an
entire toy conglomerate, all of it based upon a TV show called <i>Woody’s
Roundup</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Woody’s world
consisted of his horse, the ever-faithful Bullseye, his tomboy friend, Jessie (Cusack)
and Stinky Pete, the Prospector (Grammer), all of whom participated in exciting
adventures in the wild west, before being killed off by something more dangerous
than the latest villain in a black hat (“I’ve got two words for you,”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>hissed Stinky Pete in response to Woody’s query about their collective
fate, “Sput-nik.”).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Once the
space craze set in, Woody and the gang were consigned to the world of flickering
kinescopes and the loyalties of an ever-narrowing band of fans (the computer
program that created the dazzling recreations of Woody’s in black and white
went through two years of modifications before any animation work could begin).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Now, with the addition of Woody to Al’s collection,
Jessie and Stinky Pete can come out of their generation-long storage purgatory
and go off to a toy museum in Tokyo --&nbsp; unless Woody decides to escape.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They attempt to persuade him to stay, first by tears and threats, then by
an appeal to his deepest fear:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>that
Andy, Woody’s owner, will eventually tire of him anyway, so he should just
resign himself to the inevitable, and be a star in a museum rather than yet
another has-been toy destined for the junk yard.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>While Woody alternates between guilt and feelings of self-preservation,
Buzz has assembled a group of Andy’s toys, including Mr. Potato Head (Rickles),
Rex, the neurotic dinosaur (Shawn), Slinky Dog (Varney) and Hamm, the piggy bank
(Ratzenberger), for a search-and-rescue mission, which takes them into new urban
territory and new opportunities to confront a world that exists outside the
walls of a boy’s room --&nbsp; one that is really not friendly to high-impact
plastic in various ways and to varying degrees.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One of the strengths exhibited by <i>Toy Story 2’s</i>
creative crew is the means by which they integrate this integral (and universal)
theme of fearing abandonment into the story without allowing the emotions to
venture too far south for too long a period of time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It’s touching, but not maudlin.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
sequence involving Jessie’s all-too-brief memories of being a beloved toy
(with a tender musical accompaniment by Sarah McLaughlin) starts out as just
another sad reminiscence of yet another abandoned toy, then, by degrees, it
becomes less a story about Jessie and more about everyone in the audience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But the filmmakers, by some sort of creative ESP, know exactly when to
gently transition the audience back to “reality,” as it were, having
provided a sufficient level of audience identification with Jessie and, thus,
with Woody and his dilemma. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>It’s
this subtle attention to detail that allows these filmmakers to stand apart from
the preachy and clumsy efforts that often pass for emotional insight in animated
films ( as a bonus, Pixar even went back to its archives and pulled out the 1985
short that started it all, the deliriously funny<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Luxo Jr</i>., proving, indirectly, that the company’s
talent was kept in restraint only by a lack of technology and money).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Of course, it also helps if said filmmakers and the
voice-over cast are having fun amidst all the seriousness, and you can rest
assured that they are.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Joy in the
work and respect for the characters ooze from every frame of this film.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The humor in the script reflects the sensitive sensibilities of everyone
involved, and no mania was harmed at any stage of the filmmaking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Two examples of dialogue, slight though they are, stand out.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>When Buzz encounters a “new and improved” Buzz Lightyear,
who, like Buzz in <i>Toy Story</i>, actually believes his own press clippings,
the former is heard to mutter to himself, in a moment of self-realization, the
vain hope that he really was never<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>“this
delusional.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Woody’s response
to his new companions and their plans for joining a Japanese toy museum might
have been, “Are you nuts?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead,
the line comes out as, “Are you shrinkwrapped?”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>As above, subtle attention to metaphoric details illustrate how the
intersection between seriousness and fun is one of the most effective means of
creating art.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How else to explain
the off-the-wall casting of Robert Goulet to sing the film’s trademark song, <i>You’ve
Got a Friend in Me</i>?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Take a
still-great voice, with a “Q” factor that is slightly dated, and damned if
the loopy idea doesn’t soar right through Andy’s bedroom ceiling in a
fitting finale.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Does <i>Toy Story 2</i> have any faults?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Well, a few.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>There still is some ground to be broken in terms of rendering
human figures;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>although the process
of animating humans has progressed since the original film, computer animation,
as in its traditional counterpart, has some more advances to make before it can
accurately capture the idiosyncrasies of human physiology (we possess very few
of those precise right angles so beloved of mathematical computations). There is
also an extended riff on the Star Wars films that extends a little too far for
comedic effect, but otherwise <i>Toy Story 2</i> is both a worthy successor to
and a vast improvement over the original.</p>
