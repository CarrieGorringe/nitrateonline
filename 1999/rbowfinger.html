<p><big><strong><big>S</big></strong>teve Martin is a comic with a conscience. His film
projects are funny, but free of the biting cynicism and vulgar toilet guffaws that taint
most contemporary onscreen comedies. Not that cynicism and vulgarity aren&#146;t funny: <i>Wag
the Dog</i> was a chuckle-inducing example of the former, while <i>American Pie</i>
defined the latter, dredging guilty laughs from the very bottom of the compost barrel. But
in this age of bitter sarcasm, Martin&#146;s <i>Bowfinger</i> comes across as a
much-needed breath of fresh air. Oh, sure -- the films comes jam-packed with clever
societal truth telling: Hollywood&#146;s cutthroat mentality is skewered, racial paranoia
is called on the carpet, and Scientology-style pseudo-religious celebrity hangouts are
poked fun at. But there&#146;s a sweet side to <i>Bowfinger</i> that keeps such satire
light. Like Weird Al Yankovich and his rock video parodies, Martin laces his barbs with a
certain amount of affection and respect. Looking for sledgehammer symbolism, doused in
arsenic and served up rare? Look up Oliver Stone, not Martin. </big></p>
<i>

<p>Bowfinger</i> concerns a down-and-out filmmaker stumbling around on the fringes of
Hollywood society. Burdened by debt and inhabiting a dilapidated hovel of an office, Bobby
Bowfinger (Martin) is an Ed Wood for the nineties.<i><img src="images/rbowfinger-1.jpg" alt="Bowfinger" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150"></i> When an associate pens an aliens
&#145;n action script called <i>Chubby Rain</i>, Bowfinger pulls out all the stops to give
it a life onscreen. He passes the script on to a bigwig agent, who reassures him a deal as
long as hot star Kit Ramsey (Eddie Murphy) agrees to star in the film. Problem is, Ramsey
is too big a fish for the small-time Bowfinger to land. He&#146;s also an emotional mess.
A nervous clump of frayed nerves and narcissism, Ramsey cries &quot;racism&quot; at the
slightest provocation. When his agent admits that a recent script &quot;isn&#146;t
Shakespeare,&quot; the star becomes incensed: &quot;Shakespeare,&quot; he retorts,
&quot;as in &#145;shake a spear&#146;? You&#146;re calling me a spear-chucker!&quot;
Meanwhile, he takes spiritual refuge at a new age center called Mind Head, run by a
pretentious guru (Terrence Stamp). </p>

<p>After Ramsey rejects Bowfinger&#146;s <i>Chubby Rain</i> proposal, the persistent
director cooks up a desperate scheme to boost the morale of his meager stable of talent.
The &quot;Bowfinger International Pictures&quot; crew includes would-be leading man Dave
(Jaime Kennedy), stage actress Carol (Christine Baranski), Iranian accountant and
sometimes screenwriter Afrim (Adam Alexi-Malle), and Ohio upstart Daisy (Heather Graham).
Running near empty on a string of Bowfinger&#146;s false promises, the enthusiasm of this
patient lot is rekindled when he announces, untruthfully, that Ramsey has committed to the
project. How to worm his way out of this dilemma? Taking a lesson from such guerilla-style
hit-and-run filmmakers as radical documentarian Nick Broomfield (<i>Kurt and Courtney</i>),
Bowfinger plans to film Ramsey without the star even knowing he&#146;s in <i>Chubby Rain</i>.
With actors and crew stalking the insecure star through restaurants, parking lots, and
freeways, Ramsey is horrified by both the parade of freaks that he&#146;s ambushed by, and
the ominous rants about alien abduction which are cast his way. The confrontations are
often accompanied by special effects: one Bowfinger thespian is melted down in vivid, Rick
Baker-style horror makeup as the wide-eyed, bewildered Ramsey stares forth unknowingly.</p>

<p>Things are complicated by the appearance of Jiff (Murphy), a bespectacled nebbish with
a metallic mouth of brace-laden teeth. On account of his uncanny resemblance to Kit, Jiff
is hired to the project as a stunt double. His &quot;baptism of fire&quot; involves
sprinting across interstate freeway traffic during rush hour, and the scene is a hilarious
slaptick vision, with staff cheerfully egging this terror-stricken social recluse on as he
runs this gauntlet<i>, Road Warrior</i>-style, like Steve Prefontaine cloned with <i>Family
Matters</i>&#146; Urkel. But Murphy presents Jiff in such a three-dimensional light that
you whince at how sad a case he is, even as you&#146;re giggling at his geeky mannerisms. </p>

<p><img src="images/rbowfinger-2.jpg" alt="Bowfinger" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">Indeed,
the contrast between Kit&#146;s high octane motor mouthing and Jiff&#146;s bashful banter
makes on realize how versatile an actor Murphy is in this double role. As a Saturday Night
Live mainstay during the seventies, Murphy coupled his quick wit with a childlike
innocence that also accented subsequent movie roles in <i>48 Hrs</i>., <i>Trading Places</i>,
<i>Beverly Hills Cop</i>, and <i>Coming to America</i>. Things took a mean turn, however,
as Murphy helmed the joyless, shapeless, laughless <i>Harlem Nights</i> and slummed
through sequels to previous triumphs. The magic came back -- to a certain extent -- with <i>The
Nutty Professor</i>, and it&#146;s even more apparent in <i>Bowfinger</i>. There were
whispers of an Oscar nomination surfacing for <i>The Nutty Professor</i> (which
didn&#146;t materialize). Such a buzz is sure to follow in <i>Bowfinger</i>&#146;s wake,
as well. The Kit/Jiff combo performance is Murphy&#146;s best since his star turn as
Reggie Hammond in the original <i>48 Hrs</i>. </p>

<p>Meanwhile, Martin anchors the film with his portrayal of the low-rent yet optimistic
hero of <i>Bowfinger</i>. There&#146;s a scene where Martin has second thoughts about
exploiting the gullible Jiff. &quot;I just developed a conscience,&quot; he sulks. &quot;I
can&#146;t go on with this.&quot; It&#146;s a pivotal moment, but not a surprising one.
Like Bowfinger himself, Martin is only content to wallow in the muck for so long before
ultimately choosing to do the right thing. By refusing to dunk <i>Bowfinger</i> into the
toilet of currently fashionable lowbrow humor, and investing in some memorable
characterizations, he shows that he&#146;s still marching confidently to the beat of his
own decent drummer. </p>
