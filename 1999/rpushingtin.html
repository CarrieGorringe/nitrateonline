<p><big><strong><big>T</big></strong>his overlong drama tinged with comedic underpinnings
is the feature script debut from brothers Glen and Les Charles, the co-creators of Cheers
and heavily involved with &quot;Taxi&quot; and other classic television sitcoms. As good
as they are in developing endearing characters with barbed mots within the 30-minute
format, they sadly lack the ability to raise the fragmented trials and tribulations of
marital infidelity above its maudlin air traffic controller framework. Hence, at just over
two hours, <i>Pushing Tin</i> overshoots the runway by the equivalent of at least one of
the Brothers Charles&#146; better tv episodes. As directed by Brit Mike Newell, it
won&#146;t win half the acclaim of his mob tale Donnie Brasco or the small ensemble comedy
<i>Four Weddings and a Funeral</i>, citing two of his better efforts in a career speckled
with modest success.</big></p>

<p><img src="Images/rpushingtin-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="100">The film
focuses on paranoid control freak Nick &quot;The Zone&quot; Falzone and his uncanny
ability to dimensionalize the semi-friendly, crowded skies above the New York skyline, in
much the same way the child prodigies in <i>Searching for Bobby Fischer</i> and <i>Little
Man Tate</i> visualized their thoughts. The ever-talented John Cusack (<i>Con Air</i>, <i>Grosse
Pointe Blank</i>) fills this role with the recklessness of an over-caffeinated hot rodder
and the anxiety of looking out for Number One. His competition arrives in the form of the
smothered in black leather, close-cropped cowboy Russell Bell (<i>Sling Blade&#146;s</i>
Billy Bob Thornton), a cool cucumber atop his Triumph Thunderbird who ruffles the office
politic. His co-workers and supervisors pitch about constant rumors of his legendary
zen-master antics out West, reminiscent of the &quot;oneness of all things&quot; imbued by
David Carradine in his Kwai Chang Caine role in the old ABC series Kung Fu. Russell&#146;s
on-the-job and presumably in-the-bed demeanor threaten to turn Nick&#146;s rating from
Hertz to Avis to dust.</p>

<p>Along as cheer leaders for the flight/fight is the oddlot buddy-buddys that scan the
adjacent radar screens at New York&#146;s Terminal Radar Approach Control (TRACON) center
(with Toronto and adjoining areas substituting for the real thing), including nervous
Nellies, amateur bodybuilders, social rejects, controller washouts, and divorced husbands
with trails and tales of ex-wives longer than the backlog of air traffic on the Sunday
after Thanksgiving. And the Second-Third-Fourth Wives Club have their own sorority that
gets ample screen time, spinning sorrowful accounts of extra-marital collisions and
teeth-grinding spouses as they drown their misfortunes in fifths. This clique includes
Nick&#146;s wife Connie (Elizabeth&#146;s Cate Blanchett, here a middle-class queen of
suds) and Russell&#146;s voluptuous and decade-younger better half Mary (Angelina Jolie),
a failed social worker who manages to look great dressed in her tight-fitting wardrobe and
boozy character flaws.</p>

<p><img src="Images/rpushingtin-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="150">The boys&#146;
&quot;anything you can do I can do better&quot; bickering has them stockpiling planes on
their radar scopes, oblivious to the point that it appears they are playing a video game
rather than concerned for the hundreds of lives at their mercy. The squabbling overflows
outside the workplace in all too predictable, even if somewhat amusing, fashion. One
incident puts Nick recklessly behind the steering wheel dodging Long Island commuters at
breakneck speeds as the camera pans to Russell in the passenger seat yawning and then
dozing off, impervious to the game of chicken Nick is playing with himself. Another
sequence has a Karaoke, Muskrat Love menage-a-trois theme. Most of the humor in the film
giggles up from the continuing stress-filled situations and one-liners (&quot;I used to
bowl when I was an alcoholic&quot;), rather than erupting from deep within your belly.
That&#146;s fine, as this is by no means promoted as a broad-based laugh-a-minute vehicle.
But the film still bogs down in philandering hang-ups and temperaments pushed to the
limit.</p>

<p>Further apprehensive breakdowns drag the film along, including an anxious, airborne
moment when Nick nearly brings a plane to a disastrous end. Apparently written as a witty
piece of black comedy, this close tragedy is blatantly unfunny. Stooping to a conventional
clock-ticking-down bomb threat that could have easily ended the whole mess by showing who
is the man and who is the mouse, Pushing Tin instead skids to an expected and implausible
conclusion long after the audience started pushing the glow-in-the-dark button on their
wristwatches.</p>

<p>At final fadeout, bets are placed on whether Nick overcomes his self-destructive
burn-out and/or returns home to an empty house. I won&#146;t reveal any secrets here, but
as he nervously glides his microphone cord into the console I was concerned that all of
his colleagues were gathered around looking on instead of manning their own stations.
Perhaps this is a back-handed, half-assed way of pitching the terrifying sequel: Crashing
Tin.</p>
