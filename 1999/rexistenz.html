<p><big><strong><big>W</big></strong>hile other science fiction filmmakers flirt with
cyber-punk and the way the hardware and software of technology change the physical
landscape and the social order, Cronenberg has been the one man soft machine exploring the
effect on the human body: fleshware, if you will, the mutation of the human species as the
direct or indirect result of the technological revolution. It&#146;s only fitting that his
perspective on virtual reality is at least as concerned with the physical effects as the
mental.</big></p>

<p>For a man whose muse has consistently led him down a solitary path, it&#146;s ironic to
see <i>eXistenZ</i> emerge in a small pack of film loosely tied in subject matter, though
Cronenberg&#146;s tale is in a very different universe from the video game kinetics of <i>The
Matrix</i>. Where that gave us heroes in the form of buff, bald Obi Wan Larry Fishburne
and hunky web-surfer dude Keanu Reeves as cyber-warriors in a landscape of glass and
steel, Cronenberg offers frumpy, self conscious Jennifer Jason Leigh as &quot;game pod
goddess&quot; Allegra Geller, a normally reclusive designer, and lowly company flack
turned security guard for the night Ted Pikul (Jude Law). (You can tell Cronenberg is back
to writing his own films just by the great names!) Allegra is making a rare public
appearance in a carefully controlled situation (a select group of rabid gamers in a rural
church) to test her newest work in progress, a game that draws from psyches of its players
to create a complex virtual world where a role playing game unfolds. Deep into a
trancelike state and at her most vulnerable, an assassin shoots Allegra with a deliciously
Cronenberg construct (I won&#146;t spoil the surprise except it uses organic materials to
slip past weapon detectors -- right down bullets with a real bite) and Ted leaps up to
rush her out the door and into the night.</p>

<p>Allegra has become the target in a &quot;fatwa&quot; that may be the work of a rival
corporation out to cripple the competition, or a faceless underground group of anti-gaming
guerrillas out to make the world safe for reality. Yet all she&#146;s concerned with is
finding a safe place to play her game. She says it&#146;s merely to make sure pod survived
the attack since the only copy of this potentially multi-million dollar game is housed in
her cooing little bio-pod (an organic piece of technology that&#146;s as much flesh as
machine), but it becomes clear that game reality is more interesting to her than life, no
matter how pressing any network of assassins might seem. Ted, a gaming virgin, reluctantly
becomes her partner, but only after he gets his own bio-port implanted -- and for that
they find your friendly neighborhood black market plug-in artist, a slow talking gas
station proprietor named, what else, Gas (Willem Dafoe). From about this point on Allegra
and Ted find themselves fugitives in a sprawling conspiracy (there&#146;s a $5 million
bounty on her head), yet continue to plug into the game as if it provides some clues to
their predicament. And perhaps it does: elements from &quot;real life&quot; (such as her
mentor, a cranky bio-designer played by Ian Holm who hides her away in his ski lodge)
intrude on their game, and characters from the game (namely a collection of curious
figures played by Canadian actors Don McKellar, Callum Keith Rennie and Sarah Polley, who
may or may not be on their side) seem to cross into the real world. The whole issue
between what&#146;s real and what&#146;s &quot;only a game&quot; melts in a series of
coincidences and cross-reality connections. &quot;He&#146;s only a game character,&quot;
Allegra remarks after killing someone. &quot;What if he&#146;s real?&quot; counters Ted.
And how would we the audience know?</p>

<p>Cronenberg&#146;s first original screenplay since <i>Videodrome</i> puts us back into
his special brand of science fiction: the sexualization of all sensory experience,
bio-technology that fuses flesh with mechanics in a creation as much evolutionary mutation
as science, murky conspiracies, disease, mutation, and the shifting dimensions of
realities. eXistenZ is a virtual reality game so realistic is threatens to become real, or
as Cronenberg himself describes it: &quot;It&#146;s the game made flesh.&quot; The game
pods are fleshy biomechanical creations with more than a passing resemblance to a human
breast (you start the game by tweaking the nipple) and jacked directly an artificially
created (and quite suggestive) orifice at the base of the spine through an umbilical
cord-like cable. Don&#146;t think that the sexual imagery ends there: after Ted gets his
gaming cherry popped Allegra licks her finger and sticks it into newly installed bio-port.
He sticks his tongue in hers. Suddenly going all the way has taken you into very different
territory: Cronenberg has transformed the auto-eroticism of <i>Crash</i> for virtual sex.</p>

<p>Cronenberg&#146;s reputation for so long was based not simply in crossing taboo lines,
but in creating disturbing visceral metaphors in mutated flesh and the rebellion of the
human body as some sort of revolutionary mutation. Since <i>Dead Ringers</i> he&#146;s
changed his cinematic attack somewhat, pushing the taboo transgressions into less obvious
and more insidious territory and leaving the most disturbing elements to the imagination. <i>eXistenZ</i>
is a return to form, somewhat, as it mixes the latter with the former. We still get the
gross out scenes (check out Ted&#146;s Chinese smorgasbord of mutant seafood) and
techno-weirdness (the futuristic trout farm turned genetic laboratory), but with a cool,
detached, dispassionate cinematic eye. In fact, it&#146;s a bit too detached. Like <i>Videodrome</i>,
<i>eXistenZ</i> explores the disconnection from reality, but where we were plugged into
James Woods&#146; subjective experience in a visceral way, Cronenberg here makes us
observers rather than players in this game. The detachment helps us navigate through the
big picture, fish out the clues dropped through the layering of realities, and gives us a
stance that makes good narrative sense by the conclusion. But we lose any connection with
the characters: it&#146;s hard to get involved -- and when the film is so much a role
playing cyber-game come to life you need that involvement. Otherwise the film is about
sifting through the code, deciphering the symbolic landscape, and putting together the
narrative puzzle. Which is a fine exercise of a film, but hardly a riveting piece of
cinematic art.</p>
<i>

<p>eXistenZ</i> is brilliantly crafted -- every element fuses into a self referential
whole that needs to be re-examined by the irony-laden conclusion -- but for a film that
tackles the disconnection from reality it becomes so disconnected that there finally is no
baseline. Reality is so much a matter of perspective that it ultimately may have no place
in <i>eXistenZ</i>. Cronenberg has removed himself from the creepy onscreen doings so much
that we&#146;re just a little too comfortable. Where&#146;s the discomfort we&#146;ve come
to know, dread, and love?</p>
