<p><big><strong><big>E</big></strong>ver have one of those days? I'm not referring to a
merely &quot;bad day&quot;-- we all have those on occasion, and in the end things usually
work out okay. No, I'm talking about the kind of day where the universe itself seems to be
on a personal vendetta against you; when life flings catastrophe at you like bread crumbs
at a duck pond; when you'd give anything to be having ONLY a &quot;bad day.&quot;</big></p>

<p><i><img src="Images/rootowners-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="146"></i>Henry
Clark (Steve Martin) isn't merely having one of those days; he's having one of those <i>lives</i>.
He no longer knows how to relate to Nancy (Goldie Hawn), his wife of twenty-four years.
His daughter has dropped out of medical school to pursue an acting career. He's recently
been fired from his job, although he's afraid to tell Nancy. And his son Alan (Oliver
Hudson, the real-life son of Goldie Hawn) is about to move to London, which will leave the
house empty except for Henry and his wife... a thought which terrifies the couple, since
they will now be forced to communicate with each other. So when Henry gets an interview
with an advertising firm in New York City, a land of golden opportunities, he and Nancy
think it may be a sign that their luck is about to change. They are correct: it's about to
get much, much worse.</p>

<p>The trip starts off with a bad omen: their plane is rerouted to Boston due to heavy
fog, an event which will eventually result in Henry and Nancy arriving in the Big Apple
with no money, no credit, no food, no clothes, no patience, and no idea how to resolve
their predicament. From this moment on, <i>The Out-of-Towners</i> shifts gears into
slapstick comedy while a never-ending string of disasters besets our weary, hungry couple:
Rest assured that anytime Henry or Nancy enter a new locale, something horrible is about
to happen to them. I sighed. Since the film seemed to be in the process of settling into a
rut of cheap comedic payoff, my expectations plummeted.</p>

<p>But a funny thing happened on the way to the lowest common denominator: Henry and Nancy
came to life on the screen! I found that against all logic, I was actually becoming
interested in the fate of our two lead characters, and started cheering for them to
triumph over their circumstances. Credit Martin and Hawn, last seen together in 1992's <i>Housesitter</i>,
for possessing a plethora of screen chemistry and the ability to rise above a screenplay
that has no sense of restraint. Somehow, their characters find the time to experience the
beauty and pulse of New York, despite all the wretchedness they're going through. This
could be the reason I liked them so much: I'm dreadfully tired of movies in which the
people do nothing but whine.</p>

<p>Director Sam Weisman (<i>George of the Jungle</i>) repeatedly stages the movie's most
intimate moments in public places: in hotel lobbies, on sidewalks, in Central Park, on
crowded airplanes, etc. It's an interesting choice, perhaps intending to reflect an urban
culture in which privacy is a privilege, not a right. Through Henry and Nancy's public
displays of emotion (both good and bad), we understand and identify with the frustrations
of these two wonderful people. Hawn brings a fiery streak to Nancy, giving her an
impressive dramatic flair (I liked the scene in which she attempts to seduce a businessman
(Mark McKinney) in a madcap plan to obtain some food), while Martin has imbued the
loveable Henry with the fierce sense of sarcasm he (Martin) displayed so hilariously in <i>The
Muppet Movie</i>. For example, during an exchange with an auto-rental clerk:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <i><b><p>CLERK:</b></i> &quot;Our cars are very safe. They practically drive
    themselves.&quot;</p>
    <i><b><p>HENRY:</b></i> &quot;That's great.&quot;</p>
    <i><b><p>CLERK:</b></i> &quot;Would like you collision insurance?&quot;</p>
    <i><b><p>HENRY:</b></i> (trying not to go ballistic) &quot;If the car drives itself,
    wouldn't any accident be its fault?&quot;</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<i>

<p></i><img src="Images/rootowners-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="146"><i>Monty
Python's</i> John Cleese is also wonderfully evil in his extended cameo as Mr. Mersault, a
snooty hotel clerk whose driving passion seems to be making the Clarks' lives miserable.</p>
<i>

<p>The Out-of-Towners</i> is based on Arthur Miller's 1970 film of the same name, which
starred Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis in the lead roles. I haven't seen the original movie,
and have no idea how faithful this version is to it, but I must admit that I had a good
time. The cast is absolutely wonderful, the dialogue has teeth, and if the film
occasionally borders on absurdity, then hey, so does life.</p>
<i>

<p>The Out-of-Towners</i> is marvelous fun, and I laughed both loudly and often. And how
wonderful to see a romantic comedy that has the guts to cast two middle-age actors in the
lead roles! The way Hollywood seems to make movies, one would think that all hormones
magically evaporate from the human body around age 35. Kudos to someone for telling it
like it is.</p>
