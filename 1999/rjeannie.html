<p><big><strong><big>A</big></strong> modern-day attempt to capture the magic of Hollywood
musicals in general and the spirit of Jacques Demy&#146;s twin flights of fancy <i>The
Umbrellas of Cherbourg</i> <i>and The Young Girls of Rochefort</i> in particular, this
unique item adds a strong dollop of social activism to the lyrical premise and features a
tough yet vulnerable performance from the magical Virginie Ledoyen (seen briefly in the
Merchant-Ivory <i>A Soldier&#146;s Daughter Never Cries</i> and Leonardo DiCaprio&#146;s
love interest in the upcoming <i>The Beach</i>). Yet for all its obvious sincerity and
genuine guile, the magic of <i>Jeanne and the Perfect Guy</i> remains just out of reach, a
goal as tantalizing yet elusive as the idea of a perfect love unblemished by the cruel
realities of day-to-day life.</big></p>

<p>A free-spirited and cheeerfully promiscuous young Parisian given to alternating bouts
of girlishness and snobbishness, Jeanne (Ledoyen) is a receptionist at the Jet Tour travel
agency. An equal opportunity lover, Jeanne&#146;s involved in affairs with both conceited
agency executive Jean-Baptiste and a lowly delivery boy -- both of whom, of course, are
far more lovestruck than she is.</p>

<p>One day Jeanne meets Olivier (Mathieu Demy) on a subway car. Smitten, the make love on
the empty train, but this time there&#146;s a difference: Jeanne just knows that Olivier
is the perfect guy. When they meet again later (outside a sold-out screening of -- what
else -- Springtime in Paris), Olivier reveals that a past drug addiction has left him HIV
positive. &quot;We used a condom, didn&#146;t we?&quot; says Jeanne by way of acceptance.
Yet when Olivier disappears after being discharged from the hospital following a collapse,
Jeanne must learn to go on without him</p>

<p>Much of the film is set against the backdrop of city-wide Act-Up demonstrations, with
activist Francois (Jacques Bonnaffe) serving as a mysterious link between the lovers.</p>

<p>What the movie does best is duplicate the mid-1960s architecture and space of the Demy
films and vintage Jacques Tati, so that in the early reels when passersby and extras begin
to glide into step for impromptu musical numbers in the buildings and streets of Paris,
the effect is genuinely magical. Fine too is a scene in which the lovers sing to each
other nude on a bed, a sequence as bold as it is jarring (would Demy ever have done a
similar shot?). </p>

<p>Also noteworthy are the subjects of the songs themselves, which include not only the
dual themes of love and disease, but a tuneful lament by immigrant custodians in the
building which houses the travel agency and even an ode to Tsing-Tao beer tossed off while
Jeanne lunches.</p>

<p>There are, in fact, some strong connections to Demy&#146;s work. His son Mathieu&#146;s
performance as Olivier is touching without being particularly deep, while co-director
Olivier Ducastel was the sound editor on <i>Trois places pour le 26</i> (1989),
Demy&#146;s final feature (<i>Jeanne</i> marks the classically trained Jacques
Martineau&#146;s first foray into film). &quot;I&#146;m wild about Demy&#146;s
films,&quot; Duscatel says in this movie&#146;s presskit. &quot;Though I appreciate
American musicals, sometimes they bore me a little, perhaps because their primary goal is
sheer entertainment. One can sing about tragedy in opera, why not in musicals?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Think before you act,&quot; admonishes a pensioner during the course of this
eccentric movie, and that throwaway line may sum up the uneasy and ultimately cold reality
of <i>Jeanne and the Perfect Guy</i>: in a world capable of producing that deadly virus,
the strength to sing and dance in the face of the epidemic takes more energy than some
mortals possess. </p>
