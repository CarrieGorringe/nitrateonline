<p><big><strong><big>T</big></strong>his is a marketing gem, in part due to hot young
James Van Der Beek of WB TV&#146;s Dawson&#146;s Creek, a tired, er, tried but true plot
line; the monstrous push of co-producer MTV (along with distributor Paramount Pictures,
subsidiaries of mega-media conglomerate Viacom); and a soundtrack featuring a virtual
who&#146;s who of popular music talent: Loudmouth, Green Day, Foo Fighters, Collective
Soul, Fastball, Third Eye Blind, Janice Stark, Van Halen, and Simon Says. Yipes! The star
is also hosting Saturday Night Live over opening weekend, so expect those demographically
important teens to push this film close to the top in the short run. From a critical point
of view, this is cheap zirconium garbage. A flawed piece combining the baser elements of <i>Porky&#146;s</i>
and just about every bad sports picture of the last decade. At a preview, unruly teen
girls were screaming and yakking during the whole film, their feet hanging over seats and
bubble gum cracking. Me, I was cringing. I should have left at half time.</big></p>

<p><img src="Images/rvarsity-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="168">Director Brian
Robbins has gone from one meat to another. His &quot;family&quot; comedy <i>Good Burger</i>
(1997) trades beefsteak for oversized or muscle (-bound or -brained, take your pick) hunks
pondering their next score (on field and off) in the close-knit Texas town of West Canaan,
Texas, where football is religion and Coach Bud Kilmer (no relation to Val, who has his
own problems with <i>At First Sight</i>) has been god to the Coyotes for 35 years. As
played by Jon Voight, its another of his nastier roles, mixing together his crazed <i>Anaconda</i>
riff, his role as a overbearing cop in <a href="../rgeneral.html" target="_top"><i>The General</i></a>
(minus the Irish accent), and his over-the-top shenanigans in <i>Enemy of the State</i>.
Think of Nick Nolte&#146;s megalomaniacal role in <a href="rredline.html" target="_top"><i>The Thin Red
Line</i></a> dumbed down and steroid-addled for high school consumption.</p>

<p>On the way to his team&#146;s bazillionth state title, abusive Coach Kilmer pushes his
billboard-size star quarterback Lance Harbor (Paul Walker) over the brink. Too many pain
numbing shots cause a season and perhaps career ending injury, prompting brainy second
stringer Jonathan &quot;Mox&quot; Moxon (Van Der Beek) to move his butt off the bench
(where he reads Vonnegut instead of the play book) into instant celebrityhood with a
clutch victory for the home team. Quick cut to required T&amp;A and beer party scenes.
Rah, rah, blah.</p>

<p>And so it goes.</p>

<p><img src="Images/rvarsity-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="168">Basically the tale
of a handful of Lone Star football jocks and their trials and tribulations with their
hard-headed coach, their thinly-drawn parents (the fathers, of course, all having suffered
for under Kilmer&#146;s despotic reign years earlier), and their girl friends (Amy Smart
and Ali Larter, the latter featured as Darcy, future spokesperson for the Whipped Cream
Council of America). Aside from the QBs there are bubbly Billy Bob (Ron Lester, a.k.a.
&quot;Spatch,&quot; the burger-flipping cook in <i>Good Burger</i>), a big ole boy whose
repulsive culinary tastes might cause a wretching fit for more susceptible audiences;
Tweeder (Scott Caan, son of James), a rascal who hijacks a police car and drives around
naked; and Wendell (newcomer Eliel Swinton), whose dreams of NFL stardom seem dashed by
Kilmer&#146;s bigoted nature. As for Mox (rhymes with obNOXious), he&#146;s heading for a
scholastic scholarship at Brown and is looking to put his boring family behind him,
particularly younger brother Kyle (Joe Pichler) who examines his inner religious being by
dressing up as Jesus on the cross or a Malcolm X. Voight hell-raising antics might send
him back into semi-retirement, but the character is so unbelievably written, I have more
pity for him than shame.</p>

<p>Hollywood has it&#146;s Oscars, New York the Emmies, and Texas has high school
football. Director Robbins was featured ten years ago in the ABC sitcom &quot;Head of the
Class.&quot; He&#146;s still stuck in high school, pampering to the testosterone- obsessed
crowd. <i>Varsity Blues</i> forces a fumble on the big screen and a game ending penalty
for offensive behavior. If you&#146;re a hyperactive, oversexed teenager, go and
&quot;enjoy&quot; <i>Varsity Blues</i>. Anyone else in need a football fix, the Super Bowl
is just around the corner, or rent <a href="../rwaterboy.htm" target="_top"><i>The Waterboy</i></a> from
your local video outlet. Frankly, this is one forgettable film.</p>
