<p>As the Universal logo melts into the blazing desert sun, we learn a quick pre-Clinton
lesson in 1290 BC Egyptian political intrigue that brings the wrath of Pharaoh (Aharon
Ipale) and his gold-painted bodyguards down on his trusted high priest Imhotep (Arnold
Vosloo) for dallying with his leader&#146;s mistress. <img src="Images/rmummy-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="198" HEIGHT="99">This pyramidal no-no leaves a sour taste on the
cleric&#146;s tongue (what&#146;s left of it, that is), particularly since he is forced to
share his coffin with scores of hungry, flesh-eating scarabs. Ooh, icky. Left alone for
more than three millennia until the mid-1920s, he has plenty of time to contemplate what
plague-filled vengeance he will bestow on those who refuse to believe that some things are
left better dead. American soldier of fortune Rick O&#146;Connell unearths the
sand-covered remains of the treasure-laden fortress of Hamunaptra, the &quot;City of the
Dead,&quot; but along for the unveiling of this Pandora&#146;s box are a motley crew of
disbeliever&#146;s, bickering rivals, American cowboys, a slimy Cairo prison warden (Omid
Djalili) and Rick&#146;s associates -- siblings Jonathan (<i>Sliding Doors&#146;</i> John
Hannah), a mischievously drunken simpleton, and the bookishly fetching Evelyn Carnavon
(Rachel Weisz), a clumsy librarian who later proves that the resurrected mummy forgot to
renew his library card and has a hefty fine to pay. Also on hand are Jonathan Hyde as an
Egyptologist modeled after the actor&#146;s smarmy roles in <i>Titanic</i> and <i>Anaconda</i>,
and Kevin J. O&#146;Connor as Beni, a dentally-challenged Arab guide who provides adequate
comic relief as Imhotep&#146;s Renfieldesque sidekick recklessly searching for gold
treasures when he instead should be on the lookout for a good dentist. Taking a watchful
eye are the secretive, nomadic guardians of the city (another cinematic theft) who provide
swordplay and absurd dialogue (&quot;The creature remains undiscovered.&quot;) in their
unsuccessful attempt to keep the intruders from their drifts.</p>

<p>Director Stephen Sommers keeps the action larger than life, the characters&#146;
tongues safely in their cheeks, and the effects wide screen and mind-boggling, something
he couldn&#146;t do at all in 1998&#146;s dreadful <i>Deep Rising</i>. For such a large
budget ($80 million), you certainly see every penny up there, even if his script is laden
with clichés. One episode that drew a roar of laughter came after Evelyn inadvertently
revives the mummy by reading from the book of the dead only to be warned, too late, not to
read it aloud. A member of the preview audience, not missing a beat, let out a loud
&quot;Oops!&quot; that had us chuckling for a minutes.</p>

<p><img src="Images/rmummy-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="100">Chills and thrills
abound in this loudly scored (by Jerry Goldsmith) production with heavy use of
choral/chant flourishes. Beautifully photographed on exotic locations in Morocco by Adrian
Biddle, with kudos to the production design team and the extensive visual effects wizards
that send fireballs crashing, water-turned-to-blood flowing, and boobies into their
assorted traps. The undead priest scurries about in essence-sucking episodes that restore
Imhotep to his former, bald-headed glory, although his juicy, visceral appearance as he
regenerates himself throughout the second half of the film may turn quite a few stomachs.
He&#146;s a shifty mummy on an evil mission, particularly one weighty halitosis roar that
gives new meaning to the words &quot;bad breath.&quot;</p>

<p>All rip-roaring things considers, <i>The Mummy</i> is probably the nicest present you
could give mama box office this weekend. Happy Mother&#146;s Day!</p>
