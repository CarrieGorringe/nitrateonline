<p><big><strong><big>A</big></strong>utumn Tale</i> benefits greatly from two paradoxes,
and the first is writer-director Eric Rohmer. Of the original band of French New Wave
revolutionaries, his narrative and visual styles are easily the least conspicuous, so much
so that his work turns out to be completely distinct and recognizable. Rohmer's
naturalistic films are slices of everyday life and treated precisely as such - very little
of earth-shattering consequence occurs, and what does transpire is delicately handled with
a carefree, matter-of-fact lightness. They are more loosely told anecdotes than carefully
structured works of drama, and while his emotionally acute eye may be too modest to
shatter your world, at the very least you&#146;ll feel as if you&#146;re getting an honest
look at it. </big></p>

<p>And it's that emotional honesty which clears the way for paradox number two. <i>Autumn
Tale</i>, the last of a quartet of season-titled Rohmer films, is a story of middle-aged
adults behaving like children, in ways that are so endearing and so emotionally complex
and so real that they come across as far more adult than most Hollywood grown-up
characters. As usual, Rohmer is examining an aspect of love, and this time it is in the
meeting place where friendship love and romantic love share a buss on the cheek. Isabelle
(Marie Riviere) and Magali (Beatrice Romand) are lifelong best friends, but there&#146;s a
hole in the relationship. Magali, a fiercely independent workaholic who runs her own
vineyard, is without a man. Magali feels that most of the good men are taken, and she
doesn&#146;t have a clue as how to find one of the few that may remain. Isabelle wants to
help, but Magali finds her suggestion of a personal ad repulsive. Lucky for Magali, she
has another close friend, her son&#146;s girlfriend Rosine (Alexandria Portal). Rosine
feels such a strong connection to Magali that she considers that relationship more defined
by love than her supposedly romantic pairing with Magali&#146;s son. So she too wants to
help Magali fill her void, and she has the perfect choice -- her much older ex-boyfriend,
ex-professor Etienne (Didier Sandre). </p>

<p>Rosine&#146;s plan fits into Rohmer&#146;s scheme in interesting ways, in that Rosine
wants to stay friends with Etienne, but feels she cannot do so as long as he is free
romantically - it&#146;s too complicated otherwise. So for her, it&#146;s the perfect
solution, her two closest friends happy, attached, and liberated from romantic need. Even
more compelling is where Rohmer takes Isabelle, as she does her own work for Magali on the
sly. She places a personal ad, listing Magali&#146;s interests and emotional
characteristics as her own, and decides to find a man for Magali herself. This means
actually dating one, and for a moment, it appears that Rohmer&#146;s acuteness may have
left him. Isabelle dates Gerald (Alain Libolt), and at first she shows no signs of
realizing the potential complications that could come from having a man fall for the
picture of one woman only to have it abruptly replaced with another. The fear is that
Rohmer doesn&#146;t realize it either, but he summarily wipes out any apprehensions as he
takes the odd relationship between Isabelle and Gerald to a delightfully tricky, tangled
place. </p>

<p>As is customary with Rohmer, he exhibits a particularly impressive interest and
understanding of women, and he&#146;s using two of his favorite actresses here.
Riviere&#146;s cool, delicate elegance finds in Isabelle some unspoken emotional
complexities, while Romand embodies the earthier Magali with a touching stubbornness.
Magali&#146;s ache over living in a world where she feels aged past the prime of being
attractive to men takes on an even deeper poignancy, in that Romand, in her ingenue days,
played for Rohmer one of the young temptresses of Claire&#146;s Knee twenty seven years
ago. And the men are no slouches either, especially Libolt, who in dealing with both of
these women displays an endearing befuddlement over what exactly he&#146;s gotten himself
into. </p>

<p>Rohmer expertly juggles all of these relationship balls in the air, and only increases
their speed as he moves the film into its quaintly farcical set-piece, a wedding attended
by all of the characters. Two women looking to help Magali find love, two men hoping, to
different degrees, to provide it. Rohmer sets up a delightful situation of multiple points
of view where missed communications and deeply connected communications emerge in rapid
succession. As the suavely self-confident Etienne and the mousier Gerald lurk around the
reception waiting to see how Magali takes to them, each unaware of the other and with
Magali only aware of one, Autumn Tale reaches heights of unassumingly giddy, childlike
romantic wonder that something similarly-minded like Nora Ephron&#146;s slicker <i>You&#146;ve
Got Mail</i> never even approaches. And that is in spite of - or actually, because of -
the latter film expending much more noticeable effort to please the audience. It is the
quintessential Rohmerian paradox, from which so many Hollywood hacks could take a lesson.
Less, especially in matters of the heart, truly can be more. </p>
