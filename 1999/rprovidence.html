genial though typical coming-of-age movie, <i>Outside Providence</i> lacks the
precise character touches that would allow the display of much aging. That may
be because the movie was born from the minds of the infinitely juvenile Farrelly
brothers, responsible for such filmed whoopee cushions as <i>Dumb and Dumber</i>,
<i>Kingpin</i>, and <i>There's Something About Mary</i>. <i>Outside Providence</i>,
based on Peter Farrelly's semi-autobiographical novel, sits well outside this
field, though at many times it seems eager to join the more randy crowd. There's
a shot early on of a one-eyed, three-legged dog, and you can be sure that
somewhere in the Farrelly mental landscape they were itching to have it dig up
its fourth leg out of a pile of its own feces in the backyard. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">But
the brothers have practiced some welcome restraint here, and they've hired
fellow Rhode Island filmmaker Nicholas Corrente to help them stay grounded. The
guiding force behind the studio mishandled <i>Federal Hill</i> and the unjustly
ignored adaptation of Mamet's <i>American Buffalo</i>, Corrente has an enjoyably
light, unadorned touch, but he's often fighting the less sensitive sensibilities
of his source material. Since the story is essentially about teenagers, however,
the more prurient tendencies of the Farrelly's feel right at home, up to a
certain point. Tim Dunphy (a solid Shawn Hatosy), known as Dunph to his friends
and Dildo to his blue collar widower dad (Alec Baldwin), is a directionless
hippie, minus the ideals, who spends a whole lot of his time in 1974 Pawtucket,
Rhode Island smoking weed with his pals. His father, more out of weary
impatience than interest in his son's well-being, sends the kid to a Connecticut
boarding school for a year to keep him out of trouble. Dunph, being as
good-hearted but misguided as he is, has little trouble finding trouble in
Connecticut. But he also finds romance, with an upper class beauty named Jane
(Amy Smart) from the neighboring girl's school, and a push towards
responsibility. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">That's
pretty much the standard blueprint for a teen coming of age story, and Corrente
does a nice job of injecting some measure of life into it. Using a predictable
but undeniably evocative soundtrack of vintage 70's tunes and a measured pace
that nicely captures the alternately overcast and vibrant New England autumn, <i>Outside
Providence</i> remains enjoyably likable despite its shortcomings. Corrente is
fighting an uphill battle with the Farrelly's thinly conceived characters and
slapdash relationships, portraying Dunph's and Jane's budding love with a couple
frisbee-throwing montages, and the older characters, most notably Alec Baldwin's
ultra-gruff Old Man Dunph, within an uncomfortable limbo between caricature and
sincerity. Supporting characters float in an out with little purpose, and plot
threads arrive and retreat with a sometimes thudding awkwardness. Along with
Corrente's unmannered direction, Hatosy does an admirable job of keeping a
straight face throughout, even during the comic moments, and gives the movie as
much human truth as he can squeeze out of the limited material. As admirable it
is of the Farrelly's to attempt a minor sabbatical from their meal ticket of
Grand Canyon-broad gag comedy for something more modest and emotionally honest,
their script doesn't have the depth to support its more serious moments.
Narrative modesty requires a more finely tuned eye for human behavior - if
you're going to give your audience so little amount of ground traveled, you have
to be able to dig deeper into the people taking the shorter journey. <i>Outside
Providence</i> takes the sort of storytelling baby steps that necessitate, on
the part of the storyteller, growing up.</span></p>
