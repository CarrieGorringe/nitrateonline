<p class="MsoBodyText"><font size="5"><b>I</b></font><font size="4">n this
heartfelt, engaging, yet ultimately unfulfilling, effort to perpetuate the myth
that was Andy Kaufman, director Milos Forman pushes the cinematic envelope to
blur the outrageously unique character of the late entertainer with the
larger-than-life capabilities the silver screen can afford the whimsical legacy
that surrounded one of the 1970’s and 1980’s most bizarre comedians. That
point is driven home at ground zero, as the film blasts off with a
black-and-white image of Andy, played with a take-no-prisoners bravado by Jim
Carrey, his eyes darting around his face like loose atoms on the verge of
explosion, and his voice quivering in that obscure yet instantly recognizable
foreign dialect. He issues a semi-determined vocal disclaimer that the movie is
terrible. Vowing to cut all the baloney, he announces the film is ending.
Reminiscent of Matthew Broderick’s post-credit, exit-pointing at the
conclusion of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Ferris Bueller’s Day Off</i>,
while at the same time borrowing from one of Kaufman’s many scandalous
concoctions, patrons may wonder why they plunked down big holiday bucks for a
short subject. As the final credits immediately start to scroll, the audience is
dared to escape what will soon become a two-hour tribute to my peer
generation’s Rasputin.</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Stick around.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Dissolving from his Long Island childhood, where a
pre-teen Andy tries to charm the baseballs and bats out of the sports figures
that decorate his bedroom wallpaper, to his first, disastrous attempts at
small-time improvisation, we begin to see the schizophrenic identities
developing from the inner recesses of a warped mind. His fretful parents and
siblings put up with his “boy who cried wolf” shenanigans through to the
very end, never fully understanding his demented artistic inspiration. Many
viewers, especially those who never heard of or cared about (especially the
latter) the performer’s unorthodox, torture-chamber parody, will undoubtedly
lose something in Forman’s relatively straightforward, jam-packed translation.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Along from that disturbingly funny comedy club start is
George Shapiro, Andy’s devoted manager from 1975 until his death. Danny DeVito,
who wears one of the several producer hats (along with his Jersey Films cohorts
Michael Shamberg and Stacey Sher), plays the role against type, while at the
same time grabbing from his own recollections portraying petty tyrant Louie De
Palma opposite Andy as Latka Gravas, the fractured mechanic, on the set of the
five-year cross-network sitcom <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Taxi</i>.
Recreating the set and appearing as themselves are age-defying regulars Judd
Hirsch, Christopher Lloyd, Marilu Henner, Carol Kane, Jeff Conaway, and Randall
Carver. No, DeVito doesn’t appear as himself in these segments. Ugly American
lounge-lizard- from-Hell Tony Clifton (according to press material, he’s now
resides in a retirement community in Lake Tahoe, Nevada), one of the masterful,
mysterious performance art creations dreamed up by Kaufman and frequent
collaborator Bob Zmuda (Paul Giamatti), makes his short-lived television debut
before a stunned cast and crew. He reappears from time to time, and provides a
fitting, enigmatic postscript late in the picture.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Whether doing his own “Mighty Mouse” routine on <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Saturday
Night Live</i>, the Tony Clifton gigs, or the extended 236-lb. pro wrestler
Jerry Lawler (who plays himself) inter-gender wrestling gag, the brilliant
insanity is unhinged by writers Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, creators
of the offbeat biopic <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Ed Wood</i> and
Forman’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The People vs. Larry Flynt</i>
fame. According to the seemingly truth-based script (using 300 pages of taped
conversations between George Shapiro and his client, as well as dozens of
interviews), Kaufman never thought of himself as a comedian; he was more of a
conniving manipulator, pushing his fans and detractors alike to the limit, but
acting the spoiled brat when their expectations of him weren’t met. This is
instanced by Kaufman’s lengthy reading, in British accent, of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
Great Gatsby </i>before a expectant, then ruefully bored, crowd of Arizona State
college students. Which doesn’t mean Andy wasn’t funny—in his own
childish, immature way. There’s an air of innocence hovering overhead, but
there’s also an impish devil lurking beneath his surface.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The filmmakers constantly evoke the Guerrilla-theater
antics of the star with a bludgeon-like, spit-in-your-face precision. The
film-watching audience squirms watching their celluloid counterparts fidget with
nervous laughter. For those of us familiar with the times and the person, we can
laugh along. Thank goodness Forman is a director of high quality, and even this
lesser attempt is a better-than-average effort, but one, alas, that will
probably end up a footnote rather than a trophy, like his <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Amadeus</i>
and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest</i>, on his mantle.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Filling out the thespian bill is Courtney Love, back
again as the main love interest for Forman, but with only momentary glimpses
during the second hour. At first, she’s a loser in the wrestling ring, then
she’s asked by Andy to wear his wedding ring, only to be duped at ringside
during the initial stages of Andy’s anti-women, anti-South brouhaha developing
out of Memphis, the wrestling capital of the world.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">One of the more Pyrrhic recreations is Kaufman’s
“happening” appearance on ABC’s late night comedy-variety show <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Fridays</i>,
with Andy’s refusal to participate in a drug sketch and the anarchy, initial
and secondary, that follows.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">While mostly centering on the star’s edgy lunacy and
command for behavior science (I keep envisioning him a sort of comic test tube),
the film turns slightly serious when he is diagnosed with a rare form of lung
cancer that will kill him within five years. With Kaufman nothing seemed that
serious, and it was nigh well impossible for his friends and family to believe
the joke’s on him. The ineffectiveness of the chemotherapy prods him to seek
out alternative cures, including a final laugher in the Philippines, but years
before he made his final exit, he pulled off a heart-stopper at Carnegie Hall
before his adoring fans and now-resigned family, showing how often he could
reinvent himself.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The film’s infatuation with honestly with resurrecting
the idiosyncratic nature of a true genius, albeit one who could just as easily
shoot himself in the foot and bleed over his audience, will probably be it’s
undoing. Andy Kaufman will still a comedy minor leaguer, a brief ironic blip,
and it seems in death Forman gives him what he rarely got in life: a truly
rousing, standing ovation.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">For the curious, some of the people portrayed in the film
appear in other roles: George Shapiro is a disgruntled club owner who cans Andy
at the start of his career, while his partner Howard West pops up as a snobby
ABC executive. The real Bob Zmuda pops up briefly, too.</p>
