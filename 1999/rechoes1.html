<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="5"><b>I</b></font><font size="4">n a sudden,
quiet moment of reflection, Tom Witsky (Kevin Bacon), a rough-hewn blue-collar
husband and father, assures his wife Maggie (Kathryn Erbe) that the higher
aspirations with which he courted her was not some line of bull - he really
believes he’ll make something more of himself, someday. We know we’re about
to watch a suspense chiller, and this early moment of small, poignant
vulnerability hints at something richer, a suspense chiller with more than just
the broadest of life and death stakes. But <i>Stir of Echoes</i>, the latest
entry in this year of the ghost story, favors the route of the all-too-normal
paranormal.</font></p>

Tom, Maggie, and their four or five-year-old son Jake (an exceptionally natural
Zachary David Cope) live in a modest rented townhouse near Maggie’s more
educated sister Lisa (Illeana Douglas). One night at a party, Lisa, who happens
to believe in things like astrology and psychic power, goads Tom into being a
recipient of hypnosis. He doesn’t believe in it, at least not until Lisa is
through with him. He comes out of his trance with a new appreciation for the
concept, and with a recurrence of flashing, nightmarish visions that show him
something his son Jake has seen and interacted with all along - the restless
ghost of a girl angrily residing in their home. <o:p>

This is obviously similar in premise to the recent <i>Sixth Sense</i>, though <i>Stir
of Echoes </i>doesn’t make itself as much a slave to plot twists as its
predecessor. In fact, <i>Stir of Echoes</i> lays most of cards right out on the
table, drawing suspense from its withholding of the backstory rather than
anything with much direct effect on the film’s present. That presents
writer-director David Koepp with a specific problem that he never quite tackles
- how to give the film a strong sense of urgency. The place Koepp needed to
look, the place where he does look but to little avail, is within the character
of Tom. <i>Stir of Echoes</i> is based on a novel by Richard Matheson, and the
story seems tailor-made for the page in ways it is not for cinema. The story’s
real vitality takes place inside Tom’s fragile mindset, but Koepp is unable to
properly track his tricky psychological meltdown, which travels awkwardly from
abject fear to obsessive determination. He also has a difficult time keeping his
main character a vital part of his main plot line. The fact of the matter is
that Tom’s main purpose in the story is to uncover the truth behind a past
event he had absolutely nothing to do with. Koepp strains hard to connect
Tom’s early emotional openness to his later state of mind, but it feels a bit
trite to qualify such a fantastical situation, the mission assigned to him by
the ghostly girl, as a personal confidence builder. <o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">But Bacon gets his hands dirty
playing the part, and makes the herky-jerky physical and emotional movements of
his character riveting despite the inability of the film to get very deep inside
his head. Watching him dig up his own yard and house like a madman recalls the
self-destructive force of Harry Caul in Coppola’s <i>The Conversation</i>,
which in turn brings to mind the ability of that prior psychological masterpiece
to do what <i>Stir of Echoes</i> cannot. Koepp does a nice job of delivering a
sometimes chilling atmosphere and even a few jolts, but by the time the dismally
routine, irrelevant finale plays out, it becomes clear that the story’s
foundation is the movie’s true ghost.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span><o:p>
