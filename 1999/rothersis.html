<p><big><strong><big>T</big></strong>he best laid plans often go awry. A fitting tagline
you won&#146;t see in an ads for this dreary, laborious effort. Director and co-writer
(with <i>Exit to Eden&#146;s</i> Bob Brunner) Garry Marshall may have brought prostitution
and terminal illness to the masses with <i>Pretty Woman</i> and <i>Beaches</i>, but
lightning won&#146;t strike again in this facile attempt to tell a honestly heart-warming
story of a mentally challenged child/woman caught in the hive of a dysfunctional waspy
family setting. It&#146;s as dull as a butter knife and slowed to interminable mediocrity
(think of swimming in a pool of molasses), and inadvertently brings to mind the title of
Marshall&#146;s autobiography: &quot;Wake Me When It&#146;s Funny.&quot;</big></p>

<p>Despite the high-priced talent associated with this endeavor, it&#146;s still a
one-dimensional struggle, centering around the young twenty-something Carla Tate (Juliette
Lewis) and her ongoing battles with a over-protective (to put it mildly) mother Elizabeth,
a despotic queen of the household over-played to the hilt by Diane Keaton (think Joan
Crawford doing <i>Mommie Dearest</i>). Tom Skerritt plays the reformed alcoholic,
soft-spoken, dare I say henpecked, husband to the shrew, earning the endearing sympathy of
Carla&#146;s other sisters, Caroline and Heather, one soon to be wed and the other in a
lesbian relationship that mom refuses to acknowledge. Poppy Montgomery, who made her
feature film debut in last year&#146;s dreadfully bad <i>Dead Man on Campus</i>, and Sarah
Paulson, with some movies-of-the-week experience, perform admirably in support of their
struggling sibling. Giovanni Ribisi, developing a good reputation on the big screen (<i>Saving
Private Ryan</i>) and small (as the recurring Frank Jr. on &quot;Friends&quot;) puts in a
good spin here as Danny McMahon, Carla&#146;s similarly-challenged friend and budding love
interest. The acclaimed Juliet Mills plays the &quot;understanding&quot; housekeeper in a
throw-away part that belittles her larger, previous roles. And <i>Chicago Hope&#146;s</i>
Hector Elizondo provides an amusing, albeit miniscule, spark as Danny&#146;s downstairs
neighbor and surrogate father.</p>

<p>The cast holds its own among roles that define stereotypical convention, but the film
really bogs down in its own simplistic morass, with Marshall snipping the feature into 3-5
minutes riffs, perhaps the director&#146;s misbegotten belief that the story could best be
told in sitcom mini-bytes strung together in a seemingly endless thread. I half expected
to see those inter-titles on screen that break up <i>Frasier</i>. Instead, its &quot;Carla
as a child displaying non-social behavior at the dining table,&quot; followed by &quot;A
determined Carla, ten years later, graduating from a special boarding school,&quot; then
&quot;Carla moves home to posh upper-class parental domicile,&quot; after which we have
&quot;Carla flees the queen&#146;s palace,&quot; &quot;Carla enrolls on vocational
school,&quot; etc., etc., etc. for 130 minutes, over-amplifying platitudes as the prodigal
daughter gets her own apartment and begins to test the waters of her own sexuality,
despite cold-as-ice mom&#146;s constant baiting. The few morsels of humor (all available
in the film&#146;s trailer) fail to break up the tedium. The first attempt at
cross-cutting to enliven the film (blatantly borrowed from and used as an oafish ode to <i>The
Graduate</i>), comes with just 20 minutes to go. Too little, too late.</p>

<p>All things being proper at the Tate household, poor Carla meets her match amid the
demands of her mother. Marshall hammers this taskmaster theme to death throughout the
film, as best emphasized an early scene of Carla battling a mechanical tennis ball machine
on the family&#146;s court, despite the poor creature&#146;s pleadings. Not only is Carla
smothered, but the unfortunate viewer is as well. Despite his and the producers&#146; best
intentions, it&#146;s the film and its underpinnings that are handicapped. More memorable
attempts that have succeeded are the Oscar winning <i>Rain Man</i> and <i>Sling Blade</i>,
as well as <i>What&#146;s Eating Gilbert Grape?</i> (Leonardo Di Caprio in a very
believable role and also featuring an immensely more enjoyable performance from Juliette
Lewis) and <i>David and Lisa</i>, an award-winning film nearly four decades old. Against
these classics, <i>The Other Sister</i> will fall to the bottom of its own mawkish heap,
covered in embarrassing cliches and excruciating cuteness.</p>

<p>The film&#146;s final moments showcase mother and daughter hissing off at their cozy
Sutter Hills Country Club one sun-filled afternoon. I haven&#146;t played golf in 30
years, but on any given day (a weekend no less!), what groundskeeper in his/her right mind
(and one who wants to keep his job) is going to turn on the sprinklers when the patricians
are out on the back nine?</p>

<p>Dr. Tate, admitting to being sober 8 years and 4 months at one point in the film, would
have been better off taking a sip, gathering up the remnants of his courage, and just up
and leaving the bitch who shares his castle. That&#146;s pretty much what I suggest anyone
stuck in the audience watching this somber, antiseptic effort. Pick up your coat and high
tail it back home.</p>
