<p><big><strong><big>I</big></strong>n <i>Office Space</i>, we first see Peter (Ron
Livingston), a young computer software engineer, bucking his way through morning commuter
traffic, one inch at a time. First, the lane he's in moves to a halt, so he changes to the
next lane, which looks as if it's moving faster. Then, that lane moves to a crawl while
the previous one speeds up. He changes back to the first lane, and the whole thing starts
all over again. It should come as no surprise that by the time he arrives at the office,
he's in no mood for work.</big></p>

<p>Peter's boss, Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole, who plays his part to perfection), drives his
Porsche, with vanity plates, into his personalized parking space at work, and arranges so
that, as he walks to the front entrance of the office building, he moves around the front
of the car so he can take a fleeting, self-satisfactory look at it.</p>

<p><img src="Images/rospace-3.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">Peter and his
co-workers, we find out, are each gradually being driven crazy, day in and day out, in
some particular way. Lumbergh keeps stopping by Peter's cubicle to remind him to pick up a
copy of a memo which Peter already has, right on his desktop, upon which Lumbergh
observes, nods tortoise-like, and tells Peter, before moving on, to remember to pick up a
copy of the memo they had just been discussing. Michael (David Herman) has become mortal
enemies with an office printer which consistently refuses to work properly. Samir (Ajay
Naidu) must put up with the constant spectacle and humiliation of co-workers who can never
pronounce his Arabic name correctly. And Milton (Stephen Root) vigorously defends his
right to play his portable radio from nine to eleven a.m., which he has been given
permission to do, while he goes about the task of hand collating mountains of papers
around his desk and, at the same time, being moved and moved again to ever more tinier
corners of the office. Milton's voice has dwindled, along with his usefulness and place in
the world, to not much more than a rising mutter, but he can still feel strongly, in his
own way, over things like attempts to replace his beloved Swingline stapler with one that
is of a more inferior make.</p>

<p>Then, consultants are brought in and introduced to the staff as &quot;efficiency
experts,&quot; a ploy which fools no one because everybody knows that they are actually
there to decide who's going to go and who's going to stay. One by one, the beleaguered
workers go in to meet with the smiling executioners. Tom (Richard Riehle), a thirty-year
employee, works himself into a tizzy trying to make the consultants understand why his
job, as a liaison between the customers and software makers, is absolutely necessary.
&quot;Why can't the customers talk to them themselves?&quot; the consultants reply. They
seem to be enjoying watching the workers, on the other side of the conference table,
dangling for their lives.</p>

<p><img src="Images/rospace-4.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">Over the weekend,
though, something unusual happens to Peter -- he stops worrying. Blithely but without
malice, he begins coming in to work a few hours later than he's supposed to. He dresses in
more comfortable, casual outfits. He gets rid of a doorknob that always gives him a static
shock after he walks across the carpeting. He takes a power screwdriver and loosens the
cubicle partition whose only purpose is to mask his desk from an outside view through a
window; he then leaves the partition on the floor exactly where it fell. When his turn
comes to meet with the consultants, he gladly tells them, at length, about how the office
is being ludicrously mismanaged, the employees demoralized. The consultants love the way
Peter comes across as a &quot;straight-shooter.&quot; They recommend he get a promotion.
They even recommend he get a staff to work under him. The work ethic of our fathers --
that if you work hard, you will succeed -- seems to have been turned on its head, replaced
by a miasma of fear and confusion held together by ineffective staff meetings and empty
incentive slogans directed at people who expend their time and energy -- their lives -- at
work that accomplishes nothing. Or, as one character in the film puts it, people get to
the point where they &quot;work just hard enough to not get fired.&quot;</p>

<p>Anyone who's worked in a modern office environment, or had to put up with hideously
incompetent bosses or co-workers, or been fired on a whim, will find much to identify
with, here, and I had a few good, hearty guffaws, myself, while spotting some things that
I was able to identify with too, too well. The filmmakers don't make the mistake of
dumping on everyone and everything to get their laughs (like the makers of one hugely
popular comedy did, last year). Jennifer Aniston turns up as a waitress who works at a
restaurant where the computer engineers regularly convene. Her twit of a boss keeps
stopping her to take up the issue of her on-the-job &quot;flare,&quot; or the shortage
thereof, meaning the amount of silly buttons and badges that are supposed -- nay, required
-- to be affixed to her waitress outfit. The boss always takes a circuitous route to get
to the point he wants to make, while Aniston's character waits, paralyzed and uncertain,
to find out whether he's actually meaning to tell her she's out of a job. The picture
gives us an idea of the idiocy service workers now have to put up with, too. But then,
after a dead-on build up, the worst possible thing happens: no payoff.</p>

<p>This is the first live-action feature film by Mike Judge, who created the <i>Beavis and
Butthead</i> and <i>King of the Hill</i> animated TV shows, and it comes as no surprise
that this picture is based on a series of animated short films that Judge had made
earlier. Figuring out how to sustain a feature film, though, is another matter (and this
one just barely squeaks in at under 90 minutes).Once Judge has set up all his ideas and
concepts, he can't figure out what to do with them. Instead of having Peter seize upon his
new status in the office and, with his friends and co-workers, start remaking the
workplace in such a way as to show up his old bosses for what they are, Judge sends the
main characters off on a revenge plot that becomes so paltry and nonsensical that even the
characters seem to want to be rid of it, just like the filmmakers do once they've realized
what they've done. In short, Mike Judge squanders the perfectly good opportunities in
material that he has created himself, in much the same way the characters in the film are
squandered by their inept and maddening bosses. I can think of no other recent film (<i>Snake
Eyes</i> included) that started out so promisingly and ended up being so incredibly
disappointing.</p>
