<p><big><strong><big>T</big></strong>he most audience-satisfying route to take in the
writing of funny characters is to provide laughs that arise naturally from the characters'
personalities. In something like <i>This is Spinal Tap</i>, you have three hilarious heavy
metal musicians who, through their different levels of self-deluded stupidity, deliver
plenty of laughs. By contrast, the easiest and least audience-satisfying route to comedy
is to merely slap a single outrageous attribute onto each character. That's the route
taken by <i>Drop Dead Gorgeous</i>, and it's not a fun road to travel. It's actually a
dishearteningly vicious and ugly one, populated with extraordinarily cheap, mean-spirited
jabs at middle America. Funny it is not</big>. </p>

<p><img src="Images/rdropdead-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" alt="Drop Dead Gorgeous" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="150">The premise of <i>Drop Dead Gorgeous</i> promises a cutting look
at the superficiality and catty competitiveness that drives the beauty pageant
institution, but what the film actually delivers is just a series of paper thin
caricatures. The agenda of the writer appears to be to, first, set the story in Minnesota,
so as to give all the characters a <i>Fargo</i>-like Scandinavian lilt to their speech.
The beauty of what the Coens did with the funny accent was to make it a single element of
a larger cultural persona. But <i>Drop Dead Gorgeous</i> is interested in neither
personality nor culture. It's interested in having you laugh at the mere existence of a
mentally handicapped buffoon, or an anorexic ex-pageant winner, or a sexually deviant
pageant judge, or an anti-Semitic contestant parent. This is the sort of lazy writing
performed by someone writing for the first time, who thinks any and all ostentatious
goofiness they can throw into the mix has automatic laugh value. </p>

<p>If a writer cannot muster up interesting, funny characters, the other route to laughs
is in the creation of situations built for hilarity, the level on which most sitcoms work.
But <i>Drop Dead Gorgeous</i> cannot even reach that high -- it is a film almost entirely
without situation. <img src="Images/rdropdead-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" alt="Drop Dead Gorgeous" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">It has the form of a mockumentary, like <i>Spinal Tap</i>, with a
camera crew conducting a series of interviews with the key characters, but at the same
time, it attempts to push out a conventional plot, one that's consistently jumbled and
choppy. The mockumentary angle is oddly absent of a point of view, and the only apparent
reason for adopting the form is to smooth over the writer's inability to tell a coherent
story. The basic plot line concerns the teen beauty-pageant competition between pure as
snow Amber (Kirsten Dunst) and manipulative ice queen Becky (Denise Richards), each
running with the assistance of their harpy moms (Kirstie Alley and Ellen Barkin). The
performance of Richards is the film's one bright spot, she is the one performer who
underplays her broadly written role, and she does so beautifully, delivering each line
with a chillingly detached sweetness. The rest of the actors are right in line with the
film's shallow, bargain-basement game plan. </p>
