<p><big><em><strong><big>E</big></strong>ternity and a Day</em> is a deliberately paced
drama of extraordinary physical beauty, but its human center is too vacant to resonate. </big></p>

<p>In 1988, Theo Angelopolous made a film called Landscape in the Mist, but that title is
equally appropriate for his last two films, Ulysses&#146; Gaze, and his latest, the Cannes
Film Festival winner Eternity and a Day. With both, Angelopolous shows a predilection for
large, beautiful landscapes both natural and man-made, especially those shrouded in a wet,
ghostly fog. Many of these images are admittedly stunning in their stark austerity, but
the unfortunate by-product of such large expansive beauty is the dwarfing of the human
element. Angelopolous clearly has huge ambitions, but unlike a Lean or a Kurosawa, he
isn&#146;t as able to ground his grand visions in the human specific. The landscapes in
the mist overwhelm the behavior of the human characters that populate them, and so these
films, which purport to tell entirely human stories (unlike those of say, a Stanley
Kubrick), are tinged with a frosty impersonality. </p>

<p>Eternity and a Day features an older Greek man named Alexander who is dying of some
unnamed ailment, living his last day before entering a hospital to wait out his death.
Played with a strong, quiet dignity by veteran actor Bruno Ganz (most recognizable for
Wings of Desire), Alexander takes stock of his life, and comes to some sad, unfortunate
conclusions. He was a poet who dedicated his life to finishing the work of another dead
poet, and in the process failed to pay proper attention to the living in his life. He
finds this out firsthand, when he re-examines a letter left to him by his long dead wife,
a letter that outlines one particular day where she wished he was more emotionally
present. He is stricken with the sadness of missed opportunity, and so he roams the Greek
countryside, mulling over such mistakes. In the midst (and the mist) of the mulling, he
comes across a street urchin, a young Albanian boy who is part of a group of street
urchins running from unsympathetic police and black-market orphanages looking for new
product. Alexander, in a last grasp at emotional connection, takes the boy under his wing
and tries to put him in a safe place. </p>

<p>That last sentence implies much more eventfulness than Eternity and a Day is ready to
provide. With very limited success, the movie alternates its focus between
Alexander&#146;s ruminations of his past, which are often beautifully literal, and his
relationship to the boy, which becomes more maddeningly surreal as the film progresses.
Neither of these concerns can manage to escape the suffocating self-indulgence of
Angelopolous, who has no trouble spending an endless amount of time leaving the camera on
images that have nothing but the most peripheral relevance to the story he&#146;s trying
to tell. At one point we see a young married couple, who are complete strangers as far as
the film is concerned, dancing during their outdoor wedding for what seems a lifetime as
Alexander looks on. Yes, he&#146;s watching two lovers begin their lives as his squandered
love life is ending, and so he has more reason to feel regret, but this is a fairly
obvious point that can be gleaned pretty quickly. It is a pretty, vivacious image, but how
long is too long to hold on it? At what point does a held image of beauty cease to become
poetic, and turn into monotonous indulgence? Angelopolous forces such distinctions to be
made. </p>

<p>Perhaps if he spent less time catering to his own taste for imposing scenery he could
have made a more fully realized connection between Alexander&#146;s two concurrent
preoccupations. But the connection turns out to resonate just as weakly and obviously as
the dancing couple - the kid is Alexander&#146;s last shot at caring for a person. That
sort of human concern is nothing to sneeze at, but that is precisely what Angelopolous
does. In addition to the director&#146;s slower than snail pacing, where little time is
dedicated to people actually doing anything, the poet-boy relationship dissolves into a
cold, murky abstraction, though not without the sort of cutesy, unearned emotionality
that&#146;s par for the course with such a coupling. The only place Angelopolous can find
real, textured emotionality is in Alexander&#146;s flashbacks to that wasted day with his
wife. They have a warm, loving feel to them, and make for the only case where
Alexander&#146;s melancholy is made palpable. They work as a literalization of
Alexander&#146;s thoughts and feelings, which are what Eternity and a Day is ultimately
about. Thoughts and feelings. Not majestically misty vistas. This is a story that takes
place behind the character&#146;s eyes, not in front of them, no matter how beautiful and
impressive those sights may be.&nbsp; </p>
