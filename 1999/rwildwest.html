Coen Brothers films has given way to a more mainstream, run-of-the-mill directorial style
wasted primarily on resurrected television sitcoms-turned-films. <i>Wild, Wild West</i> is
an overstuffed vanity trip for both of these talents: a rickety stagecoach of a movie that
careens through dusty plains before plummeting over a steep cliff.</big></p>
<i>

<p>Wild, Wild West</i> begins as a man is beheaded by a sawblade: it sounds gruesome, but
the same Sonnenfeld touch that tightroped between the <i>Addams Family&#146;s</i> goth
grotesqueness and gallows humor creates a live-action comic strip from the scene. <img src="Images/rwildwest-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="150">This light humor
diffuses the gore, much like John Woo&#146;s dance-like choregraphy and coyote-roadrunner
chases offset the grisly shootouts of his films. The following frames of the film
aren&#146;t nearly as effective, as the characters of Captain James West (Smith) and U.S.
Marshal Artemus Gordon (Kevin Kline) are established. In the 1960&#146;s television series
on which <i>Wild, Wild West</i> is based, West and Gordon were secret service agents
assigned to work together by President Ulysses S. Grant. In true <i>Phantom Menace</i>
style, the prequel-style film takes on the task of explaining precisely how this unlikely
twosome was established. There&#146;s a scene involving the interrogation of seedy General
McGrath (<i>The Silence of the Lambs</i>&#146; Ted Levine) by a drag-garbed Kline, in
which the Marshal&#146;s attempts to hypnotize to former is supposed to establish the
wise-cracking humor and high-tech gadgetry that will accent to rest of the film. But even
in a floozie&#146;s dress and wig, Kline seems stiff and somewhat anxious: he&#146;s a far
more drab comic presence than he was during his Oscar-winning turn as the dense,
pretentious Otto in <i>A Fish Called Wanda</i>. Meanwhile, Smith has a smooth charm --
he&#146;s likeable in a Tom Hanks kinda way even when he&#146;s brutalizing lawbreakers in
the post-Civil War South (although the concept of an African American federal agent
materializing during this time period is unlikely, at best). </p>

<p>Essentially, the teaming of Smith&#146;s macho, womanizing, Eastwoodian (he&#146;s
critiques by President Grant as &quot;someone who shoots first, shoots later, and when
everyone&#146;s dead, ask a few questions&quot;) West and Kline&#146;s brainy,
gizmo-inventing Gordon is a failed attempt to provide some contrast. The film tries to
demonstrate the at-odds nature of this coupling, before showing how the differences are
complimentary. This tired foes-to-friends buddy formula can still work. It was a
serviceable component in Sonnenfeld&#146;s earlier <i>Men In Black</i>, when the animated
Smith and stone-faced Tommy Lee Jones created an entertaining chemistry -- but
there&#146;s so much static thrown at the screen this time around that the relationship
seems forced and wooden. </p>
<i>

<p></i><img src="Images/rwildwest-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150"><i>Wild Wild
West</i>&#146;s plot centers around this duo&#146;s attempts to stop the kidnapping of the
president by the flamboyantly demented Dr. Loveless (Kenneth Branaugh). His lower body
lost to a wartime explosion, Loveless mobilizes himself in a steam-driven wheelchair, and
plots to take over the world with his elaborate arsenal of weaponry. With all the bizarre,
Jules Verne-inspired steel &#145;n steam gadgetry surrounding him, Branaugh looks like a
refugee from David Lynch&#146;s <i>Dune</i>. His confrontations with West are based on
racist and cruel one-upmanship. &quot;A haven&#146;t seen you in a coon&#146;s age,&quot;
says Loveless. &quot;Well,&quot; retorts west, &quot;keeping in touch with everyone is
enough to cut a guy off at the knees.&quot; By the time Salma Hayek emerges as a damsel
whose scientist-father has been captured by the devious Dr. Loveless, the tone is set for
similarly tacky butt &#145;n breast innuendo<i>. Wild, Wild West</i> takes its heralded
place alongside <i>American Pie, Big Daddy</i>, and <i>South Park</i> in defining the
current cultural zeitgeist of cynical, sophomoric wise cracking at the movies, in which
cruelty emerges as the punch line of every juvenile joke.</p>

<p>By the time this rambling mess of a movie features its big climax, with Loveless
helming a monstrous mechanical spider and leveling entire city blocks, one is tempted to
reflect back on what made Sonnenfeld such a &quot;next-big-thing&quot; whiz-kid back in
the early eighties. <img src="Images/rwildwest-3.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="146" HEIGHT="150">His
camerawork in the 1984 Coen Brothers&#146; <i>Blood Simple </i>remains some of the most
imaginative and exciting in film history. In one scene, a woman&#146;s frozen terror is
converted to a fight-or-flight getaway when a thrown newspaper rattles a screen door. In
another, an injured man attempts to flee from an automobile as a shovel-wielding assailant
follows him, with break lights illuminating the hunt in a sickening red haze.
Sonnenfeld&#146;s twisted, lurching, fish-eye camera images would go on to haunt <i>Raising
Arizona</i>, <i>Miller&#146;s Crossing</i>, and <i>Throw Momma From the Train</i> before
he used a more discreet style for <i>Big</i>, <i>Misery</i>, and other mainstream fare. By
the time Sonnenfeld graduated to directorial duties on such recent hits as <i>The Addams
Family</i> and <i>Get Shorty</i>, he&#146;d continued to mesh a trademark cinematography
&quot;look&quot; with more commercial projects. However, it was always his subtle humor
and economical use of special effects that gave an edge to his work. <i>Wild, Wild West</i>,
with its raucous mishmash of loud, lumbering dialogue, effects, and music (including a
sad, marketing-as-usual tie-in rap song performed by Smith), is a lesson that less is
often more. Fortunately for Sonnenfeld, it&#146;s not too late to hitch his train onto a
kindler, gentler track. </p>
