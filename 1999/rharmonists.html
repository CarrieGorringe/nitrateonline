<p><big><strong><big>B</big></strong>ut for the fact that the seductively comic musical
group that is poignantly depicted in this truth-based story predated the rise of the
National Socialist Party in Germany by a handful of years, these five talented melody
makers and their agile pianist would have probably never existed. Thank goodness for small
favors as the world was graced by the extraordinary talents of this world-renowned sextet.
But the eventual rise of Hitler and his anti-semitic government not only would destroy the
lives of six million Jews, but would also humiliatingly consume this film&#146;s main
subjects -- and their loved ones -- in a horribly sad, career-ending and life-altering,
decision.</big></p>

<p>This remarkable, albeit slightly draggy, tale begins with the popular Comedian
Harmonists performing before a rapturous crowd of upper class patrons, providing a glimpse
of this fabulous group&#146;s success before retreating back to the end of 1927 -- to
Berlin, a theatrical magnet where down-on-his luck drama student Harry Frommermann (Ulrich
Noethern) looks for guidance, often at the grave of his dead parents, in a nation filled
with three million unemployed souls. While dining on sunflower seeds plucked from the cage
of his pet parrot, the malnourished Harry is inspired by a recording of the American a
capella group &#145;The Revelers,&#146; courtesy of Erna (Meret Becker), a student working
at a nearby music store and the object of Harry&#146;s romantic daydreams. After placing
an advertisement for a &quot;unique performing ensemble,&quot; bombastic cigar-puffing
baritone Robert Biberti (Ben Becker) bullies his way through the audition process and
immediately forms with Harry the core of the legendary ensemble and a
she-loves-me-she-loves-me-not relationship with Erna that provides a refreshing spirit
lift at the film&#146;s end.</p>

<p>Robert&#146;s connections in the local music community allows for the decisive birth of
this nearly mythic troupe, including Ari Leschnikoff (Max Tidof), a mustachioed waiter
whose tenor voice serenades lovely <i>frauleins</i> at a small ristorante; Erich Collin
(Heinrich Schafmeister), a monacled, educated dandy who favors smoking his cigarettes with
a stylish holder; Roman Cycowski (Heino Ferch), a Polish émigré and former opera singer
whose uplifting marriage to Mary (Katja Riemann), a convert to Judaism, raises the
traditional chairs in futile hopes of better times ahead; and the chronically late Erwin
Bootz (Kai Wiesinger), the group&#146;s 19-year-old piano player.</p>

<p>Months of practice takes its toll on the group. Nerves are frayed as their initial
presentation before a successful impresario suggest their act is more suited to a funeral
parlor. But doubts are overcome and their first concert is a rousing success. The rest, as
they say, is history.</p>

<p>Joseph Vilsmaier, wearing three hats -- four if you count his wife, Dana Vávrová, who
appears in the film as Erwin Bootz&#146;s wife -- as director, executive producer, and
director of photography, evokes the moral frustrations and international triumphs of these
exceptionally talented songsters and the ugly brick wall of Nazi Germany they are thrown
against when the three Jewish Harmonists are ordered to cease their public association
with the act. At times, the film is reminiscent of a Marx Brothers comedy, only to have
the madcap antics crushed by the cruel, dignity-stealing actions of stone-faced officials
of the Third Reich. The situation borders on the surreal as one puppet at the oppressive
cultural association delivers a typically offensive Nazi demand on the group to Harry and
Robert, only to ask for an autograph for his nephew as the pair struggle uncomfortably to
remove themselves from the stench of bad tidings. The conversation here was translated
(the film, of course, is in German, with English subtitles) as &quot;Maybe we can find a
solution,&quot; insinuating a quest for compromise, but ultimately inferring the
portentous answer found in Hitler&#146;s Final Solution.</p>

<p>The emotionally-driven characters, finely drawn by screenwriter Klaus Richter, fit the
actors like a glove, in much the same way as <i>That Thing You Do</i> (1996) so aptly
highlighted the rise and fall of a faux foursome. There&#146;s also a taste of <i>Life Is
Beautiful</i> in portraying the rise of the genocidal tendencies of Nazism. Production
designer Rolf Zehetbauer very effectively summons up the period, particularly an early
1930s visit by the performers to New York City as the boys sing for NBC Radio in front of
the USS <i>Saratoga</i>. His authentic re-creation of a steaming and steamy Berlin
(including a bordello and luxury hotel) are obviously an ode to 1972&#146;s <i>Cabaret</i>
, on which he served as an art director.</p>

<p>The destiny of the Comedian Harmonists takes a fateful turn as the group disbands,
split by forces beyond belief and understanding, after a final concert in Munich and the
adulation of their myriad fans. Their popularity continues long after their lives have
faded (The remaining survivor, Roman Cycowski, who became a cantor in San Francisco,
passed away last November.), but their recordings, this film, and a lengthy documentary by
Eberhard Fechner keeps their memories and harmonies alive. <i>The Harmonists</i> reveals
for you that life is full of joy and pain. Here&#146;s a show you shouldn&#146;t miss.</p>
