<p><big><strong><big>A</big></strong>s horror films go, this one left me screaming.</big></p>

<p>Why do they make films like this?!?</p>

<p>Do the producers think people will spend money on this drivel?</p>

<p>Be afraid! Be VERY afraid! Of having to sit through 99 minutes of such stuff that bad
movies are made of.</p>

<p><img src="Images/rindreams-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">As dream films
go, this one&#146;s an hellacious nightmare and annoying migraine, coincidentally released
by Dreamworks, and guaranteed to be the worst performer in the history of this young
company. Yes, it&#146;s visually stunning (credit that to the dark, moody work by
cinematographer Daris Khondji, responsible for <i>Seven</i> and <i>Alien Resurrection</i>),
but it&#146;s a psychic hotline to hell without telephones, mangled by a disconnected
script by director Neil Jordan and Bruce Robinson. And, remember, this phone call is your
dime (well, technically 35 cents, but that doesn&#146;t sound nearly as good). This
week&#146;s motto: Be thrifty.</p>

<p>Not that I have enjoyed many of Stephen King&#146;s horror adaptations, but this
painful rip-off of the horror meister&#146;s oeuvre is all wrong, driven home by that
popular author&#146;s New England settings and a get-even ending straight out of Carrie.
The unnatural story of two minds melding, each sharing the other&#146;s thoughts and
future musings, is directed with a leaden hand by Jordan, who runs hot (<i>The Crying Game</i>,
<i>Interview With the Vampire</i>) and cold (<i>High Spirits</i>, <i>We&#146;re No Angels</i>).
I&#146;m hoping he is a baseball fan and remembers the 1969 Mets; there&#146;s nowhere to
go but up after this mess. Star Annette Bening would have been better off having a mind
link with her business agent, sensing horrifying thoughts of how this film would
eventually turned out.</p>

<p><img src="Images/rindreams-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">For the record,
mysterious visions, flash backs, flash forwards, flash whatevers, of apples and death
haunt poor Claire Cooper (Annette Bening, probably wishing she was back home with Warren),
a children&#146;s book author/illustrator -- including an adaptation of Grimm&#146;s Fairy
Tales -- living with her beautiful child and wonderful husband and obedient dog in a
lovely white house on the edge of a man-made lake, covering a town flooded 30 years
earlier in the name of progress. Beneath the surface is a entrancing, haunted world of
water-logged relics (a wonder they weren&#146;t removed for salvage), a graveyard (I
wouldn&#146;t want to be a genealogist visiting a distant relative in this subterranean
tomb), and the memories of a near-death experience of a child chained to a bed as the
rushing waters overcome him. Claire eventually takes a close up look at the lower depths
when she takes a swan dives in her red Volvo into the murky depths after her daughter is
lost.</p>

<p>Upset at the increased severity of her thoughts, significant other Paul, an airline
pilot (Aidan Quinn, in a stopover role), initially skeptical, then apprehensive, flies off
to the authorities, to Detective Jack Kay (Paul Guilfoyle) who is also initially
skeptical, then apprehensive, about the woman&#146;s continuing state of mental collapse.
Dr. Stevens (Dennis Boutsikaris), a neurosurgeon examines the frantic woman and is
initially skeptical, then apprehensive, about the woman&#146;s continuing state of mental
collapse. Jordan regular Stephen Rea follows, making a brief appearance as a psychologist,
initially skeptical, then apprehensive, about the woman&#146;s continuing state of mental
collapse. And so on. Thankfully Rea, so marvelous in <i>The Crying Game</i>, makes a
refreshing comeback as a dusted off rock star of yesteryear in the wide release next week
of <i>Still Crazy</i>.</p>
<i>

<p>In Dreams</i> is an enigma, with heaps of puzzling loose ends. You&#146;ll catch
yourself saying &quot;Say, what?&quot; a few times, if you can hear yourself over the
raucous score by Elliott Goldenthal, previously nominated for an Oscar for his work with
Jordan on <i>Michael Collins</i> and <i>Interview With the Vampire</i>. On a scale of one
to eight, this is a &quot;fa,&quot; as in fa-get it.</p>

<p><img src="Images/rindreams-3.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">As a
wrong-headed, dream-laden metaphor for <i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</i> (with Downey
as Grumpy), we follow Claire as she eventually retraces the tormented path of long-haired,
grizzled Vivian Thompson (Robert Downey, Jr.), her significant mental other in a mental
ward escape using a cross-cutting, time-leaping technique -- also employed in a recent
&quot;Bermuda Triangle&quot; episode of The X Files -- to a predictable climax. Theatres
showing <i>In Dreams</i> will quickly shove this film out of the commercial marketplace.
Telegraphing those exhibitors&#146; thoughts as to where this film belongs are the three
characters caught together toward the film&#146;s end: Vivian, Claire, and Ruby, a child
abducted by the serial killer. Take their first initials and fast forward where this
weird, cheap thriller will end up later this spring.</p>
