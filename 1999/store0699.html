<p><big><big><strong><a name="DancingLughnasa" href="../rlughnasa.html" target="_top">Dancing at
Lughnasa</a></strong></i> (USA, 1998, June 15)</big></big></p>

<p>This quiet, affecting drama is based on a successful Irish stage play, and at first the
shadow of the proscenium looms large in the story of five sisters in 1936 Donegal and how
one summer changes their lives. As one of the reclusive brood, Meryl Streep is in perfect
sync with the ensemble as a sister who enforces decency in the family and is reluctant to
embrace change. The central metaphor of the title is the pagan god of the harvest
festival, and it is a joyous dance that unites the sisters after uncertainties brought by
two men: returning missionary brother Jack (Michael Gambon) and the father of one of the
sisters&#146; only boy (Rhys Ifans, so funny as Hugh Grant&#146;s spacy roommate in <i>Notting
Hill</i>). One of those movies that requires a half-hour or so to really get into, <i>Dancing
at Lughnasa</i> yields modest but satisfying dramatic rewards to the patient viewer. The
DVD features a theatrical trailer.</p>

<p><big><big><strong><a name="EnemyState" href="../renemy.html" target="_top">Enemy of the State</a></strong></i>
(USA, 1998, June 15)</big></big></p>

<p>&quot;Not too stupid after all,&quot; Gene Hackman&#146;s technospook Brill says of
innocent and inventive lawyer-turned-fugitive Robert Clayton Dean (Will Smith) between
action set-pieces, and it&#146;s a sentiment that serves to sum up this overblown but
surprisingly good thriller as well. Nothing less than an unofficial sequel to Francis Ford
Coppola&#146;s seminal 1974 paranoia drama <i>The Conversation</i>, <i>Enemy of the State</i>
continues that trajectory by presenting the great Hackman as the reluctant savior of
Smith&#146;s plucky everyman as he becomes the unwitting recipient of photographic proof
of the murder of a senator (Jason Robards, unbilled). This is the latest highly tuned and
high-decibel thrill machine from producer <font size="3">Jerry Bruckheimer</font> and the
most recent collaboration among Bruckheimer, director Tony Scott and star Gene Hackman
following <i>Crimson Tide</i>. Smith proves a fine addition to the team, doing a pleasing
update of the hapless hero minted by Cary Grant in <i>North By Northwest</i>. With little
reference to race and a pace timed to sweep plot implausibilities out of sight before they
can be detected, much less digested, this is as good as a socially conscious popcorn movie
gets and is strongly reminiscent of such similar 1970s fare as <i>Three Days of the Condor
</i>and <i>The Parallax View</i> -- not at all stupid company from a crowd not known for
their smart fare. The DVD edition of the film includes production and filmmaker
featurettes.</p>

<p><big><big><strong><a name="Faculty" href="../rfaculty.html" target="_top">The Faculty</a></strong></i>
(USA, 1998, June 15)</big></big></p>

<p>While the <i>Scream</i> template is starting to show its age after only three years,
the hormonal horror <i>The Faculty</i>, with its possessed title teachers and the
disparate, intrepid students who thwart them, is much more entertaining than it has any
right to be. This is due in large part to Kevin Williamson&#146;s clichéd yet genuinely
quirky script, which presents the strange doings at decrepit Herrington High as sort of a
cross between <i>Up the Down Staircase</i> and <i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</i>
(which gets mentioned repeatedly by the pop culture-saturated teens). The large cast is up
to the mix, with Elijah Wood a standout as the picked upon yet plucky intellectual who
leads the charge and Famke Janssen nearly unrecognizable as one of the teachers who make
startling transformations (they&#146;re all played by TV and genre vets). Part of the
problem here is that most of the kids talk like we all wish we&#146;d talked in high
school (&quot;I&#146;m not an alien, I&#146;m discontent&quot;), and the resulting
glibness contributes to a sense of superficial choppiness enhanced by the fluid yet
mannered camera of director Robert Rodriguez. On the cool scale, there are a couple of
pointed references to Robert A. Heinlein and that&#146;s Harry &quot;Ain&#146;t It Cool
News&quot; Knowles glimpsed briefly servicing the cooler in the teacher&#146;s lounge
(they drink a lot of water). &quot;You&#146;re not buying this, are you?&quot; one student
says to another at a key moment. &quot;No, I&#146;m not,&quot; is the comeback, &quot;but
it&#146;s kinda cool.&quot; In it&#146;s own derivative way, so is <i>The Faculty</i>. The
DVD includes theatrical trailers from the film.</p>

<p><big><big><strong><a name="GodsMonsters" href="../rgodmon.html" target="_top">Gods and Monsters</a></strong>
</i>(USA, 1998, June 8)</big></big></p>

<p>A modest, dignified film that might very well have appeared in the &quot;Beyond the
A-list&quot; section below, this gentle yet shrewd look at the later years of director
James Whale sparked the imagination of moviegoers and earned Oscar nominations for Ian
McKellen and Bill Condon&#146;s perfectly calibrated screenplay (which won). Sly,
deliberate and provocative, the film speculates on what might have happened to Whale, the
gay Hollywood director of <i>The Invisible Man</i> and <i>Bride of Frankenstein</i>, who
was found floating in the pool he only installed as a social attraction (he couldn&#146;t
swim) on May 29, 1957. In many ways this is the movie McKellen has been searching for his
entire career: like Whale, McKellen is gay, began on the stage and is even from the same
region of England. Thus, it isn&#146;t too much of a stretch to imagine the veracity of
the lazy insolence the great actor brings to the reclusive Whale and his complicated,
ultimately tender relationship with handsome ex-Marine and current drifting gardener
Clayton Boone (Brendan Fraser). Although downplayed from the book in favor of Whale, Boone
is in many ways the more sympathetic character and is played to befuddled perfection by
Fraser, whose career moves between the commercial and challenging are as exquisite as the
compassion he shows for his unlikely friend. The Special Edition DVD includes commentary
from Condon as well as the half-hour featurette &quot;The World of <i>Gods and Monsters</i>:
A Journey with James Whale.&quot;</p>

<p><big><big><strong><a name="LittleVoice" href="../rlvoice.html" target="_top">Little Voice</a></strong></i>
(United Kingdom, 1998, June 15)</big></big></p>

<p>Shrill and cramped, this overly praised stage adaptation about a mute and mousy young
woman (Jane Horrocks) who escapes the blue bluster of her loud mother (Brenda Blethyn)
through spot-on impersonations of such famous divas as Judy Garland, Marlene Dietrich and
Marilyn Monroe should&#146;ve stayed in the wings. Director Mark Herman, following up his
engaging <i>Brassed Off</i>, claims that this material offered him the same &quot;mixture
of humor, tragedy and music.&quot; That may well be, yet apart from Horrocks&#146; uncanny
mimicry (her performance scenes were all filmed live in front of an audience), the only
likable character here is the positively chameleon-like Ewan McGregor&#146;s meek Billy,
and he doesn&#146;t get nearly enough screen time to counteract the gross posturings of
Blethyn and the slimy bonhomie of Michael Caine&#146;s opportunistic yet morally impaired
agent Ray Say. Perhaps, in much the same way Dustin Hoffman&#146;s <i>Lenny</i> is a
distinctly American creation, this kind of thing plays better in Britain. Then again,
perhaps it doesn&#146;t. The DVD is due to be released July 13.</p>

<p><big><big><strong><a name="MyNameisJoe" href="rjoe.html" target="_top">My Name is Joe</i> </a></strong>(United
Kingdom, 1998, June 15)</big></big></p>

<p>After a two-film excursion into international politics (1995&#146;s <i>Land and Freedom</i>,
followed the next year by <i>Carla&#146;s Song</i>), socially conscious and politically
fuelled British filmmaker Ken Loach is back to doing what he does best. Headstrong and
magnetic Peter Mullan, who won the Best Actor honors at the Cannes festival last year,
dominates the proceedings as the title character, a recovering alcoholic in modern-day
Glasgow whose modest life is upset when he becomes involved with health worker Sarah
(Louise Goodall) as well as a struggling couple who&#146;ve run afoul the local toughs.
Filmed sequentially over a period of six weeks, the movie is as much about the daily
struggles of life in the depressed Scottish city as it is a love story or genre exercise.
While he is typically critical of a social service system stretched beyond all reasonable
limits, Loach can still make time for the small joys and triumphs of his working class
protagonists, and the poignant yet problematic affection that grows between Joe and Sarah
is among the most believable love affairs in recent cinema. No DVD has yet been announced
for this title.</p>

<p><big><big><strong><a name="PatchAdams" href="../rpatchadams.html" target="_top">Patch Adams</a></strong></i>
(USA, 1998, June 22)</big></big></p>

<p>When not being sublime and suitably praised for it in such films as <i>Dead Poets
Society</i>, <i>The Fisher King</i> and <i>Good Will Hunting</i> (for which he won the
Best Supporting Actor Oscar), Robin Williams has an alarmingly undiscerning propensity to
the treacly. In a career that already includes <i>Being Human</i>, <i>Father&#146;s Day</i>
and the recent, uncategorizable <i>What Dreams May Come</i>, the profoundly maudlin low
point might well be this forced, hollow parable, based on the true story of mental
patient-turned-alternative healer Hunter Doherty &quot;Patch&quot; Adams. An unrelentingly
cheerful nonconformist, the questioning medical student can never figure why the
Dean&#146;s got it in for him and many of his fellow students can&#146;t stand him.
&quot;I wanna help, I wanna connect with people,&quot; he keeps saying, so the
disconnected and predictable script (by cable sensation Steve Oedekerk, who hopefully got
a bigger house out of the film&#146;s success) features Williams riffing at a meat
packers&#146; convention, a ward full of sick but still cute children and anywhere else
where people are too incapacitated to get out of his way. &quot;Smart clown, eh?&quot;
someone says at about the midway point, but manipulative is more like it, a strategy
underscored by Marc Shaiman&#146;s preposterously syrupy score. The best performers
don&#146;t need to scream &quot;look at me!&quot; -- a subtlety that Williams often loses
sight of as he mocks the very pompousness in the medical profession that he often brings
to his hyperactive form of comedy. Nothing but warmed-over cuckoo&#146;s nest claptrap, <i>Patch
Adams</i> is one of those successfully marketed Hollywood movies that are looked back on
with a sense of wonder: you mean the public actually bought that? There are standard and a
feature-laden Collectors&#146; Edition DVD releases of the film, with a widescreen DVD due
July 20. On tape the movie is available in both English and Spanish subtitled versions.</p>

<p><big><big><strong><a name="Psycho" href="../rpsycho.html" target="_top">Psycho</a></strong></i> (USA,
1998, June 8)</big></big></p>

<p>Ironically, the proliferation of pop songs remade by currently hip bands for movie
soundtracks is a marketing tool that hasn&#146;t extended to the films themselves. If that
were so, Gus Van Sant&#146;s tantalizingly inscrutable remake of Alfred Hitchcock&#146;s
groundbreaking, low-budget horror masterpiece would be an exciting template for a new kind
of movie revisionism instead of the critically reviled failure it didn&#146;t take long to
become. That&#146;s not to say even the most sympathetic viewer can glean the point of the
exercise, but still, really, this isn&#146;t nearly as empty an hommage as the vicious
reviews might lead one to believe. Anne Heche brings a dispassionate but somehow
appropriate vacuity to the doomed Marion Crane (at once more carnal and colder than Janet
Leigh&#146;s, if such a thing is possible), and Vince Vaughn&#146;s genuinely subversive
reading of the profoundly disturbed Norman Bates mixes a dead-on impersonation of Anthony
Perkins&#146; magnificent creation with a kind of spoofy hunkiness that serves to send up
every young stud Hollywood&#146;s minted over the last few years (effectively sending
Dawson up his own creek without a paddle). But it is Van Sant&#146;s own layering of the
story with sonic whooshes (he did the same thing in <i>Good Will Hunting</i>) and
unexplained imagery during the film&#146;s key moments that make this exquisitely art
directed and reverently imitative movie a true curiosity. The DVD includes commentary from
Van Sant, Heche and Vaughn, as well as a half-hour featurette called, perhaps inevitably,
&quot;<i>Psycho</i> Path.&quot; While the extras might help the skeptical viewer learn
what motivated Van Sant to embark on such a singular enterprise, nothing can explain why
the same critical corps which has embraced his unique brand of moviemaking didn&#146;t
even give him a sporting chance with this brave oddity.</p>

<p><big><big><strong><a href="../rsplan.html" name="SimplePlan" target="_top">A Simple Plan</a></strong></i>
(USA, 1998, June 22)</big></big></p>

<p>&quot;Do you ever feel evil?,&quot; one brother asks another at a key moment in this
snowbound and defiantly leisurely new rural thriller, and the question will resonate with
anyone whose ever been tempted by the lure of easy money and the false promise of security
it can represent. Anchored by the perfectly meshed and calibrated performances of Bill
Paxton as a priggish accountant and Billy Bob Thornton (Oscar nominated) as his
deceptively feeble younger brother, <i>A Simple Plan</i> rises above a troubled production
history to emerge as an atmospheric triumph for director Sam Raimi. On a cold and snowy
New Year&#146;s Eve in rural Minnesota, returning from a holiday visit to the graves of
their deceased parents, Hank Mitchell (Paxton), his brother Jacob (Thornton) and the
latter&#146;s boorish drinking buddy Lou (Brent Briscoe) discover a downed plane with a
dead pilot and a duffle bag with $4.4 million in neatly banded, used hundred dollar bills
inside. Goaded by Hank&#146;s pregnant wife Sarah (Bridget Fonda) and shadowed by town
constable Carl Jenkins (Chelcie Ross), each man&#146;s will dissolves into suspicion as
their simple plan to keep the money hidden until the plane is discovered, then split it up
three ways and leave town, slowly and inevitably breaks down. With the arrival of FBI
agent Baxter (Gary Cole), events take a decisive and disastrous turn. Scott Smith&#146;s
Oscar nominated screenplay, from his popular novel, is another high-profile example of
less is more school of adaptation, a disciplined and compassionate reworking of his book
that displays an innate understanding of what works on film and what doesn&#146;t. This
timely, terrifying film seems to be a pointed warning of the horrible ease with which
decent people who&#146;ve never felt particularly evil can be seduced into desperately
simple plans that result not in deliverance, but blood.</p>

<p><big><big><a name="WakingNedDevine" href="rneddevine.html" target="_top"><strong>Waking Ned Devine</strong></a></i>
(Ireland, 1998, June 1)</big></big></p>

<p>Debuting writer-director Kirk Jones spent the years since his 1986 graduation from film
school making television commercials for a living, and there&#146;s a pleasing slickness
to <i>Waking Ned Devine</i> that meshes perfectly with the benevolent Irish blarney of the
story (which came about when Jones read a press cutting about a furtive Irish postmistress
who may or may not have won the lottery and was actually shot on the Isle of Man filling
in for Ireland). Ian Bannen and David Kelly bring a lifetime of skilled character work as
well as an exquisite chemistry to their mischievous leading roles as two of the 50 or so
people who live in rural Tully More and the only pair who know that their pal Ned holds
the winning National Lottery ticket in his newly dead hand. Much has been made of the
similarities between this appealing farce and such vintage Ealing Studios comedies as <i>Whisky
Galore </i>(aka <i>Tight Little Island</i>), and it&#146;s true that the template of a
community banding together to pull a good-natured swindle on the authorities is a strong
theme in both movies. Where Jones finds his greatest success is in the widescreen
realization of this caper, a perfectly timed marriage of metronome-like set-pieces and
ensemble acting that culminates in a Rube Goldberg-like stunt that is as brash as it is
funny. &quot;I wanted to make a &#145;feel-good movie&#146; in every sense,&quot; Jones
confessed to one journalist, and it is to his eternal credit that he&#146;s managed to
make one that revels in it&#146;s own cheeky craftiness. There&#146;s a Spanish subtitled
tape available, as well as a DVD with theatrical trailers.</p>

<p><big><big><strong>Alien Legacy</i> 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary re-release</strong>
(USA, 1979-1997, June 1)</big></big></p>

<p>&quot;Was it everything you hoped for?&quot; the newly constituted Lieutenant First
Class Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) asks a stunned group of hardcases who've just had a
harrowing firsthand encounter with one of the hydroponic aliens she's been fighting on and
off throughout the galaxy in frenzied bursts for in excess of two and a half centuries in
Alien-Resurrection, the fourth and most recent film in this endurable franchise. In truth
it is: the Alien Legacy DVD box set of all four titles is among the best collections yet
released in the format. There are a multitude of ways to own this epochal series, both in
the impressive box set and as individual videocassettes and DVD&#146;s. Generally
speaking, the DVD editions have more features but the tapes are no slouch either. Herewith
is a rundown of the series so far:</p>

<p><big><a name="Alien" target="_top">Alien</a></i> (1979)</big></b></p>

<p>Ridley Scott's surprising, smoke-filled scare fest is the <i>Old Dark House</i> of
space movies -- more horror than sci-fi, really -- in which big-haired Weaver (billed just
below Tom Skerritt's doomed Captain Dallas) first battles the &quot;perfect organism&quot;
that methodically picks off everyone on the earth-bound mineral tanker <i>Nostromo</i>
after bursting through John Hurt's chest (Veronica Cartwright's split-second reaction of
sheer terror was achieved by springing the now-legendary special effect on the clueless
actors). The seeds of then-Chief Warrant Officer Ripley's series-long mistrust of
treacherous androids is planted when the synthetic Ash (Ian Holm) disobeys her direct
order and perhaps unwittingly allows the beast on board, the all-encompassing twin themes
of imperialism and greed via the <i>Nostromo's</i> pre-programmed orders to investigate
potential mining (colonization?) opportunities and Ash's recognition that the things might
actually have some biological (read: monetary) value. H.R. Giger's Lovecraftian designs
remain unsettlingly memorable today, as does the eerie beauty of Jerry Goldsmith's languid
score. &quot;What are my chances?&quot; Ripley types in to the computer mainframe, dubbed
&quot;Mother&quot; (the <i>Auriga</i>'s is called &quot;Father&quot;). &quot;Does not
compute,&quot; the machine replies with ominous serenity. &quot;Crew expendable.&quot;
&quot;You bitch!&quot; Ripley calls it later, prefiguring one of the more enduring motifs
of the whole series. And how's this for verisimilitude? <i>Alien</i> was filmed at Bray
Studios, the same British soundstages that hosed the classic Hammer horror films.</p>

<p>Helpless shock gives way to swaggering optimism in director James Cameron's titanic,
gizmo-crazed sequel, which devotes over two hours to the medium-haired Ripley's reluctant
return to the now-colonized LV 426 -- planet of the eggs -- 57 years after the events of <i>Alien</i>,
the reluctant adviser to a cocksure group of starship troopers (complete with cute chick
pilot) on a &quot;bug hunt&quot; that goes horribly awry. Skeptical of her story (the
vaporized M-Class freighter <i>Nostromo</i> was apparently worth some $42 million
&quot;adjusted&quot; dollars -- less than a quarter of the cost of Cameron's upcoming
movie) the centralized Company offers her a reinstatement of flight status in the form of
corporate weasel chaperone Burke (Paul Reiser doing a prototype Paul Buckman), whose
nefarious scheme to smuggle the alien through galactic customs attached to Ripley's face
prefigures the cryotube piracy of <i>Alien Resurrection</i>. Our heroine's also saddled
with another creepy android, Bishop (Lance Henriksen), who prefers the term
&quot;artificial person&quot; and turns out to be OK -- for the moment. Maybe the most
Freudian film of the bunch, as Ripley protects the resourceful young lone survivor Rebecca
&quot;Newt&quot; Jordan (Carrie Henn), flirts over heavy weaponry with Corporal Dwayne
Hicks (Michael Biehn) and squares off against the Queen for the first time in the bowels
of the massive Atmosphere Processor. <i>Aliens</i> marks the series debut of Alien Effects
Designers Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff, who built beasts for all subsequent films
(&quot;Tom in fact is often the guy in the suit,&quot; Weaver told an interviewer
recently), while James Horner's memorable score is a clangy, militaristic industrial
symphony. </p>

<p>Ripley is engulfed by darkness and despair in director David Fincher's claustrophobic
and underrated big-screen debut (which looks a lot better in light of <i>Seven</i> --
photographed by <i>Alien Resurrection</i> cinematographer Darius Khondji -- and <i>The
Game</i>), as she crash lands on Fiorina &quot;Fury&quot; 161, a remote, nearly deserted,
Class C Prison, maximum security, Double Y Chromosome-Work Correctional Facility after
drifting in space -- again -- for an unspecified time. Shorn of her hair, Ripley is
grief-stricken over the loss of Newt and Hicks (&quot;they have been released from all
darkness and pain,&quot; says Warden Andrews [Brian Glover] almost wistfully) but manages
to salvage enough of Bishop to verify what's been killing the weaponless inmates of this
bleak futuristic big house, all of whom appear to be British -- one of them sings a snatch
of the 1969 Zager &amp; Evans chestnut, &quot;In the Year 2525 (Exordium &amp;
Terminus)&quot;, before being ground into chow. &quot;Do you have any faith, sister?&quot;
asks the lone Yank, Dillon (Charles S. Dutton). &quot;Not much,&quot; says Ripley, who
promptly loses the only lover she's had during the entire ordeal (Charles Dance's
unexpectedly tender and dignified Clemens -- clemency?) to the marauding alien. High
points include the implanted Ripley's recitation of the line &quot;somebody's got to kill
me&quot; directly into the camera and the most genuinely unsettling finale of the series
-- an unrelentingly tragic denouement (featuring Bishop's return, sort of) which is
redeemed spectacularly by the principal plot twist of <i>Alien Resurrection</i>.&nbsp;</p>

</i>(USA, 1997)</big></p>

<p>Two hundred years after Ripley's unfortunate fate on Fiorina 161, a team of scientists
circling Pluto on the top-secret United Systems Military research station <i>Auriga</i>
have successfully cloned her (after seven false starts) in order to birth a baby Queen for
study and eventual domestication of the species. Following that successful procedure, the
new Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), whose DNA is entwined with that of her enemy, becomes a
disposable commodity to corrupt General Perez (Dan Hedaya) and surgical team leaders Wren
(J.E. Freeman) and Gediman (Brad Dourif). Into this already-tense mix sails the <i>Betty</i>,
a dilapidated freighter manned by a scruffy group of mercenaries, prominent among whom are
leader Elgyn (Michael Wincott), wise-cracking goon Johner (Ron Perlman), paralyzed
mechanic Vriess (Dominique Pinon) and spooky, waif-like mechanic Annalee Call (Winona
Ryder). After conducting their nefarious business of selling warm, presumably pilfered
bodies to Perez for alien research, all hell breaks loose as the aliens escape their pens,
the pirates commandeer the <i>Auriga</i>, and a mad scramble is on to reach the dubious
safety of the <i>Betty </i>-- every thing for itself -- as the conjoined vessels approach
earth on a pre-programmed distress course. In the end, <i>Alien Resurrection</i> works
both as a stand-alone action extravaganza with strong nods to other genre faves including <i>The
Poseidon Adventure</i> and <i>Day of the Dead</i>, and as a continuation of perhaps the
strongest female character in contemporary cinema. &quot;What happens now?&quot; Call
asks, in a final grace note that gives nothing away in the enjoyment of the film. &quot;I
don't know,&quot; answers Ellen Ripley the survivor, irrevocably changed but somehow wiser
and certainly stronger for her ordeal -- which may not yet be over, &quot;I'm a stranger
here myself.&quot; Such a weary redemption is indeed all one could hope for.</p>

<p>Cheesy and jingoistic, <i>The Base</i> is a by-the-numbers programmer that serves to
showcase the martial arts skills of one Mark Dacascos (toplining &quot;A Tough and Deadly
Cast&quot;) as a straight-arrow army major sent by the Pentagon to stop a renegade army
within the army dealing drugs. Peppered with enough action to satisfy the undiscerning
genre fan (&quot;Military Hardware Always Maximizes your Rentals,&quot; points out the
glowing copy on the screener copy furnished for review), the film suffers enormously from
Dacascos&#146; wooden style and a script that&#146;s more lame-brained and disjointed than
is usual for this type of thing. Is it really possible that a full-pitched firefight could
rage on a military base without anyone seeming to notice? It&#146;s that kind of movie.
The DVD features audio commentary by veteran low-budget director Mark L. Lester (who uses
the middle initial to avoid confusion with the 1960s British child star who gained fame in
Oliver!).</p>

<p><big><big><a name="Gabbeh" target="_top"><strong>Gabbeh</strong></a></i> (Iran/France, 1996, June 8)</big></big></p>

<p>Long revered as one of the best filmmakers not only in contemporary Iran but all the
world, writer-director-editor Mohsen Makhmalbaf had originally set out to make a
documentary about the Gashgai nomadic tribe in southeastern Iran and the titular patterned
carpets that reflect the events in their lives. But as he edited the footage shot during
his travels through over a hundred villages, a story began to form in his mind and he
returned to shoot additional scenes. The finished film is a serene, visually stunning
story that mixes fantasy and rich rural imagery into the story of a mysterious young
woman, also named Gabbeh, and the elderly couple she befriends. &quot;When you bring a
gabbeh home,&quot; Makhmalbaf explained at the 1996 London Film Festival, &quot;you feel
like you&#146;ve brought nature with it. Nature&#146;s at your feet! I&#146;m quite
convinced that the gabbeh has much in common with any good Iranian film. That is to say
they are both simple, tender, close to nature and to daily reality.&quot; With that in
mind, <i>Gabbeh</i> is a refreshing and beautiful break from Hollywood fare. New Yorker
Films has done their usual superb job on the videocassette mastering and packaging, with a
widescreen video transfer housed in a colorful box that reflects the spirit of this short
(75 minutes) yet memorable film.</p>

29)</big></big></p>

<p>The absolutely gorgeous DVD transfer of this landmark American special effects comedy
is the big news here, an extras-laden item that enhances the film&#146;s special effects
without losing the 1980s spirit of the movie. For it&#146;s fifteenth anniversary,
Columbia Pictures has released a disc that features a generous handful of deleted scenes,
&quot;Tricks &amp; Trivia&quot; listed below the image (did you know the slime was
actually methylcellulose ether and that the movie was almost called <i>Ghoststoppers</i>?),
a nifty section that allows the viewer to use the angles button to actually jump back and
forth in a scene between the original footage and the special effects version in the final
print (the sfx can also be compared in shots from original and 1999 featurettes), and even
a <i>Mystery Science Theater</i>-type effect that has the silhouettes of director Ivan
Reitman and others in the lower corner of the screen during their commentary. Originally
envisioned by Dan Aykroyd as <i>Ghost Smashers</i>, an outer space fantasy pairing him
with pal John Belushi, the retooled <i>Ghostbusters</i> made a star of Bill Murray as the
wisecracking cynic who teams with his university colleagues to rid New York City of ghosts
and created a template for success that has influenced big-budget American comedy ever
since. Also available in a widescreen VHS version minus many of the bonuses, this is the
latest in a long line of reasons to make the jump to DVD.</p>

<p>&quot;Boy, I wish I was you people seeing this for the first time,&quot; says Kermit
the Frog to the camera during the opening musical number of this second Muppet feature
(one of three released by Columbia TriStar Home Video and Jim Henson Home Entertainment to
celebrate the 20<sup>th</sup> anniversary of <i>The Muppet Movie</i> -- the third being <i>The
Muppets Take Manhattan</i>). In this installment, the relentlessly cheerful and
wisecracking beasts (including Rowlf, Animal, Scooter, Oscar the Grouch, The Great Gonzo,
Dr. Bunsen Honeydew and the effervescent Fozzie Bear) solve a jewel robbery in Merrie Olde
England. The long roster of celebrity cameos include a hirsute Charles Grodin (lovestruck
over Miss Piggy), Diana Rigg, Jack Warden, Robert Morley, John Cleese (who calls his wife
&quot;my little armada&quot;), the Peters Falk and Ustinov, and even the bearded Henson
himself in the nightclub scene. &quot;Is there any way to stop it?&quot; some, uh, thing
yells near the end of the first tune. Thankfully, no, there isn&#146;t -- the Muppets will
live forever thanks to successive generations of children of all ages. This re-release is

<p>In much the same way <i>Enemy of the State</i> is an unofficial continuation of Gene
Hackman&#146;s shadowy Harry Caul from <i>The Conversation</i>, this quirky but ultimately
static thriller might be seen as the further adventures of the cocky, swaggering and
intense men of action -- one on each side of the law -- played by William L. Petersen in
William Friedkin&#146;s <i>To Live and Die in L.A.</i> (1985) and Michael Mann&#146;s <i>Manhunter</i>
(1986). Here he&#146;s Jake Bridges, a washed-up writer befriended by Atlantic City
enforcer Frankie McGregor (gravelly-voiced Michael Wincott). They make a deal of sorts:
Frankie teaches Jake about life on the streets, and Jake walks Frankie through great
literature, beginning with &quot;Moby Dick&quot; (&quot;Good chapter, that one there with
Ishmael and the cannibal, I like that&quot;). Wincott (<i>Alien: Resurrection</i>) brings
a loopy tenderness to his fundamentally unbelievable character, though Diane Lane is
largely a cipher as his live-in love, slowly seduced by Jake&#146;s attentions.
Gray-templed and a bit fleshy, Petersen still has flashes of the charisma that made him a
star. So too the faded charms of Atlantic City provide a distinctive if underused backdrop
for the often-cliched action of Larry Gross&#146; script (many moons ago he wrote <i>48
Hrs.</i> and more recently authored the Clint Eastwood vehicle <i>True Crime</i>). Former
drill sergeant R. Lee Ermey (<i>Full Metal Jacket</i>) and rock singer Meat Loaf have
single-scene cameos in the first few minutes. The DVD features commentary from Gross and
director Jeff Celentano, production notes, theatrical trailers and Spanish subtitles.</p>

<p>&quot;When you&#146;ve been a policeman long enough, nothin&#146;s weird,&quot; says
Swedish police inspector Jonas Engstrom (Stellan Skarsgaard) to his partner as the two
investigate a murder in northern Norway where the sun shines 24 hours a day. Yet this
illumination also reveals a nearly debilitating streak of weirdness in the detective
himself, as he matches wits with a cold-blooded killer while struggling to cover up a
tragic mistake. It&#146;s likely few Americans who&#146;ve seen the 48-year-old Skarsgaard
in his most high-profile Hollywood movies, including <i>Good Will Hunting</i> and the
shamefully underrated <i>Ronin</i>, realize that this compulsively watchable actor was
actually born in Sweden, began acting as a teenager and made his first international
splash in 1982 in the title role of the foreign film <i>The Simple-Minded Murderer</i>.
Since then he&#146;s proven adept at historical drama (<i>The</i> <i>Unbearable Lightness
of Being</i>, <i>Good Evening, Mr. Wallenberg</i>, <i>Amistad</i>), sexually charged
stories (<i>Breaking the Waves</i>) and even TV serials and family fare (nothing
that&#146;s available stateside). With <i>Insomnia</i>, the directorial debut of
31-year-old Erik Skjoldbjaerg, Skarsgaard continues to mine an oddly appealing weariness
that imbues even his most flawed characters with a frayed dignity. As an added bonus to
the purist the Home Vision Cinema rental VHS is available in the letterboxed format; the
DVD is set to street July 27.</p>

<p>This isn&#146;t a bad Steven Seagal film, as Steven Seagal films go, typically strident
in that idealistic, Billy Jack kind of way yet shunned by the Seagal faithful, who
complained of a lack of action (which says more about his audience than it does about the
movie). He&#146;s Dr. Wesley McClaren, a world-class immunologist who&#146;s decamped for
rural Montana and a quiet life healing animals and townspeople with eastern medicine when
not imparting earth-friendly wisdom to his daughter Holly (Camilla Belle) and trading
jibes with grizzled farmhand Frank (L.Q. Jones, eternally famous for appearances in Sam
Peckinpah films and the creation of the legendary Don Johnson genre film <i>A Boy and His
Dog</i>). When a local freedom fighter (character vet Gailard Sartain) infects the town
with a purloined government virus, it&#146;s up to the self-described &quot;pathogen
posse&quot; to find a cure (Holly being immune helps) and thwart the threat to national
security and that feel-good vibe. Seagal&#146;s films play handily into the both the pride
and fears of his target audience, which undercuts the somewhat mawkish sincerity he brings
to even his most preposterous vehicles. More fascinating than off-putting to the average
viewer, this is perhaps a good introduction to a guy who&#146;s often thought of as the
Vanilla Ice of movie stars. The no-nonsense DVD is presented in the widescreen format,
which highlights the open-air locations selected by director Dean Semler.</p>

<p>One of the tangible benefits of those ubiquitous made-for-cable movies is that a
pleasing percentage of them are quite good. <i>A Soldier&#146;s Sweetheart</i> is better
than most, a tough, moody and altogether original spin on the Vietnam war movie (this
explains the picture&#146;s screenings at last year&#146;s Seattle and Toronto film
festivals prior to it&#146;s December debut on Showtime). Adapted from the Tim
O&#146;Brien short story &quot;Sweetheart of the Song Tra Bong&quot; and filmed with
serene authority by adapter-director Thomas Michael Donnelly on atmospheric locations in
and around Auckland, New Zealand, the film tells of bored medic Mark Fossie (Skeet
Ulrich), who spices up his life at a remote surgical unit by scheming to fly his
girlfriend Marianne Bell (Georgina Cates) in from America for a visit. At first fascinated
by her new and exotic surroundings -- and welcomed by the other medics (including cynical
narrator Rat Kiley, played by Kiefer Sutherland) -- Marianne is soon affected by the
menace around her and becomes increasingly fascinated with the secretive Green Beret
special forces unit, the &quot;Greenies,&quot; bivouacked next door. Year by year, young
Sutherland is building a fine career on pungent character turns -- much as his father did
a generation ago. Ulrich too seems focused on the nuances of his character, and the
late-arriving Cates helps to sustain the eerie tone. &quot;Everything I want is right
here,&quot; Marianne tells Mark as things start to get really weird, and adventurous
moviegoers who give this title a shot will find the film absorbing, disquieting and
provocative. To date this title is exclusive to videocassette.</p>

<p>In the early 1990s, classically trained musician Odette Springer came to Hollywood and
got a job as a music supervisor for Roger Corman. &quot;How did I go from Beethoven to B
movies?&quot; she asked herself. &quot;I never admitted it to myself, but stories about
women in jeopardy were beginning to inspire me.&quot; This film is her revealing journey
to an answer, with observations from genre mainstays Sam Arkoff, Fred Olen Ray and Corman
(who says his films have a &quot;liberal humanitarian viewpoint buried somewhere beneath
some wild exploitation subjects&quot;) as well as younger directors Catherine Cyran, Jim
Wynorski (&quot;I have no desire to go and make an art fart film&quot;), Chuck Moore,
Nancy Zala and others. Clips from films with titles like <i>The Sorceress</i>, <i>Midnight
Tease</i> and <i>Angel of Destruction</i> are interspersed with profiles of actresses
Maria Ford, Julie Strain (1993 &quot;Penthouse&quot; Pet of the Year) and interviews with
story editors, other cast members and crew. Ultimately, Springer finds a disturbing yet
apparently liberating truth in this unique film, part B movie primer, part biography and
part confessional. Tape only to date.</p>
