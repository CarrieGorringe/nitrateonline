<p><big><strong><big>T</big></strong>he best scene in Mel Gibson&#146;s latest action
vehicle, <i>Payback</i>, involves his determined character Porter demanding money from a
crime syndicate boss played by James Coburn. Coburn plays a dapper, appearance-conscious
mobster lugging alligator-skinned suitcases after returning home from vacation. After he
refuses to pay the money, Porter shoots his costly luggage full of holes. &quot;Hey, stop
that!&quot;, protests Coburn, turning from vicious crime patriarch to sensitive victim.
&quot;Shooting a man&#146;s luggage -- that&#146;s just plain mean.&quot;</big></p>

<p>It&#146;s a funny scene from a movie that could have benefited from this lighter touch
more often. However, it&#146;s sandwiched in between the antics of a sadomasochistic
double-crosser who disdainfully tosses a woman across a room before threatening,
&quot;I&#146;m gonna screw you seven ways from Sunday&quot;, and a crime syndicate&#146;s
tendency to use a sledgehammer to the toes as an information-extracting method. The change
in tone seems jarring. And when it&#146;s slathered in green and blue tones that make the
viewer wonder if something didn&#146;t go dreadfully wrong during the final development
process, <i>Payback </i>comes across as cheap and ugly -- a second-string Mel movie.</p>
<i>

<p><img src="Images/rpayback-2.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="112" HEIGHT="150">Payback</i> opens
with a number of scenes designed to set Porter up as an unsympathetic antihero. His junkie
wife, played by Deborah Kara Unger, shoots him in the back following a heist in which she
and his accomplice Val (Gregg Henry) make off with the loot in a cold double-cross,
leaving Porter for dead. After a sleazy doctor offers him a swig of whiskey and removes
the bullets, Porter is out hustling, rebounding, and waiting for the right time to extract
revenge and reclaim his dough. In an introductory collage of scenes, he&#146;s seen
stealing credit cards to buy suave suits, and robbing a street beggar of his money-filled
hat. He&#146;s remorseless and hardboiled, a typical film noir antihero whom you admire
for his ruthless self-sufficiency while wincing at his means to such a self-serving end.</p>

<p>The remainder of the movie follows Porter on his single-minded quest to retrieve
$70,000, his share of the heist money. He discovers his wife strung out on heroin: when
her dealer comes calling, Porter convinces him to hand over information on Val&#146;s
whereabouts by plucking out a nose ring. A few frames later, he&#146;s putting a bullet
through the head of Val, whom Porter learns has handed over all the money over to an oily
crime syndicate in an effort to buy his way in. Then the scene is set for Gibson&#146;s
greenback-motivated scuzzball to confront the mobsters and insist on the punctual return
of his $70,000. One by one, he works his way up the hierarchy of syndicate overlords. Does
he get his money? Can Mad Max drive a tanker through a gauntlet of mohawked thugs? </p>

<p><img src="Images/rpayback-3.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="112" HEIGHT="150"><em>Payback</em>
has a lot of typical Gibson-movie staples, the most obvious being a masochistic torture
scene in which Mel demonstrates that mutilation is the best prerequisite to success. In <i>Mad
Max</i>, Gibson&#146;s family was run down by a group of vicious post-apocalyptic bikers;
in the film&#146;s sequel, he&#146;s run off the road by another group of hot-rodding
thugs, which then kills his dog with a crossbow. In <i>Lethal Weapon</i>, he&#146;s
electrocuted by Gary Busey, and in <i>Braveheart</i>, he&#146;s disemboweled in a public
Gibson-gutting that one would think might put a cap on this tired tradition. But he ups
the ante here, with a scene involving a sledgehammer applied to his toes. Unless he
reverts to hack comedy mode and churns out more films like <i>Bird on a Wire</i>,
anticipate a Gibson decapitation or chainsaw demise coming to a theater near you in the
future.</p>

<p>The thing that&#146;s most fun about <i>PayBack </i>is its cast of supporting
characters. Most of them have played unsympathetic sadists in past seventies crime
melodramas, but they&#146;ve been relatively mute during the current decade. To see them
parading through a late-nineties flick like this conjures forth nostalgic, if not
altogether pleasant, memories of past neo noir appearances. William Devane plays an
underwritten upper-rung syndicate crook much like the one he played in <i>Marathon Man</i>,
where he was in cahoots with Laurence Olivier&#146;s torturous Nazi dentist. His shady
face and oversized teeth ooze menace. Ditto for John Glover, whose unkempt bomb-planter
harks back to the crazed pornographer and blackmailer he played in 1986&#146;s <i>52
Pickup</i>. Gregg Henry&#146;s initiation into Hollywood crime capers started with his
appearance as a U.S. politician offering government assist to a Colombian drug overlord in
Brian DePalma&#146;s <i>Scarface</i> remake. Other seventies mainstays Coburn and Kris
Kristofferson also make appearances as nineties-style creeps. </p>

<p><img src="Images/rpayback-4.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="112" HEIGHT="150">However, this
parade of &quot;where are they now&quot; film faces is about the only thing interesting
about <i>Payback</i>. Gibson&#146;s strength has always been the unbridled enthusiasm he
throws into his roles. In this movie, he&#146;s restrained and emotionally detached. This
might be the idea, but in the end, Porter&#146;s payback seems matter-of-fact and
unimportant, when compared to the cathartic release of a Martin Riggs going ballistic or a
William Wallace dodging arrows. Meanwhile, the combination of sadism and understated humor
doesn&#146;t flow the way it did in such Elmore Leonard-inspired crime outings as <a href="../rgetshrt.html" target="_top"><em>Get Shorty</em></a> and <a href="../rjackieb.html" target="_top"><em>Jackie
Brown</em></a>. Add the godawful blue-green tint that shrouds each frame of Payback, and
you&#146;re left with the experience of watching a faded seventies crime video: ugly to
look at, and familiar in content. Save yourself some money and rent the real deal instead
(preferably John Boorman&#146;s late sixties classic <em>Point Blank</em>, which, like <em>Payback</em>,
based its story on the novel &quot;The Hunter&quot;, by Richard Stark). </p>
