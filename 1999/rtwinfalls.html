twins are nothing new to the cinema, particularly those of us familiar with the
Hilton Sisters, who died more than 30 years ago after having lived an incredible
60 years together and who appeared in the quintessential 1930s horror film <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Freaks</i> as well as starring in the 1950 exploitation drama <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Chained
for Life</i>. Some of the off-hand banter (“Maybe I’ll call you when I’m
single.”) in the new art house entry <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Twin
Falls Idaho</i> is reminiscent of the earlier Tod Browning fright-fest although
the present effort is definitely one that grovels in close relationships and
dark, moody textures instead of blood-curdling revenge. As written by Mark
Polish and his identical twin Michael, the latter also directing with a steady
yet lethargic hand (obviously his left), Blake and Francis Falls (Mark and
Michael, right to left as you look at them) create a haunting relationship that
is poignant, sensational, and filled with more low-key intensity that you’ll
likely see among this year’s Oscar contenders, at least based on 1999 releases
to date. Their strongly defined performances power this strangely crafted
feature about searching for a birth mother and attempting to find closure as
tragedy nears.</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">Running at 105 minutes, the Polish brothers’ propensity
for drawn out dialogue and whispered, shorthanded asides, coupled with a
close-in camera baring their intimate lifestyle as it flounders in a dismal,
fleabag hotel, makes the film seem longer than it actually is. Fast-food cinema
junkies may not appreciate this movie, chock full of duality symbolism and
mildly amusing references to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Cosmopolitan</i>
tests of compatibility, but you will feel uncomfortably satiated at what these
twins have accomplished and how believable it all appears. The unseen harness
that Mark and Michael must have used to carry off this ruse brings to mind the
makeup work of Lon Chaney, Sr., the “Man of a Thousand Faces,” whose
masterful silent film characterizations often involved incredible physical
hardship.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Extraordinarily photographed in all its bleakness by M.
David Mullen, who sketches a Edvard Munch landscape keyed on murky interiors
(designed by Warren Alan Young) and drab florescent colors, the film follows the
Falls brothers after their arrival in a nondescript town (Kernsville according
to their birth certificate) on the eve of their 25th birthday. Penny, a
warm-hearted prostitute heavy into dark eyeliner and ordered up by or for
Francis as a natal day present, finds release from her own dreary existence by
befriending the lonesome and emaciated brothers (cotton candy and chocolate cake
obviously not being the cornerstone of a nutritious diet, and stay away from the
tap water!). In an effort to balance her karma, she shares what little she has
to offer, including the social intimacy of a doctor (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
Pretender</i>’s Patrick Bauchau) who diagnoses Francis’ failing heart.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Newcomer Michele Hicks, a former model, makes a notable
debut as a semi-worldly yet homeless hooker that sees past the freakish nature
of the Siamese twins and creates a most interesting, nearly sexless, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ménage
à trois</i>, portended by a low angle shot early in the film in which she is
framed between the boys’ heads. Harping back to my <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Freaks</i>
riff and that film’s climactic wedding dinner at a table filled with carny
folk (“Gooble, gobble. Gooble, gobble. We accept you. We accept you. One of
us. One of us.”), Michelle is accepted into the small company of oddfellows
and is cast out by some of her normal “friends,” including her pimp
girlfriend Sissy (Teresa Hill), Jay (Jon Gries), a slimy, gold-chained
entertainment attorney, and Tre (Ant), a hermaphrodite photographer intent on
becoming the next Diane Arbus.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Other roles are redemptive in nature, in tune with the
film’s “kindness of strangers” motif (excepting Bauchau’s role),
including Francine (Lesley Ann Warren), the boys’ reluctant mother who
abandoned them in lieu of her inability to deal with their physical limitations
and her mental shortcomings, a local surgeon (William Katt), and a lightly
comedic Jesus figure (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">SNL</i> original
Garrett Morris), indeed a neighborly savior. As small as their parts are, they
all add depth to the Polish brothers claustrophobic world, especially the
teary-eyed Warren (also seen in Kevin Williamson’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Teaching
Mrs. Tingle</i>), as she covers the sleeping Blake and Francis with their baby
blanket.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In the end, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Twin
Falls Idaho</i> is a small, poignant gem despite its laggardly pacing.
Definitely an off-beat, side show attraction, but with three big rings of heart,
character, and soul.</p>
