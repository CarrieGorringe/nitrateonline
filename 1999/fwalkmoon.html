<i><b>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Paula Nechak:</font></b></i> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> Your grandfather was a risk-taker. He rebelled against the
mainstream idea of the big studio system. He was a wild card. Do you feel compelled to
follow the genetic trail? You have picked iffy projects in your career - gay characters,
errant husbands, villains - you seem to lack the fear of stereotyping that plagues most
big-name &quot;movie stars.&quot;</font></p>
<i><b>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Tony Goldwyn:</font></b></i> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> Absolutely. People ask what I gained in this business from my
grandfather and father. I knew nothing about the business aspect (laughs). My parents kept
us away from the Hollywood swirl with good reason. But by osmosis, if there is anything I
was handed down it was the sense of independent spirit. Anytime I've been presented with a
challenge, where the conventional wisdom was &quot;be careful,&quot; I tended to say
&quot;screw that.&quot; If it moves me I'm gonna do it. The whole idea of playing a gay
character was funny in retrospect because I had just had my big film opportunity in <i>Ghost</i>.
Suddenly I was hot. But I'd been doing this great, beautiful Australian play called
&quot;The Sum Of Us&quot; at Williamstown and I played the gay son. It was about to move
to New York, Off-Broadway. People said I shouldn't do it because <i>Ghost</i> was a hit. I
thought, &quot;This is a great part.&quot; They said, &quot;You're crazy.&quot;
Everybody's anxiety appeared and that made me want to do it more. So, yes, if something's
been handed down it's the risk-taking mentality as a way of constantly re-defining myself.
And you have to do that in Hollywood unless you want to make the same thing over and over.
You can make money doing the same stuff, but I knew it was the road to misery.</font></p>

<i><b>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">PN:</font></b></i> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> Did you ever feel, with your extensive resume in all mediums, that you
could have directed some of your projects better than the director assigned?</font></p>
<i><b>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">TG:</font></b></i> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> Never. I never wanted to direct. I looked at the directors I had worked
with and thought, &quot;Oh man, that's not for me.&quot; They looked so stressed out,
exhausted and besieged by schedules, budgets and the studio's yelling at them. There was
this incredible responsibility to the job and it held no appeal for me. My father had been
telling me for years that I should direct and that I had more to offer than just acting. I
originally looked at <i>A Walk On the Moon</i> to act in and produce so I could control my
career in the long run because I wanted the leverage to do what I wanted to do. I read
tons of material and I loved Pamela's script but I also thought that I wasn't quite right
for either of the male leads. But I wanted to meet the writer and we did, we started
talking and I told her I thought the script needed some very specific work but that I
loved it. Pamela asked if I would play Walker Jerome (ultimately played by Viggo
Mortensen) and I said okay. We worked on it for a couple of years and had a director
attached who fell out so I just sat on it. I mean, I couldn't give it away, so literally,
one morning I had a flash that said, &quot;I have to direct this myself.&quot; That was
six months before we were in business.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<i><b>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">PN:</font></b></i> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> How did Harvey Weinstein at Miramax come onboard?</font></p>
<i><b>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">TG:</font></b></i> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> That came later. First it was Dustin Hoffman. Dustin had developed projects
for years and never made anything. He finally got financing and decided he wanted to get
serious about making movies and supporting young filmmakers. We were the first, so it was
serendipity. I was in Deauville for <i>The Substance of Fire</i> and got a call from him.
I brought in the script and they simply said, &quot;Please don't show this to anyone else.
We want to make it.&quot; That year at Cannes they announced a deal with Village Roadshow.
Once we had a rough cut, we shopped the film at the American Film Market and Harvey and
Bob bought it.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<i><b>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">PN:</font></b></i> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> One of the directors you worked with [on <i>The Substance of Fire</i>] was
the theatre director, Dan Sullivan, who left The Seattle Repertory Theatre a few years ago
and moved to New York. Was it easy to work on a film with a man who is best known for
directing plays? Did the styles and sensibilities clash?</font></p>
<i><b>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">TG:</font></b></i> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> He's the best director. In directing my film and in trying to define myself
as I approached the project, I thought back on everyone I worked with to try and draw on
what I found valuable to emulate in directing, and although Dan and I are very different
people, his style was amazing. He doesn't say a lot but he says the right things. His
economy is brilliant - he doesn't coddle, he doesn't stroke, he isn't temperamental. As a
result, there isn't a lot of extraneous bullshit where, as an actor, you have to figure
out what he's really trying to say. There's no manipulation, no abstract discussions. He's
a laser.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<i><b>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">PN:</font></b></i> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> After watching <i>A Walk On the Moon</i> I was struck by your cast and the
fact that in many ways, they seemed like fringe actors. Again, that's an element of
risk-taking on your part. Was it intentional? Do you prefer to work with actors as well
who are construed as fellow risk-takers?</font></p>
<i><b>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">TG:</font></b></i> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> It wasn't directly intentional, however with every choice I made, I was
obsessed with not going the obvious way. I wanted to avoid the obvious cliches, especially
doing a piece set in 1969 in a Jewish milieu. That very much fell in the casting of it
because with every character I went away from what you'd expect. I mean, Diane Lane is not
your obvious Jewish girl from Brooklyn, but Diane embodied something inside that was what
I wanted in Pearl. That she wasn't Jewish made Dustin a little nervous but we knew she was
the right actress. Liev has a fierce intelligence as a man that avoids the cliché of
Marty being a schlubby guy who's unconscious to his wife's cheating. With Viggo, I wanted
to avoid the stud-muffin hippie and with him, not that he isn't sexy or handsome, he
brings a lot to the party and he's complicated and mysterious. All these actors have been
around for a long time and I identify with them as an actor myself. If you want to do
eclectic things, you have a harder time in Hollywood. The business is about selling and
marketing and it's tough to sell someone if you don't know who they are. Viggo is like
that; he's conflicted about fame and being a leading man. With Anna Paquin's role, I
needed an actress of depth, intelligence and sophistication. There are very few young
actors around who could embody the character's qualities. Anna read the script and said,
&quot;There are so few things you read when you're at that exact moment in your life, and
I'm at that exact moment in my life.&quot; (laughs) It's an interesting question you've
asked, so, yeah.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<i><b>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">PN:</font></b></i> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> In the '40s, <i>A Walk On the Moon</i> would have been considered a woman's
picture and it would have been directed by George Cukor or Douglas Sirk. Did you have any
trepidation toward crossing into that genre?</font></p>
<i><b>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">TG:</font></b></i> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> Not at all. I never thought about it in terms of commerciality, only
&quot;this moves me.&quot; That's the launch word, I've learned, for choosing material to
direct. As an actor you can do the job and since you have no control over the end result
anyway, it's easier to make a semi-casual decision. As a director, you live and breathe
it. It would be torture to do something because you only thought it would speak to a
certain audience, or avoid something that moves you because it might be tricky in the
marketplace. This film interested me though it's uncommercial; it was challenging.</font></p>
<hr size="1">

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><em><strong>PN: </strong></em>Still, it's not like Oliver Stone making Platoon.
He was part of a small group who were there, in Vietnam, and since most of us only saw
newsreel footage of the War, we didn't know its nuances, its truths. This film is a period
piece, but more of us grew up in it. We have very specific memories of the era. How do you
make a film that has personal, vivid inner life for many people, universal without
grasping at clich¾ s?</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><em><strong>TG: </strong></em>Just that; be as specific as possible. The reason the
'60s interested me was on film so many people leap to the obvious song, the flower power,
the cliche. It was our watch word to avoid on this film. So yeah, it has to do with
specificity. What's the detail? We opted for the emotions of the piece as opposed to the
period. Look at us in this room. What's the period? I'm not sure; look at our clothes.
1990's, right? What are the clues? The important thing is we're in conversation that feels
real. It tells us where we are as opposed to one of us wearing a Monica Lewinsky button
that signals, &quot;Get it? This is the '90s.&quot; I eradicated that kind of stuff from
the script. And I knew nothing about this milieu - this was Pamela's world - but the human
details absolved us from the clich¾ .</font></p>

<hr size="1">

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><em><strong>PN: </strong></em>You captured the essence, anyway; the restlessness, the
shift in thinking, the chafe that comes with change.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><em><strong>TG:</strong></em> That's the whole thing; that's right.</font></p>

<hr size="1">

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><em><strong>PN: </strong></em>Now you've done this; you've directed your first film and
have a couple more lined up. So what would you be doing if all of this fell away? If you
never had any of this life in film and the theater?</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><em><strong>TG:</strong></em> I don't think I could do anything else. I didn't ever
want to be in the movie business, I wanted to do something else originally because I
didn't want to be viewed as following in anyone's footsteps. But in high school I fell in
love with acting - and as any actor will tell you, it's undeniable; you have to do it. The
family aspect was a real negative, a real drag. My father worried about me because he knew
it's a risky profession, so it wasn't a natural, easy step or a career that can be easily
navigated. It was scary. But the reason I did it was because there's nothing else I can
do. Having now branched into directing, I see I do have other skills like leadership and
management. I feel lucky every day to make a go of something I love. That's the whole
trick of it.</font></p>
