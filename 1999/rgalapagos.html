<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><b><font size="5">I</font></b><font size="4">MAX,
the really big-screen projection system that has captivated museum audiences and
a growing number of commercial screens around of the world, is now even bigger
than life on the seven-story tall screen at the Samuel C. Johnson Theater in the
National Museum of Natural History here in Washington, D.C., with the world
premiere this week of the latest monstrous 3-D presentation, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Galapagos</i>.
This mini-feature adds an incredible dimension in granting viewers the widest
panoramic vistas and the in-your-face close-up views of some of nature’s most
interesting creatures. The logistical nightmare in preparing this forty-minute
educational travelogue (more on that below) makes me wonder if watching films
like this, even if your eyes are covered with oversized polarized glasses, is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">better</i> than being there. IMAX films tend to be breath-taking in
their scope and this one guarantees to knock your socks off but, if you’re too
close to the screen, maybe give you a case of vertigo. Being up front in an IMAX
auditorium positions you for an image several stories high; add in the 3-D
factor and you might feel like you’re watching a giant version of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
Blair Witch Project</i>. It’s obviously a conditioned reflex concerning how we
focus, in much the same way you might force focus on a finger held about a foot
from your face and then trying to converge on the background. This is especially
noticeable when the camera abruptly shifts from black lava rock landscapes to a
closer examination of the archipelago’s denizens. At other times, you stretch
out your hand in front of you to try and touch the fish in front of you. The
filmmakers occasionally resort to the usual 3-D trick shots, including undersea
laser beams or the heavy cable reaching out from deep in the screen background.
Despite its lack of a dramatic punch -- the story is barely shown -- the film is
a must see for its stunning three-dimensional exploration of the animals found
among lush island vegetation or the sea creatures found deep within the ocean
depths. As a medium for showing the study of evolution and biodiversity in this
part of the world, this film can’t be topped.<o:p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">The
National Museum of Natural History has 7 <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">million</i>
visitors per year, many of them now spending the extra $6.50 (adults) or a buck
less for kids to watch oversized images of iguanas, sea lions, hammerhead
sharks, moray eels, huge tortoises, and abundant other beasts strut their stuff.
With only two IMAX screens in town (the other is at the National Air and Space
Museum), the captive audience can lead to sizable profits and surprisingly large
weekly per screen averages. For 1999, two of the top ten films (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Everest</i>
and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">T-Rex: Back to the Cretaceous</i>) are
IMAX productions. And while expensive to produce -- <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Galapagos</i> cost $2,000 for every three minutes of film exposed --
they play continuously week after week. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">T-Rex</i>
has parked a nearly $25 million total, while <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Everest</i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>has scaled $73
million.<o:p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">The
tapestry is diverse and the wildlife extraordinary off the coast of Ecuador as
captured by the only two IMAX 3-D cameras in existence. Undersea
director-cinematographer Al Giddings (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
Deep</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Abyss</i>, and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Titanic</i>)
and documentary director-producer-writer David Clark split the machines to
tackle above ground and underwater sequences, the latter providing for a lot of
innovation to allow for sensational subsurface footage, including simulating
life at 3,000 feet down. Using Harbor Branch Oceanographic Institution’s
Research Vessel SEWARD JOHNSON as the mother ship and the high-tech submersible
JOHNSON-SEA-LINK, the research team of marine biologists, headed by Dr. Carole
Baldwin of the Smithsonian Institution, a reluctant “star,” the formidable
task of dealing with the film’s “heavy” -- the 1,700-pound camera
surrounded by a large casing. It took ten people to get the camera in the water
and between two and five to handle it afterwards. The sheer bulk of the
contraption forced careful planning by the production team, as Giddings noted
that “reloading film into the camera also took about an hour and a half.”
From the look of the film you’d never know about the technical challenges
involved.<o:p>

Isham, nominated for an Oscar for his music to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">A River Runs Through It</i>, adds an out-of-world score that compliments
the mesmerizing images, including a dark, tonal ominous riff when some dangerous
morays unexpectedly creep up on Dr. Baldwin. Kenneth Branagh provides a sparse
narration.</span></p>
