<p><big><strong><big>N</big></strong>obody in Havana today seems to remember exactly where
the legendary Buena Vista Social Club was, much less the people who played there, but that
didn&#146;t stop world music icon Ry Cooder from tracking down some of the key Cuban
musicians under that banner and making a sexy, sinewy record of <i>son</i>, or popular,
standards old and new which subsequently won the 1998 Grammy for Best Tropical Latin
Performance. Cooder subsequently interested Wim Wenders -- for whom he&#146;d composed the
scores to <i>Paris, Texas</i> and <i>The End of Violence</i> -- to document the new
sessions and subsequent concert performances in Amsterdam and New York City. The result is
a shimmering Dolby triumph of passion over the clock, as these exuberant elders reminisce
and perform in a stylized yet straight-ahead documentary that is Wenders&#146; most
accessible work in the genre to date.</big></p>

<p>The occasion of the studio and interview material that comprises the bulk of the film
was a recording session in March 1998 behind BVSC vocalist Ibrahim Ferrer, whom Cooder
calls &quot;the Cuban Nat King Cole.&quot; During the course of these rehearsals, as they
work through their repertoire and prepare for the concerts, &quot;los superablos,&quot; or
&quot;The Super-Grandfathers,&quot; as they&#146;ve come to be known in Cuba, emerge in
laid-back interviews on colorful locations as still-feisty individuals: </font>There&#146;s
90-year-old guitarist Compay Segundo, who has five children and is confidently
&quot;working on the sixth&quot;; showboating pianist Ruben Gonzalez (whose stage moves at
80 would put most contemporary bands to shame); Barbarito Torres, who in concert stops the
show by playing the laud, or guitar, behind his back (and at 42 is the youngster of the
group); and comically histrionic singer Manuel &quot;Puntillita&quot; Licea, who makes the
most of a feature vocal that begins with the line &quot;Tula&#146;s bedroom&#146;s gone up
in flames.&quot;</p>

<p>Wisely, Wenders lets the music and the sprightly people who make it speak for
themselves, although the director&#146;s ongoing fascination with the urban environment is
in top form as Joerg Widmer&#146;s camera serenely cruises the dawn streets of Havana
(actually filmed on their way in from the airport when the crew arrived) and circles the
rehearsing musicians seductively. <font FACE="TIMES">Cinematographer Robby Muller was in
charge of the Amsterdam concert footage and long-time Wenders associate Lisa Rinzler
followed the wide-eyed band through the streets of New York City with a digital Beta
camera. The visual strategy of over-saturating the already vibrant Havana material and
under-saturating the shadowy Dutch show combines with the shimmering Dolby SRD sound to
create a warm world of creativity and joy. </p>

<p>Watching this celebration of spirit over time with these remarkable, eternally young
musicians, the effect is not unlike the effects of the fabled Fountain of Youth (even
those who don&#146;t dance will begin to move a little -- this is some of the sexiest
music on the planet). Wenders seems to be saying &quot;Look, see? There&#146;s no
substitute for experience,&quot; and he&#146;s refreshingly, inspiringly right.</p>
