<p><strong><big><big><em><a name="Antz" href="../rantz.html" target="_top">Antz</a></em> (USA, 1998)</big></big></strong></p>

<p>The initial salvo in the battle of the animated bug wars, DreamWorks SKG's <em>Antz</em>
is undeniably astonishing to look at, but isn't nearly as rousing as Disney's subsequent <em>A
Bug's Lif</em>e on the script level, offering an unsatisfying cross between technical
gloss and thin story that says more about the high-stakes world of contemporary animated
film than it does about pleasing the child within each patron. Even in voice only Woody
Allen is annoying as dyspeptic worker ant Z-4195, who rebels against his lowly existence
by sweeping Princess Bala (Sharon Stone) off her feet and thwarting the efforts of evil
General Mandible (Gene Hackman) to do in the entire colony. Jarringly, while some
characters in Antz look more like their human counterparts than others (the celebrity
voice cast includes Sylvester Stallone, Jennifer Lopez, Christopher Walken, Anne Bancroft
and Paul Mazursky), none of the characters are even of the cute-gross variety kids like;
rather, they're downright grotesque, sort of like those sad, large-eyed kids and animals
in cheap paintings. And come on, ants with perfect teeth? Too pseudo-hip for kids, far too
simplistic for adults and much too dramatically overblown for the simple messages of its
story, the movie tries to make a mountain out of an anthill. One doesn't want to dismiss
the exciting technical achievement on display in Antz out of hand, but it's a pity there
couldn't have been more steak with the sizzle. Buyer beware: if you're looking to own Antz
(and there's also a dubbed Spanish language version available), be prepared to spend a few
dollars more, as the list price is $26.98.</p>

<p><strong><big><big><em><a name="Vampires" href="../rvampires.html" target="_top">John Carpenter's
Vampires</a></em> (USA, 1997)</big></big></strong></p>

<p>&quot;We kill vampires,&quot; says Montoya (Billy Baldwin) to questioning hooker
Katrina (Sheryl Lee), and that pretty much sums up this new movie from genre mainstay John
Carpenter (<em>Halloween</em>, the remake of <em>The Thing</em>). In the sun-baked New
Mexico desert, lifelong vampire hunter Jack Crow (James Woods) and his dwindling band of
bad asses pursue Valek (Thomas Ian Griffith), a sort of supersucker (&quot;master,&quot;
in the well-thought-out vernacular adapted from John Steakley's novel) who is on the verge
of figuring out how to do his business in the daytime. True to form, <em>Vampires</em> --
we'll shorten Carpenter's traditional, unwieldy possessory title -- highlights the best
and worst of the director's uneven career: absorbing, gore-filled action set pieces (not
for the squeamish) on annoyingly cheesy sets are sprinkled throughout a wildly implausible
and often howlingly stupid story in which the three human leads often seem completely
lost. Although <em>Vampires</em> is Carpenter's most accomplished movie in quite some time
(at least since 1988's <em>They Live</em>), it once again exhibits a nearly fatal
distraction, as if the natural flow of human interaction that is the connective tissue of
any halfway decent movie is either too trivial to be bothered with or is maybe beyond his
abilities altogether at this point. Worth seeing for the zesty action (even now, nobody
does cross-cutting, tracking shots and intuitive coverage quite like John Carpenter), <em>Vampires</em>
is yet another frustrating chapter in a career that has promised a great deal more than it
has delivered. Also available day-and-date with the VHS tape is a DVD edition, featuring
audio commentary from Carpenter and the obligatory theatrical trailers. And of further
interest to the director's long-suffering fans, his first feature, the spoofy, low-budget <em>Dark
Star</em> (which was made in collaboration with Dan O'Bannon, who went on to write the
original Alien), will be coming to DVD on February 23.</p>

<p><strong><big><big><em><a href="../rmulan.html" name="Mulan" target="_top">Mulan</a></em> (USA, 1998)</big></big></strong></p>

<p>Skillfully adapting an ancient Chinese legend to a contemporary Disney mold, <em>Mulan</em>
tells of the independent young title character, who rebels against the plans of her family
and culture and masquerades as a boy to become a warrior in the Imperial Army's battle
against the invading Huns (she goes in place of her proud but infirmed father). Through
grit and determination, bravery and guile, she helps turn the sincere but ragtag gaggle of
soldiers into a fighting unit. An improbable subject for the Disney animation treatment --
to say the least -- this is actually one of more satisfying of the studio's recent string
of box office successes, a perky, colorful saga that smartly balances comedy and drama by
minimizing the anthropomorphized sidekicks and maximizing the action (best sequence: a
spectacular mountain battle that culminates in a harrowing avalanche and rescue). Ming-Na
Wen gives sprightly voice to Mulan, supported by Eddie Murphy's blustery, wise-cracking
dragon Mushu and Miguel Ferrer as head Hun Shan-Yu (other voice talent includes George
Takei from the original &quot;Star Trek,&quot; Gedde Watanabe from &quot;E.R.,&quot; B.D.
Wong and the immortal June Foray). Jerry Goldsmith wrote the music, and Matthew Wilder's
songs include &quot;True to Your Heart,&quot; performed by Stevie Wonder with 98 Degrees.
As with <em>Antz</em>, <em>Mulan</em> has a slightly higher price point ($26.98), and is
also available in a Spanish-language edition (dubbed, not subtitled).</p>

<p><strong><big><big><em><a href="../rpecker.html" name="Pecker" target="_top">Pecker</a></em> (USA,
1998)</big></big></strong></p>

<p>Although each of his films has a strong streak of sentimentality, &quot;sweet&quot; is
not a word usually linked with Baltimore-based filmmaker John Waters, creator of such
notoriously -- and inspirationally -- trashy movies as <em>Hairspray</em>, <em>Polyester</em>
and the immortal, unclassifiable <em>Pink Flamingos</em>. Yet that's exactly what <em>Pecker</em>
is: a sweet, slight and altogether surprisingly graceful ode to family values, community
pride and irredeemable eccentricity. Edward Furlong is sublime as the title character --
the nickname refers to the finicky way he eats (which of course we never see) -- an
amateur photographer who is discovered by vivacious but shallow New York agent Rorey
Wheeler (Lili Taylor). After initially succumbing to the evil lure of New York City,
Pecker comes to realize that you can take the boy out of Baltimore but you can't take
Baltimore out of the boy. Nurturing him throughout his travails are a gallery of appealing
eccentrics that include a miscast but game Christina Ricci as his laundromat-managing
girlfriend Shelly, Brendan Sexton III as his shoplifting pal Matt, Lauren Hulsey as Little
Chrissy, Jean Schertler as his odd but lovable grandmother, Mary Kay Place as his sunny
mother, and a whole slew of distinctive locals. After years of such skewed nostalgia as <em>Cry-Baby</em>
and unfocused comedy as <em>Serial Mom</em>, Waters has regained the distinctive
equilibrium of his early work and seems newly able to weave social satire into engaging
narrative situations. To be fair, the days of promoting a movie like <em>Pink Flamingos</em>
with showmanly pizzazz and little fear of censure are long gone, but you've got to hand it
to a guy who positions his directing title card over a shot of rats mating. And how ironic
is it that <em>Pecker</em> barely made a dent at the box office, while <em>There's
Something About Mary</em> wouldn't even exist without Waters' legacy of bad taste? The
Special Edition DVD features audio commentary, interviews, the theatrical trailer and a
photo gallery.</p>

<p><strong><big><big><em><a href="../rpmagic.html" name="Practical_Magic" target="_top">Practical Magic</a></em>
(USA, 1998) </big></big></strong></p>

<p>That crazy witchcraft gets a surprisingly agreeable chick flick treatment and the
nostrum almost takes, until the curse of Hollywood special effects and dubious logic cast
a dark spell over the impractical third act. <em>Practical Magic</em> begins as a
stimulating brew of <em>Beetlejuice</em>, &quot;Bewitched&quot; and a modified &quot;The
Munsters,&quot; as it casts an appealing, if somewhat cloying spell of sisterhood and
security (does anybody really own and live in houses like these?) while exploring the
effects of special powers on a benevolent family that includes Sandra Bullock and Nicole
Kidman as sisters cursed by their dying mother to spell certain death to any man who
marries them. Coached by swingin' aunts Dianne Wiest and Stockard Channing, the girls
learn about love and pain in the hunky forms of Aidann Quinn and Goran Visnjic. In the
end, however, <em>Practical Magic</em> is caught between familial and sensationalist
sensibilities and can be true to neither without serious dramatic sacrifice. Add to that
the calculated and predictable use of high-profile chick flick songs -- just when you
think the movie is like watching a Stevie Nicks album, sure enough, she caterwauls over
the closing credits -- and the movie has the potential to be positively annoying for those
not caught up in the spirit of the proceedings. Two thirds of a very good movie about that
little bit of witch in women and the mischief of which they're capable in the name of
love, this incarnation of <em>Practical Magic</em> could've used a last-minute exorcism of
its last two reels. Also available in a Spanish subtitled edition and a DVD, which sports
a theatrical trailer, interactive games, a featurette and audio commentary.</p>

<p><strong><big><big><em><a href="../rronin.html" name="Ronin" target="_top">Ronin</a></em> (USA, 1998)</big></big></strong></p>

<p><em>Ronin</em> rocks. Taut, taciturn and terrific, this out-of-nowhere new action
classic marked a defiant return to form for director John Frankenheimer (<em>The
Manchurian Candidate</em>) and a vibrant update of the moody thrills found in French caper
films of the 1960s and such American genre classics from the 1970s as <em>The Seven-Ups</em>
and <em>The Driver</em>. Completing the transformation into action hero that began with <em>Midnight
Run</em>, Robert De Niro stars as the detail-oriented Sam, one of five specialists brought
together in a Paris warehouse by Irish tactical strategist Dierdre (<em>Natascha McElhone</em>,
<em>The Devil's Own</em> and <em>The Truman Show</em>) with the promise of a job. Their
mission? Steal the distinctively shaped silver case chained to the wrist of -- who cares?
They're being paid a lot to get it, and that's that. As they pursue the mysterious case
from Nice to Arles and back to Paris, cautious bonds begin to form and each man's
character is glimpsed. Though this may sound like tough-guy posturing on the page, a
combination of canny writing and intricate, astonishing urban car chases propel the story
over some stilted rough spots. The movie's central metaphor is that of the ronin, the
masterless samurai forced into the life of a wandering outlaw through the humiliation of
their masters' deaths (the Japanese characters for the word literally mean &quot;wave
man&quot;). The cumulative effect is that of a whole underworld of these specialists, all
of whom know each other, running around the world knocking each other off for faceless
bosses. The DVD features additional footage, alternate ending, audio commentary, the
theatrical trailer and web access that allows the viewer to log on to the internet and
chat with Frankenheimer.</p>

<p><strong><big><big><em><a href="../rrushhour.html" name="Rush_Hour" target="_top">Rush Hour</a></em>
(USA, 1998)</big></big></strong></p>

<p>Okay, so it took a pairing with motormouthed Chris Tucker to break Jackie Chan once and
for all in the United States -- that's OK, as <em>Rush Hour</em> is probably the most
inventive and pleasing riff on the buddy cop movie since the original <em>48 Hrs</em>.
Jackie stars as a hotshot Hong Kong cop summoned to the United States to look into the
kidnapping of a teenaged Chinese girl, and Tucker is the hotshot Los Angeles cop sent by
his boss to keep Chan away from the case. Of course the two bond, with thrills and laughs
along the way. High points: Jackie's split-second timing in a poolroom brawl, Jackie's
split-second saving of priceless artifacts during the climactic brawl, and Jackie's
complete lack of timing while singing Edwin Starr's &quot;War.&quot; Low points: any time
Tucker is allowed too much wiggle room in a script that is otherwise enhanced by a smart
pace and good character work from the supporting cast (points off, though, for under-using
Elizabeth Pena). For a lot more Jackie on his own terms, see <em><a href="#Who_Am_I" target="_top">Who
Am I?</a> </em>below. <em>Rush Hour</em> also comes in a subtitled Spanish version and a
feature-packed DVD, the latter of which streets March 2 and features deleted scenes,
director Brett Ratner's audio commentary, one of his earlier short films (<em>Whatever
Happened to Mason Reese</em>, from 1990),and the Dru Hill video for &quot;How Deep is Your
Love.&quot; </p>

<p><strong><big><big><em><a href="../rsnakeeyes.html" name="Snake_Eyes" target="_top">Snake Eyes</a></em>
(USA, 1998)</big></big></strong></p>

<p>As a hurricane approaches, wiseass Atlantic City police detective Rick Santoro (Nicolas
Cage) tries to get to the bottom of a political assassination during a prizefight, a task
complicated by best friend, Navy Commander Kevin Dunne (Gary Sinise) -- who may or may
note know more than he's telling. <em>Snake Eyes</em> is nothing if not ambitious, opening
with a lengthy, bravura Steadicam shot through the hall and point-of-view sequences in
which principal characters narrate their own version of the events surrounding the
assassination (shades of Akira Kurosawa's 1951 must-see masterpiece <em>Rashomon</em>).
And for a while it looks as if the movie has achieved a seductive rhythm, coddled by
Ryuichi (<em>The Last Emperor</em>) Sakamoto's lush score, that promises tangible
pleasures. But once Santoro turns from cretin to crusader and the fourth or fifth plot
twist has been revealed, the movie loses not only steam but common sense, lurching to an
abrupt halt via a wildly improbable and virtually indecipherable denouement. The latest in
a long line of cinematic teases from veteran director Brian De Palma (<em>The Untouchables</em>,
<em>Mission: Impossible</em>), Snake Eyes is a glossy, supercharged, sumptuous but
ultimately empty exercise in virtuoso technical skill that is at once gorgeous to look at
and a real challenge to sit through (a significant irony, since at under 100 minutes it
was one of the summer's more conspicuous examples of brevity). Still, movies like this are
what the big screen is for -- and when all was said and done the movie made close to $100
million worldwide, if grosses are a deciding factor in weekend tape rentals. See it for
the experience, not the satisfaction. There's a Spanish-subtitled tape available, as well
as a fairly utilitarian DVD featuring a theatrical trailer and interactive menus.</p>

<p><strong><big><big><em><a name="Mary" target="_top">There's Something About Mary</a></em> (USA, 1998)</big></big></strong></p>

<p>&quot;Isn't that a little politically incorrect?&quot; someone says 45 minutes or so
into this inexplicable cultural phenomenon -- which, once all the hysteria has died down,
proves neither as wretched as the Farrelly Brothers' first movie, <em>Dumb &amp; Dumber</em>,
nor as genuinely subversive as their second, the truly off-the-wall <em>Kingpin</em>. Yet
this surprise grossout hit of summer 1998 turned out to be a bad taste movie for people
who are just a little hesitant about bad taste. After the ultimate indignity on his prom
night with dreamy sports nut Mary (Cameron Diaz), earnest nerd Ted (Ben Stiller) hires
shamus Healy (Matt Dillon) to find her 13 years later, setting off a chain reaction of
screwball shenanigans. As resolutely off-color as it is, the movie has an oddly disjointed
rhythm and no center to speak of -- the popular highlights of the film (or low points,
depending on your tolerance), are as disconnected from the slim storyline as anything else
here. Still, the movie made more money than anything save <em>Armageddon</em> and <em>Saving
Private Ryan</em> last year ($346.9 million worldwide to date), and anything with Chris
Elliott, the musical stylings of Jonathan Richman and the indestructible Puffy the dog
can't be all bad. But compared to the mystifying box office flops <em>BASEketball</em> and
<em>Mafia!</em> (not to mention the aforementioned <em>Kingpin</em>), <em>Mary</em>,
ironically, just isn't politically correct enough. Also available in a subtitled Spanish
edition.</p>

<p>At Pendleton University, the so-called &quot;safest college in the United States,&quot;
someone is murdering people in the style of contemporary urban legends and everyone's a
suspect: there's Natalie (Alicia Witt from &quot;Cybill&quot;), her best friend Brenda
(Rebecca Gayheart, who was also in <em>Scream 2</em>), ambitious student reporter Paul
(Jared Leto, &quot;My So-Called Life&quot;), Damon (Joshua Jackson, who plays Pacey in
&quot;Dawson's Creek&quot;) and, in what you might call the Drew Barrymore role, Natasha
Gregson Wagner (<em>First Love</em>, <em>Last Rites</em> and <em>Another Day in Paradise</em>)
as Michelle. Although older moviegoers may have had it up to here with Scream clones, <em>Urban
Legend</em> must grudgingly be recognized as the exception that proves the rule, a knowing
and zippy teen-aimed horror movie that manages to subvert predictability by the sheer brio
of it's approach. Credit for this must go to the almost impossibly young principal talent
behind the camera: first-time director Jamie Blanks was just 26 when he made this, and
screenwriter Silvio Horta has been out of film school for fewer years than it takes to get
a Bachelor's degree. Together, they've managed to get a few more miles out of a genre
workhorse that plods on as long as there are popular young stars and older character
actors (John Neville from &quot;The X-Files&quot; and Freddy Krueger himself -- OK, Robert
Englund -- pop 'round for a visit) game enough to offer themselves up for inventive
on-screen deaths. There is also a Spanish subtitled tape of this title (the plot's
transparent in any language), as well as a DVD featuring audio commentary and a
featurette.</p>

<h1>Beyond the A-List: Some Other Titles of note:</h1>

<p><big><big><strong><em><a name="All_of_Me" target="_top">All of Me</a></em> (USA, 1984, reissue)</strong></big></big></p>

<p>A pivotal and long overdue reissue in the annals of contemporary American film comedy,
this sparkling new version of Steve Martin's career high water mark to date restores a
great comedy to its rightful place as one of the freshest and funniest movies of a decade
not known for warm laughs. Adapted from Ed Davis' novel &quot;Me Two&quot; by Phil Alden
Robinson (who went on to write and direct the classic baseball film Field of Dreams and
the not-so-classic Robert Redford caper movie <em>Sneakers</em>) and directed with
unobtrusive smoothness by the great but often uneven Carl Reiner (who had previously
directed Martin in <em>The Jerk</em>, <em>Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid</em> and <em>The Man
with Two Brains</em>), <em>All of Me</em> stars Martin as an affable, idealistic lawyer
and moonlighting jazz musician (hence the title) who becomes half possessed by the venal
spirit of Edwina Cutwater (Lily Tomlin), a rich old lady who has been persuaded by Terry
Hoskins (Victoria Tennant, for a time Mrs. Martin), the daughter of a servant, to have her
spirit moved to the young woman's body by the quite daffy Prahka Lasa (Richard Libertini).
The joke is that although Martin thinks the whole thing's a scam, the transfer actually
works and Mrs. Cutwater is now controlling half his body. After a steady diet of absurdist
foolishness (albeit tremendously successful absurdist foolishness), Martin used this
genuinely original story to show off his leading-man good looks, great taste in clothes
and impeccable comic timing. Particularly funny is the scene on the street right after her
spirit enters him, his subsequent foray to the men's room, and Libertini's un-PC but
hysterical turn as the mystic (&quot;Bakinbowl! Bakinbowl!&quot;). The charming coda is
every bit as cathartic as Tom Hanks and Meg Ryan finally meeting at the end of Sleepless
in Seattle. If ever a DVD cried out for extras and audio commentary, this is it -- but,
alas, neither Reiner or Martin is seen or heard on this straightforward reissue.
Regardless of format, <em>All of Me</em> is a keeper.</p>

<p><big><big><strong><em><a name="Alarmist" target="_top">The Alarmist</a></em> </strong></big></big></p>

<p>Called Life During WarTime when it premiered at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival (that's
the name of the 1990 play on which it was based -- and, of course, a great Talking Heads
song), this tedious directorial debut from Evan Dunsky stars Stanley Tucci (<em>Big Night</em>,
<em>The Impostors</em>) as ruthless burglar alarm baron Heinrich Grigoris, David Arquette
(the <em>Scream</em> franchise) as ambitious protegee Tommy Hudler, Kate Capshaw as Gale,
Arquette's love interest, and a whole gallery of minor character types as Los Angeles-area
weirdos with various opinions of the salesmen's wares (that looks like Dunsky as a
commercial director). One of those movies that thinks it's a lot funnier than it really
is, the general heavy-handedness is fatally accentuated by Christophe Beck's annoying
score and the rather smirky approach of everyone towards the material. One major plus: the
comic sexual monologue delivered by Ryan Reynolds, the funny guy from &quot;Two Girls, a
Guy and a Pizza Place,&quot; who's a scream as Gail's comically clenched son Howard (also,
the movie has the wit to film in the legendary watering hole Boardner's, on Cherokee
Boulevard off Hollywood). Sort of a lame, updated, west coast version of Jules Feiffer's
&quot;Little Murders,&quot; <em>The Alarmist</em> is enough to make one wonder just how
bad all those movies that get rejected for Sundance really are. There is a Spanish
subtitled tape and DVD edition available.</p>

<p>Life isn't often easy for the hearing child of deaf parents, yet it is a rich,
dignified and occasionally mischievous tapestry of emotions -- good and bad -- that gives
Caroline Link's remarkable directorial debut <em>Beyond Silence</em> it's power. An
intimate drama with the bold feel of an epic that charts the growing pains of a close but
conflicted Bavarian family, the film has won numerous international awards and was one of
the Final Five in last year's Best Foreign Film Oscar field. Kai and Martin Bischoff
(Emmanuelle Laborit and Howie Seago) are deaf, relying on their bright and spunky daughter
Lara (Tatjana Trieb) for everything from bank meetings to parent-teacher conferences. When
Martin's free-spirited sister Clarissa (Sybille Canonica) gives Lara a clarinet, the
gifted child is hooked. Ten years later Lara (Sylvie Testud) moves to Berlin to study
music and becomes involved with Tom (Hansa Czypionka), the hearing teacher of deaf
children. Yet Lara's conflict with her father threatens to destroy the family's bond.
&quot;The subject matter offered me the possibility of combining several ideas I had been
wanting to use for a film,&quot; Link told an interviewer. &quot;I wanted to tell a love
story, make a film about growing up, about how hard it is to first find one's own way and
then to actually follow it.&quot; Based on a newspaper article she read during a stay in
the United States five years ago, Beyond Silence has the kind of universal appeal that is
a hallmark of the new German cinema (Lara and Tom signing to Gloria Gaynor's &quot;I Will
Survive&quot; provides a comic highlight) and displays a thoughtful, exuberant filmmaking
talent at the dawn of what has all the makings of a brilliant career.</p>

<p>Kino on Video expands one of the niftiest boutiques going with these three previously
unavailable titles from the heydey of film noir, that hardboiled atmospheric movement of
the 1940s and 1950s. Although it takes awhile to get going, German emigre director Fritz
Lang's <em>The Blue Gardenia</em> -- photographed by genre genius Nick Musuraca (the
original <em>Cat People</em>, <em>Out of the Past</em>) from a story by the woman who
wrote Laura --&nbsp; is a visual treat, as impulsive Anne Baxter's liason with libidinous
lounge lizard Raymond Burr (whose next role would be the killer in Hitchcock's <em>Rear
Window</em>) at the eponymous Los Angeles club &quot;on Vine, right off Hollywood&quot;
(where Nat King Cole is the house pianist) leads to murder, mystery and love for smooth
Chronicle newshound Richard Conte -- who has to pass up covering the latest H-Bomb test to
crack the case. In <em>Brute Force</em>, Burt Lancaster (in only his second starring role)
does battle with sadistic chief guard Hume Cronyn in a complicated prison caste system
meant to draw parallels between incarceration and life in a fascist state (the large
familiar supporting cast includes debuts from future character stalwarts Howard Duff --
then playing Sam Spade on a popular radio program -- and Whit Bissell, who later played
the scientist in <em>The Creature from the Black Lagoon</em>). There are eight million
stories in <em>The Naked City</em>, the film that coined that memorable phrase from the
1950s, and this is the first of them: narrated by producer Mark Helllinger, the film stars
avuncular John Ford regular Barry Fitzgerald as Muldoon, a police lieutenant heading up a
murder investigation over the course of a hot summer's day in New York City. With these
latter two titles and the later <em>Thieve's Highway</em>, director Jules Dassin pioneered
a realism in popular films that was harrowing at the time (and has strongly influenced
such contemporary incarnations of the genre as TV's &quot;Law and Order&quot;). About to
be named a Communist in front of the House Un-American Activities Committee, Dassin fled
to Europe and made <em>Night in the City</em> in London and <em>Never on Sunday</em> in
Greece (with new wife Melina Mercouri). These three movies are first-rate examples, not
only of an exalted genre, but a time when movies had exposition, shades of meaning and
few, if any, explosions.</p>

1992)</big></big></strong></p>

<p>&quot;The good Lord does not get involved in politics,&quot; someone says during the
course of this provocative drama. If only that sentiment were true: the politics of
oppression and martyrdom are key elements in this tension-filled game of human chess
adapted from a successful Venezuelan stage play. In an unnamed but strongly suggested
Latin American city, two nuns shelter a young fugitive from totalitarian forces. The
corrupt mayor soon deduces the truth (the sisters aren't very good liars), but is faced
with a potential public relations nightmare when they refuse to cooperate with his
inquiry. How on earth could he explain two executions? Chilling and thought-provoking, <em>Knocks
at My Door</em> packs a heavy emotional punch through the skillful direction and emotional
veracity of Argentine-born director Alejandro Saderman, who brought years of experience in
non-fiction filmmaking to his narrative feature debut -- which is a must-see for
moviegoers with an interest in the dramatization of human rights issues. Saderman's new
film, the caper drama <em>Little Thieves, Big Thieves</em>, has just played the Toronto
and Sundance festivals to great acclaim. </p>

<p>Nothing much happens in the small northern French town of Bailleul, but as the sun
broils the Flanders countryside the inarticulate, pent-up rage of one local boy is about
to explode. Twenty-year-old Freddy (David Douche) lives with his mother Yvette, who runs
the Au Petit Casino cafe. He's in love with the attractive Marie (Marjorie Cottreel), a
cashier at the local supermarket, and the two spend their time together either in bed or
just standing against each other in the otherwise deserted street. Freddy's epileptic and
self-conscious about it, but dutifully goes for treatment when he isn't racing souped-up
mopeds with his equally bored buddies. But one day Kader, the son of Arab immigrants,
starts talking to Marie, and Freddy's frustrations with life find a sudden focus.
First-time director Bruno Dumont takes his time with his leisurely unconventional
narrative, and the widescreen photography alternates between bucolic vistas and jarring
closeups. Among the cast of non-professionals Douche is memorable as Freddy, with his
close-cropped hair, eyes like black marbles and a soul that is truly and profoundly
adrift. &quot;I was reaching into the creases of human nature, their junctures,&quot; says
Dumont, and what he has found is profoundly terrifying.</p>

<p>In a sun-drenched French Riviera nearly devoid of adults, in the shadow of the twin
shark fin-shaped rock outcroppings known as the Bay of Angels, 15-year-old petty thief
Orso (Frédéric Malgras), who isn't very good at what he does, meets 14-year-old vixen
Marie (Vahina Giocante), who spends her time entertaining Americans on and around a nearby
base. Eventually, they come together, only to be separated by cruel fate and the power of
a gun. Conjuring up such seminal films of disaffected youth as <em>Breathless</em>, <em>The
400 Blows</em> and <em>Pixote</em>, this debut feature -- five years in the making -- has
been prompting critics and programmers to compare writer-director Manuel Pradal's
shimmering, fragmented style to &quot;pure poetry,&quot; in the words of Toronto festival
director Piers Handling, &quot;Rimbaud and Kerouac transcribed onto celluloid, a
breathless film for the 1990s.&quot; Profoundly disturbing and undeniably powerful, Marie
baie des Anges is a singular, memorable moviegoing experience.</p>

<p><strong><big><big><em><a name="A_Merry_War" target="_top">A Merry War</a></em> (United Kingdom, 1997)</big></big></strong></p>

<p>Based on George Orwell's semi-autobiographical novel &quot;Keep the Aspidistra
Flying&quot; (and known by that title when it played the film festival circuit in late
1997), this sweet and hugely enjoyable British satire tells the saga of Gordon Comstock
(Richard E. Grant), a poet of fiery emotions stuck writing ad copy for a publishing
company. Impulsively quitting his job, to the chagrin of long-suffering girlfriend
Rosemary (Helena Bonham Carter), Gordon takes a job in a seedy bookstore and finds rooms
with the virtually indestructible houseplant of the title in the window -- a sure sign,
according to his bemused publisher, of respectability. Yet Gordon's road to success proves
rocky indeed, with both his nature and situation conspiring to keep him from the upper
class he thinks he wants to join. The glossy 1930s period look of the film and sly
undercurrent of class conflict makes for a tart but dignified burlesque of the stuffy
British character, with the constant bickering of Gordon and Rosemary spiced with the kind
of imaginative English seldom seen these days outside of proper British films. Those with
Bohemian yearnings will take to Gordon's comically doomed spirit, while the more pragmatic
will cluck at the foolishness of it all. Whichever camp you belong to, <em>A Merry War</em>
is a delightfully good film. </p>

<p><strong><big><big><em><a name="Whatever" target="_top">Whatever</a></em> (USA, 1997)</big></big></strong></p>

<p>Susan Skoog's desultory, quasi-autobiographical drama of growing up in early 1980s New
Jersey is so distracted by its own ennui that the company didn't even bother going to New
Jersey: the movie was shot in and around Wheeling, West Virginia. Still, the moody
surliness of Liza Weil's fearless performance as the thrill-seeking Anna, a high school
senior &quot;afraid of being ordinary&quot; but too confused to resist the proto-slacker
life, will appeal strongly to similarly conflicted contemporary teenagers (proving that
hairstyles and music may change, but emotions stay pretty much the same from generation to
generation). Dreaming of art school in New York City but resistant to the supportive
exhortations of her teacher, Mr. Chaminski (Frederic Forrest), Anna spends most of her
time with best friend Brenda (Chad Morgan), an unrepentant party girl whose wild ways have
rubbed off on the clearly smarter but no more discerning teenager. After a number of
parties and a few unsatisfying sexual experiences, Anna seems to break out of her torpor
long enough to take some positive steps forward. Shot through with an authentic feel for
the period and selfless, unshowy acting, <em>Whatever</em> is so determined to be
unglamorous that the film often seems to be daring audiences to stay with it. &quot;Don't
expect so much, it's a little easier that way,&quot; says Anna's weary mother by way of
career counseling, and perhaps this is the best advice for those approaching this
well-intentioned by unrelentingly bleak movie.</p>

<p>Forty-four years old and still coordinating and performing his own stunts (as well as
writing screenplays and co-directing), Jackie Chan is at the point where he's going to
need his own wall at the video store. Much of that shelf space will be taken up by this
direct-to-video gem, which was never released theatrically but is one of his most exciting
films of the decade (even slightly edited from the Asian release print). Chan -- playing
31 -- stars as, uh, Jackie Chan, an elite commando operative dubbed &quot;Whoami&quot;
(he's lost his memory) by the African tribe that nurses him back to health after a
spectacular fall from a helicopter when a mission goes awry. His quest to regain his
memory and get to the bottom of the plot involve some of his best stunt work in a long
time, highlighted by a an intricate chase through Rotterdam engineered while handcuffed
and the spectacular, vertiginous finale (&quot;I can't believe you're still in one
piece!&quot; says one of the two fetching women who help him throughout the film; also
fine are Ron Smerczak and vet Ed Nelson as heavies). <em>Who Am I?</em> was released in
Asia in the first month of 1998, grossing some $200 million in that region alone. A
must-see for fans and a splendid blending of glossy production values and the
old-fashioned one-on-one fights that made his reputation (there's not a hovercraft in
sight), <em>Who Am I?</em> is a perfect complement to <em>Rush Hour</em> and a triumphant
new chapter in the saga of Jackie Chan. And don't forget to watch the traditional closing
credits, which among other goodies and gaffes features Jackie doing the Macarena with a
gleeful group of African children and the trademark sequence where he's carted off on a
stretcher following one blown stunt or another.</p>
