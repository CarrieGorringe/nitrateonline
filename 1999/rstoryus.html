<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><b><font size="5">H</font></b><font size="4">ere's
a terrifying thought: each of the major turning points in your life is reducible
to the hairstyle you're wearing at the time. Your graduation, your first job,
your marriage, your dead goldfish, your vacation in Italy: all of it is mucked
up when filtered through those misty-water-colored memory glasses. If it sounds
awful in theory, it's even worse to see it acted out, on a wide screen with lots
of close-ups of teary, badly-coifed movie stars backed by a treacly Eric Clapton
guitar score. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">This
is the experience delivered by Rob Reiner's <i>The Story of Us</i>, a movie that
too often feels like an unclever follow-up to <i>When Harry Met Sally...</i>
(which, I admit, never seemed very clever to me). This time the couple in
perpetual trouble is Ben (Bruce Willis in his just-please-take-me-seriously
mode) and Katey (Michelle Pfeiffer). We meet them when they've been married for
fifteen years and as they're talking -- separately -- to the camera, like those
fretful young people do in MTV's <i>The Real World</i>. He writes novels and she
writes crossword puzzles. She's unhappy that he's become so irresponsible, he's
despondent because she's become so unspontaneous. He says tomato and, well, can
this marriage be saved? <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">While
you might intuit that it will be saved -- Rob Reiner doesn't traffic in tragedy,
after all -- watching it be saved is mostly annoying. For one thing, there's
those hair-dos. And for another, she can't possibly leave Ben because her only
possible other suitor is a divorced dentist played by Tim Matheson, whom you'll
remember as the fake Mr. Brady in <i>A Very Brady Sequel</i>. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">And
then there's the actual plot. You see the moments in their relationship that
matter most to each principal (thankfully, you only see these from one
perspective, sparing you any potential he said-she said arguments). He remembers
when they met -- he was a beginning journalist and she was an office temp; he
teased her by tossing paper clips, she put on a pith helmet; he had long hair,
she had frizzy. She remembers when she gave him a plastic spoon she had saved
from their first dinner out at a Chinese restaurant, then wonders aloud,
&quot;When is that moment in a marriage when a spoon becomes just a spoon?''<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">(This
was the moment when the friend sitting in front of me -- normally a much more
forgiving viewer than I -- turned around and made a gagging face, and it wasn't
even ten minutes into the film). <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
story of them proceeds as you might expect. Their two children -- a Josh (Jake
Sandvig) and Erin (Colleen Rennison) -- are suspicious that things aren't going
well, but Katey and Ben decide to keep what seems to be their imminent break-up
a secret until said children return from summer camp. This means that even
though Ben moves out as soon as the kids get on the bus, the couple must go
through the motions of marital normalcy when they visit the camp for Parents'
Day. Of course, this makes for some discomfort and the kind of humor premised on
such discomfort (as in, ohmigosh! what will they do when Erin surprises them
with a night visit to their cabin and notices that the couch is made up?) <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Both
Ben and Katey have same-gender pals to whom they lament repeatedly: for her, the
super-sympathetic Rachel (played by perpetual best friend Rita Wilson) and
dullsville Liza (Julie Hagerty), and for him, Rachel's buttinsky husband Stan (Reiner)
and Ben's egocentric agent (Paul Reiser). Because they have these shoulders to
cry on, the solo-confessions seem superfluous: everyone is annoyingly articulate
in that sit-comesque way that characters in contemporary relationship movies
tend to be. For instance, Rachel advises Katey concerning sex during emotional
difficulties: the penis is &quot;a battering ram'' and the vagina, when nervous,
can't &quot;receive&quot; it. Or Ben spends time with Stan, who asserts, by way
of illustrating the &quot;grayness&quot; of life, that Ben stare at his buttocks
while he intones, &quot;In reality, there is no ass, only the continuation of my
legs.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">In
between whining to their friends, remembering sexual ecstasies on the kitchen
counter, and confessing to the camera, Ben and Katey do interact, mostly arguing
and attempting to make up. After several weeks apart, they spend an excruciating
few minutes in bed, where they reminisce about the pathetically ineffective
couples' therapists they've consulted, and then think about having sex. Within
seconds they're joined -- as we get a glimpse inside their Woody-Allenized heads
-- by their parents (Betty White, Red Buttons, Jayne Meadows, and Tom Poston,
all looking as horrified by their roles as you feel about them), instructing
them on what to say and how to behave. Needless to say, Ben and Katey revert to
form (sniping and not listening) and their hopes for the evening are dashed. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
movie's basic formula, for all its hip smugness and 90s-style egalitarian
sorrow, actually seems more like a forties weepie than anything else. The script
by Alan Zweibel and Jessie Nelson (the latter responsible for <i>Stepmom</i>,
i.e., I could rest my case here) would suit someone like Irene Dunne, because
she's tough enough (beneath her excellent and perfectly calibrated tears) to
withstand the pummeling such generic stories inflict. While Katey does look like
a survivor, Ben is most certainly not: he just gets angrier and sadder (to the
point that he riverdances to entertain his kids), and you start imagining that
he'll end up in the Fight Club down the street if she doesn't step up to rescue
him. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">That
it's Ben who needs the rescuing is not without its cultural significance and
class-related resonance. Katey can afford to move on, unlike Irene Dunne (who
usually moved on anyway, but without a job where she could work at home on her
computer): you see her taking cooking classes, book shopping, anticipating what
she'll be doing with the kids home. He sits in his apartment and hates himself
and her, stews over her date, wants it to be &quot;like it was&quot; (he uses
that damn pith helmet as the sign of her lost sense of &quot;fun&quot;). Katey
knows it can't like that, but she's willing, eventually, to work on it.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Unfortunately,
the film never addresses the possibility of its specifically gendered melodrama,
never allows that it might be about the ongoing dislocations of a
straight-white-middle-class-male psyche, never observes either of its
protagonists with imaginative or thoughtful, serious or even comic insight.
Instead, it goes glib.</span></p>
