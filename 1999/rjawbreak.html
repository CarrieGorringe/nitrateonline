<p><big><strong><big>I</big></strong>f May is the month for gathering nuts, why is this
wacky walnut arriving so early. Well, it is just after Valentine&#146;s Day and
there&#146;s candy in the title, but more likely this micro-budget ($3 million, I believe)
ode to high school hardwood obviously has distributor TriStar salivating that a quickie
wide release, so soon after this film&#146;s presentation at Sundance in late January,
should easily earn back its production costs opening weekend. Heck, may that by the end of
opening day. I have to agree with that theory, even if I hated the film. Guess I&#146;ve
been out of secondary school too long to appreciate demographically disabled stuff like
this.</big></p>

<p><img src="Images/rjawbreak-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">With all the
teen angst out there in cinemaland, this stylish yet boneheaded black comedy from
sophomore director-writer and John Hughes wannabe Darren Stein (his first effort,
Sparkler, is going into general release next month) will suck up to the young crowd,
especially thanks to its hip soundtrack, the sharp, stylish lensing by Amy Vincent (<i>Eve&#146;s
Bayou</i>), and editing straight off of an MTV music video. Stein has called it <i>Heathers</i>
meets <i>Carrie</i>, an apt description in lieu of its homage to those distinctly better
predecessors. A bevy of bodacious goddesses, young on experience, will certainly absorb
the adolescent gents in ways that they want to be entertained, featuring the likes of Rose
McGowan (<a href="../rphantom.html" target="_top"><i>Phantoms</i></a>), Rebecca Gayheart (<a href="../rurban.html" target="_top"><i>Urban Legend</i></a>, <a href="../rscream.html" target="_top"><i>Scream 2</i></a>,
<i>Beverly Hills 90210</i>), Julie Benz (<i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>), Judy Evans
Greer (previously starring in the little seen, Wisconsin-based feature <i>Stricken</i>,
dealing with a college prank gone tragically awry), and Charlotte Roldan (in a feature
debut that ends in the first reel, except for an occasional flashback).</p>

<p>Speaking of pranks gone tragically awry, that&#146;s the basis of <i>Jawbreaker</i>, as
the titular sweet heads south in the throat of birthday babe Liz Purr (Roldan), up to that
moment one of a fab foursome who spend their school days looking gorgeous, walking down
the halls of Reagan High in endless slow motion riffs. It&#146;s up to ugly duckling/class
runt Fern Mayo (Greer) to fill her spot in the clique, with a makeover assist by the
surviving brood, all seemingly homework deficient. Re-christened Vylette, the girl goes
straight to the top with a bullet. Shades of Frankenstein drifted through my
sweet-and-sour thoughts of the film at hand, but I didn&#146;t want to demean that
illustrious work too long.</p>
<i>

<p>Jawbreaker</i> is <a href="../rverybad.html" target="_top"><i>Very Bad Things</i></a> redux (Very
Worse Things?), with ruthless Courtney Shayne (McGowan) in the Christian Slater, take
charge role, but looking very much like a young Barbara Steele. Her curvaceous pawns are
the chaotic Marcie &quot;Foxy&quot; Fox (Benz), aptly described as a legend in her own
mind, and the reluctant, &quot;You can&#146;t hide the truth with a makeover&quot; Julie
Freeman (Gayheart), eventually ostracized from the group like a bad dream, but with a ton
of Damocles&#146; swords hovering overhead. To service the hunk-obsessed crowd is Ethan
Erickson as the head jock/prom king Dane Sanders, with Chad Christ (Young Vincent in <i>Gattaca</i>)
portraying the school outsider/head thespian and Julie&#146;s love toy.</p>

<p>For us older folks, there were many recognizable walk-ons, including Carol Kane as the
school principal, blaxploitation queen Pam Grier as Police Detective Vera Cruz, William
Katt and P.J. Soles as the dead girl&#146;s parents, and Jeff Conaway as an Oprah-obsessed
father. Marilyn Manson&#146;s brief appearance can be attributed to his significant other
being the picture&#146;s star.</p>

<p><img src="Images/rjawbreak-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">The film sputters
along, its characters adrift in search of a director (and a decent script). Throwaway
scenes and bad humor bubble to the top of the coven&#146;s cauldron, as a reference to the
Karen Carpenter table in the school cafeteria showing four anorexic students sharing a box
of raisin, or a mindless scene featuring Dane and Courtney sucking on a phallic popsicle
in their underwear, as the temptress coos a double entendre at her stud muffin. Plot holes
are abundant, including a whopper as to how the new-born diva ends up driving a red-hot
sports car (license plate: BITCH), or the lack of any believable build up to the climactic
senior prom.</p>

<p>Your dentist will tell you to stay away from sweets. I&#146;d rather suffer root canal
that burden myself with another viewing of <i>Jawbreaker</i>, or as I call it: Battle of
the High School Bimbo Bitches. Class dismissed!</p>
