McKellar has been the subject of a lot of joking in Canada about what it means
to be famous in this cold, celebrity-phobic country. About a year ago he was
toasted at home and abroad, at both the 1998 Cannes and Toronto film festivals,
having co-written and acted in the award-winning, Fran<span style="mso-char-type: symbol; mso-symbol-font-family: Symbol; font-family: Symbol; mso-ascii-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho; mso-hansi-font-family: Times New Roman">V</span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">ois-Girard-directed,
Sam-Jackson-starring film <i>The Red Violin</i>, in addition to writing,
directing, and starring in his own film, <i>Last Night</i>. Along with <i>The
Red Violin</i>, McKellar's first foray into directing is a fantastic example of
Canadian cinema's increasing comfort with the possibilities of a commercial but
also intelligent national cinema. In this way, McKellar is king of the
moderates, which may seem a ludicrously Canadian way of classifying him, but
I'll stick to it. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">McKellar's
narrative centers on the (by now) proverbial apocalypse/Y2K fear, and his basic
take on the last day of the millennium is that the world is simply going to end.
The exact details of why or how the world is going to end, however, are left
unexplained. Everyone in the film has totally accepted that it's just all over
at exactly midnight, Toronto time (typical, grumbled many western Canadians, who
sarcastically refer to Toronto as &quot;the center of the universe&quot;). All
the elements of millennial/apocalyptic narrative are still here, including
street riots, infrastructure breakdown and separation from loved ones and all
that. Nevertheless, the way that all these characters are so completely resigned
to the inevitability of it all is the creepiest part of the story. The kind of
tension that would be expected in an apocalypse film is almost totally absent
here: the most dramatic moments of the film are much more interior-oriented than
related to any sort of end-of-the-world kind of stuff. Indeed, the film's
climax, where the camera swirls around McKellar and Sandra Oh as they try to
decide whether to complete a suicide pact, is excruciatingly suspenseful, far
more powerful than anything in <i>Deep Impact </i>or <i>Armageddon's </i>moral
universe precisely because the moment is unrelated to the fact of the apocalypse
as such. It relies instead on an abstract, rawly emotional impact. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Simply
as a piece of narrative, <i>Last Night </i>is exceptional. McKellar is quite a
skilled storyteller, juggling an unusually large number of characters, giving
each one a sufficient amount of depth so we understand their own individual
crises and connecting them all in a way that is apparent and not overly clever.
McKellar himself plays the character at the center of the film, and his deadpan
humor and gently confused expression gives all these sometimes disjointed
situations an odd kind of moral center. The great Quebecois actress Genvieve
Bujold is especially memorable in a minor role as McKellar's former French
teacher (who, as a way of going out with a bang, has sex with McKellar's
coitus-obsessed friend). She gives the role a very real gravity that
miraculously escapes melodrama. When she spontaneously quizzes McKellar on the
French that she had taught him a decade earlier she is toughly amused by his
pathetic attempts to respond. Her emotions turn gently sad when she begins to
realize that it'll be the last time she sees him. &quot;It's nice you remember
some of it,&quot; she mumbles, as the elevator closes on her. It's a nice
moment, played with a thoughtfulness and world-weariness that is all too
uncommon these days. Sandra Oh's performance as a woman hopelessly trying to
re-unite with her husband for the big moment is also a marvel. The presence and
force that she's brought to other roles (most famously <i>Double Happiness</i>,
although she also has a bit part in <i>The Red Violin</i>) seems oddly out of
place is this environment of impossibility, but it's just that intensity and
seriousness of purpose that gives her part of the film its tragic sense. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Visually,
<i>Last Night</i> is somewhat less than revolutionary, but I'd argue that this
is part of its power, rather than seeking some equivalent el much odder than an
average Hollywood film. All three of these filmmakers are graduates of the
Canadian Film Centre, a school started by Norman Jewison in hopes of building a
film industry north of the 49th parallel and ending Hollywood domination on
Canadian screens. That hasn't exactly come to pass, but the films coming out of
the Centre's grads, especially those by McKellar and Girard, have done a great
deal to bolster domestic and international confidence in Canadian film, and to
come up with new ways of telling stories that resists both European-influenced
esoteric and Hollywood-style simplicity. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Finally,
then, <i>Last Night</i> is a film about very big ideas, which come to include
the end of the world, the need for companionship, the randomness of love, the
value of human life, and the impossibility of reconciliation. It's also a film
that deals with these ideals in a very straightforward way, Don McKellar's
refusal to indulge in this material's possibilities for philosophical pretense
or melodrama is especially impressive. The film well deserves its multinational
character, and indeed synthesizes the most important elements of Canadian cinema
(concern with civic life, a gentle nihilism, visual utilitarianism, and
narrative expertise) into a humorous, emotionally satisfying whole. I can think
of no better person to be famous in Canada that Don McKellar. <o:p>
