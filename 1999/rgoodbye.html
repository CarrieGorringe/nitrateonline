<p><big><i><strong><big>G</big></strong>oodbye, Lover</i> is a jokey piece of cynical
dime-novel pulp, the type that you can find now find for a dime a dozen. You get (usually)
two amorals who plot to murder a third out of sexual jealousy and/or financial greed, you
get complications after the murder, and with the complications you get more murder and the
exposure of a few double-crosses along the way. What you don&#146;t get, nowadays in the
age of self-consciously cool irony, are characters worth caring about or even worth
knowing at all. In fact, the most astonishing twist in <i>Goodbye, Lover</i> actually
comes early on when one of the characters tells another that he&#146;s ready for something
real in his life. What&#146;s shocking isn&#146;t so much that he says it, it&#146;s that
he seems to mean it. But, have no fear, the film doesn&#146;t mean it for a second. It
quickly becomes apparent that any hinting at sincerity is just grist for the plot mill. </big></p>

<p><img src="Images/rgoodbye-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">What makes <i>Goodbye,
Lover</i> substandard even by today&#146;s standards is that its twist-minded plot is so
boringly routine. After the first murder, all the revelations and violence coming down the
pike can be seen coming from a pretty long distance away, and precious little follows
behind. That means the film must survive on tone alone, but director Roland Joffe, whose
history of ultra-earnest work ranges from the sublime (<i>The Killing Fields</i>) to the
ridiculous (<i>The Scarlet Letter</i>), isn&#146;t prepared to deal with something so
dependent upon a hip, sneering attitude. So he uses his formidable visual skills to throw
some slick gloss on the screen, which equates to lots of reflected visuals, moody colors
and silly extreme close-ups, while the script lays on lazy incongruity gags like having a
depraved vixen repeatedly sing from <i>The Sound of Music</i>, but little of this does
much to hide the fact that almost nothing is going on. </p>

<p>It&#146;s stupid to talk about the plot in a review, because all <i>Goodbye, Lover</i>
has to offer the viewer are the few twists that it has. Suffice it to say that it&#146;s
driven forward by a quartet of upper-middle class folks looking to drop the word
&quot;middle.&quot; Don Johnson, Patricia Arquette, Dermot Mulroney, and Mary Louise
Parker perform a square dance of illicit, occasionally kinky sex, multiple stabbings of
the back, and sometimes literal stabbings of the back, while Ellen DeGeneres investigates
from the sidelines as the predictably cynical, world-weary detective who&#146;s so
cynical, and so weary, that her most lively, entertaining bit comes when she gets to pick
corn dog out of her teeth. </p>

<p><img src="Images/rgoodbye-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">Naturally,
she&#146;s given a partner who is exactly one hundred and eighty degrees from her, an
innocent, religiously-minded yokel who believes absolutely everything everyone tells him.
His name is Detective Rollins, played by Ray McKinnon, and he ends up being <i>Goodbye,
Lover&#146;s</i> most refreshing ingredient, because unlike anyone or anything else on the
screen, he (almost) never winks. McKinnon plays his golly-gee rube straight as an arrow,
like he means it, and so his wide-eyed naivete actually serves to generate some giggles.
That is something which can&#146;t be said for most everything else in this mind-numbingly
cheap piece of half-hearted cynicism, the sum total point of which is that hey, the world
is a nasty, ugly place, but isn&#146;t it fun to see that some folks think it&#146;s not?
Uh, yeah, sure, that&#146;s really fun. </p>
