<p><big><strong><big>W</big></strong>ithout the sarcastic wit of television mega-talent of
David E. (&quot;Emmy&quot;) Kelley, this lowbrow horror entry might have been titled <i>Lake
Flaccid</i>. But it&#146;ll provide minimal relief from the summer tepidity (weather that
is) and has little chance opening opposite the marketing thrust of Kubrick&#146;s
psychosexual <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i> and the limited break, Internet-hyped <i>The Blair
Witch Project</i>, a delicious low-budget, gore-deficient scare item that should corner
the younger crowd. That is those kids who have already had their fill of self-enlightening
baked goods and hand-me-downs from Comedy Central.</big></p>

<p>So, while Stephen King is recuperating from his car accident in Lewiston, Maine, Kelley
is spouting campfire tales in the pristine New England wilderness and plush piney
backwoods skirting Black Lake. Yeah, believe it, the film&#146;s water trap isn&#146;t
even the same as the film&#146;s title! It&#146;s explained briefly, in throw-away
dialogue that &quot;We could have called this Lake Placid, but that name was taken.&quot;!
Camping out for the quick 82-minute ride is a cast that has some of the corrosively funny
dialogue this side of <i>Ally McBeal</i> (one of Kelley&#146;s three current TV
franchises, along with <i>The Practice</i> and <i>Chicago Hope</i>). Ah, now I see.
It&#146;s that kind of camp fire. We have a half-horror, half-comedy show where the
humans, despite advanced college degrees, appear to be dumber than Adam Sandler when it
comes to tackling a 30-foot crocodile, an oversized pet with a penchant for dramatically
dining out on local livestock and law enforcers.</p>

<p><img src="Images/rlakeplacid-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="150">The quirky
characters are a typical, albeit well-spoken, bunch whose spoken and physical barbs are
constantly pitched against each other, trying to pull a wet blanket over the film&#146;s
silly premise. Kelly Scott (Bridget Fonda) is the Big Apple paleontologist rebuffed in
love by her big-city museum boss (Kelley regular Adam Arkin in a brief appearance) then
promptly air-plopped in the great outdoors in the company of Twinkie-toting local sheriff
Hank Keough (the great Irish actor Brendan Gleeson, irascibly Americanizing a similar role
he played in <i>This Is My Father</i>) and potential puppy love partner, fish and game
warden Jack Wells (Bill Pullman), easily the weakest link in the film&#146;s starring
quartet. Kelly is the pissed-off fish-out-of-water character, obviously at a loss for some
good cappuccino from the corner Starbucks and harboring an allergy to timber. Mixed into
this bad hatchet job of <i>Jaws</i> arrives the off-kilter faux Matt Hooper character
herein called Hector Cyr, a sonar-equipped, rich, eccentric mythology professor played
with over-acted buffoonery by Oliver Platt, whether treading dangerous water or picking
fights with authority figures.</p>

<p>I&#146;ll single Betty White (God bless you Sue Ann Nivens and Rose Nylund), for daring
to come up with another completely off-the-wall, flaky character (as she did in <i>Hard
Rain</i>) as a lonely widow who lives lakeside with some unusual friends. She has two of
the best verbal expletive-filled zingers in the film. There&#146;s also &quot;I&#146;m
rooting for the crocodile&quot; line heavily featured in the TV trailer. She&#146;s nearly
worth the price of admission for the five minutes or so she&#146;s on screen.</p>

<p><img src="Images/rlakeplacid-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">Technically
pieced together by director Steve Miner (<em>Halloween H20</em>, <em>Forever Young</em>),
with an imposing, ominous score by John Ottman and eye-pleasing cinematography by Daryn
Okada, the film still lacks the electricity of a believable story. Miner, who has directed
episodes of producer-writer Kelley&#146;s television episodic stable and launched the <i>Friday
the 13th</i> franchise, seems to believe <i>Lake Placid 2</i> could be dredged up if the
first offering does decent box office. The film&#146;s ending certainly leaves the
floodgates open in a small way, unfortunately. Stan Winston&#146;s effects are
jaw-dropping and grisly, but the gruesome outbursts are just about all highlighted in the
various trailers promoting the film and there ain&#146;t much left to the imagination if
you&#146;ve caught the previews (except for Betty White&#146;s bon mots). Yes, <i>Lake
Placid</i> is a disconnected beast, good for a half-price matinee or a video rental later
this year, where you can watch it on the appropriate medium for this muddled message. </p>
