<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="5"><b>T</b></font><font size="4">he
Bone Collector</font></span></i><font size="4"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
assumes you know the drill, the serial-killer-movie drill. It gives you most
everything you need to know during the first four minutes, half of which take up
the credits sequence (the credits themselves are, of course, hyper-scratchy and
slashy-looking, very post-<i>Seven</i> stylish). In these few minutes, you see
police stills of carved-up bodies, New York City buildings, cops toasting each
other for triumphant photo-ops, newspaper headlines, and assorted true crime
titles, ascribed to one Lincoln Rhyme. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">So,
you're watching all this, and maybe you're trying to pick out the clues that
will surely help you follow, if not actually solve, the upcoming mystery. But
then you find yourself distracted, and you're thinking, what a preposterously
perfect name for a heroic crime-fighter: Lincoln Rhyme. The name resonates in
ways that probably never occurred to the character's creators. Most obviously,
it recalls the dead president, but beyond that, it invokes young and beautiful
Clarence Williams III intoning &quot;solid&quot; in <i>The Mod Squad</i> or
rapper Busta Rhymes calling out unseemly police tactics in his brilliant
&quot;Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Can See.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">There's
some irony in all this name baggage, because, as you learn two minutes after the
credits, this guy Lincoln Rhyme -- based on the protagonist in Jeffrey Deaver's
best-selling novel and played by the great and noble Denzel Washington -- is an
ex NYC forensics detective, paraplegic since an on-the-job accident (which comes
neatly rehearsed in an introductory bad-dream-flashback, from which Linc wakes
in the requisite sweat). The point is, for all his brilliance and success, Linc
is not your standard issue heroic crime-fighter. In fact, as you also learn --
about ten minutes after the credits -- he's angry, bored, suffering from
debilitating seizures, and suicidal. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Enter
the case that will inspire him to live again. Not to mention the amazing young
rookie partner -- female -- who serves the same purpose. If all this sounds
familiar, then you will have gathered that the most aggravating thing about
Phillip Noyce's thriller is its devotion to formula. Call it: <i>Silence of the
Lambs</i> meets <i>Seven</i> meets <i>Rear Window</i> meets (appropriately
enough) <i>Copycat</i>. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Confined
to this overwrought plot as much as he's confined to Linc's bed, Washington
still manages to make you want to watch what happens (at least until the last
ten minutes, which are so stale as to be painful). Here's the deal: Linc lives
in a fantastic apartment, equipped with the latest in everything tech, including
a slew of voice-activated computer appliances, like an adjustable bed, flawless
scanners and projectors, superspeedy search engines and chips, zoomable
monitors, 3-D chess games. (If all law enforcement equipment were so up-to-date
and actually functioning, perhaps <i>America's Most Wanted</i> would be out of
business.) <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">In
a word, Linc is ideally generic. As is his adversary, the ingenious serial
killer with a grudge and a penchant for elaborate crime scene set-ups. At least
as angry and bored as Linc, he spends way too much time leaving obscure, only-Linc-can-read-em
type clues at the murder scenes -- iron bolts with traces of asbestos, scraps of
really old paper, ancient subway maps, bits of bone and rat hair. True to
formula, he's determined to wreak vengeance on Linc for some long-forgotten
slight. And like any decent movie monster, he's only visible in masks or shadows
as he picks up his victims in his alternately skulking and lurching yellow cab,
thus pressing a familiar &quot;worst nightmare&quot; button for any urban
dweller (question: will this movie do for taxis what <i>Jaws</i> did for the
water?). <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">In
addition to the primary opponents, the film includes the expected third term,
the gifted novice. Unlike Jodie Foster in <i>Silence</i> (but like Grace Kelly
in <i>Rear Window</i>), Amelia (Angelina Jolie) is stunningly beautiful (the
film explains this by making her a child model, much like TV’s <i>Homicide</i>
made the detective played by &amp;&amp;Michael Michele a former beauty queen: in
other words, neither accounting seems plausible). She's also deeply troubled by
a childhood trauma, namely, that she discovered her cop dad's body, dead by
suicide (as far as I can tell, she is not haunted by memories of lambs
screaming). This is a convenient trauma for her relationship with Linc, of
course, since it makes her both sympathetic to his despair but inclined to save
him. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Linc
and Amelia bond in fits and starts, because he's imperious and she's ornery. But
he's struck by her gift for forensics (demonstrated at an early crime scene,
where she -- despite her beat-cop rank -- insists on taking photos and
cataloguing wacky-looking evidence). She's so good at such activity and so mad
at the world that Linc eventually convinces her to take the case with him, in
order to: a) avenge the corpses that so appall her, and b) stop the insanity. As
Linc's &quot;eyes and legs&quot; at subsequent drippy-noir murder scenes, Amelia
is confronted with bodies in various states of grisly discombobulation while
searching for evidence (&quot;working the grid,&quot; as they say in the Crime
Scene biz). <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Together,
Linc and Amelia also fight the usual ignorant hard-ass captain (Michael Rooker)
with help from the usual decent but always-a-step-behind detectives, one of whom
might be a suspect (Ed O'Neill and Mike McGlone) and the usual lab-team ace
(Luis Guzman). Prosaic to its core, <i>The Bone Collector</i> can't surmount its
built-in predictability: the characters you like are appropriate to like,
characters you expect to die do so in appropriately horrific ways, and the
showdown between Linc and the killer delivers the standard mix of dread, action,
and cathartic bloody violence. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Ironically,
what would seem the film's cheesiest distraction -- the unsubtly building
romance between Linc and Amelia -- is its most fascinating aspect, if only
because it's so skillfully executed by its players. Inevitably, the relationship
gives them both what they so desperately need, he being suicidal (how
conveniently like her father, so she can revisit old bullshit) and she being
commitment-phobic. It's the very small gestures that make any of this begin to
work. After Amelia witnesses a particularly harrowing seizure, she approaches
Linc's dozing form to touch his tracheotomy scar and then his fingers. He wakes,
for once not from a nightmare, and they share a painfully delicate moment, laced
with awkward joking and seemingly real affection. For an instant, you might
forget that they're restricted by the plot to come. But only for an instant. <o:p>
