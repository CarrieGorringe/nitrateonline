<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="5">A</font></b><font size="4">rriving under
your Christmas Tree is this under-heralded yet wildly entertaining sci-fi
comedy, a perfect cup of interstellar action-adventure eggnog to compliment the
serious Yuletide films screening in adjoining auditoriums and keep your worries
off impending Y2K misery next week. I’ve managed to open this hilarious gift
twice (Yes, it’s worth it!) and it’s both naughty and nice after repeat
airings in sending up at least a half-dozen films and a few cheesy fantasy TV
shows from yesteryear (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Star Trek</i> being the primary target), not to mention their legions of
singularly focused fans.</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText">The movie is one heck of a space celebration involving
washed-up actors, bruised egos, and one huge misunderstanding surrounding a
seriously cheezy, long-running 1970’s series. From little alien acorns, big
geek-filled science fiction conventions grow, and the movie takes a page from
the documentary <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Trekkies</i> in showcasing
the army of obsessive followers that has fashioned an apparent billion-dollar
merchandizing industry in the eighteen years since the make-believe show was
cancelled. Forget that the aging actors (except for the young “Gary Coleman”
child navigator character, now grown to his early thirties) of the series must
have had awful business acumen and no residuals contracts. They are all pretty
much bad actors in search of a genuine life and job, but entirely content to
accept $15 a pop for their autograph. They all have moral warts under their
costume/uniforms, eventually exorcised after a quartet of real extraterrestrial
beings arrive on earth to recruit them. The straight-haired (think Pugsley
Addams), waddle-walking, forced smile Thermians have unfortunately been watching
the show as fact (“historical documents”), and have based their entire space
fleet on the plastic communicators and battery-operated gizmos of the series.
Except now those gadgets work (most of the time). When they seek the technical
and battle expertise of the “crew” in fighting off a real intergalactic
adversary, the film takes on a whole new intrepid dimension. The earthlings,
incredulous at their hosts’ fictional dysfunction, ask their alien comrades if
they had seen <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Gilligan’s Island</i>. After a pause and sideward glances, their
expression? Absolute sorrow. Oh, the horror. Those poor people! But yes, plot
holes are there right alongside the worm holes—I guess the Thermians never
watched the news. But you shouldn’t to make logical sense out of much of this
filmed comic book.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Borrowing heavily and forever poking fun at various
episodes and some plot devices left unanswered in the wake of the program’s
cancellation, the film warps along with merry glee, thanks to one of the
wittiest scripts of the year. David Howard and Robert Gordon are the culprits
behind this madness, their screenplay ever so wonderfully translated by director
Dean Parisot (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Home Fries</i>), perfectly
picking up his cast’s priceless lunacy. The film is very much in the same vein
as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Men in Black</i> (Gordon’s working on
the sequel to that classic. Whoa!), with passing homage to Joe Dante’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Explorers</i>
(1985). For the record, Harold Ramis bailed as director back in February, due to
“creative differences;” although Dreamworks (which financed the film)
principal Steven Spielberg provided some guidance when visiting the set.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The regulars include Tim Allen (Jason Nesmith, a.k.a.
courageous Commander Peter Quincy Taggart), Sigourney Weaver (Gwen DeMarco,
a.k.a. blonde, big-boobed Valley girl Lt. Tawny Madison), Alan Rickman
(Alexander Dane, a.k.a. half-human, half-reptile Dr. Lazarus), Tony Shalhoub
(Fred Kwan, a.k.a. ace engineer Tech Sergeant Chen), and Daryl Mitchell (Tommy
Webber, a.k.a. top gunner Laredo). Battling within themselves and often against
each other, the underlying roles find some with hang ups or hangovers, even if
maniacally revered by their fans. Nesmith is a self-absorbed, albeit agreeable,
guy. Big-hearted, no-nonsense Gwen seems content to embrace her fans. The
classically trained Dane is a contemptuous panic button, his legitimate career
forever eclipsed by a signature tagline (“You shall be avenged!”) from what
he considers a forgettable role. Fred is Mister Sincerity, with a few screws
loose (watch him struggle to open a cookie tin or happily munch on cheese whiz
during a desperate moment). Tommy appears rudderless, in search of direction.
But as the crew aboard the NSEA <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Protector</i>,
the tv characters are about as dense as their plywood sets. My favorite? Alan
Rickman in the “I am not Spock” Leonard Nimoy role. He stole scenes in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Die
Hard</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves</i>, and does a great hammy act here,
teetering on the edge of sanity but managing to stay in his alien character
makeup through the entire film, space fights and all! And what a marvelous sad
sack intellectual he is, with his purple-flecked reptilian skull-mold a perfect
complement to his uniform. His success here, thankfully, is not at expense of
the others. Everyone, including Sam Rockwell (the really nasty death-row inmate
in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Green Mile</i>), as the newly
recruited Guy Fleegman, gets his/her share of the action. Guy’s running gag is
that he’s afraid he’s the expendable crewman (number six, in this case), one
of those many nameless actors killed off before the opening credits.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">I won’t give details on how the film unfolds because
the less you know the more you’ll enjoy it. As to the writers’ deep rooted
sci-fi references, one hits me straight on that I want to pop in here. Remember
the Dreamworks’ “anything-you-can-do-I-can-do-better” tactic when it
struck a preemptive release of its inferior <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Antz</i>
before Disney’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">A Bug’s Life</i>?
Well, the odd tangent in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Galaxy Quest</i>
is that you have a group of actors battling what looks like a ruthless
grasshopper (love those ear rings!). For those unfortunates who missed <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">A Bug’s Life</i>, it concerns a bunch of insect performers who battle
a merciless grasshopper. Hmmm.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Technically, the film’s a gem. Stan Winston’s
creature design and special effects makeup is right on, with the production
design team of Linda DeScenna, James Nedza, and Ric McElvin making the TV show
look as cheap as they should and the real spaceships truly inspirational.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Galaxy Quest</i> is
a great triumph. For sheer holiday laughs, catch both Tim Allen films NOW. Yeah,
and don’t forget that other masterpiece: <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Toy Story 2</i>.</p>
