<i>Beyond the Clouds</i>, the first feature film directed by Michelangelo
Antonioni in over a decade, John Malkovich plays a filmmaker and photographer
who, descending in a commercial airliner into the fog-bound streets of Ferrara,
is already musing on what form his next film will take after having completed
his last one. It is for this purpose that he has come to an unfamiliar city,
trying to empty his mind of all thoughts, all distractions. &quot;It is in the
darkness that reality lights up, and in the silence that the voices arrive for
words...&quot; It is through images that, he says, he has come to a better
understanding of reality. And it is then that he tells us of the first of four
stories that we will see enacted in the film, the first &quot;a relationship
that lasted for years without ever existing.” <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">This
is the first film by the great modernist director since 1983, when a stroke left
him unable to speak or write. Gradually, with the help of his wife Enrica, he
worked out a system whereby he could communicate again, and, starting in 1989,
began making an active return to filmmaking, directing a series of short films.
By the early Nineties, when he had shown he was ready to direct a feature film,
Wim Wenders, for insurance purposes, had to sign-on as a back-up director.
Wenders directed some of the introductory and connecting segments for the film's
four main episodes, but the majority of what you see on the screen was helmed by
Antonioni himself. (The film premiered in Italy in the fall of 1995, and was a
hit. It is only now receiving proper theatrical distribution in the U.S.,
opening in New York City on Dec. 1, and in Los Angeles on Dec. 3.) <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
film's first and last episodes prove to be the best. A young man (Kim
Rossi-Stuart, who has the striking face of a knight from the <i>Morte d'Arthur</i>)
meets a beautiful, and inviting, young woman (Ines Sastre) at a small hotel
where both are staying. But their meeting never progresses beyond the stage of
conversation. Three years later, they meet again, but, although the young lady
is willing, the young man again cannot instigate a relationship with her,
whether out of fear or concern over how things might develop. The episode, which
has some surprisingly erotic moments to it (and that is a term that I do not
bandy about often, if at all), captures a very rare but precise emotion, the
unexpected sense of precariousness which one feels when confronted with taking
the final step towards acting decisively, or not. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
final episode also has to do with two people who meet by chance. Another young
man (Vincent Perez) is drawn to a young woman (Iréne Jacob) who passes by him
as they go out through a doorway. He follows her, but the calm, yet determined,
way in which she walks down the street -- to church, as it turns out -- makes
her all the more appealing to the young man. Unwilling to lose her as yet, he
goes in to attend church services with her. Is Antonioni taking an unexpected
turn towards religious considerations, here? (It wouldn't be surprising, given
his recent experiences, if his thoughts had turned towards higher matters.) As
it turns out, the story's religious angle is a means whereby things come to a
droll conclusion: the young lady turns out not to be quite so obtainable, after
all. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">In
both episodes, and elsewhere -- a third story where Malkovich's character has an
encounter with a woman, a boutique clerk (Sophie Marceau), in Portofino --
Antonioni, who is in his 80s, shows a vivid regard for the beauty, and sensual
power, of women. Ines Sastre conveys a remarkably down-to-earth quality -- she
shows a satisfied unhurriedness as she changes-clothes before retiring, in one
scene -- and Jacob, an already beautiful actress, glows with a radiant composure
that gives her sequence the transcendent quality it needs. Antonioni is again
working with the cinematographer, Alfio Contini, who did some remarkable visual
work for his 1970 film, <i>Zabriskie Point</i>, among others, and much of the
film has a supple, luminescent quality to it, with a very exact usage of colour
and shading. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
film's third episode is hampered somewhat by two of its performers. Peter Weller
plays an American., living in Paris, who starts an affair with a girl (Chiara
Casselli) whom he meets under unusual circumstances in a cafe. (She tells him
about a news story she read of how people transporting some corpses may have
caused the souls of the deceased to become mislaid along the way.) We then see
him go home to his wife -- only the scene showing him coming home, after the
encounter with the girl in the cafe, turns out to be occurring three years
later. The wife (Fanny Ardant) is upset because she's distraught over whether
the husband has just come home after leaving the bed of his lover. The husband
placates her, but when he next sees his mistress, she's upset over whether he
has just come to her after being with his wife: she says she can sense the
traces of this &quot;cheated woman&quot; on his person. So nobody's happy either
way. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Weller,
who has given one of the best performances of the decade as Bill Lee in David
Cronenberg's film of William S. Burroughs' <i>Naked Lunch</i>, does not perform
well in French, or at least look like he's performing well. (His voice takes on
a disembodied quality that keeps making you look to see whether it's coming from
him or from somewhere else.) And the photography seems to bring out the most
cadaverous, even gibbonesque, qualities of his facial features. Jean Reno, on
the other hand, simply doesn't look comfortable at all. He plays a man who comes
home to an apartment that seems peculiarly under-furnished. It turns out that
his wife has just left him, and emptied the place out in the process. Then, the
apartment's new tenant turns up to take occupancy -- Ardant's jilted wife.
Walking with dangling arms and the broad-shouldered gait of a loading dock
worker, Reno seems ill-at-ease working in a film made by a director of stature.
But the episode packs some punch: it concludes with two characters recognizing
in each other that particular sense of sadness that occurs when people have just
been disappointed and heartbroken by someone with whom they were in love. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Towards
the end of <i>Beyond the Clouds</i>, there is a short episode where Jeanne
Moreau and the late Marcello Mastroianni appear. The two performers had appeared
in Antonioni's <i>La Notte</i>, back in 1961, and it is obvious, here, that they
enjoy working with each other again: the sequence has an infectious quality that
is genuinely touching. Mastroianni is seen painting the same landscape in
Aix-en-Provence that had been previously painted by Cezanne, and replicating
Cezanne's style while doing so. Moreau, passing by, wonders aloud why he should
copy this particular view of a landscape done by Cezanne, in the style of
Cezanne, when, if he wanted a picture of it, a simple photograph would do. But,
Mastroianni responds, anyone who copies the work of a great artist stands a
chance to also copy the manner of a great artist, even, perhaps, the artist's
exact gesture. &quot;A copy of a gesture,&quot; Moreau says. Mastroianni's
response: Why not? Copying the gesture of a genius would give him more
satisfaction than any that he might do himself. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Antonioni,
of course, doesn't need to copy anyone. He's already firmly established his own
style, and entering this film is like stepping into a new room where, once
you're past the doorway, the rhythms and pacing are new but are also highly
agreeable. (The film will be praised by some critics for this superficial
quality alone, in our age of slam-'em, bam-'em movie style.) Chris Wagstaff
wrote in an article that appeared in <i>Sight and Sound</i> of how Antonioni
would come up with ingenious ways to film scenes that, in terms of shot-countershot
techniques of filming, would seem different from the norm but would turn out to
work splendidly when finally seen assembled on the screen. In a take that rivals
the extraordinary closing shot of his 1975 film, <i>The Passenger</i>, Antonioni
concludes <i>Beyond the Clouds</i> with a view of four windows in a hotel where
Malkovich's character is staying: a person alone, two people together, another
person alone yet introspective, and finally, in the only window looking into an
unlit room, Malkovich's filmmaker-photographer. After viewing the four stories
his character tells us about and which we, then, see, enacted, for ourselves, he
brings the film to a close by receding from viewing -- or seeming to. We can
only go on the basis of what we, ourselves, see at that moment. (The shimmering
music that accompanies this sequence is by U2 and Brian Eno, who contributed to
creating the film's music score along with Lucio Dalla, Laurent Petitgand and
Van Morrison.) <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Beyond
the Clouds</span></i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
is one of the very, very, very rare films which comes to expand and take on
greater significance in your mind after you see it, and becomes more meaningful,
even more precious (in the best sense of the word), in your recollection. Its
observations have a more ruminative, more informed and compassionate quality to
them. This does not seem like the work of a man who, in 1966, said, ”...I
don't think there is any love in the world. Nobody is in love. Also, there is no
feeling for family. No religion. Most people of the new generation are dreamers.
L.S.D. and mescaline are better for them than love.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Malkovich's
character wonders about the ability to capture experience through art, or
writing, or filmmaking, because the experience, as conveyed to an audience, is
always going to be one step removed from the actual thing. Like frames on a
wound reel of film, ”...we know that, behind every image revealed, there is
another image more faithful to reality, and in back of that image there is
another, and yet another behind the last one, and so on, up to the true image of
that absolute, mysterious reality that no one will ever see....&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
most striking thing about the film, directly after seeing it, is that Antonioni
seems, still, to be concerned with the same things that concerned him when he
made <i>L'Avventura </i>over 30 years ago: the inability of people to truly
communicate, and to make truly lasting bonds, whether it's in a personal
relationship between two people or the relationship between an artist and an
audience. The tone and form of these concerns hasn't seemed to have changed
much. Plans were announced last spring for Antonioni to direct a new film that
would appear in theaters next year, and while we should only be so lucky to have
the opportunity to see another new Michelangelo Antonioni film, one wonders if
he will ever find solutions to the problems of the human condition that continue
to haunt him. <o:p>
