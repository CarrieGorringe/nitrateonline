<p>It&#146;s time to hire a lawyer and sue MGM (&quot;75 Years&#133;A Legacy of
Excellence&quot;) for this felony of a film. Frankly, after three quarters of a century,
94 minutes of this stiff is enough to neuter Leo the Lion. Heck, the beast is dead; I was
asking for battle pay after suffering through this counterculture flop. Webster&#146;s
Dictionary and entire audiences will be rewriting the definition of &quot;turkey&quot;
based on a viewing of this fowl-feathered television police drama retread, yet another in
the dismal string of old TV series recycled to the big screen (following last month&#146;s
disastrous <i>My Favorite Martian</i> and the forthcoming <i>Charlie&#146;s Angels</i>).
The curse of Aaron Spelling is upon us (and you thought &quot;actress&quot;-daughter Tori
was bad enough). Run! Hide! Call the police! Write your Congressman! But most of all, do
not even think of buying a ticket to this moronic attempt to revive the Seventies
mentality in a 1999 shell.</p>

<p>Claire Danes, Giovanni Ribisi, and Omar Epps fill the shoes of Peggy Lipton, Michael
Cole, and Clarence Williams III as the eponymous trio Julie, Pete, and Linc. The originals
aired on ABC from 1968 through 1973 and this latest theatrical effort is actually the
second ruse to pump new life into the old series, the first being the made-for-television <i>The
Return of Mod Squad</i> in 1979. Neither revival succeeded, thank goodness, but the new
version is attempting to drag you into multiplexes everywhere under the marketing spell of
a shameless studio.</p>

<p>Several years ago I was blessed to attend the San Sebastian (Spain) Film Festival and
catch director Scott Silver&#146;s feature directorial debut with <i>the little seen johns</i>,
a bleak story of Los Angeles street hustlers featuring Lukas Haas and David Arquette,
which won over audiences and captured one of the festival&#146;s awards. Kevin Thomas of
the Los Angeles Times called it &quot;<i>Midnight Cowboy</i> for the &#145;90s,&quot;
harking on the John Schlesinger classic released a half-year after three &quot;hippie
cops&quot; invaded America&#146;s living rooms. Wish as I may that there was as nice a
corollary for Silver&#146;s second film, but this one just brings to mind
&quot;1999&#146;s answer to <i>The Avengers</i>.&quot; No, it&#146;s not pretty. Not
pretty at all. Silver mentions in the press material that &quot;we wanted to make it
timeless,&quot; but if you&#146;re unfortunate enough to see this tiresome update,
you&#146;ll probably remember for all eternity how bad it really is. But anyone who calls
Aaron Spelling a genius, as Silver does, deserves to be caught up in this cinematic
sinkhole.</p>

<p>This bomb of seismic proportions (if the disjointed script and awful direction
don&#146;t kill you, the over-produced, brassy soundtrack will, at the least, make you
deaf) has us believe that the L.A.P.D., under one Captain Adam Greer (Dennis Farina,
lately of Spelling&#146;s retro Buddy Faro series), has recruited three small-time
criminals with an attitude problem, and given them a dubious, undercover position within
the force, despite the growling of the real cops. Danes, now a college freshman at Yale,
should be spending more time with her studies than playing a gullible, recovering
alcoholic half-wit, while Ribisi still seems caught up in his <i>The Other Sister</i> role
as the mentally-challenged, formerly middle-class, Danny McMahon, even to the point of
barking early on in his role here as a ridiculous, over-sexed crash dummy. Poor Omar Epps
is the token underused black icon (although <i>The Practice&#146;s</i> Steve Harris adds a
few minutes of screen time), generally crouching in the shadows watching the bad guys. And
there are plenty of crooks, most of which you can guess from reel one, but also including
Michael Lerner in an unintentionally hilarious and uneasy role as Howard, a shady, fey,
gold-chained gangster with a predilection for an impromptu dance.</p>
<i>

<p>The Mod Squad </i>conjures up the best work of Ed Wood (or the worst of Aaron
Spelling). The cocky threesome talk about &quot;playing cop&quot; at one point in the
film. Unfortunately, they play cops badly. Any gunplay in the movie should be redirected
at the people responsible for this offense. In my scrawl of notes I underlined one
sentence several times: This is a mess! Enough said.</p>
