<p><big><strong><big>&quot;I</big></strong> see dead people, &quot; says eight-year-old
Cole Sear (Osment) to his therapist, the renowned child psychologist, Dr. Malcolm Crowe
(Willis). And he really does &#150; in fact, he&#146;s the only one who can see them. His
mother (Collette) certainly can&#146;t explain why a cherished necklace given to her by
her late mother ends up in one of Cole&#146;s dresser drawers on a regular basis, unless
he&#146;s given to bouts of theft. He&#146;s an outcast at school, among both students and
staff, despite his obvious intelligence; he has to pay someone to walk with him to school
so that his mother will believe otherwise. </big></p>

<p><img src="Images/r6thsense-1.jpg" alt="The Sixth Sense" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">And yet Cole, for all of his internal torments and exterior tormentors, has not
been searching for assistance. It is Dr. Crowe who has decided to seek out Cole, not only
because he believes he can help him, but also because the good doctor needs to believe
that he can. Less than a year earlier, Dr. Crowe, flush with praise from an awards
ceremony, confronted an armed intruder in his home. The intruder turned out to be none
other than one of his former patients, Vincent Gray (a completely unrecognizable Donnie
Wahlberg) who had fallen through the doctor&#146;s busy schedule, and fallen apart as a
result. The doctor was the recipient of the distraught young man&#146;s wrath and
retribution. Struggling with the nagging impression that he just might be a fraud, Crowe
is desperate to help Cole. If only the boy would quit making up stories about seeing dead
people and just accept the doctor&#146;s diagnosis of paranoid schizophrenia like a good
patient, everything would work out just swimmingly. Of course, circumstances are
inalterable unless Crowe can be brought around to an understanding of Cole&#146;s unwanted
gifts of perception, because Cole needs the doctor&#146;s help to fulfill the mission for
which he has unknowingly and unwittingly been selected.</p>

<p>On the face of it, director/screenwriter Shymalan&#146;s recent film (following his
feature debut, <i>Wide Awake</i>) appears to be a refreshing 180-degree shift away from
the usual mystery/horror offerings of mayhem and gore, and that would be a fair assessment
of it. Or, rather, I should say that that&#146;s the impression you get in retrospect.
While you&#146;re actually in the theatrical grip of <i>The Sixth Sense</i>, the feelings
experienced therein are far less ambiguous. The film isn&#146;t necessarily too
terrifying, but while Shymalan is toying with your expectations like a confidence
trickster, not willing to give the game away until the last few frames, a sense of
frustration tends to set in, as you get only what the director is willing to give you at
the time. It&#146;s a cinematic strip-tease, and one that, at times, seems almost too
clever by half for its own good. Only after the payoff, and after your mind races over the
cinematic landscape just exposed to your purview, searching in vain for continuity errors,
do you sense how very deftly Shymalan&#146;s deception has played on your expectations. To
sustain this parlor trick over one sequence is admirable; to maintain it for 106 minutes
is quite incredible &#150; by contemporary standards. The director is asking his audience
not only to meet him half way, but to do its share of the work, and there will be some who
are not willing to do so. </p>

<p>A shame, really, because <i>The Sixth Sense </i>gives back considerably more than what
it takes, but it does so in one post-filmic swoop rather than by degrees. It&#146;s a
story about more than a boy who sees dead people; it speaks to the fundamental fear in all
of us: that we might die, our last wishes unknown to those still alive, with no one
knowing what really happened, with no comfort, and with injustices against us left
unpunished (this is, of course, why, aside from the randomness and violence associated
with serial murder, its practitioners have been anointed the newest bogeymen for this
fin-de-siecle society). Under the circumstances, Shymalan has turned contemporary
Philadelphia and this quasi-surrealistic tale of phantoms into a metaphor for the deepest
human despair, with none of the pretentious portent that a less skillful filmmaker might
have drawn upon to prematurely engender suspense in the audience. Replete with confidence,
the director lets the film speak for itself, since its voice is resounding. </p>

<p><img src="Images/r6thsense-2.jpg" alt="The Sixth Sense" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">Now, if someone had just gotten to Bruce Willis during the opening sequence
when he has to create the role of loving, if neglectful, husband to the lovely Anna
(Williams), the entire package would have been perfect. Willis&#146;s scenes with young
Osment (a young actor whose every gesture implies a deep well of precocious maturity) are
replete with empathy and compassion, while his attempts at marital interplay are less than
persuasive because they seem half-hearted in comparison. It&#146;s immediately tempting to
blame Willis&#146; real-life breakup with wife Demi Moore as the source of his
awkwardness, but the problem goes back to Willis&#146; unwillingness to abandon the usual
flippant shuck-and-jive routine that is his substitute for emoting, and that&#146;s due to
the fact that it&#146;s typically the only thing he&#146;s ever asked to do in what passes
for tender moments in his action-film repertoire. Usually, Willis can get away with this
minimalist (negativist?) approach to acting, but not here. There&#146;s a good actor
somewhere underneath those smirks, but it will take an archeologist to find him.</p>
<i>

<p>The Sixth Sense</i> is a bonbon of a mystery film for narrative connoisseurs to savor,
with many deeper issues wrapped inside. They should, however, be prepared to receive their
pleasures after the fact, and to earn them through the exercising of considerable
patience. Their efforts will be rewarded.</p>
