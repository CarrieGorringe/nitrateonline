<p><big><strong><big>T</big></strong>his U.K. import will only find a smallish audience to
appreciate its time-skipping story of two chums who grew up, fell apart, and then reunited
as young adults at the end of the London underground Metropolitan Line. Last stop, <i>Metroland</i>.
Very reminiscent of Michael Leigh&#146;s Career Girls, this variant from long-time Brit
feature and television director Philip Saville (dating back to 1966&#146;s <i>Stop the
World -- I Want To Get Off</i>) shows of his yeoman abilities to put an admirable but
ultimately &quot;so-what&quot; spin on the screenplay by Adrian Hodges (last represented
on these shores with his Academy Award-nominated <i>Tom and Viv</i> five years ago. This
well told story about relatively drab characters -- which feels better suited to the small
screen -- is based on the 19-year-old debut novel by Julian Barnes (a French adaptation of
his Love, etc. is scheduled to arrive in the States at the end of May), greatly admired by
the feature&#146;s director and producer Andrew Bendel.</big></p>

<p>After a flurry of film festival presentations (Venice, Toronto, Palm Springs, Seattle,
etc.), <i>Metroland</i> stops at New York and Los Angeles stations before shuttling into
other railyards nationwide this spring. Thankfully, the film doesn&#146;t crash or burn,
but just moves along at it&#146;s own assured pace, reflecting on the tediousness of life
and the middle-class ruts that strand many people along the tracks. American folk singer
Pete Seeger years ago intoned of such communities as &quot;little boxes made of
ticky-tacky,&quot; and this British cinematic equivalent does have its moments, including
a short, witty one defining the neighborhood routine of commuter husbands all washing
their cars in unison. hristian Bale and Lee Ross play best buds Chris and Toni, a chaotic
relationship cemented back in 1963 (and embellished through a series of flashbacks in
which these members of the &quot;angry generation&quot; spite their bourgeois neighbors).
As the film unfolds it is 1977 and Chris has settled into a comfortable, boring life less
than a mile from where he grew up. He has a complacent commercial photography job (a
long-planned photo book lays buried in an office drawer), a beautiful yet unsociable wife,
Marion (Oscar winner/nominee Emily Watson), and a baby whose ill-timed outbursts often
interrupt its parents&#146; sleep and sex life. Another abrupt obstruction in their
day-to-day existence (signaled by a 3:30 a.m. phone call) is the unannounced re-appearance
of the obnoxious, anti-establishment Toni, returning to England after five years abroad.
The reunion is a tenuous one, their divergent paths having set their lifestyles in
different social strata. A ruffled, disheveled Toni drags his domesticated friend into a
punk bar that shows off clean-cut Chris&#146; fish-out-of-water nature. Efforts by the
childish Toni, he of the raging libido and all-hours party mindset, to bring out his old
schoolmate&#146;s dark side is compounded by Chris&#146; own wishful daydreams in which
his doting wife suggests her husband dabble about with other women. Like an out-of-shape
athlete, the reserved Chris nearly fumbles away his morals at his friend&#146;s bidding,
and ends up instead with a case of plop-plop, fizz-fizz.</p>

<p>By contrast, Chris makes the brief acquaintance of a ghost-like fellow commuter (John
Wood), put out to pasture after a 42-year job stint with little to show, other than the
limited future that lay ahead for Chris. So, perhaps it is time to give the devilish Toni
his do. The tensions escalate as the guys realize their half-decade schism apart is
actually growing wider as they reminisce about their past, exacerbated by Marion&#146;s
obvious disdain for the irresponsible Toni&#146;s intrusion, and speckled with a touch of
jealousy.</p>

<p>Toni&#146;s pontifications about free love and Chris&#146; accidental discovery of some
of his old soft core photographs hidden in French edition of Flaubert evokes an extended
flashback by the now-and-ever monogamous Chris to his virginal days in 1968 in Bohemian,
post-riot Paris, where he becomes a lover to the passionate, carefree Annick (Elsa
Zylberstein), a leopard-skin outfitted stunner whose voracious sexual appetite sparks up
her scenes a notch. Jean-François Robin&#146;s photography captures the period and locale
perfectly, washing this sequence in a sepia-yellow tone</p>

<p>Christian Bale (<i>Empire of the Senses</i>, <i>Portrait of a Lady</i>, and <i>Velvet
Goldmine</i>) is a hot item with a growing arena of fans. He hits the right notes here as
a poor sot stuck in a hole. Lions Gate Films, which is releasing <i>Metroland</i>, has
cast Bale as a serial killer in the controversial adaptation of Brett Easton Ellis&#146;
novel &quot;American Psycho&quot; (a notorious project once connected with Leonardo
DiCaprio), but his next appearance will be alongside Kevin Kline and Michelle Pfeiffer in
the forthcoming <i>A Midsummer&#146;s Night Dream</i>, the latest update in a season
already full of Shakespeare. Lee Ross fills his nasty foil role with just the right touch
of antagonism and hedonism. Neither actor has had as much recognition among American
audiences as Emily Watson though, and while she captures her role as a sedate suburban
housewife with the same compassion she has all of her just five films, her character is
largely subordinate this go round and is nowhere close to her earlier award-winning
performances.</p>

<p>There&#146;s nothing extraordinary about <i>Metroland</i>. It&#146;s a gracious tome
about strained relationships painted on the ordinary canvas of middle class life. Like
Chris&#146; double-guessing character, the film might or might not be worth you stopping
off for a look, but you best do it sooner than later as I suspect this won&#146;t be
around all that long.</p>
