<p><big><strong><big>G</big></strong>ood grief. Is another Rugrats movie upon us? Just as
that earlier film has recently passed the $100,000,000 domestic box office total, Disney
hopes that some of the young crowd that supported Paramount&#146;s release will mosey on
over to this new animated creation. Regretfully, this reviewer still hasn&#146;t caught up
with <em>The Rugrats Movie</em>, and only a last minute &quot;why not&quot; prodded me
along to <em>Doug&#146;s 1st Movie</em>, a barebones expansion of the Nickelodeon then ABC
Saturday morning television series developed by the creative team of Jim Jinkins and David
Campbell. The genteel near-teenage world of Bluffington is innocuous enough, populated
with colored and colorful characters but hardly the stuff from which Disney thinks a big
screen franchise will sprout. When you&#146;re aiming for the tyke market, this 73-minute
feature is more than able to keep the kids from squirming in their seats. The few adults
along with them will find some oddly refreshing self-referential moments at hand -- good
for a slight chuckle -- along with shameless references to <em>Creature From the Black
Lagoon</em>, <em>Robocop</em>, and numerous other films. If your kid-less, or your little
monsters are now out of grade school, I&#146;d suggest you pass on this padded hour before
you cry yuck.</big></p>

<p>For the parents among us, at least those in the Disney demographic model marketed here,
Doug Funnie (Thomas McHugh), seemingly modeled after Dick Tracy -- with nine hairs
standing from his flat top -- and his pal Skeeter (Fred Newman) are budding adolescents
battling the green-skinned, red-haired bully Roger Klotz (Chris Phillips) on one hand and
a sweet-natured legendary creature, later christened Herman Melville (Frank Welker) from a
nearby polluted lake. At school, Doug has his eye on Patti Mayonnaise (Connie Shulman),
but she&#146;s being diverted by Guy Graham (Guy Hadley), a blue-haired, purple-faced
egotistical upper-classman. The stories all converge satisfactorily at the annual
Valentine Day&#146;s dance. It ain&#146;t much, and screenwriter Ken Scarborough keeps the
pre-pimple tension believable within the confines of Doug&#146;s world.</p>

<p>Amusing cinematic devices, mostly intended for adults, include daydreams in faded color
(with dirt-speckled scratches, army motif and &#145;40s music) and black-and-white
(strongly evoking the same punch line used in the hilarious short subject Bambi Meets
Godzilla); mini-previews a la Saturday serials of yesteryear; and an extended testimonial
to a wigged-out, dressed-up E.T. There&#146;s also an occasional visual gag, including one
dealing with a naval vessel&#146;s steering wheel prop in a land-locked house that tilts
the room when someone accidentally turns the wheel. And, yes, there is some baby toilet
humor. But no one gets killed or pummeled, a major moral plus in any movie these days.</p>

<p>Director Maurice Joyce tackles his feature debut after a ten year apprenticeship on
such projects as <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>, <em>Beavis and Butthead Do America</em>.,
and <em>King of the Hill</em>. It has been reported that when Joyce grows up he wants to
become a fireman. And if that doesn&#146;t work out, he can always come back to Hollywood.</p>
