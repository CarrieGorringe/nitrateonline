<p><big><strong><big>C</big></strong>lint Eastwood seems to be one of the only filmmakers
working today who makes movies because there is something in each and every one of them
that personally interests him, that seems to call for them to exist as movies at all. In <i>True
Crime</i>, he plays Steve Everett, a reporter for the Oakland &quot;Tribune&quot;, and a
screw-up in both his professional and personal lives -- somewhat removed from the types of
characters that, twenty years ago, first brought him to attention. He smokes, drinks (less
than he used to), womanizes, makes promises that he can't keep -- but he isn't shown as
being cocky or vain about it. In fact, his self-assurance seems to barely mask his
realization that he is at the point in life where he may be running out of luck.</big></p>

<p>Steve is assigned to cover a story that had been started by another staff journalist,
the impending execution of a man, Frank Beachum (Isaiah Washington), who was convicted and
sentenced to die in San Quentin for the murder of a young, pregnant woman working at a
convenience store. Steve lives by no particular faith or credo, except for what he calls
his &quot;nose&quot; -- the innate journalistic instinct of whether a story or situation
is true or not. After his first meeting with Beachum, Steve comes to suspect that
something about his case may be awry. He has before midnight, less than 24 hours away, to
prove whether he's right.</p>

<p>The film, which Eastwood directed from a screenplay adapted by three writers (see
above) from Andrew Klavan's novel, tries to work in many different strains of material, to
uneven effect. There is the matter of race, such as in when Steve checks the transcripts
of Beachum's case and discovers that he was convicted based on the testimony of two
witnesses who saw him, covered with the victim's blood, making a hasty getaway from the
crime scene. The two witnesses who testified were white; a third witness at the scene of
the murder, whom the police apparently didn't bother to check up on, turns out to have
been black. The scenes of Beachum with his wife (Lisa Gay Hamilton) and young daughter, on
the day prior to his execution, contrast with those of Steve juggling, without much
success, picking up and dropping off his young daughter with his exasperated ex-wife
(Diane Venora). (Steve and his child literally race their way through a visit to the
Oakland Zoo.) The authorities are less than cooperative with his inquiries, less they
lose-face; the protestors seen outside of San Quentin are seen angrily championing the
murder victim, who was young and about to have a child. Other people also try to take some
sort of advantage from the occasion of Beachum's execution. And Steve even puts his job on
the line with both his, also exasperated, city editor (Denis Leary), and the newspaper's
editor-in-chief (James Woods), who also happens to know the value of a good story. Through
it all, there is the continual feeling that Steve is not just rushing back and forth
across the Bay Area on the behalf of saving a man's life; he will also save his career,
and himself, if he can prove that he's right and come up with a big journalistic coup.</p>

<p>If the movie had successfully managed to integrate everything that's been poured into
it, and to turn or subvert the clichés of a prison execution drama, it might have emerged
as something more than it is. In the end, the picture ends up turning into just another
race-against-the-clock drama. But even second-rate Eastwood pictures are, now, not without
their merits. He pulls the first real good screen performance I've seen out of Denis Leary
(who chews gum furiously in all his scenes, his trademark cigarettes having been taken
away from him) -- Leary keeps his head up, maintains eye contact with people, and finally
reveals that he can hold his own in front of the camera. The scenes with Washington and
Hamilton have genuinely poignant strains to them, in unexpected ways. Eastwood also has
some scenes with James Woods that turn out to be real doozies -- but some of the scenes
that also have real dramatic bite to them are those with the actress Hattie Winston, who
plays a middle-aged woman whom Steve visits at her home in a run-down section of</p>

<p>suburban Richmond. Winston's character is not unsympathetic, but, as she points out,
there are stabbings and shootings all the time in her neighborhood, sometimes right
outside her front door. Why aren't the Oakland &quot;Tribune&quot; reporters swarming all
over these crimes? Steve does not have a ready answer to that. In fact, Eastwood risks
making the hero of this drama look like a stumblebum, imperfect yet human.</p>

<p>He also ends the film on a curiously ambiguous note, where Steve receives no big
laudatories or rewards for all the work he's seen putting in on behalf of someone whose
existence he hadn't even known about until a day or so before. What Eastwood is after is
something unspoken, something that states that, for every &quot;big&quot; victory that
receives fanfare, there are other times when people have to content themselves with not
being feted for what they've accomplished, even if it was the correct course of action.
Eastwood risks ending this imperfect but ambitious picture with a thud, but it is because
it seems like the right, the true way to do so.</p>
