<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><b><i>Sean

company was initially approached to become involved in the 2000 AS SEEN BY
series.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><b><i>Don

guess you know it’s a series of ten films from ten countries about the turning

</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><b><i>DM</i></b>:
No, so you’re thinking ‘Why did they ask me?’<o:p>

<hr size="4" width="60">

</b></i> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><b><i>SA</i></b>:
I’m wondering why it took so long.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><b><i>DM</i></b>:
Partially it’s because there was a lot of pressure on me, I felt, to make my
first feature. I had directed a couple of short films, I’d directed on the
stage before, people knew me fairly well in Canada for acting and writing, and
people kept saying to me ‘We’re waiting for your first film, Don.’ My
director friends, Atom Egoyan and others, we’re saying ‘We’re waiting,
Don, we’re all there for you,” and it was just impossible for me to create
under those circumstances. At least in my mind everyone was waiting, though
I’m sure it’s not the case. So it was great to have the incentive of this
commission, to force me to come up with something without thinking too much. The
idea came very quickly and I wrote the script faster than I ever did, so I’m
grateful. I’d directed a couple of short films that got around quite a bit and
had been written up in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Cahiers du Cinéma</i>
and they knew them in France, so that’s how they knew I was interested.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<i><b>

<hr size="4" width="60">

</b></i> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><b><i>SA</i></b>:
You’ve acted in so many films before, how did you go about casting this? I
know you’d worked with many of them before, and I notice that half the cast of
David Cronenberg’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">eXistenZ</i> winds up
in this film.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><b><i>DM</i></b>:
That’s true, but actually I’d made my film before <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">eXistenZ</i> and David (Cronenberg, who appears in a supporting role in
McKellar’s film) really liked <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Last Night
</i>and drew a number of cast members from it for his film, which made me very
proud. It’s the most flattering and satisfying thing you can do as a director,
to get your actors work, so I was happy that he cast Callum Keith Rennie and
Sarah Polley form my film, but also he said he would have cast Sandra Oh if
he’d had a role. But yeah, I’d worked with many of them before. And I think
partially, because it was my first film, I wanted actors that I knew, I knew
their work, I trusted them as people too. Because I was going to acting in the
film too I didn’t want any difficult actors. I wanted actors who were tough
and who had done some work, so I drew on my acquaintances quite a bit. It’s
perceived as an all-star cast in Canada, kind of, so it helped me also funding
this. I love my cast. I didn’t write any of the parts for these people, but as
soon as I’d finished they immediately came to mind and I got my dream cast.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><b><i>SA</i></b>:
They are a terrific cast. I’m a big fan of Sarah Polley and I think she’s
about ready to hit it big. She was terrific in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Go!</i>,
but she’s terrific in everything.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><b><i>SA</i></b>:
You have been writing screenplays for years now. How did you start? Was Bruce
McDonald the first to approach you?<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><b><i>DM</i></b>:
Yeah, I’d been working in theater, actually, I had a theater company which
seemed like a more reasonable career choice in Toronto at the time, and Bruce
just asked me – Bruce, who was at that point Atom Egoyan’s editor – asked
me if I would be interested in writing a film and he offered me a couple bucks,
maybe $100 (laughs), as a sort of up front payment, and at the time it was more
like a job but then as I got into it and I realized I could actually make movies
of course I was really excited.<o:p>

</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><b><i>DM</i></b>:
I started writing <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Highway 61</i> first,
but then we realized it would take a little bit of time to get it together
because it involved travel, it was going to be a fairly expensive movie, though
compared to most films it was incredibly cheap, but before that we did a film
called <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Roadkill</i>, which was really,
really, really low budget road movie with Joey Ramone.<o:p>
</o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><b><i>SA</i></b>:
I haven’t seen it but a friend of mine saw it at a film festival and
couldn’t stop raving about it.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><b><i>DM</i></b>:
I like it, I think it’s quite fun. It was certainly thrilling for me because
it was the first thing I ever made and it sold. It won an award at the Toronto
Film Festival, so it was really a big boost to all of us.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><b><i>SA</i></b>:
Did you work together on the screenplay or did you work together on the
story…?<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><b><i>DM</i></b>:
<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Roadkill</i> was such an odd thing because
it was initially supposed to be a documentary about this band who got lost in
Northern Ontario on tour – well, as a documentary they weren’t supposed to
get lost – but then Bruce had problems with the band, they started threatening
him and the lead singer took a vow of silence, which is a problem in a
documentary, and he kept asking me to write more. At first he just asked me to
write some scenes or some ideas like, say, the band meets the ghost of Jimi
Hendrix, something like that, but by the end he was saying ‘Write a script,’
so I wrote a script very quickly and again it was a great push to get me to
write my first script. And then after that I wrote <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Highway 61</i>, based a lot on Bruce’s ideas, he had these weird
notions, but also based on album covers and maps and all these things he’d
collected.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><b><i>SA</i></b>:
With the Bruce McDonald rock and roll films and your collaborations with
Francois Girard, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Thirty-Two Short Films
About Glenn Gould</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Red Violin</i>,
not to mention the completely bizarro soundtrack to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Last Night </i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>you’ve
worked music into all of your films.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><b><i>DM</i></b>:
Music is very important to me. I always have music playing when I’m writing
and I have pretty wide musical taste. I remember when <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Thirty-Two Short Films About Glenn Gould</i> played in Venice, the first
question at the press conference was “You’ve done rock and roll movies with
Bruce McDonald and now you’re doing this film, what’s happening there?”
The fact is I used to listen to Glenn Gould music the way other people my age
would listen to Pink Floyd in the basement. I never really had that distinction.<o:p>

whereas many actors like…<o:p>

</b></i> 
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><b><i>SA</i></b>:
I wasn’t thinking of Jim Carrey. Like Colm Feore, recently, someone who I
think of as a Canadian actor who went to Hollywood to find roles and he wound up
landing supporting roles in big films whereas Callum Keith Rennie and Sarah
Polley and you stayed in Canada, around Toronto.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><b><i>DM</i></b>:
It’s<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>partly patriotism but it’s
also a recognition that it’s possible to stay in our hometown and work. It’s
also a recognition around the world, even in Hollywood, that local filmmaking is
still possible, that you don’t have to move to Hollywood. I think it’s
partly a technological thing too, that you don’t have to be there in Hollywood
in order to get Hollywood money. I think less and less that it’s necessary to
move there. That is, with a certain kind of film. If you’re James Cameron,
obviously you move from Niagara Falls and leave Canada because the idea of
making those films in Canada is inconceivable, or if you’re Jim Carrey it
makes sense. But if not, Canada offers a possibility of a certain amount of
control over your films that’s very unique in the world, actually, it’s very
privileged. I think we’re all beginning to see that because thanks to certain
people like Atom Egoyan and a few of us who have done well.<o:p>

Cronenberg was the first but he’s saying now that it’s the first time that
he feels that there’s a community around him because he was a go it alone guy

time. All his films were made in Toronto and he was a real role model for a lot
of us because of that.<o:p>
