<p><big><big></big>f it had not been for a visit to a movie theater at
the Treasure Island Naval Base, in San Francisco, California in 1969, you would not be
reading these words.</big></p>

<p>Of course, I had already had exposure to the movies. My parents actively went to see
the latest pictures before I came along. My older sister Marge pestered them to take her
to see a drive-in showing of <i>A Hard Day's Night</i>, in Norfolk, Virginia, sometime
around 1964, and of which I remember almost nothing. (For years, I mistakenly thought that
the second feature, which screened first, before the Beatles movie, was <i>Fall of the
Roman Empire</i>, of which my folks made many jokes about it needing to be retitled <i>My
Son, the Emperor</i>. It was actually <i>My Son, The Hero</i>, a French/Italian peplum
flick produced by Ariane Mnoushkine, much shorter than the Anthony Mann picture, and also
released by U.A., the same company handling <i>Hard Day's Night</i>.)</p>

<p>And there were the &quot;de rigueur&quot; trips to see Disney movies. The Memrose, in
Norfolk, was the premiere Disney cinema, and to get to the auditorium, you had to walk
down a long mezzanine, with mirrors set in the walls on both sides, and a vaulting, domed
ceiling that was painted pale white and blue, with little silver stars set into it. Inside
the auditorium, the curtains over the screen were black velvet with gold decoration on the
bottom which, when lit from below, gave a magical, empirical effect. This was back at a
time when people in the audience politely applauded, as a matter of show, at the
conclusion of a motion picture showing.</p>

<p>The Memrose also once showed a European-made live-action version of <i>Snow White</i>,
where I was terrified from having to stand in-line outside the theater next to the poster
for <i>Bunny Lake is Missing</i>. (Naturally, I later became a fan and collector of Saul
Bass' work.) There was also the time when my mother went to take us to see a movie, there,
and the ticket lady, who had apparently come to recognize us by-sight, told Mom, no, no,
you don't want to take your kids to see this picture. Take them to see <i>Billie</i>,
which was playing at another, probably rival, theater. We did, and while Marge and Mom
loved it, I don't remember what my impressions at the time were at all. When I saw it, 30
years later, on Cinemax, I can scarcely imagine how we made it all the way through it.</p>

<p>When my Dad served on the officer staff of the U.S.S. &quot;Lexington&quot;, we would
go for officers' dinner on Sundays in the wardroom, where we were served on tables with
white linen and formal settings. After dessert, the movie screen would be lowered, and we
would see a film, which Dad selected from a group of cards listing several current movies
that were available to be shown on-board ship. This was 1967 - 68, so we saw the innocuous
ones, like <i>Bullwhip Griffin</i>, and the <i>Travelling Saleslady</i> movie with Phyllis
Diller, still sitting in the same places where we had just been served dinner. The
naughtier movies were screened for the crew, elsewhere, on the ship. One time, I got
fed-up with Elizabeth Hartman yelling in <i>A Patch of Blue</i>, and asked Dad if I could
go on-rounds with him when he was scheduled to do so. I got to walk the deck of one of the
last wooden-decked aircraft carriers in-commission, and later got to sit in the captain's
seat on-bridge. Almost 10 years later, Dad and I took in <i>Midway</i>, which we had heard
used the &quot;Lexington&quot; for some scenes. I was shocked and surprised when Henry
Fonda, sitting on a ship's bridge in one scene, turned around in his chair: it had the
same markings, on the back, as the one I'd sat in.</p>

<p>And, I was a &quot;child of television&quot;, as Gabriel Kaplan put it, so there I was,
planted nose-to-nose in front of the tube, as per every other kid in America, every
Saturday morning starting around 6 a.m. I was a &quot;Batman&quot; fan and got a Batman
haircut, while Marge had switched from the Beatles to the Monkees after the Beatles let
their hair grow long and, it was rumored, were indulging in drugs. I saw all the scare
pictures shown on &quot;The Big Show&quot;, which was broadcast every weekday afternoon,
around 3 p.m., to Pensacola from a TV station in Mobile. The only one that scared the
peatwadding out of me was &quot;Mill of the Stone Women&quot;---don't ask why. There was
also the time I was confined to bed with the flu, unable to get-up, the same week the T.V.
began being blitzed with ads for <i>Night of the Living Dead</i>. I remember it well:
&quot;Welcome...to a night...of sheer HORROR!...'A-HH-HH-HH!'&quot; &quot;Afternoon&quot;
was more like it. But that's another story.</p>

<p>It was not until we went to see <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>, while living in the Bay
Area, that I suddenly had what could be called my awakening: So this is what movies can
do! It can open your eyes, your ears, your senses. It can stir powerful emotions in you.
It can take you to places you've never been before. It can give you a look at the
mysteries of the universe. It can sometimes do all these things all at once.</p>

<p>Afterwards, we repaired to a restaurant at the El Ceritto Plaza, and, over ice cream
sundaes, me, Marge and Dad (an avid moviegoer himself, by the way, since Nanna, his
mother, took him to see Disney's <i>Snow White</i> in Boston, as well as being a
science-fiction fan) talked excitedly about the movie. I was jazzed about it for days,
weeks, months, years. I am jazzed by it to this day. I bought the soundtrack album, and
played it. A lot. I got the &quot;Making of Kubrick's '2001'&quot; book. (Which contained
a full reprint of the instructions for the operation and use of the &quot;Zero Gravity
Toilet&quot; on the Pan-Am space airliner.) I caught the movie again, around 1980-81, when
it played the Salt Lake City/Provo area as part of M.G.M.'s four &quot;roadshow&quot;
films, which included <i>Doctor Zhivago</i>, <i>Ryan's Daughter</i>, and the mutilated
&quot;widescreen&quot; version of <i>Gone With the Wind</i>. I prepared <i>2001</i> for
airing at KDRV-TV, in Medford, Oregon, where I had my first full-time &quot;industry&quot;
job right after college. My gruff, hard-bitten production manager, Tom Craven, who had
worked at one time as a ranchhand in the Midwest, would stick his head in the tiny room
where I screened the 16 mm. prints to check them and decide on where to best place the
commercial breaks, and his leathery face would break into a beautiful grin, and he'd say,
&quot;I love that movie!&quot; Inexorably, anyone else who was free at the time drifted in
to watch the film unreel, enraptured and drawn as if by some unspoken force. However,
television is subservient to the dollar, so you have to have a certain amount of
commercial breaks in anything that is being run and hasn't been paid for in advance. Film
prints, before they were replaced by tape, were as a rule circulated from one station to
the next, so it came as no surprise that when I next had to prepare &quot;2001&quot; for
airing, some dunce who had handled the print before me had scissored apart one of the most
famous edits in film history to plunk in the first commercial break. (For the record, I
always placed the first break BEFORE the edit.)</p>

<p>When Kubrick's next movie, <i>Clockwork Orange</i>, came out, I was just dying to see
it. It was supposed to be another science-fiction movie! Alas! it was rated &quot;X&quot;.
How was I to know, then, why? I bought the soundtrack album to that film, too, and became
familiar with Beethoven and Walter (later, Wendy) Carlos' work at the same time. As it so
happened, the picture happened to be among the first batch scheduled to be shown by the
S.O.S.C. Student Program Board during my freshman year of college, in 1978 - 79. And I
went. (Since the movie had originally been released at about the same time that I first
became a teenager, with all the attendant changes therein.)</p>

<p>In between, I'd caught &quot;Barry Lyndon&quot;, almost by accident. I and Marge and a
friend of hers were out doing something, one night, and I suggested, &quot;Let's go see
'Barry Lyndon'.&quot; I think Marge and her friend went because it had Ryan O'Neal. Only
after we were well into the movie, though, did Marge lean over and say to me, sotto voce,
&quot;GOOD MOVIE!&quot;</p>

<p>In the meantime, I made the first of many super-8 films, the first of which won an
award from the Rogue Valley Art Association. I wrote, produced and directed a one-act play
during my high school senior year, and wrote another that was produced by a friend at
S.O.S.C. After some fruitless years at the Y, I returned to Southern Oregon and took a
film-editing class, which led to the first of several jobs working, alternately, in video
and film production. I also worked in journalism, during which I freelanced and wrote the
first of several monthly articles on film for an Ashland publication whose editor first
heard about me from a teacher at S.O.S.C. who told him that I had written papers in my
senior year, there, on Godard and Hitchcock. The rest, as they say, is history.</p>

<p>I remember the hot anticipation over <i>The Shining</i>. I'd read the novel---still my
favorite of the Stephen King novels that I've read. And there were so many people involved
with it and so many reasons to want to like the film. But there was also that nagging
feeling of, why did Kubrick make these alterations to the story, alterations which weren't
very good, and which certainly wouldn't have helped any movie, let alone this one. And
there were the rumors that the seven minutes that Kubrick cut from the film, after its New
York City opening, would have really set everything in the film to rights.</p>

<p>By the time <i>Full Metal Jacket</i> came out, I had read some of Gustav Hasfeld's
novel &quot;The Short Timers&quot;, before pitching it into the wastebasket. One could see
why Kubrick was drawn to this material: a new soldier in boot camp is driven crazy by his
drill sergeant, then, later, a Vietnamese woman begs to have one of the men shoot her and
put her out of her misery. I don't know if the latter episode is in Hasfeld's book, but
the former was. The willowy, straw-haired, sweet-tempered kid from Kentucky who was in the
boot camp sequences was changed into a huge, wheezing, wild-eyed monster by Kubrick,
regarding us with the same evil, glowering, lowered-head look that Jack Nicholson used to
suggest total evil in <i>The Shining</i>. It was a crashingly disappointing film, almost
dismissable, but, hey, this was the guy who made <i>2001</i>. There was always the chance
that he could very well blow our minds once more.</p>
<i>

<p>Eyes Wide Shut</i>, a psycho-sexual thriller set in New York City but made in Britain,
complete with imported &quot;Village Voice&quot; vending machines, has been filming, and
filming, and filming for over a year. Before the cameras, for the moment, stopped, it was
said that this might very well be Kubrick's last one, even though there talk about his
communicating, via satellite, with Industrial Light and Magic about pre-production for <i>A.I.</i>,
a film which was supposed to be based on Philip K. Dick's novel &quot;Martian Time
Slip&quot;, a psychological thriller set on the first Earth colony on Mars. Several years
back, there was to have been a film of Louis Begley's brilliant novel, &quot;Wartime
Lies&quot;, about a Jewish aunt and her nephew hiding under assumed identities in
Nazi-occupied Poland, and the effects it has on them during the occupation and, most
tellingly, afterwards. Joseph Mazzello would play the young boy, but Kubrick kept
dithering over who to cast as the aunt. Julia Roberts? Uma Thurman? Jodie Foster? Surely,
one of these ladies could play the part, but who could say what Kubrick had in mind? Then,
the film vanished, replaced by <i>A.I.</i>, then said to be set during a second Ice Age on
Earth. The &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot; carried it in their &quot;In Production&quot;
listing, but Kubrick was said to be dissatisfied with the sample visual FX he was shown
(this was just about the time digital FX, on the scale of <i>Jurassic Park</i>, were fully
beginning to come into being). And no cast announced, either; further, no screenwriter.</p>

<p>So, when <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i> was announced, and then actually went before the cameras
in full-fledged principal photography, the old flame of my experience of first seeing <i>2001</i>
was rekindled. Who cares if it's lousy? I'm gonna see it anyway!! It's like being a
baseball fan in Boston and not going to see the Red Sox season opener. It's a kind of
duty. It's something you feel is owed. It's one of those things that makes you the person
you are, today, instead of someone else with some other differentiations and tastes
altogether.</p>

<p>Kubrick's passing is, in some ways, not a surprise. He has stayed a semi-recluse in
Britain for over 20 years. Who knows how well he has been taking care of himself. And
there is the troubling aspect of his not seemingly being able to bring himself to halt the
principal photography on his current movie, surely one of the maddest production shoots in
movie history, surely the only one since <i>Cleopatra</i> that has generated so many pages
of speculation, inside rumors, and reports of what might or might not be going on at the
set. Who knows if it's even really finished. Along with the cuts on <i>The Shining</i>,
Kubrick also trimmed some footage from <i>Clockwork Orange</i>, after its release. That
was the movie which Kubrick himself took out of circulation in Great Britain, after an
occurrence took place there, in connection with the movie, around the late Seventies.
Bootleg copies of the film on video are supposed to be a hot commodity, and when the Royal
Shakespeare Company put on a stage adaptation of Anthony Burgess' novel, starring Phil
Daniels and with incidental music by Bono and The Edge, Londoners reportedly could see
folks riding the Underground dressed just like one of Alex's droogs in Kubrick's movie.</p>

<p>&quot;Refrigerated&quot; is one term that keeps coming to mind about <i>Clockwork
Orange</i>. But although Kubrick's films could be morose, or pessimistic, there was also
the fact that they could be quite funny. &quot;The Premier is a Man of the People,&quot;
says Peter Bull's Russian ambassador in <i>Dr. Strangelove</i>, which Kubrick co-wrote
with Terry Southern and Peter George, &quot;but he is also a man.&quot; Whereupon, we hear
Peter Sellers' U.S. president, having finally located the leader of the Soviet Union,
asking him over the telephone, &quot;Dimitri? Could you turn the music down a
little...?&quot; Kubrick also used Sellers to good effect in his film version of
&quot;Lolita&quot;, where he apparently figured that, if you were going to approach a
story about two maundering middle-aged men chasing after a very young girl and her Coke
bottle, it might be a good idea to do so while using some levity. The characters on-screen
in <i>Barry Lyndon</i> may look and act a little glaceed, but the running narration
commentary was anything but. There's the oddly comic quality to the moment in <i>The
Killing</i> where a public brawl breaks out, on cue, before the climatic robbery starts.
Dr. Heywood Floyd, in <i>2001</i>, calling his daughter by public phone, to ask what she
wants for her birthday (&quot;I want a bushbaby!&quot; she replies), from the space
station---and the, er, astronomical cost for the call, afterwards. Jack Torrance's wife,
in <i>The Shining</i>, discovering what her husband has really been spending all of his
time writing at the typewriter. And one of the things that, still, most vividly comes to
mind about <i>Paths of Glory</i> was the way Ralph Meeker sounded when his character,
imprisoned and facing an imminent firing squad, blurts out, &quot;You know, I haven't had
one sexual thought since I've been in here....&quot;</p>

<p>Kubrick wrote the screenplay for <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i> with the British writer Frederic
Raphael, and it is supposed to be based on Viennese author Arthur Schnitzler's 1925 novel
&quot;Traumnovelle&quot; (which was published, in the U.S., as &quot;Rhapsody: A Dream
Novel&quot;). But it may also be based on a novel Raphael published in 1971, entitled
&quot;Who Were You With Last Night&quot;. Both novels bear comparison. They both feature a
protagonist who is a married man and father---in Schnitzler's novel, it is a young,
upper-class doctor; in Raphael's, a suburban, middle-aged industrial park executive. Both
experience sudden disillusionment, even loathing, towards their wives. And both have
encounters with other woman, about which their wives know nothing. The doctor in
&quot;Traumnovelle&quot; meets a woman at a &quot;secret club&quot; where everyone in
attendance is masked. The executive in &quot;Who Were You With...&quot; meets, and begins
an affair with, a young secretary, and they rendezvous in the as-yet untenanted executive
offices of a new office building. An episode where they are interrupted by a gun-toting
intruder, who thinks what they are doing is wrong but doesn't know what to do about it, is
supposed to have had its origins in discussions Kubrick had with Raphael over an earlier
version of <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i>.</p>

<p>In &quot;Traumnovelle&quot;, the protagonist flirts with the idea of whether to
distrust women, as well as whether some ideas or concepts of behavior which society labels
as &quot;wrong&quot; are really all that &quot;wrong&quot;, after all. (&quot;Isn't it
strange how we are misled by words, how we give names to states, events, and people, and
form judgments about them, just because we are too lazy to change our habits?&quot;)
Raphael's novel reveals, rather elegantly, in the very last pages that we have been
reading about a man who has been a full-fledged misogynist all along. (&quot;The trouble
with women is, give them a chance and they think they own you.&quot;) Kubrick himself has
never seemed to be all that crazy about women in his films. He has gotten good
performances from women---Marie Windsor in <i>The Killing</i>, Shelley Winters in <i>Lolita</i>,
Shelley Duvall in <i>The Shining</i>. But three of his films have featured a husband who
either commits, or threatens to commit, violence upon his spouse; a fourth has a woman
pleading with a man to do so. Even neurasthenic Lady Lyndon turns out to be the victim of
a man who marries her only for wealth and position. (Two men also fight over her, with
mortifying results.) And Alex, in <i>Clockwork Orange</i>, is sent to prison---and,
eventually, the Ludovico Treatment---after killing a woman, in rather bizarre
circumstances. (Kubrick's marriage to his current wife, Christiane, is his fourth; he is
the father of three daughters.) This is also a film which asks us to identify with a
pathological lead character who lives in a debased society where pleasure is derived from
sex, violence, or both. Some sources at the time of the film's release said that <i>Clockwork
Orange</i> took place at the end of the 1970s, not all that far off from the time when
Kubrick's previous film, a film that depicted man appearing to achieve his most highest
aspirations and potentials, was set.</p>
<i>

<p>Eyes Wide Shut</i> may turn out to be the humbinger of the lot. I have heard a LOT
about this picture---everything from the reason for Harvey Keitel's departure (not what
you heard, or heard after that), to the possible M.P.A.A. rating (plan on leaving the
kiddies at home) and even the distribution of &quot;false&quot; scripts (one of which may
be in the hands of a famous Internet movie journalist). Within 24 hours of Kubrick's
passing, Warner Brothers executive Terry Semel assured the public, &quot;But,
soft...&quot;, and announced that Kubrick had screened a final cut of the film only five
days before. (To the last, the screening for Semel, a second Warners executive, and Tom
and Nicole, was held with the projectionist facing away from the screen.) Semel also
reported that the music score was in place---mostly &quot;classical&quot;, with &quot;a
few beats&quot; added to it (possibly the original rap music score by U.K. musician
Goldie?); and that two versions of advertising for the film were prepared and ready to be
used. The &quot;few tweaks&quot; that Semel referred to in-passing will probably not
significantly affect our appreciation of the film. Kubrick was very particular about the
look he wanted for his films. He and the cinematographer John Alcott developed a special
lens whereby they could film <i>Barry Lyndon</i> using candlelight. Later, they developed
a special Stedicam that allowed them capture the particular effect of little Danny
pedaling his Big Wheel across the floors and carpets of the Overlook Hotel, for long,
uninterrupted periods at a time, in <i>The Shining</i>. (On my 20th birthday, I
accompanied my friend Tim Hansen, who had not yet seen <i>Clockwork Orange</i>, to a
screening of the film at the Cinema 21 in Portland, where it was being shown on a
double-bill with <i>Performance</i>, the 1970 film which had been photographed and
co-directed by the cinematographer Nicolas Roeg. Seeing those two films together was a
definite experience, I can tell you.)</p>

<p>The most telling story of all I've heard is the one that may be the most apocryphal:
Sometime in the Seventies, Kubrick and Terry Southern were watching an adult picture, back
when it was fashionable to do so, when Kubrick was to have turned to Southern at one point
and said, &quot;What would happen if somebody who really knew how to make movies made a
film like this?&quot;</p>

<p>What if I had not seen <i>2001</i> when I was nine? What if I had not seen <i>Citizen
Kane</i> when I was 12? (Before I was exposed to its being taught as an
&quot;institution&quot; of a film in film classes.) The results of the latter incident
were that all of cinema, to me, eventually became pre-&quot;Kane&quot; and
post-&quot;Kane&quot;. And as for the former experience, I was turned on like an electric
light by a film and the way it was made and the way it took me away to places, literally
setting my heart to flight. There were two things I most wanted to do between 1984 and
1999: Walk into a theater one night---the Lumiere in San Francisco, I have always
thought---and sit down to see a showing of Orson Welles' completed <i>The Other Side of
the Wind</i>. And to see a few more Stanley Kubrick films before the big clock turns over
to two-zero-zero-zero, and we find out if that vision of life that had been implanted in
our brains by Kubrick when we were young would, indeed, be our reality. Well, the space
station is going up, as I write these words. The world, though, seems a more sordid, more
disappointing place than I imagined. And I am reminded of Neil Gabler---a writer I have
never really thought much of, by the way---and his book, &quot;Life: The Movie&quot;,
published this last year, about how life has turned into Entertainment, and we are all
performers in one great big movie, instead of real life. Is it a bad thing or a good thing
to want to be living in a film like <i>2001</i>?</p>

<p>Which brings us to our final scene, which is an anecdote and which I include because it
involves Kubrick, and the dichotomy of life. When I was trying, without much success, to
get schooling to make films at B.Y.U., there was an unspoken rule that L.D.S. students
were not to see any films that were rated &quot;R&quot; or above. Unspoken, but taken by
many as doctrine. This was a continual sore point among film students who had chosen to
attend the university, since it put them in a bind, as students, church members, and
artists, to seriously discuss the comparative merits of, for example, <i>Coming Home</i>
(rated &quot;R&quot;) and <i>Grease</i> (rated &quot;PG&quot;, but, arguably, in some ways
more lascivious and amoral than <i>Coming Home</i>). In 1981, I took a class in French and
Italian cinema, in which one of the two teachers (who, I will say right now, was an
idiot), spoke in class one day about the use of music in motion pictures. Part of his
lecture was based on a scene from <i>Clockwork Orange</i>. What, an &quot;X&quot;-rated
film, being discussed on the campus of an L.D.S. school, where we aren't supposed to see
anything further than a &quot;PG&quot;? Anyway, the professor was citing, as an example,
the scene in the film where Adrianna Asti's character is being...&quot;interfered
with&quot;, brutally, by Alex and his droogs. &quot;And then,&quot; he said, with
appropriately poignant dramatic emphasis quavering in his voice, &quot;we see this close
up, of the woman's anguished face, while the 'Ode to Joy' plays on the
soundtrack...!&quot; Well, they didn't use Beethoven's choral from the Ninth Symphony in
that scene, the music they used was &quot;Singin' in the Rain&quot;, and, anyway, what he
was talking about wasn't in the film, which meant he hadn't seen it. What he probably saw
was a copy of the published screenplay for <i>Clockwork Orange</i>, which did have a
close-up---photograph, that is---of Adrianna Asti's face in that scene. That was probably
what this nitwit had seen, not the movie, and although he may have thought he was adhering
to Church precepts, which forbade members seeing anything over a &quot;PG&quot; rating, he
was talking about something he didn't know about while trying to presume, to the class,
that he did. And probably thinking that, since nobody in the class would have the
presumption to have seen an &quot;X&quot;-rated film, nobody would correct him on his
error. Which is where I should have stepped in. The problem was, in so doing, I would have
been admitting that I had gone against Church conduct---applying for admission to B.Y.U.
requires that you sign a statement attesting that you will adhere to Church conduct and
principles while attending classes, there---and admit that I had seen an
&quot;X&quot;-rated film, and therefore be looked upon, accordingly. I was also, at the
time, shy, in ways that I am not, now. I should have called him on it. But I didn't. I was
silent. And 18 years later, it still doesn't feel any better. You'd like to think you'd
always do the right thing, that you would stand up on-principle and for the people who
mean something to you, whom you respect, who have given you something that's valuable. It
doesn't always work that way every single time that you would want it to: hindsight is a
