<p><big><strong><big>I</big></strong>t may not be completely original (sadly, little is
these days), but this teen-angst revenge saga from the director of the small but enjoyable
<i>Citizen Ruth</i>, is deliciously malevolent and one of the best little films I&#146;ve
seen this spring. Thirteen years after his day off stirred the funny bone of the masses --
and remains a corner foundation of my video collection -- Ferris Bueller has grown up and
gone mainstream. He&#146;s been re-shaped into Jim McAllister (Matthew Broderick), a
semi-happy family man and devoted history teacher of the year (3 times already!) at George
Washington Carver High School. A day of reckoning is at hand, as Bueller&#146;s past
catches up with his made-over self, in the guise of Tracy Flick (Reese Witherspoon), an
extremely dedicated (and eventually, exceedingly cut throat) pupil and future student body
president.</big></p>

<p><img src="Images/relection-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="93">Ferris&#146;
bright, sunny skies of Chicago have become McAllister&#146;s cloudy and menacing firmament
above Omaha, Nebraska, hometown of director Alexander Payne, who has re-fashioned some of
the corn-is-as-high-as-an-elephant&#146;s-eye characters (yeah, I know it&#146;s not
Oklahoma, but I feel like singing) from Tom Perrotta&#146;s novel, with the help of Jim
Taylor, his co-conspirator on the wickedly amusing screenplay as well as on Payne&#146;s
earlier, debut feature. McAllister&#146;s life and marriage begins to unravel at the same
time that Tracy&#146;s singular tunnel vision crystallizes her future for the next 20 or
30 years, much like Jason Schwartzman&#146;s vision in <i>Rushmore</i> (she is introduced
in the film in an identical, over-achieving manner), but her first hurdle is over the
speed bumps in her school election campaign. And it is the unfortunate student government
advisor playing god to the democratic process who gets flatten by his steam rolling
adversary. In this microcosmic political maelstrom all in Hurricane Tracy&#146;s path get
crushed. Witherspoon, recently seen in the glossy, Manhattanized update of <i>Les Liaisons
Dangereuses</i>, is treading on familiar ground. In the possible words of Yogi Berra,
it&#146;s Cruel Election all over again.</p>

<p>Initially confusing but soon afterward refreshing is the story&#146;s voice-over
point-of-view, including Tracy and McAllister&#146;s, plus a few more of the other main
characters thrown in for good measure, each offering their selfish rose-colored outlook as
the tale grows darker. McAllister&#146;s deep hatred of the prissy teenager evolves from
math teacher and best friend Dave Novotny&#146;s weakness for her flesh. And Tracy shows
Dave that there is a lot more that you can develop in the dark room than photos for the
school newspaper. Mark Harelik&#146;s performance is tearfully hilarious as the sea slug
in search of extracurricular and extramarital activities.</p>

<p>Kudos are in store for the entire ensemble cast, primarily Broderick and Witherspoon as
the nastiest of sparring partners. Broderick may get more mileage out of his portrayal of
Inspector Gadget later this year, but <i>Election</i> will bring him better reviews.
Witherspoon continues to impress in a variety of school-themed pictures and her maturity
as an actress continues to impress. <img src="Images/relection-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="143" HEIGHT="93">Chris Klein and Jessica Campbell appear as senior Paul and
sophomore Tammy Metzler, two widely different students brought into the presidential
campaign. Paul is the bumble-headed but popular first string quarterback (out for the
season with a broken leg, although thankful in his nightly prayers for his ample manhood)
recruited by the nefarious McAllister. His apathetic sister joins the grassroots fray when
her supposed lesbian lover Lisa (Frankie Ingrassia) bolts from her bedroom and into the
arms of big brother and the family hot tub. Yes, this does sound like a wacky John
Waters/John Hughes collaboration with a touch of Hitchcock, particularly one divinely
outrageous moment that has the rebellious Tammy playing perfectly into her conservative
parents&#146; unwitting belief that their daughter would be better off in a strict private
school -- Immaculate Heart -- an all girls parochial institution. Also deserving of
honorable mention is Delaney Driscoll as Linda Novotny, divorced from her no good husband
and perhaps looking for some plumbing relief from helpful handyman McAllister.</p>

<p>In lieu of the initial news reports on the tragedy this week in Littleton, Colorado, it
is unfortunately easy to see how the black comedy of <i>Election</i> can create or
re-create an atmosphere of deadly consequences. No such comparison would have been
mentioned had the film had not been pulled from last year&#146;s release schedule. Perhaps
the budding Tracy Flicks who watch this sophisticated comedy can be tempered to lighten up
and laugh a little (or, like me, a lot), remove that huge stick up their you-know-whats,
and focus more clearly on the implications of their actions. Hopefully the brilliance of
films like this will at least take our minds off the realities of life and make us turn
inward in personal examination and laugh outward in cynical appreciation. It&#146;s a
cruel world, but thanks to <i>Election</i> we can snicker along with it.</p>
