<p><big><strong><big>C</big></strong>hampion City is a foggy, grimy setting of urban
overdevelopment, the type where it always seems to be night, even when it's day, that begs
for the heightened interplay of good and evil brought on not just by good guys and bad
guys, but by archvillains and superheroes. But this particular dark metropolis has a bit
of a problem. The balance of good and evil is off. All the criminal geniuses have been
locked up, and the one honest-to-goodness superhero Captain Amazing (Greg Kinnear) is
bored and, incidentally, short on big-money sponsors. Into the criminal justice vacuum
step a few good, brave, and proud heroes of ineptitude. One hurls at his enemies every
eating utensil except knives (Hank Azaria), one wields a shovel with not-so-destructive
force (William H. Macy), and another just gets real, real mad (Ben Stiller). These three
fledgling wannabes want nothing more than the chance to win from society the respected,
beloved role of superhero, but they lack the self-awareness to recognize their
limitations. </big></p>

<p><img src="Images/rmysterymen-1.jpg" alt="Mystery Men" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">The superhero spoof <i>Mystery Men</i> is at its most pleasurable when it
concentrates on the gentle mockery of these hapless amateurs and their deluded naivete.
Unfortunately, it doesn't concentrate its energies there often enough - <i>Mystery Men</i>
shows just as much loyalty, if not more, to the superhero half of its subject matter as it
does the spoof. And that means loud, busy special effects and action sequences which serve
mainly to overwhelm the more genially amusing nature of the story. This is one of those
cases (which are becomingly increasingly less rare) where the budget is too big for the
script to handle, rather than vice versa. What the budget did allow for was the hiring of
a fantastically surprising cast. Along with Kinnear, Azaria, Macy, and Stiller, are
Geoffrey Rush as Casanova Frankenstein, the arch villain Captain Amazing mistakenly sets
loose in order to give him something to do (the action which sets in motion what this film
has for a plot), Janeane Garafalo as a supehero recruit whose weapon is a very special
bowling ball, and Kel Mitchell as Invisible Boy, who for the most part is invisible only
in the figurative sense. </p>

<p>Other than wearing a psychotic stare, Rush is given precious little to do, but much of
the un-superhero-like cast shines. Macy in particular puts a perfectly sober sheen on the
best lines of the script. Listening to him assert his case that Captain Amazing and
billionaire Lance Hunt are two different people, because Hunt wears glasses and Amazing
does not (how could he see?), is far more entertaining than the rote action plot to which
the film ultimately succumbs. <i>Mystery Men</i> is that kind of movie, in which the
throwaway lines and sideline behavior are where it's at, not the action on center stage.
In a story about characters destined to rest forever on the fringe, the fringe is exactly
where the focus of the story should be. </p>
