<p><big><strong><big>A</big></strong>s much as I was hoping this new social romantic
import would scale new heights and electrify your senses, Among Giants&#146; blah story of
love among the high tension wires instead is a limp disappointment of voltages dashed.
Screenwriter Simon Beaufoy wrote this under-developed story, his first script, before he
penned the Oscar-nominated hit Brit blockbuster <i>The Full Monty</i>, another
Sheffield-based, working-class paean that wowed audiences worldwide. Regrettably,
lightning doesn&#146;t strike twice for this wordsmith, even if the film includes two of
my favorite actors (Pete Postlethwaite and Aussie Rachel Griffiths) unabashedly prancing
around in their full frontal monties.</big></p>

<p>Along the Yorkshire roads ventures Gerry, a lonely, backpacking mountain climber from
Down Under who&#146;s been traveling the world&#146;s highways for &quot;as long as a
piece of string&quot; until she whimsically decides to stop awhile amongst the
beer-guzzling locals. These cast-offs include a handful of out-of-work blokes who, under
Ray&#146;s foremanship, find off-the-books summer work rust-proofing and painting 15 miles
worth of electrical towers. Smelling an opportunity to scale new heights, breath more
outdoor air, and check out the generally mental-deficient male populace along the
roadside, Gerry drops anchor, planting a pup tent at the edge of her new
&quot;office.&quot; Aside from picking the middle-aged, divorced Ray, there&#146;s his
best bud Steve (James Thornton), a young lothario with a love van/sex palace on wheels
that probably once beloved to Eddie Murphy in his hornier days. The relationships among
the leads are never fully formed, as the characters are only half-heartedly committed to
it, and the threesome strains from not knowing which way it&#146;s heading. Steve moves
out of the apartment he shares with Ray probably just as much because of his disgust with
Ray&#146;s newly discovered raison-d&#146;être as he is with his own inability to lure
the young lass to his bed. The fact that 20-something Gerry is sleeping with someone who
is at least as old as her father doesn&#146;t seem to factor into the equation, other than
pushing his cynical ex-wife, Lyn (Sharon Bower), to poo-poo what she thinks is a doomed
partnership.</p>

<p>The film&#146;s problems are just as much the fault of debut director Sam Miller&#146;s
inability to enthuse the characters with any larger-than-life significance for
today&#146;s demanding audiences (including yours truly), as well as director of
photography Witold Stok&#146;s annoyingly dizzy, hand-held or helicopter shots whirling
about lovers Ray (Postlethwaite) and Gerry (Griffiths) embracing on too many occasions.
Even if the scenery is beautiful and effectively lit, whether scaling the Sheffield cliffs
or climbing the electrical towers that frame the feature, the film doesn&#146;t have
enough emotional glue to stick together. To Miller&#146;s benefit, he does provide some
buoyant moments and some excellent soundtrack titles (particularly a rendering of
&quot;Stand By Me&quot; and &quot;Old Paint&quot; by the jovial cowboy kings of the
pylons) amid the drudgery of their days aloft. </p>

<p>Postlethwaite, nominated for an Academy Award for his strong portrayal of Giuseppe
Conlon in <i>In the Name of the Father</i>, and memorable in nearly all his films
(including <i>Brassed Off</i>, <i>The Usual Suspects</i>, <i>The Lost World: Jurassic Park</i>,
and <i>Amistad</i>), tries to fill tall boots, but unfortunately falls victim to a weak
script and poor direction. Similarly, Rachel Griffiths, coming off her strong performance
in Hilary and Jackie, suffers the same fate. The smaller roles that fill up the road crew
are quirky, almost nameless, and nearly invisible, even though they share a good
percentage of screen time. Some of their dialect was undecipherable as well.</p>
<i>

<p>Among Giants</i> poses as a passionate trapeze act, but instead merely comes off as a
tired, and forgettable, countryside travelogue.</p>
