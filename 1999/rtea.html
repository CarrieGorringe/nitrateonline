<p><big><strong><big>F</big></strong>ranco Zeffirelli's &quot;Tea With Mussolini&quot; is
based on a portion -- a fragment, actually -- of his 1986 memoir, in which he describes
the British ladies who lived in Florence while he was growing-up in the 1930s. Known among
the locals as the &quot;scorpioni&quot;, these high-handed, parasol-wielding women would
brazenly mock and ridicule the working-class Italians while becoming infatuated with the
machismo radiated by the country's Fascist dictator, Benito Mussolini, who, as soon as war
was declared against their native land, ordered that the women be rounded-up and shipped
posthaste to prison camps. As a boy, Zeffirelli wrote, the women were to be seen in the
streets one day, the next they were gone.</big></p>

<p>In the film, motherless young Luca (Charlie Lucas) is taken under the wing of the
kindly Miss Mary (Joan Plowright) after he tries to run away. He is instructed in an
appreciation of the fine arts by another lady (Judi Dench), while a third (Maggie Smith)
huffs and wonders why they should bother with the child. After going away to school in
Austria and coming back, seemingly unaffected by the rising tide of Nazism, the teenaged
Luca (Baird Wallace) helps to get all the nice British ladies out of prison and into a
hotel for the duration of the war, with some help from a rich American expatriate (Cher,
looking gorgeous) and an archaeologist (Lily Tomlin) who wears slacks. The Americans are
the most kind and generous of all.</p>

<p>This film would scarcely be worth writing about at all were it not for the ludicrous
amount of acting talent recruited, with scant results. Zeffirelli goes in for grand, broad
strokes instead of narrative detail, so there are large gaps in the plot, but the women's
roles seem to have been snipped to pieces. Why cast Judi Dench as an art historian whose
only defining characteristics are long, scraggly wisps of hair, and becoming hysterical
over her dog? Looking down her imperious nose, Maggie Smith seems frozen in a rictus of
the haughty characters she played in &quot;A Room With a View&quot; and &quot;Howards
End&quot;. As she showed in the director's previous &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, which featured
William Hurt as the most ludicrously miscast Rochester in history, Joan Plowright can
create both interest and a respectable persona even under the barest of circumstances. But
the film keeps cutting away from Lily Tomlin every time it looks like she is just about to
do something interesting. Only Cher emerges unscathed, and her funny, ingratiating,
sincerely-felt performance seems to cut through the bologna from which most of the movie
is made.</p>

<p>Zeffirelli has his cinematographer David Watkin shoot the film in a manner which is
supposed to resemble the hand-tinted quality of antique photographs, but seems to leech
the colour out of the picture; the approach is brutal on some of the older actresses. This
brings up another, nagging concern. In &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, Zeffirelli gave Charlotte
Gainsbourg's face a grey, potato-like look, and he cast Elle MacPherson in a supporting
role but then refused to give her one decent close-up. &quot;Tea With Mussolini&quot;
indicates that, while Franco Zeffirelli may continue to cast women in substantial roles in
his films, he not only seems hardly interested in them, but openly contemptuous.</p>
