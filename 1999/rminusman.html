odd, odd (did I say odd) portrait of a serial killer set against a backdrop that
is plum smack in the middle of white bread, Ozzie and Harriet, America.
Interesting enough too, but I prefer a little more bang for my buck and this
effort comes up a lesser film, sort of a “so what?” comes to mind as this
picture dragged to it’s ambivalent ending nearly two hours from the nowhere
from whence it began. It’s not that this is a gory <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Scream</i>, it’s just a plain wrapper of a psychological horror film.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">From
the screenwriter of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Blade Runner</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
Mighty Quinn</i>, not to mention a character actor in numerous 1950s tv western
series (probably a good trolling ground if E! Entertainment wants to mystery and
scandlize 62-year-old aspiring director Hampton Fancher) comes this
disconcerting, sunshine-bright, bird-chirpy film, landing a block short of the
Bates Motel. Into a musty roadside bar in the middle of nowhere arrives Vann
Siegert, a simple drifter in from Vancouver with a busted nose and a low key
personality, his throat dry as he leaves his Ford truck in search of some
refreshment, only to find no pizza, no pie, just pickles and some junk and booze
addicted doll who calls herself Caspar (her real name’s Laurie). Just as
she’s hiding behind a ghostly identity, Vann (who says he’s “Bob”) has
his own secrets. Although both strike up limited conversation as they head down
the interstate together, at the first rest stop it’s all too clear that Vann
has other, more deadly, yet bloodless, intentions lurking beneath his nonchalant
façade and the poison-laced Amaretto in his pocket flask.<o:p>

<o:p>

</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Blonde-haired
and Dennis Hopper eyed Owen Wilson (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
Haunting</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Armageddon</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Bottle
Rocket</i>) thus drifts into <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Minus Man</i>
lacking much of a personality, a plus that seems to attract the ladies
(Wilson’s girlfriend Sheryl Crow is the above-mentioned first victim), before
leaving them with a more lasting, fatal impression. Director-writer Fancher, who
based this work on a 1990 cult crime novel, moves his film along with occasional
emotional spurts and dreamy fantasies, narrated by Wilson’s droll, vacuous
existential parables that take on subliminal significance (“You don't always
choose what you do,” he intones after one murder, “Sometimes what you do
chooses you.” Still later he deadpans “The urge erases the path it
travels.”).<o:p>

<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Vann’s
tranquility base eventually lands in a nondescript Pacific coast community,
specifically a rented room in the disturbed household of Doug and Jane Derwin (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Rushmore</i>’s
Brian Cox and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Fisher King</i>’s Mercedes
Ruehl), a pair with more than a few loose screws upstairs who adopt their
boarder as a replacement for their wayward daughter, whose departure appears to
have placed a minefield of emotional landmines that explode every few footsteps.
Doug puts his grown child’s dirty secret in vague perspective: “Fuck her and
the mother she rode in on.” It’s probably no coincidence that Doug finds a
job for his new best friend where he works, the Post Office, that mecca for the
unhinged.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">In
a small town where everyone knows everyone and their pet (including Zipcode the
cat) and life centers around work, the high school football team, and the local
diner, Vann picks his victims at close range (the star varsity player, a
disgruntled patron) from amongst these cozy surroundings, with the only
authorities hot on his trail (Dwight Yoakam and Dennis Haysbert) being brutally
tough figments of his own imagination. Despite their intensity, these blackouts
act as awkward pacifiers for the charming stranger, while, back in the real
world, circumstances (many of them) divert attention away from the real killer.
After he becomes a model employee delivering mail, he’s postmarked with
cupid’s arrows by mail clerk Ferrin (the always entrancing spitfire Janeane
Garafalo, doing a knockout job here), a budding wallflower who drinks hard and
pushes her bold affections on the startled Vann, nearly blowing his impulsive
circuits and melting his Clark Bars.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Meanwhile
family strife between self-flagellating and now near-catatonic Doug and his
nervous nell of a wife takes its own unexpected turn, allowing enough deflection
from Vann’s uncharacteristic reckless killings (i.e. bunched together in this
warm-hearted neighborhood) for him to ponder his future in this faux Norman
Rockwell suburb on the edge of the world. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Minus Man</i> isn’t much of a story, but it is one heck of a
character study.<o:p>
