<p><big><strong><big>I</big></strong>n <i>The Runaway Bride</i>, much is made of the fact
that the Maryland-based heroine, Maggie Carpenter (Roberts) gets a bad case of stage
fright while wearing a white wedding gown and has gone to elaborate lengths to evade
matrimony -- three times in succession (&quot;She may not be Hale&#146;s longest-running
joke, but she certainly is the fastest,&quot; quips Papa Carpenter (Dooley)). But when the
local joke goes national, courtesy of reporter Ike Graham (Gere), Maggie decides that
speaking the obvious is so offensive that she threatens legal action against his
newspaper. An angry Graham, smarting at his subsequent dismissal and her attacks upon his
journalistic abilities, decides to do some investigative reporting in her home town, and,
not so coincidentally, report on the progress of her upcoming nuptuals to the local
high-school football coach (Meloni). Graham has already written the ending of this fourth
ceremony in his head. &quot;You&#146;ll run,&quot; he tells Maggie, &quot;and when you do,
I&#146;ll be right there to watch.&quot; Forget white and red, or the question of whether
or not Maggie and Ike fall in love (you have to ask?); the real question is how much
&quot;green&quot; this picture will generate. Judging from the reaction I witnessed, the
filmmakers will have to rent a fleet of eighteen-wheelers to truck the money to the bank.</big></p>

<p><img src="Images/rrunaway-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" alt="Runaway Bride" WIDTH="214" HEIGHT="150">This is not to say that everything runs smoothly in <i>The Runaway
Bride</i>. Richard Gere has a lot of difficulty transitioning from irate to romantic.
There are times during his performance where it&#146;s not unreasonable to suspect that
his thoughts are revolving more around the profit participation factor than in wooing
Julia Roberts. She, on the other hand, turns on her usual mixture of coltish vulnerability
and pluckiness and, also as usual, wins the audience to her point of view from scene one,
regardless of how irrational the justifications for her character&#146;s behavior might
appear. Nevertheless, during some of their scenes together -- some of the scenes that are
actually integral to the forward motion of the plot, no less -- the audience is treated to
the rather embarrassing spectacle of watching Roberts emoting her heart out while Gere
does a reasonable imitation of the pre-human Pinocchio. The delay in re-teaming these two
actors has been somewhat costly in the realm of credibility. </p>

<p>There is a clue as to why this film often veers perilously close to disaster, and it
lies right within the title. While writing the script for this film, the scriptwriters
cannot have been unaware of another property, also entitled <i>The Runaway Bride</i>, this
one written by Elizabeth Kendall. It is not a film, but a classic study of 1930s romantic
comedies, and how certain narratives and actors conveyed themes important to their
contemporaneous audiences (among the most important elements, of course, were optimism and
the promise of marriage in an era when despair and delayed marriage were the norm). After
seeing this film, it&#146;s obvious that the writers have written this version by the
genre book (not surprisingly, the very formulaic <i>Three Men and a Little Lady</i> is
listed among their credits). Not only has the audience been cued to anticipate the
long-delayed reunion of that <i>Pretty Woman</i> duo, but every very necessary plot twist,
every character development falls into place right on cue, and the audience knows that
each one is coming long before the resounding &quot;thunk&quot; of assemblage confirms it.
Moreover, this <i>Runaway Bride</i> also contains themes that dovetail neatly with those
of its own contemporary audience: fear of commitment versus the desperate need for it.
There&#146;s nothing wrong with this writing-by-numbers approach in theory, but in
comparison with the spontaneity that marked a previous Roberts vehicle, <i>My Best
Friend&#146;s Wedding</i>, this new outing has the tang of staleness clinging to it far
too often. <i>The Runaway Bride</i> isn&#146;t sassy; Like Graham&#146;s car in one brief
(almost metaphorical) sequence, the entire enterprise threatens to break down more than
once. </p>

<p>However, trust good old reliable Garry Marshall (who, it must be remembered, had the
moxie to put a Cinderella spin on a story about prostitution in <i>Pretty Woman</i> and to
make people come out in record numbers to buy the tale, in more ways than one) to come up
with his own built-in salvage. <img src="Images/rrunaway-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" alt="Runaway Bride" WIDTH="214" HEIGHT="150">He actually has three aces in the hole with which to
accomplish this task: Hector Elizondo (always acting as an enhancement to all of
Marshall&#146;s films), Rita Wilson and Joan Cusack, and he hands them precious few
situations and lines, but they&#146;re there just often enough to keep this unwieldy film
careening along on the right track. Elizondo and Wilson, as Graham&#146;s best friend and
ex-wife, respectively, are given a subtly sardonic, if predictable, bit to perform
involving Maggie and a FedEx truck, and they carry it off with such relaxed precision that
they inject vitality into the very obvious. You can feel the mood of the film lift in a
manner that is almost tangible. Naturally, the incomparable Joan Cusack is her usual
flawless self, veering from physical comedy to pathos to wit without hesitation. At some
point during the first forty minutes of the film, it made more sense to ignore the
predictable main plot and to take refuge in the well-choreographed antics of this coolly
witty trio. Never mind Gere and Roberts: shouldn&#146;t someone in Hollywood find a script
in which to showcase these tragically underutilized talents?</p>

<p><em>The Runaway Bride</em>, to borrow a line from Mr. Carpenter, isn&#146;t the
fastest-running film emerging this summer, but it will certainly be one of the
longest-running.</p>
