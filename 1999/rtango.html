<p><big><strong><big>C</big></strong>inematic lord of the dance Carlos Saura sure makes
you feel like taking to the ballroom floor or the nearest Arthur Murray studio, even for
those of us with two left feet. As in Flamenco, he fills your passion plate, but unlike
that performance film, here we also dine on sizzling morsels of whirling visions and
entrancing shadows, with abundant tastes of colorful chiaroscuro and reflected bodies.
Emotionally captured by the omnipresent lens of Vittorio Storaro (<i>Apocalypse Now</i>, <i>Reds</i>,
<i>The Last Emperor</i>), the award-winning Italian master of light and image, and
enthusiastically scored by Argentinean composer Lalo Schifrin, a multiple Grammy winner
and Oscar nominee, you&#146;ll be enthralled as the film builds to a tumultuous climax
over its near two hour length. The film, nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Foreign
Film (from Argentina), also has a nod in that category at the Academy Awards show later
this month.</big></p>

<p>There&#146;s something more a-foot in this international smorgasbord of tapping souls
than its slender, disjointed plotline, which merely acts as a contrivance to ravishly
showcase some of the greatest tango artists. The film isn&#146;t a traditional
documentary, rather a personal fantasy, a poetic tone piece framed around Mario Suárez
(Miguel Ángel Sola), a Buenos Aires director immersed in a tango musical, and the women
in his life, the recently rejected Laura Fuentes (Cecilia Narova) and his new discovery,
the beautiful and passionate 23-year-old brunette Elena Flores (Mia Maestro), who brings
along a failing association with a mobster/restaurateur who is also financially linked to
the Mario&#146;s project.</p>

<p>Saura&#146;s forté is his complex blending of layers of illusion through the use of
color and camerawork, as Mario&#146;s confusion amid his smoldering mid-life crisis
(tinged with jealousy) intermingles with his creative wanderings on his project, i.e., is
it reel or real. Relationships are blurred as nightmares and daydreams haunt our vision of
cinematic reality. Wandering about his set one evening, he turns on a wind machine and the
costumes sway, filing over the bodies of his cast in a 1920s flapper setting as Elena and
Laura alluringly tango over a checker-board stage. Lit from the sides (most of the film
has no overhead lighting), the women have masked light projected on them as well.</p>

<p>The nature of the Mario&#146;s artistic endeavor is similarly confounding, probably on
purpose, although I always fear I am losing something when it is translated through
subtitles. Is he a filmmaker, as evidenced by the unmanned camera that floats about the
stage on an extended crane, or is that the filmmaker Saura&#146;s Arri hovering before
it&#146;s self-referential self in the multi-mirrored set. Or is it a television piece
because of the smallish, darkly-lit sets. The climax is played out before a group of
onlookers sitting on chairs during a full dress rehearsal, so is this, perhaps, a
theatrical extravaganza?</p>

<p>When Mario returns to his old school to recruit some children for his show, he has a
faux flashback, if that&#146;s the proper terminology. Is a small child, also named Mario,
the director as a child, or not. The school&#146;s director and Mario watch as the
children, still green in their talent, take to the dance floor. Again, the blurring of
present and past as Mario watches concertedly. Tango relishes in such bits of screen
whimsy, which makes this such an enjoyable watch.</p>

<p>As the film progresses, Mario&#146;s concept grows more daring, as his dancers, dressed
in army camouflage, interrogate and torture the star (a harsh rebuke to the military pasts
of Argentina and Spain, no doubt), a sequence that causes a bit of friction among his
backers, watching off stage.</p>
<i>

<p>Tango</i> represents a bold effort from one of the masters of world cinema, a film
broadly set on the duality of cinematic reality and illusion. A realistic, haunting
fantasy with power and passion as we gaze at the actor/dancers engage in their seductive
magic. Do let yourself become entranced by <i>Tango&#146;s</i> rhythms and dance the night
away.</p>
