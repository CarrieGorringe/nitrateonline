<p><big><big>&quot;</big>f this one&#146;s no good I&#146;ll need a
double,&quot; came the voice from a few rows back just before the lights went down on one
of the remarkably punctual three-a-day press screenings well into the home stretch of the
25<sup>th</sup> annual Seattle International Film Festival, held May 13 to June 6 in this
beautiful and vibrant Northwest city.</big></p>

<p>This being Seattle, there&#146;s a fifty-fifty chance the fatigued critic meant coffee
-- although the pace and sheer size of this the affable event, lustily endorsed by the
city and thus well-attended by the inquisitive and supportive natives, might&#146;ve
driven the scribe to a stronger drink.</p>

<p>Seattle is a study in contradictions, the golly-gee atmosphere of the civic embrace of
the festival. And then there are the locals, the legendarily responsive and nurturing
public known for being among the most savvy in the nation (&quot;I&#146;ve heard about you
guys,&quot; said one visiting filmmaker before the lights went down on the first-ever
screening of his film, echoing what a lot of directors think about premiering a movie
here).</p>

<p>To mark the first quarter century of the festival&#146;s existence, founding director
Darryl Macdonald supplemented the usual lineup of international festival favorites and
American independent premieres with a sidebar event reprising some of the titles given
American premieres at the festival in years past. This impressive list of 10 titles
included Denys Arcand&#146;s <i>Jesus of Montreal</i>, Werner Herzog&#146;s <i>Aguirre,
the Wrath of God</i>, Alan Rudolph&#146;s <i>Choose Me</i>, Julio Medem&#146;s <i>Cows</i>,
Lars von Trier&#146;s <i>Element of Crime</i>, Carl Franklin&#146;s <i>One False Move</i>,
and a selection of Dutch films -- which the festival claims to have championed well before
other American events -- featuring two early works by <i>Starship Troopers</i> director
Paul Verhoeven, 1975&#146;s <i>Cathy Tippel</i> and 1983&#146;s <i>The Fourth Man</i>. The
print of Hector Babenco&#146;s The Kiss of the Spiderwoman, previously announced for the
section, didn&#146;t make it due to some sort of rights snafu.</p>

<p>The remaining bulk of the festival, which numbered some 200+ feature films spread out
over six downtown venues, was split into numerous, easy to digest sections. In addition to
the de rigeur Contemporary World Cinema, there were sections dedicated to new directors,
American independents (including 10 new films in a juried competition), documentaries,
archival presentations, new Canadian films, films for families, packages of short works
and midnight attractions. Among the most popular programs were the late-festival sneak
preview of a new film, each weekend&#146;s &quot;Secret Festival&quot; presentation and an
all-night &quot;Drive-In Party&quot; of four B-movie-ish titles culled from the festival
at large.</p>

<p>One of the more adventurous and opinionated sidebar events was &quot;Emerging
Masters,&quot; which highlighted recent work by Polish director Dorota Kedzierzawska,
French auteur Francois Ozon, British helmer Michael Winterbottom and hot German filmmaker
Tom Tykwer (whose new movie <i>Run Lola Run </i>won the festival&#146;s Golden Space
Needle Best Film award).</p>

<p>The flagship screenings included the opening night gala presentation of Francis
Veber&#146;s<i> The Dinner Game</i>, an evening with John Sayles introducing and
discussing the American premiere of his new movie <i>Limbo</i>, 25<sup>th</sup>
anniversary presentations of five new high-profile films, and the closing night premiere
of the sequel starring everyone&#146;s favorite British agent In Need of a Dentist, <i>Austin
Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me</i>.</p>

<p>Non-screening festival events included a virtual auction of movie poster art in
partnership with Amazon.com, work by 25 local teams of artists inspired by the festival
motto &quot;Life. Flashed Before Your Eyes.&quot;, the third edition of a self-described
movie &quot;boot camp&quot; called &quot;Fly Filmmaking&quot; and a three-day
&quot;Filmmakers Forum&quot; featuring round-table discussions with visiting professionals
on a broad range of subjects affecting the creative impulse as well as the industry as a
whole.</p>

<p>One of the programming strategies employed by the Seattle team is to backload the
schedule with premieres, which serves to make the last 10 days to two weeks of the event
of keen interest to the festival veteran. What follows, then, is a modest cross-section of
films seen primarily during the latter stages of the festivities -- in amongst the cozy
and laid-back social events that seem to be organized almost every night by the attentive
but understandably frazzled staff.</p>
