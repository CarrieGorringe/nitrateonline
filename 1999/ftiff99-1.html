<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><i><a name="BreakingGround" target="_top"></a>Rosetta</i><b>
</b>was the <i>Palme d’Or</i> winner at this year’s Cannes festival and,
along with Tom Gilroy’s tiresome indie retread, <i>Breaking Ground</i>, was
among the films that were least deserving of the praise being heaped on them by
the proverbial truckload. Purporting to be a story about the tragedies suffered
by a downwardly-mobile teenager at the hands of her shiftless, trailer-trash
mother, <img border="0" src="images/ftiff99-1.gif" alt="Rosetta" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" width="225" height="124">Rosetta
plays out its hands with sparse background details, alternating between extreme
sentimentality and extreme dissociation. Aside from the questions of how one
says “trailer trash” in French (roll the phrase “les petits Blancs pauvres”
around your mouth a couple of times, and begin to appreciate the succinct,
dismissive cruelty redolent within the English counterpart), and why the
filmmakers chose to shoot this twaddle in an aggravatingly clumsy cinema-verite
style, there are very few others worth posing about this film.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>One might argue that <i>Rosetta</i><b> </b>is yet another one of those
– yawn! – “stinging indictments” of capitalism so beloved by those both
well-heeled and politically “progressive”, and one might just manage to
sound reasonably articulate on the subject, if it weren’t for the
well-documented effects of the asphyxiating cradle-to-grave welfare system in
France upon the upward mobility of the socio-economically disadvantaged like --
Rosetta.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Imagine that.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">The level of social enlightenment offered by
<i>Rosetta</i> is, to put it kindly, non-existent;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>after eighty-six minutes, the only “awful truth” the film can reveal
to its audience is this:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>sometimes
poor people aren’t very nice to each other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Since Marxist historian Raymond Williams was the first to codify this
presumably axiomatic hypothesis back in the ‘50s (and it apparently wasn’t
all that self-evident in some quarters, so necessary was it for Williams to
state the obvious),<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the brothers
Dardenne (Luc and Jean-Pierre, who brought us the heart-string tugger <i>La
Promesse</i> in 1996) are in the rather embarrassing position of having too
little to say and having said it all a little too late.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>With its unwieldy thematic blend of sentimentality and outrage, <i>Rosetta</i>
plays like a film for people who have just discovered the specter of intractable
poverty after reaching their majority.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Those expecting intelligible – never mind intelligent –
revelations concerning the plight of the poor should turn their minds elsewhere.</font></p>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><a name="FeliciasJourney" target="_top"></a>The film that
should have won this year’s <i>Palme d’Or</i>, but didn’t, was Atom
Egoyan’s creepy little masterpiece, <i>Felicia’s Journey</i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Perhaps the jury at Cannes mistook the film’s title and expected a
pleasant little travelogue through the quaint nooks and crannies of Ireland.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead, what the audience gets is an unpleasant (but
compellingly constructed) travelogue through the <i>modi operandi </i>of a
British serial killer named Hilditch (a magnificent performance by Bob Hoskins)
at the point where his life and the life of a pregnant Irish teenager (an
equally masterful debut by Elaine Cassidy) intersect.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><img border="0" src="images/ftiff99-2.gif" alt="Felicia's Journey" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" width="225" height="120">After
watching <i>Felicia’s Journey</i>, you’ll be convinced that <i>The Sweet
Hereafter </i>is the aberration in Egoyan’s oeuvre, at least in its more
low-key style and tone;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Felicia’s
Journey</i><b> </b>is an atavistic journey back to themes of voyeurism, outrage
and guilty secrets so prevalent in his past projects. Bob Hoskins and newcomer
Elaine Cassidy make a wonderful cat-and-mouse team as each plays out his or her
inner drives on the other, one unwittingly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>The talented Arsinee Khanjian (Egoyan’s wife) is wonderful as
Hilditch’s obsessive and brutal French-chef mother, seen only in
black-and-white videotaped accompaniments to Hilditch’s cooking sessions, as
the killer tries, yet again, to beat Mother at her own game.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>After enduring the psychological wringing-out imposed by<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Felicia</i>, it’s no wonder Toronto audiences rushed to <i>The
Five Senses</i>; allegories on solipsistic behavior, after all, are considerably
less stressful on the mind. [<i>review the <a href="rfelicia.html" target="_top">review</a>
and <a href="ffelicia.html" target="_top">interview</a> by Cynthia Fuchs</i>]</font></p>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p><font size="3"><span style="font-style:normal"><a name="HappyTexas" target="_top"></a>Before
<i>Felicia</i>, there was a brief interlude in </span><i>Happy, Texas</i><span style="font-style:normal">.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Consider the comedic possibilities in two convicts (Jeremy Northam and
Steve Zahn) escaping from a Texas chain gang courtesy of a plot device ripped
unapologetically from<i> </i></span><i>The Fugitive</i><span style="font-style:normal">
(either version).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><img border="0" src="images/ftiff99-3.gif" alt="Happy, Texas" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" width="225" height="125">Said
ex-chain-gang members steal a DOA RV, decide to assume the identities of the
former owners, then discover they have to not only impersonate artistic advisors
to help the no-account town of Happy, Texas win its first beauty pageant, but
they have to act as long-time lovers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Then,
to top it all off, the local sheriff (William C. Macy, of all people) decides
it’s time for him to come out of the closet and take a shine to one of the
“advisors”, who’s really in love with the local bank manager (Ally Walker,
from TV’s </span><i>The Profiler</i><span style="font-style:normal">).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Naturally, our boys, being so experienced in crime and all, know an easy
mark when they see it – and Happy’s bank, with state-of-the-art security, by
nineteenth-century standards -- has “open” signs all over it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Northam and Zahn (the latter best known for his role as the crazy
guitarist in </span><i>That Thing You Do!</i><span style="font-style:normal">
and his intriguing work in </span><i>Out of Sight</i><span style="font-style:normal">)
update the traditional “buddy” routine with a great deal of vigor. Add
Illeana Douglas as a Southern-Belle music teacher always coming down with the
vapors at the drop of a hat (or the utterance of a dirty word), and the results
are wickedly funny, so funny, in fact, that one wonders whether or not the film
will spawn a Southern Anti-Defamation League. Tyro feature director Mark Illsley
(a USC grad) might not want to make any travel plans that focus south of the
good ol’ Mason-Dixon anytime soon.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><i><a name="SnowFallsOnCedars" target="_top"></a>Snow
Falls on Cedars</i> is the latest offering from Scott Hicks, whose last project
was a little film called <i>Shine</i>. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Ostensibly
a murder mystery set in Washington State in 1949, <i>Cedars</i> alternates
between the post and pre-war years to illustrate a grim tableau of
anti-Japanese-American prejudice, and its embarrassing refusal to disappear,
even after the specter of Manzanar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><img border="0" src="images/ftiff99-4.gif" alt="Snow Falls on Cedars" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" width="225" height="120">All
it took was a suspicion that a Japanese-American war veteran turned fisherman
had murdered his former (white) best friend for the trouble to bubble up from
its barely-concealed trough of guilt and resentment.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><i>Cedars</i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>is at its best
recounting the wartime trials of Japanese-Americans, notably in the sequence in
which Japanese-Americans are being rounded up for deportation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Shot in alternating long takes and extreme close-ups, it encapsulates all
of the outrage and misery of the unjustly accused without veering into
histrionics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately,
the film falls on<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>weaker ground
when it lands on its “contemporary” passages, tending toward treacly
denouements in an attempt to paste some sort of happy ending on an extremely
grim situation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Snow Falls on
Cedars</i> has several deeply resonating moments, but overall, it lacks the
necessary cohesiveness characteristic of great filmmaking.</font></p>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt"><font size="3"><i><a name="RideWithTheDevil" target="_top"></a>Ride
With the Devil</i> is Ang Lee’s interpretation of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>the American Civil War and it is a subtly spellbinding exploration of how
the conflicting forces tore apart life in the state of Missouri;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>the conflicts depicted here, both emotional and martial, also serve to
represent, via synecdoche, warfare nation-wide.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><i>Devil</i> also provides an explanation for the rise of the
post-Civil-War lawlessness as the frontier and opportunities for advancement
began to narrow and finally close (the guerilla tactics of the Missouri
“Irregulars” (those who fought for secession) would prove useful training
for outlaws like Jesse James and the Younger Brothers). Lee takes this volatile
material and renders it without hysteria or sentiment, but with a great deal of
compassion, and is one of the few directors capable of achieving such a goal
(perhaps the Taiwanese-born Lee had the advantage of emotional distance on his
side, but his story-telling skill is also painstakingly exquisite).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;[<i><a href="rride.html" target="_top">Click
here to read the full review</a>]</i></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top:12.0pt"><font size="3">Tobey Maguire
(also seen in Lee’s <i>The Ice Storm</i>) and Skeet Ulrich (<i>Scream</i>, <i>The
Chill Factor</i>) are the two individuals charged with the tall order of
distilling the Secessionist ideology into a comprehensible, and nearly
sympathetic, viewpoint.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They do so
flawlessly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><img border="0" src="images/ftiff99-5.gif" alt="Ride with the Devil" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" width="225" height="127">Ulrich’s
character, with the unlikely name of Jack Bull Childs, is a Southern Bryon,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>flamboyant in manner, hot-headed and stubborn (literary talent unknown),
who will do anything to defend the slaveowning classes’ way of life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Jake Roedel (Maguire) becomes the film’s Everyman figure, whose
character embodies the contradictory situations in which those who fought for
the Secessionist cause often found themselves (Jake’s father, a German
immigrant, is murdered for his pro-Union beliefs, and although Jake keeps on
fighting for “the cause”, seemingly despite all reason, his loyalty is
always suspect to everyone but himself).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Folksinger Jewel makes her screen debut as a wily Southern widow, and
carries herself with far more dignity and humor onscreen than, apparently, she
does when off (there were stories in <i>The Globe and Mail</i> of Ms. Kilcher
throwing conniption fits when “unauthorized” photographs were taken of her
at the public screening of <i>Devil</i>).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jeffery
Wright, as Holt, the former slave of the Childs family, and Jake Bull’s
devoted companion, has been given a wonderfully-written role and plays it to its
limits and beyond.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3"><a name="AmericanBeauty" target="_top"></a>From Sam
Mendes, director of London and Broadway sensation, <i>The Blue Room </i>(best
known, or notorious, depending on your point of view,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>for its showcasing of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nicole
Kidman in the altogether), comes <i>American Beauty</i>, the debut film that was
the talk of the festival and the winner of the People’s Choice Award for best
film.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>American Beauty’s</i>
premise reads just like another one of those suburban expose films (i.e., there
are kinks floating around underneath the bland veneer of ticky-tacky homes that,
as Malvina Reynolds sang,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>“all
look the same”), with wife-swappers, pedophiles and what-have-you all
conspiring against each other while trying in vain to preserve their own
domains.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">In fact, stripped of all of its elegant
veneer and acting power, that’s exactly how <i>American Beauty</i> plays, as
Lester Burnham (Spacey), a forty-two-year-old family man with a rotting
marriage, psyche and career (amazing how troubles always run in threes in these
films), attempts one last fling with his teenage daughter’s best friend (Mena
Suvari).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><img border="0" src="images/ftiff99-6.gif" alt="American Beauty" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" width="225" height="122">Meanwhile,
as Lester goes on the road to ruin and (we are informed in the film’s first
five minutes) his <i>Sunset Boulevard</i>-like impending death, the film
emphasizes the fallout that his midlife crisis-to-be generates within both the
family and his immediate neighborhood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His
wife, Carolyn (Bening), an individual so obsessed with home and style that she
makes Martha Stewart look like a Jane-come-lately to the world of <i>haut monde</i>
place settings and fine Irish linen, also begins to come undone ( it should come
as no surprise that she is especially fond of “American Beauty” roses, those
deep-crimson works of art whose petals project the most exquisite, fragile
elegance one day, then rot at warp speed), and his daughter (Thora Birch) is
being stalked by the next-door video voyeur/pot dealer (Wes Bentley), whose
Marine Corps father (yes, that is Chris Cooper) collects Nazi-era china plates
(yet another instance in this film, and perhaps the most obvious, of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>beautiful veneers concealing the hallmarks of ugliness which are easily
revealed by the most simple of gestures).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
makes Pat Buchanan sound like a moderate Democrat.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He, too, has a Nasty Little Secret, which will naturally be revealed by
the final act.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Any one of the
misdeeds, evil acts or thoughts could be credible by themselves, but so many
have been jam-packed into one temporal and spatial block that <i>American Beauty</i>
sometimes seems like Grand Guignol in the suburbs.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="3">Sounds like fun?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Replace the gloss, Spacey’s projection of cool irony over a cauldron of
emotional breakdown, and Bening’s explosive rendition of a social striver
whose carefully-constructed veneer of respectability has been repaired so often
that it is on the verge of permanent collapse, and <i>American Beauty</i> is, at
its best, an updated version of <i>Death of a Salesman</i> (and the comparison
is not in any way meant to be an insult). The elusive, deceptive and arbitrary
nature of beauty, and its relationship to financial and personal success is the
focal point of Mendes’s film:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the
literal and metaphorical manifestations of beauty (what it is like to no longer
be “beautiful” to your employer, your family or even yourself), its
limitations and consequences, unsparing in their intensity even to the unaware.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Certainly, with its chock-a-block compiling of misery upon misery, Mendes
and playwright-turned-screenwriter Alan Ball could surely be accused in some
aspects of pandering to a so-called “liberal intellectual boomer elite,”
through heavy-handed symbolism (those red roses make far too many symbolic
appearances in a hundred-minute film to prevent their descent into triteness),
but the film has many of those so-called “moments of truth” which more than
compensate for the occasional misfiring.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
is an elegant, ugly, ungainly, precise, and, in balance, a most worthwhile film.&nbsp;<o:p>
