<p><big><strong><big>B</big></strong>reaking the farce-laden mold that so many cast
members of Saturday Night Live have set for themselves, with legions of SNL alumni moving
on to the greener pastures of Hollywood broad-based comedies and prime time sitcoms, Julia
Sweeney fashions a small, poignant, survivalist gem that&#146;s simple in concept,
entertaining in delivery, and big in heart. Sweeney has graduated from the lesser
SNL-induced relics of the androgynous It&#146;s Pat and the lame Stuart Saves His Family,
and taken a bittersweet serio-comic approach to the death of her brother Michael and her
own medical trials and tribulations, basically filming her heart-tugging yet lively
railings that became her acclaimed one-person show. That theater piece -- <i>God Said,
&quot;Ha!&quot;</i> -- directed by Greg Kachel (who gets co-producer status on the film,
originally opened at the Magic Theater in San Francisco in early 1996 and ran for three
sold out months. During a subsequent successful run in Los Angeles, Quentin Tarantino (the
film&#146;s executive producer who appears briefly at the film&#146;s end) brought the
idea of filming the production to producer Rana Joy Glickman, and the challenge began.
Instead of opening the performance up, the filmmakers (including production designer Gail
Bennett, cinematographer John Hora, and editor Fabienne Rawley) used a few cameras to
cover a stark, streamlined set (based on set designer Thom Biggart&#146;s original for the
stage), forcing your attention at Sweeney and riveting you for 85 minutes, with the crew
occasionally becoming part of the blocking.</big></p>

<p>The film first surfaced on the festival market, including South by Southwest, Seattle
International (Best Film), Palm Springs, and Toronto, with Miramax, fresh from its success
earning 23 Oscar nominations earlier this week, blessing the film (an appropriately named
Oh Brother Production) for initial commercial release this weekend in New York and Los
Angeles. For those of you elsewhere, keep an eye out (with Sweeney&#146;s luck, it&#146;ll
open in your town on May 21st, opposite you know what), and, during the wait, pick up the
Bantam book, Warner CD, or audiobook (all adapted from the stage work) and have a good
laugh/cry.</p>

<p>Comparisons to the autobiographical work of Spalding Gray (Swimming to Cambodia,
Monster in a Box) and the immensely enjoyable two character piece My Dinner with Andre are
obvious, and <i>God</i> is just as rewarding. Since this is not a movie in a cinematic
sense (I suspect the subtle light changes are of theatrical origin), don&#146;t go looking
for much action. Thank goodness there are movies like this that just flow over you,
instead of beating you over the head with special effects.</p>

<p>Sweeney disarms you immediately from the get go, inviting you into her Hollywood home
(actually not much more than a chair, sofa, throw rug, pillows, a lamp, and a few other
props), spinning tales of her failed marriage, her family, either drum-beating about her
brothers, especially Mike, who moved in with her during his losing battle with lymph
cancer, or mimicking her overbearing yet peculiar parents (dad&#146;s an NPR junkie,
mom&#146;s mixed up) as they relocate from the Spokane, Washington, house into
Sweeney&#146;s smallish bungalow. Partly self-demeaning, but always refreshing, we share
her human monologue about life and death, of her fears, particularly after she is
diagnosed with a rare form of cervical cancer, and her valiant (I can see her cringing
when I use that word) struggle and uplifting victory in her &quot;house of cancer.&quot;</p>

<p>Her embellished recollections bring you face to face with life in the bureaucratic fast
lane, of medical indecision&#146;s, of sex on the fly, of Michael&#146;s demanding
chemotherapy and radiation treatments. It&#146;s a Cobb salad with Sweeney&#146;s own
particular dressing. Filling and delicious, much like her thoughts on how the food changed
in her home during her parents&#146; visit. The bottle Samuel Adams beer in the fridge is
replaced with canned Pabst Blue Ribbon. Or the Trader Joe&#146;s chunky salsa being eaten
and replaced by Del Monte tomato paste, Mom Sweeney convinced it was an even match up.</p>

<p>&quot;Even if I used words like &#145;pasta,&#146; it was as if I was throwing my big
city ways right into their faces. They'd say, &#145;You mean noodles?&#146; And if I used
a phrase like &#145;marinara sauce,&#146; it really blew their minds, so after a few
months I was reduced to saying things like, &#145;Hey, how about the noodles with the red
topping?&#146;&quot;</p>

<p>Obviously, Sweeney&#146;s ingratiating delivery is the film&#146;s key, and that&#146;s
something that can&#146;t be properly reflected in an 750-word review. Seeing is enjoying.
So drop your SNL preconceptions and get ready to relish (get out the red topping)
something terribly hilarious.</p>
