<p><big><strong><big>B</big></strong>ack in 1990 Washington DC area airport Dulles
International was the setting for <i>Die Hard 2</i>, a lesser sequel in that franchise. To
the thinking of this long-time DC Beltway resident, the film took itself a notch down by
placing Pacific Bell pay phones in prominent view (a continuity error here in Bell
Atlantic-land), an error caused as much by the film having been shot in Denver as on poor
research, the kind that often places Silver Springs in Maryland instead of Florida.
Filmmakers have often done geographic damage of similar ilk to many a neighborhood. Back
in 1987 the Baltimore subway system derailed to the nation&#146;s capital in <i>No Way Out</i>.
Go figure. A Dulles Airport fiasco rises anew in <i>Forces of Nature</i>, a new faux
romantic-comedy featuring Sandra Bullock and Ben Affleck as a pair of mis-matched road
mates on the way from New York City to Savannah. Perhaps at Bullock&#146;s request (she
grew up 45 minutes from the airport), or by some other stroke of misfortune, the noted
futuristic building design by Finnish-born architect Eero Saarinen is magically
transported via Hollywood special effects wizards (actually just a few well-placed New
York City taxis) to the Big Apple. Next up, no doubt, will be the relocation of the
Washington Monument to Chicago because the some Windy City production couldn&#146;t get
permission to film the Sears Tower.</big></p>

<p>I won&#146;t say <i>Forces of Nature</i> was a total barometric disappointment because
of this mind-boggling oversight. It certainly didn&#146;t put me in a favorable frame of
mind. The script by Marc Lawrence (also responsible for the upcoming remake of Neil
Simon&#146;s <i>The Out of Towners</i>) is a washout, a cross between <i>Planes, Trains,
and Automobiles</i> and <i>Overnight Delivery</i>, a little seen Paul Rudd-Reese
Witherspoon vehicle that at least sports a better ending than this new retread, which
walks a fat line along a fiancé&#146;s professed love and an extended minor indiscretion,
used as a tool to reach his intended bride on their wedding day. Lawrence sprinkles an
occasional dialogue nugget amongst the coal, but the bin remains filled with black rocks,
lacking sparkle and wit. Two of America&#146;s sweethearts star in this lesser effort, and
that&#146;s enough to bring in their fans and crowds searching for a slice of light
romantic diversion. Don&#146;t raise your hopes too high and you might find it. I
didn&#146;t (raise them or find it). This was particularly true in Affleck&#146;s case; I
felt his performance lacked any gumption and often wandered off into Adam Sandler
impersonations. I don&#146;t think the supporting cast were well written, particularly the
parents of the bride and groom. Director Bronwen Hughes&#146; sophomore effort (after <i>Harriet
the Spy</i>) is an adequate one, of sexual innuendo, pre-marital infidelity, hot baths,
and cold showers. But like its main characters, it loses its direction somewhere in South
Carolina, when &quot;by chance&quot; the film&#146;s main ruse starts to unravel.</p>

<p>A series of circumstances (the only way to believe this film) has the loyal and
monogamous book-jacket copywriter Ben (Affleck) teaming up with ravishing, free spirit
Sarah (Bullock) as he races against time and an approaching hurricane to reach his beloved
Bridget (NewsRadio&#146;s Maura Tierney) down in Georgia and she hurries to save her
investment in a Savannah bagel shop from an unloving second husband and then hopefully
reconcile with another part of her family. Sarah&#146;s actually a fan of his work, wowed
by his blurbs on the back of the non-seller <i>Me and My Pharoah</i>. The stage for
possible marital disaster is set early, when Ben&#146;s grandfather, hospitalized after
suffering a heart attack at the boy&#146;s bachelor party, confesses he never married his
wife out of love (&quot;She looked like Tolstoy!&quot;) and that (his) marriage is a
prison. Ominous storm warnings indeed in a film tossed with weather references and dark
clouds, raising the eternal question, &quot;Will he or won&#146;t he?&quot;</p>

<p>So, the unlikely coupling survive a plane crash, a felony-tainted car expedition, a
train ride that sputters to a halt and finds Sarah pushing the reserved Ben trying to let
out a scream on top of a rail car, and a busload of sun worshippers looking for a good
deal on a time share. The usual stops along the way include an agonizingly stay at a
Wal-Mart, a laundromat, a motel in Oren, South Carolina (where Coincidence checks in), and
the Mr. Wonderful Bar, a bump-and-grind joint that brings about an unlikely disrobing that
sends the crowd (on screen and off) roaring. The act stops short of an X-rating and ends
up in a used Bonneville convertible (actually, a semi-convertible).</p>

<p>The tempest and cast collide at film&#146;s end, with an ending that is definitely
different. A final voice over tries to bring some understanding to the film&#146;s
unbelievable conclusions. But, like Sarah&#146;s bagel place, this epilogue, as most of
the rest of the film, is full of holes. I suggest a detour around <i>Forces of Nature</i>
until its arrival on home video.</p>
