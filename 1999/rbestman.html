I know organized an opening weekend group to go see <i>The Best Man</i>. As he
reasons in the invitation he sent out to several friends, &quot;Hollywood&quot;
pays attention to opening weekend box office receipts, and he'd like to ensure
that this film's receipts make an impression on the powers that be. You don't
see this kind of effort made for just any movie. No one feels the need to get
out the vote for <i>Three To Tango</i>, <i>Julien Donkey-Boy</i> or the latest
white-folks-getting-married picture, no matter how dim their profit-making
prospects might seem. No, the movies that attract this kind of activist approach
are movies like <i>Daughters of the Dust</i> and <i>Waiting to Exhale</i>, the
movies that the industry calls &quot;black.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">What
this term indicates is ambiguous -- it can mean that the casts or crews are
black, and/or the concerns are &quot;black&quot; (an ambiguous and often
meaningless notion that rightly frustrates anyone involved in making and
marketing &quot;black films&quot;), and/or most importantly, the target
demographic -- sometimes known as the audience -- is likely to be black. But
even if the concept is uncertain, the bottom line is crystal clear: movies that
make money get made again (and again). And in this context, the person who sent
out the invitation to see <i>The Best Man</i> understands his role as a black
consumer dynamically: he intends to influence what culture will be available for
black people to create and consume. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">While
this intention is surely commendable, not to mention shrewd, <i>The Best Man</i>
is also being pitched by a parallel method. Writer-director Malcolm Lee and the
actors have been busy on the promotional circuit (talk shows, print interviews, TV
spots), asserting the film's &quot;universal&quot; appeal. Of course, this claim
is always more political than actual (perhaps especially when made for white
movies). &quot;Universal&quot; is most often used in the industry as another
word for &quot;white,&quot; but sometimes, it means &quot;cross-over.&quot; And
it was only a short time ago -- 1986, when Malcolm Lee's cousin Spike released
the extremely profitable <i>She's Gotta Have It!</i> -- that universal or
cross-over came into common use regarding &quot;black&quot; films. Still, the
importance of race and racism in media production and promotion cannot be
overestimated: when was the last time you heard a movie starring Tom Hanks or
Meryl Streep called &quot;white&quot; or saw on the news that such a film
&quot;crossed over&quot; to black or Asian viewers? <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">On
one level, the claim that <i>The Best Man</i> is &quot;universal&quot; means
that it doesn't deal in street slang or 'hood business. On another, it means
that the film portrays events and characters that might be familiar to anyone of
a certain class (or more precisely, anyone with access to television or
magazines, where the upper middle class is the predominant image and imaginable
goal). Lee's movie delivers these potentially stock events and characters with a
mix of irony and respect, and trusts his young performers -- who are, without
exception, excellent -- to convey what the dialogue doesn't spell out. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
plot is simple and complicated at the same time. At first glance, it looks like
Harper Stewart (Taye Diggs) has everything going for him. He has a great Chicago
apartment, an about-to-be-published novel that's been selected for Oprah's Book
Club (read: instant celebrity and much income), a devoted and patient girlfriend
named Robin (Sanaa Lathan), and his best friend's wedding to attend this coming
weekend. But Harper has issues. And they're close to the surface, as
demonstrated in the movie's first five minutes, when you see Harper and Robin
celebrating the Oprah news: they lounge in an elegant freestanding bathtub,
surrounded by candles and champagne and rose petals. He leans back into his
beautiful lady's body, and sighs, contented. Until, that is, Robin lets slip
that she'd like to stay like this forever. Bzzzt! The alarm going off is clear
in Harper's suddenly wide eyes. She hasn't even mentioned the c-word
(commitment), but already the man is sweating bullets. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">This
scene sets up <i>The Best Man</i>’s predominant theme, male fear of
commitment. And it's not just a set-up for making the guys look bad: this is a
serious examination of what it means to commit, to trust, and to make yourself
vulnerable. Needless to say, this isn't a subject that comes up often in movies
not about or aimed at women. Indeed, most pictures about weddings target women,
what with all the crying, family feuding, and stressing over dresses and menus.
Refreshingly (and more or less true to its &quot;universal appeal&quot; claims),
<i>The Best Man</i>'s interest in the guys doesn't preclude women viewers with
its attention to loyalty and propriety, a smooth Stanley Clarke score, a
built-to-sell soundtrack (including a duet by Lauryn Hill and Bob Marley, and
new tracks by Maxwell and the Roots), and attractive bodies in designer clothes.
<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">While
he's stewing over this dilemma, Harper also worries that an advance copy of his
novel, the ominously titled <i>Unfinished Business</i>, will fall into the hands
of the friends who figure in it so prominently. These friends are the groom,
Lance (Morris Chestnut), who has just signed a $5 million dollar contract with
the New York Giants; the supersweet bride Mia (Monica Calhoun) who used to be a
writer for Harper when he edited the college newspaper; Murch (Harold Perrineau
Jr.), a way-too nice teacher who's bullied by his materialistic girlfriend
Shelby (Melissa DeSousa); Quentin (Terrence Dashon Howard), a self-styled player
who's currently playing guitar at a club downtown; and Jordan (Nia Long), a BET
producer for whom Harper carries a smoldering torch. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Because
Harper is facing a crisis -- when Lance finally reads the novel, he'll learn
what everyone else who's read it (which is everyone in sight, apparently)
already knows, that in college Harper had a one-night with Mia -- the film
maintains a low-grade tension throughout the requisite lunches, fittings for
wedding attire, and of course, the bachelor's party (where most of the guests
are football players, and where the booty-shaking seems as much a function of
pleasing stereotypically &quot;male&quot; moviegoers as making a point about the
male characters' intricate and unself-conscious conditioning by a go-team
culture). And because Harper is also considering finally acting on his desire
for Jordan, the possibility that he'll cheat on Robin also thrums along in the
background. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
film's most troubling aspect is its lapsing into facile stereotypes to fill in
key moments and transformations, as when Murch meets his dreamgirl at the
bachelor party, a stripper who's only doing this to pay for college, where she's
getting straight A's, thanks very much, or when Shelby gets her comeuppance by
hooking up with the relentlessly self-absorbed Quentin, or when Lance forces
Harper to pray with him to gather strength to go through with the wedding (in a
scene that's part Three Stooges abuse-comedy and part easy-targeting of
bible-quoting football players). Using Lance the star athlete as its chief
example, the film seems to want to dismantle the tired double standard that
governs heterosexual relationships, that men's &quot;indiscretions&quot; are
somehow less odious than women's, because men (and their dicks) are only
responding to provocations from females. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">This
focus on the men's exchanges leaves the women with the mostly thankless task of
helping to develop the complex desires and expectations that seem to drive Murch,
Harper, Lance, and Quentin. As the ambitious, thoughtful Jordan, Long is
particularly up to it, such that her scenes with anyone tend to seem like
they're about her more than them. It could be that since she's the sole
unattached woman on the scene, by definition she can't be limited by her
designated partner's development needs (despite a couple of attempts to attach
her to Harper via flashbacks and exchanged longing glances). Or it could be that
Jordan is the character here most in need of her own movie. <o:p>
