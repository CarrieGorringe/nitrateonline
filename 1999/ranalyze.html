            <font face="Verdana"><big><strong><big><font size="2">W</font></big></strong><b><font size="2">ith the nearly-suffocating prevalence of irony in
both entertainment and society these days, it&#146;s hardly surprising that Robert De
Niro, whose name is nearly synonymous (or perhaps eponymous) with portrayals of
individuals whose penchants for criminal activity and/or sociopathic behavior (to whatever
extreme), would decide to turn the guns on himself, if you&#146;ll pardon the expression.
One might also call De Niro&#146;s decision somewhat overdue, since his last foray into
the genre (as gambler Ace Rothstein in <i>Casino</i>) was in a film at once so over and
underwrought that any inclusion of intentional irony (there was no shortage of the
unintentional variety) would have been manna from heaven. Nevertheless, the prospect of
handing over such a (mostly) venerable acting franchise to the likes of former Second-City
madman Ramis, a director whose tendencies toward a lack of subtlety in comedic matters can
simultaneously charm and induce the grinding of teeth, might have caused De Niro some
sleepless nights (I submit <i>Caddyshack </i>and <i>Groundhog Day</i> as evidence &#150;
and, yes, I can say this, even as a fan of Ramis&#146;s work).</font></b></big></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Paul Vitti (De Niro) is a gangster with several problems, not the least of which have
been several attempts to &quot;whack&quot; him by his main rival, Primo Sindone
(Palminteri). Sindone has been jealously glowering for what seems like decades over
Vitti&#146;s &quot;privileged&quot; status as the son of a mob boss who is primed to take
over the family business, and Sindone wants the glory for himself, hence the failed hits.
Now, these threats on his life don&#146;t faze Vitti one iota; after all, being the victim
of a hit is, in Mafia terms, the equivalent of death by natural causes. Threats on his
life are an annoyance, but he knows how to deal with them, or, rather, he would, if he
didn&#146;t keep having these damned panic attacks. But when these same anxieties prevent
him from performing with his mistress&#133;well, there&#146;s only so much a guy can take.
</font>
</p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meanwhile,
Vitti&#146;s main enforcer, Jelly (Viterelli), has run into Dr. Ben Sobel (Crystal), a
psychiatrist with his own set of problems: a smartass son, an impending marriage to the
beautiful Laura (Kudrow) and a psychiatrist father who is better known than he. Sobel
gives his business card to Jelly after having rear-ended Vitti&#146;s Lincoln (complete
with a soon-to-be stiff in the trunk). He is all contrition, offering to pay for the
damage he has caused to Vitti&#146;s car. So, when Vitti confides to Jelly that &quot;a
friend&quot; needs some help for anxiety attacks, guess who goes on permanent call. Vitti
is the patient Sobel can&#146;t refuse, appearing everywhere, dragging the shrink out of
bed on the flimsiest pretext, and otherwise making life intolerable for Sobel and his
fianc¾ e (Kudrow). Vitti&#146;s goals are
precise and (naturally) unrealistic: Sobel has two weeks to cure Vitti of his anxiety,
before a big mob meeting takes place and Vitti has to face down Sindone &#150; providing
that Sindone doesn&#146;t get to Vitti first. Oh, yes, and then there&#146;s the little
matter of the FBI surveillance, led by one Agent Steadman (Weeks) and a reluctantly
cooperative Sobel to add an interesting subtexture to the entire dilemma. Caught between
two immovable objects, Sobel doesn&#146;t know whom to resist.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The overall impression left after watching <i>Analyze This</i> is of a
skillfully-crafted and smoothly-flowing satire of gangster films and the assumptions about
character and crime that underlay them, although it is occasionally so pithy in detail
that at times it plays like an overly-long sitcom. This observation, however, verges upon
the unfair; granted, the film never goes too deeply into sociological observations of the
underworld subculture (not that anyone should really expect it to do so), but it goes
deeply enough for comfort and logical consistency. The dialogue and situations have been
deftly interwoven to reveal the warp and woof of confusion and menacing uncertainty that
is at the core of the humor in this film; witness the leagues of difference in
understanding between Sobel&#146;s concept of hitting a pillow to release frustration
versus that of Vitti (maybe Vitti thinks that Sobel is an aggression-therapy advocate).
It&#146;s admittedly a simple pun, but an effective one. Then there is the sly takeoff of
a scene involving oranges &#150; ripped straight and shamelessly from the reels of <i>The
Godfather</i> &#150; and describing it further would dull its obviously insolent charm.
The script doesn&#146;t shy away from psychological development &#150; a trait all too
common in contemporary comedy; in fact, as the relationship between Vitti and Sobel
progresses, and their common traits are revealed, the script has a tendency to veer
somewhat dangerously toward the excessively maudlin; however, director Ramis never lets
the film do more than skirt the edge: there&#146;s just enough sorrow to throw the comedy
into fresh relief and give it enough of a wash of depth to paper over the inevitable gaps
in character that result from a comedy desperately trying to cram in all the nuances and
plot developments (what there are of them) before the final reel. </font> </p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Nevertheless, <i>Analyze This</i> succeeds in spite of itself, because it takes
well-worn situations and motifs and runs them through the wringer without any hesitation
or reverence. (Ramis has been quoted as saying that the film presents a warning to those
who would join gangs of any sort; if this is so, the message had to have been buried in a
subtext deeper than six feet under). Critics who have compared the humor in <i>Analyze
This</i> to that in an average sitcom, then have asked why people would be willing to pay
for what they can receive for free are missing the point: Let&#146;s just avoid the
obvious fiction of &quot;free TV&quot; (<i>pace</i> the National Association of
Broadcasters), and concentrate on the essentials: the humor in this film occurs with all
the subtlety of a Mack truck barreling down on someone at ninety-five m.p.h., but that
doesn&#146;t make the presentation any less effective. As any graduate of English Lit will
tell you, there are only about twenty narrative structures known to mankind, so of course
we&#146;ve seen it all before, but it&#146;s what the filmmakers do with the material that
is the determining factor, and for fans of broad slapstick, or anyone who&#146;s tired of
the pompousness of gangster films of late, <i>Analyze This</i> is a breath of badly-needed
(but not necessarily fresh) air. The comparison made by countless critics between this
film and the HBO series, <i>The Sopranos</i>, is just another monotonous reworking of the
old apples-oranges intellectual shell game; <i>The Sopranos</i> aims for irony, but the
series&#146; scripts end up shooting themselves in the feet because the writers can&#146;t
figure out whether to just go for the yuks or to take the whole enterprise seriously:
it&#146;s cliché time, folks. <i>Analyze This</i> has no such illusions, and as such is
the purer product.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film&#146;s success is due in no small part to the casting choices, most of which
can be best summed up as a dovetailing of the conventional with an unconventional (or at
least unexpected) twist or two. De Niro and Crystal play their respective parts with all the skill one expects
from two professionals. Judging from the hilarious result, De Niro was not preoccupied
with whatever so-called &quot;damage&quot; might have resulted from poking fun at himself.
His precision comedic timing has been on display before, in films like <i>We&#146;re No
Angels</i>, even when it was ill-served by the material at hand; now, with no fetters on
his talent, De Niro can chew away at the juicy script with glee, and he does (think of
Paul Muni in <i>Scarface</i> with far fewer maniacal conniption fits and you have a rough
sketch of Vitti&#146;s character). Crystal rolls out his trademarked
overburdened-nebbish-with-a-bite character and gives a first-rate demonstration not only
of the advantages to be gained by playing straight man, but also of how difficult a
position that is (though Crystal, a comedy master, doesn&#146;t break a sweat or show a
seam at any time during the proceedings). Palminteri, his on-screen thuggish persona long
overdue for a tweaking or two, provides solid support as Vitti&#146;s would-be successor.
But it is Viterelli, with a face like a well-fed, if lugubrious, Shar Pei, who was perhaps
the most inspired casting choice; his deadpan expression never changes, whether he&#146;s
armed with a pistol or advice. Never mind Vitti: Jelly&#146;s the one you don&#146;t want
to meet in a dark alley. Kudrow brings spark to the largely auxiliary role of the whiny
WASP fiancee. She hints at a darker side to the lady&#146;s character; there&#146;s a
sense that she would take on Vitti herself if necessary, and probably come out the better
of the two. Despite her angelic exterior, maybe she&#146;s the one you don&#146;t want to
meet in the dark alley. In fact, Sindone probably couldn&#146;t stand to do a couple of
rounds with her; he&#146;d die of frostbite in her presence within about five minutes or
so. </font> </p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Analyze This</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> is a rarity for film comedy these days: simple, polished, if
unreservedly over-the-top, and therefore unpretentious. It is a film you shouldn&#146;t
refuse if you love your comedy applied with a trowel, the threat of cement overshoes for
nonattendance notwithstanding. </font> </p>
