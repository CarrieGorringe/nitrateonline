<p><big><strong><big>B</big></strong>oys and girls are dressed alike, singing in unison,
sitting rapt before a movie screen that shows glorious war footage, the triumph of good
over evil. These early images in Joan Chen's debut feature, <i>Xiu Xiu, the Sent Down Girl</i>,
set the scene in mainland China during the Cultural Revolution (mid-1970s), in a city
called Chengdu. As the children are watching the war stories unfold on screen, their
attention is suddenly diverted from projected battles to real soldiers, who appear in the
dark with flashlights and guns. As they round up the kids, the soldiers exhort them to
&quot;forget their ancestors.&quot; </big></p>

<p>This ominous sequence also sets up the film's central themes: the Cultural Revolution
demands that everyone work to rebuild a fundamental economy, no questions asked. And the
cost of the Revolution's infamous repression of intellectual activity is represented here
in the girl Xiu Xiu (played by Lu Lu), sent down from Chengdu to the countryside, where
she's to learn a useful trade, horse herding. Written by director/co-producer Chen and Yan
Geling, and based on his novella <i>Tian Yu</i>, the movie follows the short life of
15-year-old Xiu Xiu, who wants to make her family proud by serving her nation. </p>

<p>And so she goes willingly to the remote Tibetan borderlands, where she's assigned to
live and work with the master horse trainer Lao Jin (Lopsang). She's told that following
her re-education through six months of hard labor, she will be returned triumphant to the
city and her family, prepared to take an honorable position in the Girls' Cavalry. When
she arrives at Lao Jin's place, however, Xiu Xiu is understandably apprehensive: he lives
in a tent in the middle of nowhere, moving occasionally to keep his animals eating wild
grasses. His face is weather-beaten, his posture stooped. Rumor has it that he was
castrated in a battle some years back. </p>

<p>Xiu Xiu is somewhat comforted by Lao Jin's gentleness, not to mention his apparent
inability to make sexual demands on her. But she's also frustrated and bored by their
crude existence. Yue Le's breathtaking, simple cinematography conveys both the stern
beauty of the landscape and the void it represents for the city girl. She counts the days
until her stint is up, marking them precisely on her calendar, and strings a blanket
between her space and Lao Jin's preserving her girlish sense of privacy. </p>

<p>Her teacher, meanwhile, is infinitely patient, humble, and solicitous. When Xiu Xiu
frets about the lack of facilities, he uses taped-together plastic tarps to build her a
bath which warms in the sunlight. The appointed release day comes and goes with no one
arriving to retrieve her, and Xiu Xiu begins to wonder at the wisdom of her elders, which
she's taken for granted until now. Eventually, she learns from a local vendor that the
cavalry has been disbanded and indeed, she has been forgotten. Desperate to get back home
to the city, Xiu Xiu believes the vendor's promise that he can arrange the paperwork for
her return, in exchange for sex. </p>

<p>She agrees to the deal, but soon finds that he's not quite so well-positioned as he led
her to think. Soon other men from the city -- insignificant officials, good-timing
soldiers -- hear about her availability and come to visit, also assuring her that they'll
help her. </p>

<p>Though Lao Jin is often absent during these encounters, when he is in the tent, he
cringes, silent and suffering as he listens to the sounds coming from the other side of
the blanket-wall that once symbolized the girl's youthful modesty. Heartbroken himself, he
tends to Xiu Xiu's spiritual wounds after each man leaves, bathing her with water that he
rides miles to get. While both Lao Jin and Xiu Xiu are plainly agonized and feeling
optionless, the irony of this impotent man caring for the girl he would, in truth, like to
bed, is not a little awful. </p>

<p>The film wants so badly to condemn the rigid Revolutionary dictates and limitations --
the belief that every citizen had a predetermined and inflexible role in the regime --
that it find its necessary also to blame the passivity of its protagonists. Their
submission to their fates seems, however, as much a function of traditional values, such
as unquestioning obedience to and respect for apparent superiors. Chen's movie doesn't let
anyone off the hook: as heroes, Xiu Xiu and Lao Jin are less noble than they are
frustrating. </p>

<p>Though Xiu Xiu's story is increasingly sad, Chen's filmic choices remain surprisingly
unsentimental. The girl's transition from dutiful soldier to pitiful victim is displayed
through long distance shots of the relentless, snowy landscape and tight, dingy interiors.
At one point, Lao Jin comes home to see Xiu Xiu laughing and playing with one of her
(unofficial) johns, seeming almost like the girl she was so recently. But she stops short
when she sees Lao Jin, reminded that her existence is fixed, her life potential over and
done. </p>

<p>This indictment of the Cultural Revolution is structured as a kind of legend. There is
a male voice over (by offscreen Luoyong Wang), which refers to the &quot;long
periods&quot; when there was &quot;no news of her.&quot; At first, the device sets up the
mythic proportions of the girl's suffering, but eventually, it seems to be framing a
distance from the story, a self-protective removal from the experience. And in this sense,
the voice-over also alludes to Lao Jin's point of view, which comes to dominate Xiu Xiu's.
As the film pulls back, watching Xiu Xiu self-destruct through his helpless eyes, the
story of his pain seems almost to overwhelm hers. It's as if her internal life is so
devastated and her dreams so fractured, that her perspective can't even be imagined
anymore. </p>
