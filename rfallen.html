<p><big><strong><big>D</big></strong>etective John Hobbes (Washington) is about to witness
the murder of a notorious serial poisoner named Edgar Reece (Koteas). Hobbes is called in
to hear Reece&#146;s last words. Unrepentant to the end, Reece is insistent that Hobbes
shake his hand &#150; presumably in one of those usual acknowledgments of Hobbes&#146;
status as a worthy opponent. Nothing in this chain of events prepares Hobbes for what
transpires after Reece seizes his hand: a stream of seeming gibberish froths forth from
Reece&#146;s mouth. Shaken, Hobbes leaves for the execution room, where yet another
surprise awaits him and the audience: Reece&#146;s final act is to sing his own rendition
of the Rolling Stones&#146; <i>Time is On My Side</i> just before the gas hits him (one
might have thought that <i>Sympathy for the Devil</i> would be more appropriate, but
I&#146;m getting ahead of the film and myself). Again, although deathbed bravado is not an
unusual aspect of executions, the sardonically menacing tone emanating from Reece&#146;s
mouth is enough to place anyone in a state of unease.</big></p>

<p>After the execution, Hobbes, gathered with his fellow officers, Lou (Gandolfi)and
Jonesie (Goodman), declares that the police &quot;are the chosen people&quot; who save the
world from chaos &#150; another variation on the &quot;thin blue line&quot; theory. But
even Hobbes is not prepared for what he has been chosen to endure. Not long after the
execution, a rash of killings that match Reece&#146;s homicidal style begin breaking out
all over the city, and evidence seems to be suggesting that Hobbes is part of the
conspiracy, insofar as Hobbes&#146; superior, Lt. Stanton (Sutherland), is concerned.
Hobbes is then sufficiently intrigued to answer the riddle that Reece posed to him while
in his jail cell. The answer leads Hobbes to a young theology professor named Gretta
Milano (Davidtz) whose policeman father committed suicide over thirty years ago after
being framed for murder under strikingly similar circumstances. After some initial
prodding, she tells Hobbes that he is the victim of an evil spirit named Azazel (meaning
&quot;evil incarnate&quot; in Aramaic). Azazel is one of the &quot;fallen&quot; angels,
one so evil that he has been denied form. In order to survive, he and others like him must
drift from human to human in a parasitical search for existence. Not surprisingly, their
eventual aim is the destruction of society. Now armed with information, Hobbes goes after
Azazel, but the cost will be high; Azazel will repay the favor by menacing Hobbes&#146;
brother (Casseus) and nephew (Pagan).</p>

<p>There&#146;s no question that <i>Fallen</i> is a bizarre Frankenstein monster of a
film, since it has the feeling of having been cobbled together from various psychological
flotsam and jetsam of various other films. Paste a bit of the Hitchcockian
mistaken-identity motif here, attach a bit of supernatural thriller there, etc. and you
have the film&#146;s essence down pat. Despite the obviousness of <i>Fallen&#146;s</i>
cinematic heritage, its &quot;bone structure&quot; should have been good enough for the
creation of a first-class thriller, but such isn&#146;t the case. One of the key elements
in this genre of filmmaking to bombard the audience with as much information about the
evil specter as soon as is decently possible while concealing just enough to provide an
effective wallop at the end. The entire narrative hangs upon this information, simply
because an early arming of the audience causes its members to become disarmed and their
imaginations to run more amok, thereby intensifying the horrific charge they obtain with
every passing scene. <i>Fallen</i> does not follow this pattern very effectively; it
allows the &quot;knowledge-is-power&quot; element to dissipate far too quickly after about
ninety minutes (the very time during which the audience is looking for more information).
The expert is not given enough opportunity to provide the necessary clues to the
demon&#146;s <i>modus operandi</i>, allowing them to dribble out in an ever more
enervating stream. This is the Cliff&#146;s Notes version of explication, and it weighs
the narrative down. Moreover, the script has a fatal lack of timing; some of the
explicatory passages, such as the reference to Revelations 18:2 (describing the use of
human souls as a &quot;home for every foul beast&quot;) are provided long after their
usefulness has expired. Instead of striving for balance, director Hoblit, who seems to be
developing a specialty in the area of the slam-bang ending (used to great effect in his
debut, <i>Primal Fear</i>) bets the entire farm on the strength of the ending alone; the
so-called shock that awaits the audience here is, alas, hardly much of a surprise, because
the audience hasn&#146;t been adequately primed for it. They know too much and too little
at once. It&#146;s a dangerous position for any horror film in which to find itself. Once
the hand has been tipped, tedium sets in, and the film is beyond redemption. Not even
wholesale appropriations from <em><a href="rseven.html" target="_top">Seven</a></em><i>&#146;s</i>
visual style &#150; <i>Fallen </i>is chock full of slow-motion, rough video images,
effective only until the novelty wears off &#150; can conceal the structural weakness
underneath.</p>

<p>The slackness of the script obliges the actors to prop up the film at every turn and
their work is, under the circumstances, can only be described as admirable, especially
considering the unrelenting silliness of the dialogue they are forced to work with,
courtesy of Nicholas Kazan (anyone who can keep a straight face, as does Davidtz, while
uttering the line, &quot;When it involves a person, it&#146;s always personal&quot;,
deserves any amount of praise that is immediately and not so immediately available).
Washington is, as per usual, always the very model of an earnest, upstanding man pushed to
the limits of decency. Goodman is also superb in his trademark slobby sidekick role,
though his turn in the final scene is reminiscent of his work in the same position in <i>Barton
Fink</i>; you venture past the aw-shucks veneer to find the rich layers of fine acting
underneath. Sutherland, who seems, visually at least, to be evolving into a sinister
version of Art Carney, uses his on-screen moral ambiguity to good effect; you really
wonder just how involved he is in the plot. In fact, Sutherland ends up, at times being
the only fulcrum on which the evil can balance itself, if for no other reason than the
shady persona he has consistently projected in films as of late (particularly in George
Cosmatos&#146; dreadful <a href="rct.html" target="_top"><i>Conspiracy Theory</i></a>). However, playing
a waiting game with Sutherland&#146;s character is not sufficiently entertaining in
itself, given the weak ending, soul-crushing dialogue and the appalling lack of
originality of the final musical motif. Let&#146;s just say that the motif is indicative
of <i>Fallen&#146;s</i> overall quality: it&#146;s no exaggeration to state that hustling
the audience is just the nature of its game.</p>
