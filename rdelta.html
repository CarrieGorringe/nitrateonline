<p><big><strong><big>C</big></strong>o-produced by Showtime, the directorial debut of
writer/poet Maya Angelou reads much like a made-for-television Hallmark Hall of Fame, this
particular appeal dealing with one African-American family&#146;s emotional roller-coaster
ride. In much the same manner that network television often opts for a disease-of-the-week
or affliction-of-the-weak, <i>Down in the Delta</i> concerns a woman&#146;s pains in
liberating herself from the drug-invested, alcohol-ridden Chicago housing projects. She
and her children eventually come to a sluggish, but enlightening, trek many miles and
heartfelt moments later at their generations-old ancestral homestead just off a delta in
Mississippi. It&#146;s a valiant, uplifting effort, devoid of special effects, aliens,
bugs, and email, although home-made sausage does save the community from financial ruin.
If you're looking for some counter-programming this holiday season, you&#146;ll find this
slightly more than passable, helped by some fine performances from Alfre Woodard, Al
Freeman, Jr., and the supporting cast. But Angelou&#146;s pen remains mightier than her
camerawork.</big></p>

<p>Unemployed, under-educated, neglectful, and a single parent to two children -- an
autistic 4-year-old daughter and a positive-thinking, early-teenage son -- Loretta
Sinclair (Woodard) is at sanity&#146;s edge. An unsuccessful attempt to find work at a
local supermarket causes her to relapse into the ugly world of booze under the
self-serving eye of a drug-dealing neighborhood scumbag. One step forward, two steps back.
Rosa Lynn, her strong-willed mother (Mary Alice), dares her offspring to show her devils
their due, effectively warning that her grandchildren are &quot;babies on the waiting list
to street crime.&quot; So Loretta takes a deep breath and a giant leap south to the roots
of the Sinclair legacy with the young-uns Thomas (played with stability by Mpho Koaho) and
Tracy (Kulani Hansen, who pretty much screams through her role). The trio settle in at the
modest yet sun-drenched home of Uncle Earl (Freeman), brother of Loretta&#146;s late
father, and his wife Annie (the late Esther Rolle). The new fish out of water are hard-put
in dealing with their aunt&#146;s Alzheimer&#146;s-induced wanderings and the slowed-down
lifestyle devoid of the inner-city dangers and AK-47 gunfire that had been part of their
everyday existence. Yet, slowly, they adjust, as Loretta goes to work at Earl&#146;s Just
Chicken restaurant, reins in her addictions, and gains a messful of self-confidence.</p>

<p>The script, by first-time screenwriter and Georgia native Myron Goble, works better as
the story heads south and the actors gain confidence in their relaxed surroundings. He
intertwines homespun homilies with stories of the family&#146;s generations past (told in
numerous recreations throughout the film and rehashed at the film&#146;s conclusion), its
brush with slavery, and the history of Nathan, a 150-year-old candlebra that has become
the Sinclair&#146;s most valuable and prized heirloom. Passed down from oldest son to
oldest son, the family jewel finds temporary shelter in a Chicago pawnshop, sold to pay
for bus tickets to Biloxi, but its place on the mantel seems cloyingly assured by
film&#146;s end. On the down side, Goble&#146;s tale pushes Loretta into a pain-free rehab
and seemingly overnight recovery, while Tracy&#146;s first spoken words are played out in
overly sentimental fashion.</p>

<p>Angelou, already recognized as a television director, scriptwriter (Georgia, Georgia),
writer-producer (1982&#146;s family-themed drama <i>Sister, Sister</i>), and for numerous
musical scores, also earned an Emmy nomination 21 years ago for her supporting role in the
landmark production <em>Roots</em>. It&#146;s easy to see why the producers thought this
script worthy to be her debut directorial undertaking. Wesley Snipes, who has a small role
as Earl&#146;s upper-middle-class Atlanta-based attorney son, was instrumental in pushing
the project along through his Amen-Ra Films.</p>

<p>Cinematographer William Wages evokes a warm tone and rural feel, enhanced by Lindsey
Hermer-Bell&#146;s stark production design. You wouldn&#146;t know that the film was shot
in Toronto, with the Southern-based material filmed 40 miles north of that city.</p>

<p>Woodward, who last year won an Emmy and Golden Globe for her performance in HBO&#146;s <i>Miss
Evers&#146; Boys</i>, imbues Loretta with a quiet dignity (she&#146;s one of
America&#146;s best actresses) that elevates the film above it&#146;s weak foundations.
Veteran actor Freeman is a sturdy, yet concerned, patriarch who struggles with an ill wife
and extends open arms to his city cousins. <em>Good Times&#146;</em> Esther Rolle&#146;s
final credit caps a sad end to a career that also saw her co-star with Angelou and Woodard
in <i>How to Make an American Quilt</i>. Loretta Devine, who created &quot;Lorell&quot; in
the Broadway production <i>Dreamgirls</i> and has been seen on big screen and small, adds
a fine turn as Zenia, a paid helper in the Sinclair household, who becomes a close friend
of Loretta&#146;s.</p>
<i>

<p>Down in the Delta</i> is not completely convincing, yet the tale is chockful of
optimism, and the cast revels in sewing together a family torn asunder. In these
depressing times of Presidential impeachment and war in Iraq, <i>Delta</i> will raise your
spirits and take your mind off the national headlines. Yes, it&#146;s a slight film. If
you miss it now, it&#146;ll be a pleasant enough rental next year for home video, and
will, at least for nearly two hours, take your mind away from whatever ills and innuendoes
are being telecast on CNN.</p>
