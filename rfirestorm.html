<p><big><strong><big>T</big></strong>his film isn't apt to light your fire and it's
doubtful it will ignite much action at the box-office. It's unfortunate that Fox NFL
Sunday co-host, former football pro, and fledgling actor Howie Long choose as his first
starring vehicle this tame (dare I say lame) action piece set around the heroic exploits
of smokejumpers &#150; &quot;the men and women who parachute into forest fires when all
other accesses are unavailable.&quot; Long made a memorable debut in John Woo's <i>Broken
Arrow</i> and <i>Firestorm</i> is the first of three films under a multi-picture deal with
Twentieth Century-Fox. He ain't no Steven Seagal, at least not yet. And Arnold
Schwarzenegger toiled away before hitting paydirt with <i>The Terminator</i>, so there is
hope for Long. Just as he was very competently directed as John Travolta's right hand in
his first film, now former director-of-photography turned director Dean Semler can't seem
to provide Long any dimension. Semler may be an Academy Award-winning cinematographer (for

<p><img src="images/rfirestorm-1.jpg" align="right" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="150">So we have affable and fearless ex-Pro
Bowl jock Long featured as affable and fearless Jesse Graves, a smokejumper who likes to
fight the flames and take on any raging fire as a personal quest for the holy grail. His
mentor is Wynt Perkins, a poorly defined role of another skydiving fire fighter filled by
Scott Glenn. He pretty much mopes around after an opening credit rescue (a small girl and
her cute puppy conveniently and moronically left behind by weeping parents!) leaves him
hobbled and ripe for retirement. He's done much better work with much better material
(i.e., <i>Silence of the Lambs</i>, <i>The Right Stuff, Backdraft, </i>and last year's<i> <a href="rapower.html" target="_top">Absolute Power</a>). </i>Add to the mix ornithologist Jennifer, the
damsel in the dress (Suzy Amis, most recently seen fleetingly in <a href="ftitanic.html" target="_top"><em>Titanic</em></a>)
and Randall Alexander &quot;Earl&quot; Shaye (William Forsythe), the bad-ass Hannibal
Lecter who masterminds his escape from the Wyoming State Penitentiary. <i></p>
</i>

<p>Shaye &#150; a cross between the local bad boy Forsythe played in <i>Out for</i>
Justice (1991) and his Al Capone in the TV series <i>The Untouchables</i> &#150; is eager
to start spending the $37 million he is in the slammer for heisting several years earlier.
This sociopath, responsible for 17 deaths in his robbery, offers to share his hidden
wealth with five other incarcerated foul-ups <img src="images/rfirestorm-2.jpg" align="left" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">(a big blond pro wrestler, a &quot;shy&quot; rapist, etc.) who assist with
his entry back into society through the convenience of the busload of convicts used by the
state in digging trenches alongside the fire fighters. About every ten minutes or so, the
fire gets closer and Shaye contrives the death of one of his cohorts as their usefulness
in his grand plan lessens. The ever-diminishing dimwits don't have a clue that their
socially impaired leader is offing their buddies (&quot;Gee, he musta slipped off the
ledge&quot; or &quot;Gee, Jesse musta killed him.&quot;) as they chase Jennifer and Jesse,
who have knowledge of their escape plans. The film's pretty much a clueless mess. This
Baywatch of the woods has one running joke about a dropped Pulaski (a big mother of an
axe) that's always just missing scalping Jesse. Once was enough, three times and it falls
flat, although the dropped tool becomes the weapon of choice during the film's climax, set
against an impeding firestorm. Yeah, that's when the effects slip into high gear to show
off two ferocious fire storms creating a massive inferno. It causes all oxygen to be
sucked out the air. Other things suck with this film, too. Not too impressive as effects
go, unless you're a fire buff.</p>

<p>It's pretty much Long's ball game here and while he doesn't fumble the pigskin, er
pulaski, away, he gets no help from his coaching staff. Thank goodness it's a short film
(less than 90 minutes, with a slight &quot;Carrie&quot;-esque overtime). This week's fire
will undoubtedly be drowned out by next week's <i>Hard Rain</i>.&nbsp;</p>
