<p><em>Get Shorty</em> is a good film. In fact, it&#146;s a very, very good film, so good
that it restores one&#146;s faith in Hollywood filmmaking generally after a rather dismal
slate of summer and fall releases. It also restores the belief that Barry Sonnenfeld (he
of the <em>Addams Family</em> pictures) actually has a feel for comedy; the proof lies in
the fact that Sonnenfeld does not significantly alter (except at the end) the content and
essence of Leonard&#146;s novel. The novel is a brilliant mix of self-reflexivity and an
overlay of irony; the story that Chili tries to pitch as a movie idea to Zimm is the
actual narrative of the film recounted to the point at which he and Zimm begin talking
about it. This self-conscious approach can, if injudiciously employed, quickly appear to
be self-indulgent; in such a case, it is usually employed as an &quot;artistic&quot;
device meant to conceal major conceptual shortcomings. Granted, there are some rather
large holes in the narrative, but, taken as a whole, the film is such frothy, almost
infectious, fun that the audience just wants to bounce along with it. The amazingly cool
soundtrack, featuring diverse but related artists like Count Basie, Morphine and John
Lurie, adds to this sense of hipness, making even a dinosaur like Harry Zimm seem
up-to-date.</p>

<p><em>Get Shorty</em>, whether in film or book form, is a wonderful satire about the egos
involved in the movie industry. Of course, enjoyment of the film rests upon an assumption
that the audience has or can muster a certain degree of sympathy for people whose raison
d&#146;être is a preoccupation with the self to a degree that is not only excruciating,
but also flagrantly overt. Naturally, when all an actor has to sell is his or herself, and
when visibility (the old &quot;seeing-and-being-seen-in-all-the-right-places&quot; gambit)
is essential to obtaining success, and if success is power and power is access to
influence, then the whole process, especially for those at the bottom of the Hollywood
heap, can seem like nothing more than a zero-sum game being played in an ever-downward
spiral. Hence, an ability to create a perception of success can be more important than
actual success itself. Everybody in this film, be it mob figure or Hollywood figure, has
an angle, and <em>Get Shorty</em> does more than suggest that the difference between the
two mafias is solely a product of the imagination. A comparison between this film and
Robert Altman&#146;s <em>The Player</em> is instructive, since they deal with the ethical
vagaries of Hollywood; unlike Altman&#146;s rather more stridently didactic piece, <em>Get
Shorty</em> skewers the pretentiousness of filmmaking gently, but no less effectively.</p>

<p>Everything works in <em>Get Shorty</em>, especially the performances. Travolta
demonstrates that his work in <em>Pulp Fiction</em> wasn&#146;t an aberration. He
doesn&#146;t merely embody Chili Palmer; he has seemingly absorbed the character&#146;s
sensibilities into his own DNA code. When Travolta appears on screen, it is as if the
other characters and even the surroundings part to allow him to pass, so in awe do they
seem at the specter of such low-key but high-voltage self-confidence. Arguably, the role
of Chili Palmer could be nothing more than a continuation of his role in <em>Pulp Fiction</em>
but, if this is nothing more than a one-note role, Travolta blows that note with such
loving skill and tenacity that he deserves an Oscar nod. His talents having been wasted in
the execrableness of <a href="rclock.html" target="_top"><em>Clockers</em></a>, <em>Get Shorty</em>
gives Delroy Lindo a great opportunity to take charge, and he does. Lindo&#146;s portrayal
of drug-dealer and Hollywood wannabe Bo Catlett has exactly the right mix of silkiness and
menace. With any luck, he will join Denzel Washington and Morgan Freeman in that
newly-minted and all-too-sparsely-populated realm of African-American actors who can make
a film bankable. Hackman effortlessly projects the world-weary cynicism and pathetic
hopefulness of a would-be Hollywood player who has been on the fringes too long. Zimm is
what Roger Corman might have become had the series of <em>Poe</em> films and <em>Little
Shop of Horrors</em> not provided Corman with a patina of critical respectability to add
to his talents as a budget-conscious filmmaker. Russo likewise provides Karen Flores with
that same blend of cynicism and pathos; despite Karen&#146;s &quot;been there, done
that&quot; attitude, Russo&#146;s portrayal allows Karen to have a tiny core of optimism
against all odds that softens the edges of her personality, and it is to Russo&#146;s
credit that she keeps everything nicely in balance. Farina is hysterically funny as a thug
who alternates between ineffectual stupidity laced with self-pity and viciousness, both of
which are girded by an overly-inflated sense of his own self-importance and invincibility.
Never mind the gang that couldn&#146;t shoot straight; Bones is the gang that
couldn&#146;t think straight -- all by himself.</p>

<p>Add to the above mixture wonderful cameo performances by Bette Midler and Harvey
Keitel, and <em>Get Shorty</em> is great entertainment for a dreary afternoon.</p>
