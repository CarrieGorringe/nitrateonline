<h1><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Ten Best Movies of 1998:</font></h1>

<h2><font face="Verdana" size="2">1) <a href="rprivateryan.html" target="_top"><i>Saving Private Ryan</i></a></font></h2>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Although the midsection of this emotionally devastating summer triumph (second only to <i>Armageddon</i>
in the year's box office tally) sags alarmingly, Steven Spielberg's unabashedly patriotic
ode to the men who stormed Omaha Beach and the unwavering sense of duty that carried them
through that horror would not -- could not -- be the same without the even-keeled,
everyman performance of his friend Tom Hanks, who seems to be able to form a fast
friendship with even the most cynical moviegoer.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Verdana" size="2">2) <a href="roppositeofsex.html" target="_top"><i>The Opposite of Sex</i></a></font></h2>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The year's funniest movie is a triumph of intuitive acting and spectacularly witty
writing, as first-time director Don Roos muscled his screenplay into life with the
collaboration of a uniformly fine cast in top ensemble form. Christina Ricci and Lisa
Kudrow are both Oscar-bound as headstrong women who lock horns over the pertinent issues
of the day, as the former schemes her way through shocked family and friends to the
constant and imaginative disapproval of the latter. With a refreshingly self-deprecating
commentary by Roos, the newly-released DVD is a must-have for fans with an interest in how
movies are put, or sometimes fall, together.</font> </p>

<h2><font face="Verdana" size="2">3) <a href="rsplan.html" target="_top"><i>A Simple Plan</i></a></font></h2>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This complex and satisfying morality plays continues Billy Bob Thornton's dark
exploration of the rural psyche, proclaims Bill Paxton a leading man of vulnerable
charisma and marks an exhilarating shift of focus for director Sam Raimi, who brings to
novelist Scott Smith's shrewd and brave adaptation of his book an icy authority far
removed from his pulpy genre roots in execution, if not spirit. Ultimately, <i>A Simple
Plan</i> is a movie about the dangers of financial pressure and the lure of easy money --
a subject that resonates with profound moral implications in today's world.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Verdana" size="2">4) <a href="rronin.html" target="_top"><i>Ronin</i></a></font></h2>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Veteran director John Frankenheimer's action thriller came from nowhere to do for chase
movies what Quentin Tarantino's <i>Jackie Brown</i> did for lowlife caper films. Sadly,
Frankenheimer's movie, anchored by one of Robert De Niro's best performances ever, seems
to be as profoundly misunderstood and underappreciated as Tarantino's was in late 1997,
although both should have long, happy lives on tape and DVD -- where they can be cherished
by those who like their genre exercises neat.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Verdana" size="2">5) <a href="rcentral.html" target="_top"><i>Central Station</i></a></font></h2>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like <i>Kolya</i> in 1997, <i>Central Station</i> exhibits a filmmaker in supreme
control of the medium telling a universally affecting story, as director Walter Salles
takes a young boy, an old woman and the audience to the heart of Brazil in a tale of
poverty, deceit and an ultimate redemption that is both graceful and cleansing.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Verdana" size="2">6) <a href="rspanish.html" target="_top"><i>The Spanish Prisoner</i></a></font></h2>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A malicious masterwork from the sword, uh, pen, of playwright/screenwriter/director
David Mamet, this pleasing puzzle of a movie about corporate skullduggery features the
dramatic high water mark of Steve Martin as a shadowy player who may or may not be loaded,
superbly calibrated work from Campbell Scott as the fragile creator of a much sought-after
formula for business success and Rebecca Pidgeon -- Mrs. Mamet -- as what Mamet himself
might call &quot;the dame.&quot;</font></p>

<h2><font face="Verdana" size="2">7) <a href="rgeneral.html" target="_top"><i>The General</i></a></font></h2>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">John Boorman is one of the great living filmmakers, and this impressionistic, often
impish biography of Irish criminal and all-around rogue Martin Cahill -- filmed in bracing
widescreen black and white and set to the music of saxaphonist Richie Buckley and singer
Van Morrison -- is his freshest, most accessible work in years.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Verdana" size="2">8) <i>The Mighty</i> </font> </h2>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">From Peter Chelsom, director of <i>Hear My Song</i> and <i>Funny Bones</i>, comes a
first American film, adapted by Rodman Philbrick from his young adult novel, with the same
affection for the disaffected shown in his previous work. The medium-sized cast is good
down the line (a Chelsom hallmark), but the movie is really about the unlikely friendship
of Kieran Culkin's Kevin (as a whiz-kid suffering from Morquio's Syndrome) and learning
disabled hulk Max (Elden Henson), who team up when Kevin logically points out &quot;you
need a brain, I need legs.&quot; Later, someone says the boy has a &quot;heart too big for
his body,&quot; and that is a mighty good description of this movie as a whole.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;9) <a href="routsight.html" target="_top"><i>Out of Sight</i></a></font></h2>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">From the producers of <i>Get Shorty</i>, a textbook example of how to do Elmore Leonard
right. From the faded honor of George Clooney to the exquisitely calibrated direction of
Steven Soderbergh, every note rings true -- and cool. And the nearly fatal attraction
between Clooney and Jennifer Lopez was the high point of heat in a 1998 film.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Verdana" size="2">10) <a href="rshakespeare.html" target="_top"><i>Shakespeare in Love</i></a></font></h2>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The year's most literary movie. The sly and intricate script by Marc Norman and Tom
Stoppard posits a bard so smitten with a soon-to-be-married noblewoman and harried by the
pressures of the theatrical world that one of his most popular plays is created literally
on the run, as episodes from his own passionate affair and the demands of the creditor are
pressed into service as part of the drama (which he'd sold as a lowbrow comedy improbably
christened &quot;Romeo and Ethel, the Pirate's Daughter&quot;; &quot;nice title,&quot;
says a clearly unimpressed Christopher Marlowe). As the object of his affection, Gwyneth
Paltrow is luminous, combining her second English accent of the year (as in <i>Sliding
Doors</i>, she sounds a bit like &quot;Avengers&quot;-era Diana Rigg) with an unbridled
yet serene passion.</font> </p>

<h2><font face="Verdana" size="2">11) <a href="ftiff98-2.html#Touch_of_Evil" target="_top"><i>Touch of Evil</i></a></font></h2>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Orson Welles' late-career potboiler is a masterpiece of self-referential noir, a gothic
stew of murder, lust and corruption that was restored and slightly re-edited into a more
Wellesian form by a team including Oscar-winning sound editor Walter Murch and Welles
scholar Jonathan Rosenbaum. On tape or DVD (a March 1999 release has been discussed), this
bonus selection is destined to be a keeper in any collection.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Honorable mention:</font></p>
<i>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Gods and Monsters</font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">, <i>Waking Ned Devine</i>, <i>Funny Games</i>, <i>Love and Death
on Long Island</i>, <i>BASEketball</i>, <i>Unmade Beds</i>, <i>The Inheritors</i>, <i>Fireworks</i>,
<i>The Celebration</i>, <i>Psycho</i> (yes, the remake), <i>Inside/Out</i>, <i>Frogs for
Snakes</i></font></p>

<h1><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Ten Worst Movies of 1998:</font></h1>

<h2><font face="Verdana" size="2">1) <a href="rantz.html" target="_top"><i>Antz</i></a></font></h2>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Forced, unfunny and often genuinely creepy, this animated oddity is a real ordeal. And
the gambit of animating insects to look like the actors who voice them</font> </p>

<h2><font face="Verdana" size="2">2) <i>The Big Hit</i></font></h2>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The downside of cool, when a concept just doesn't work and isn't helped by petulant,
pushy acting. Mark Wahlberg's follow-up to <i>Boogie Nights</i> confirms that Paul Thomas
Anderson's porno epic may have been it for the former underwear model, credibility-wise.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Verdana" size="2">3) <a href="ftiff97-1.html#The_Big_One" target="_top"><i>The Big One</i></a></font></h2>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Michael Moore isn't funny, period.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Verdana" size="2">4) <a href="rcruise.html" target="_top"><i>The Cruise</i></a></font></h2>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The praise for this manipulative and exploitative &quot;documentary&quot; was both
incessant and mysterious, elevating a motormouthed New York City tourguide with apparently
profound emotional problems to cult status. <i>That</i>'ll help him deal with his demons.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Verdana" size="2">5) <i>First Love, Last Rites</i></font></h2>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The downside of the new American independent movement, a slow and obtuse meditation on
young love in the bayou redeemed only by a novel soundtrack from Shudder to Think.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Verdana" size="2">6) <a href="rgod.html" target="_top"><i>Godzilla</i></a></font></h2>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The downside of summer blockbusters, an effects-heavy chunk of inertia redeemed only by
that genuinely scary sequence in Madison Square Garden.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Verdana" size="2">7) <a href="rlastsum.html" target="_top"><i>I Still Know What You Did Last Summer</i></a> </font> </h2>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This movie will serve nicely as poster child for all those exasperating and wretched
teen horror films; to their credit, they pay for themselves and exit quickly, leaving only
a few interesting cover versions of classic rock songs in their wake.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Verdana" size="2">8) <a href="rlostinspace.html" target="_top"><i>Lost in Space</i></a></font></h2>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Even worse than <i>The Avengers</i>, this oddly-cast (Gary <i>Oldman</i>? William <i>Hurt</i>?)
and perfunctory cavalcade of special effects does feature a fine, square-jawed performance
by friend Matt LeBlanc but will forever be known as the film that knocked <i>Titanic</i>
out of first place at the box office -- and sank even quicker than the boat it displaced.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Verdana" size="2">9) <a href="ftiff97-3.html#Suicide_Kings" target="_top"><i>Suicide Kings</i></a></font></h2>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Any movie that duct-tapes Christopher Walken to a chair deserves what it gets, which in
this case was nothing. Denis Leary is a scream in one of those small supporting roles that
you wish the filmmakers had built the movie around.</font></p>

<h2><font face="Verdana" size="2">10) <a href="ryfriends.html" target="_top"><i>Your Friends and Neighbors</i></a></font></h2>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Alongside <a href="rhappiness.html" target="_top"><i>Happiness</i></a> and <i>The Last Days of Disco</i>
in the sad genre of movies making fun of disaffected and grotesquely flawed young people,
individually and collectively these movies registers more as disappointments, as dyspeptic
young hyphenate filmmakers vent their spleens against societies that they find
self-indulgent and suffocating -- in works that are self-indulgent and suffocating.</font></p>
