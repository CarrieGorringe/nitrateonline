<meta name="description" content="Cinefest 98 - Perhaps taking inspiration from the title of this year's Children's Film Festival ? &quot;Courage to Act&quot; ? the International Jury of the flagship Competition section of the 48th Berlin International Film Festival seemed to directly refute claims that the whole thing's gone irreparably mainstream and commercial by awarding the event's top prize, the Golden Berlin Bear, to the warmly-received but decidedly more artistically adventurous Brazilian-French entry Central do Brasil (Central Station) ? which, fittingly, features a captivating performance by an 11-year-old newcomer who won the part over a reported 1,500 other aspirants.

<p><big><strong><big>U</big></strong>nited I fly. United they stall. It&#146;s Wednesday
night (Thursday morning, actually) and after a cramped and long-delayed flight aboard one
of those miniature sardine-can United Express flights, I have arrived in Syracuse, New
York. Home of the Orangemen. Home of March Madnesday. Home of Cinefest.</big></p>

<p>Say what? I have made annual pilgrimage to this upstate city for the last ten years not
to cheer on the local basketball team but to spend a long weekend sitting in a darkened
hotel ballroom with hundreds of other old farts (and some young ones too!), my butt frozen
in uncomfortable chairs from sunrise to after sunset, watching amusing, forgotten, and
sometimes enlightening old movies. Nearly all the titles shown over the course of this
four-day event have something in common with this magazine ... it&#146;s namesake. They
are were originally developed on nitrate film stock, an extremely unstable and very
flammable product (phased out of use by the early 1950s) prone to spontaneous combustion.
Like some of my reviews. Thankfully, the viewings this year will all be from safety prints
on acetate stock. Maybe we could change our name to acetateonline.com, but it doesn&#146;t
have the same sense of daring and anger.</p>

<p><img src="images/fcinefest98-1.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="left" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="179">Ah, sweet
Cinefest, now in it&#146;s 18th year, the product of a group of stalwart cinephiles whose
love for the medium has resulted in one of numerous conclaves throughout the U.S. of A.
that allow for fans of silent and sound films to gather for hours in the darkness, or
browse through movie reels and memorabilia in an adjoining dealer hall, or schmooze at the
bar with old friends and new here at the Four Points &quot;Convention Center&quot; in
suburban Liverpool, away from the hustle of downtown traffic and a 5-minute ride from
Hancock International Airport. This region of the Empire State is often under a layer of
snow at this time of year, but the temperatures now are above freezing and instead of snow
it&#146;s a slow, steady drizzle. In 1997&#146;s edition, there was a continuous snowfall
blanketing the vicinity, a few inches here and there. Sometimes we have a foot or more. I
think El Nino might give us a break this time. You can bring your boots, but few venture
out as there are no nearby restaurants in walking distance. </p>

<p>As a film historian, I first attended one of these gatherings in Washington DC in the
early 1970s. That party was Cinecon, which was then a roaming show but is now solidly
entrenched in Los Angeles over the Labor Day weekend. I haven&#146;t been to that west
coast experience, which often brings in stars of yesteryear, while Cinefest pretty much is
a straight forward movie show.</p>

<p>The participants range from old film fans, students from the area universities, and
anyone else willing to fork over the few bucks ($55 at the door) to attend. Among the
&quot;guests&quot; are Entertainment Tonight&#146;s Leonard Maltin, whose Sunday morning
auction is a don&#146;t-miss hour, and noted film archivists and preservationists Paolo
Cherchi Usai, Chris Horak, David Francis, and David Sheppard. Richard Gordon (who
introduced me to this &quot;special&quot; event) and his brother Alex are film producers
and writers who are always fun to be with.</p>

<p><img src="images/fcinefest98-2.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="213">And of course
there are movies. Starting Thursday at 10 A.M. and continuing (with breaks for meals)
through Sunday until around 6 P.M. Figure 6-8 feature-length programs, a smattering a
shorts and other programs, and you get a real good cross-sampling of some rarely seen
footage. Including on the schedule are The Shake Down (1928), director William
Wyler&#146;s lost classic with James Murray and Barbara Kent, Derelict with George
Bancroft and William Boyd, the Harold Lloyd film Welcome Danger, Heart of the Hills
starring Mary Pickford and John Gilbert, James Thurber&#146;s 13 Clocks (the first tv
musical, starring Basil Rathbone and Sir Cedric Hardwick), as well as salutes to George
Gershwin, Technicolor, and Biograph silent shorts. </p>

<p>Of course we don&#146;t watch silent films in silence. The stellar talents of Jon
Mirsalis and George Eastman House&#146;s Phil Carli provide keyboard (as in piano, not the
kind I&#146;m banging on right now) support for the 14 silent films in the program. </p>

<p>The highlight is always the Saturday morning show, usually held at the hugely beautiful
former Loews State Theatre downtown. We&#146;ve occasionally be bussed to the George
Eastman House an hour or so down the New York Thruway, but in recent memory, we&#146;ve
stayed local. This year we&#146;ll be thrilled with the 102-minute restored version of the
silent classic The Lost World. Years before Spielberg and still just as exciting. Walt
Disney Co. preservationist Scott MacQueen will also be presenting some rare reels from
Mickey&#146;s vaults.</p>

<p>I&#146;ll be posting another installment later in the weekend and also will provide
some web links to some interesting silent film sites. Organizer Phil Serling (license
plate PHILM1), firmly entrenched in bygone days, hasn&#146;t set up a website because he
doesn&#146;t have a computer. Never has and probably never will. In the meantime, you
might want to visit the alt.movies.silent newsgroup to pick up some tidbits on goings on
in this off-the-beaten-path tribute to the glory days of cinema.</p>
