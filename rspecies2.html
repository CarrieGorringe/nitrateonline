<p><big><strong><big>A</big></strong>h, the wonderful world of sequels. Think of the
Academy-Award winning Godfather II. Recall the imaginative Star Wars trilogy. The wacky
Back to the Future flicks. Those hair-raising Alien II and IV follow-ups (forget the third
installment). </big></p>

<p>Species II is one sequel that screams...Yuck! It also conjures up...Why? Screenplay be
damned. Acting? Throw it out the window. Pacing deader than the many bed-ridden corpses
throughout the movie. Effects. Yeah, they're ok (at least the producers kept the H.R.
Giger design). If you liked the 1995 original, consider this. Pretend Species is a great
body of work (I said pretend). Species II can't hold a pinkie up to it. Probably not even
a pinkie's fingernail. If MGM thought they were creating a new franchise here, a la James
Bond, they are sadly mistaken. They probably realize that as the film was not pre-screened
for the press prior to its unleashing on an unsuspecting public.</p>

<p><img src="images/rspecies2-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="133" HEIGHT="200">This gore fest
is chockfull of rotting flesh and rotten writing, the latter courtesy of X-Files' Chris
Brancato, who even dares to toss in an off-the-cuff reference to the popular TV show.
Director Peter Medak (most recently helming TNT's <i>The Hunchback of Notre Dame</i>) must
have been gone deaf from the bells in the cathedral when this film was being made. What
else would explain his failure to hear his actors read so many dreadful lines in such a
wooden manner. He inspires his actors to genuine boredom. Particularly George Dzundza as
the &quot;intimidating&quot; Colonel Carter Burgess Jr. If you were to look up
&quot;over-acting&quot; or &quot;ham&quot; in the dictionary, Dzundza's role here would
provide the perfect definition. Michael Madsen as Press Lennox is a close second.
Unfortunately, as Madsen is truly capable of some great performances, including those
found in <i>Donnie Brasco</i> and as the psychotic Mr. Blonde in Reservoir Dogs. When the
Colonel enlists Lennox, now a private-sector security consultant, to help fight the alien
threat (as he did in the first film), he refuses. The officer, disfigured with one cloudy
eye, offers up a million bucks and, presto, guess who's on board? As in life imitating
art, the entire cast (including the three returns from the original) must have had a large
change purse dangled before them before agreeing to appear (I didn't say act) in this sad
excuse for a film.</p>

<p><img src="images/rspecies2-2.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="left" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">An extended
opening sequence heralds man's inaugural landing on Mars (sponsored by the likes of Pepsi,
Sprint, and Reebok through exterior spacecraft endorsements) and the subsequent infection
of three astronauts by extra-terrestrial DNA. Meanwhile, in an underground, supposedly
high-security facility not too far from Capital Hill, Dr. Laura Baker (Marg Helgenberger)
is supervising the development of Eve (Natasha Henstridge), a clone of the human-alien
hybrid seen as Sil in the first (and, regrettably, not the last) Species. Reason is tossed
to the wind in figuring out why anyone would create such a threat to the human race,
although by film's end it's obvious that Brancato is cribbing from the Terminator films in
transforming the bad Sil into a good Eve. </p>

<p><img src="images/rspecies2-3.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="197">Richard Belser
has a brief cameo at the film's beginning, as the President of the United States. He must
have had a day off from filming Homicide (one of television's greatest hours); location
scenes were filmed in Baltimore, Laurel, and Columbia, Maryland, as well as in Washington
DC. An after-thought, it appears, as Bill Clinton's portrait is seen briefly in the office
of southern Senator Ross (James Cromwell), whose son Patrick (Justin Lazard) is one of the
infected spacemen--a bad seed whose inter-species foreplay and extra-terrestrial
intercourse back on earth creates an instant brood of future genetic monstrosities he
squirrels away on the family farm. The heightened display of T and A might provide a kick
for those viewers who surf the internet's sex sites, but it only further shows the flaws
in the film. And when I say the acting is wooden, there is no pun deserved.</p>

<p>I already mentioned the pacing (or lack thereof). Chase scenes are played out like a
walks in the woods. It's also entirely unbelievable that all three astronauts are sent off
on their own after such a historic mission and that all live in the Metro Washington DC
area. Dennis Gamble (Mykelti Williamson), the only non-infected member of the Mars team,
joins with Lennox in quickly popping from one demon seed outburst to the next, totally
unaware of the traffic situation in area and the time most commuters spend idling on the
Beltway here in Washington. </p>

<p>The film comes to a predictable close with a gross-out at the ok corral. The pupacious
spawn of the handsome astronaut turned sex-crazed alien are done away by what appears to
be bug spray. Like cockroaches, you can't exterminate them all. Down the road, sometime in
the future, will be Species III. Oh, the horror! The horror!</p>
