<p><big><strong><big>A</big></strong>n &quot;urban legend&quot; is supposed to be about
things like pet baby crocodiles who now happily reside in the local sewer system, a
taxicab which shows up in the darnedest of times and places, or raccoons who congregate
regularly at night on the Central Park riding path to play pinochle. The things to which
the characters in this movie refer sound more like <i>pranks</i> than &quot;urban
legends,&quot; stuff about Pop Rocks and soda, or animals in microwave ovens. A college
professor specializing in &quot;urban folklore&quot; addresses his class of students, who
look rather hirsute even by movie standards, on the story about the babysitter who gets
crank phone calls that turn out to be coming from inside the house. &quot;Anyone ever
heard that one?&quot; he asks. Yeah, I have, I replied: 1979's <i>When a Stranger Calls</i>,
which had a sensational opening sequence that made it a word-of-mouth surprise hit. See?
Sometimes movies can be bigger than life. But even before that sequence, the body count
has started to rise. A menacing stalker, wearing a familiar outfit that still disguises
the face, has started perpetrating malfeasance without apparent reason or cause. The first
victim is seen listening to a recording of Bonnie Tyler's &quot;Total Eclipse of the
Heart.&quot; As if that weren't horrifying enough, ... But, wait a minute, doesn't this
also seem familiar?</big></p>

<p>Since the surprise success of <i>Scream</i>, which had a sensational opening sequence
that made it a word-of-mouth hit, the recent revival of the slasher movie has, frankly,
has me a bit baffled. Why bring back a sub-genre of movie which died under the weight of
its own repetitiousness? After years of capering by that jolly jester, Freddy Krugger,
screenwriter Kevin Williamson came up with the answer: attitude. With the rise of home
video, the characters would comment on the predictability of the conventions of the very
kind of movie in which they were existing! So hip, so glib, so &quot;in&quot;, so knowing,
so -- David Letterman-ish. Never mind that <i>Scream</i> tried to create scares by the
very same things that it purported to be satirizing.</p>

<p><img src="images/rurban-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="150">The main
differences between <i>Urban Legend</i> and a movie like <i>Terror Train</i>, made to
capitalize on the success of <i>Friday the 13th</i>, is that the sexual talk is a little
trashier, the young characters a little more flip almost to the point of annoyance, and
the music &quot;stings&quot; are much louder in Digital Stereo. The soundtrack is
absolutely up-to-date: one can hear a New Swing song by the Cherry Poppin' Daddies being
played in the frat house party scene. Cultural icons make strategic appearances: Brad
Dorif puts in a cameo appearance; Robert Englund, successfully making the transition into
character roles, plays a college professor; John Neville, one of the Quorum of Dark Men in
<i>The X Files</i>, plays the college dean (No wonder they're having trouble on campus).
Fortunately, Loretta Devine is the campus security cop (and apparently, during the
climatic scenes, the <i>only</i> campus cop), whose role model is Pam Grier in <i>Coffy</i>.</p>

<p>Otherwise, much has stayed the same. The girls fall into various categories of
babe-a-rific, with appropriately matching hair colors, and the heroine is a
virginal-looking type who, it turns out, has a Dreadful Secret in her past. As for the
guys, there's a &quot;frosh&quot; with white hair, a creep with darker hair, and a
reporter for the campus newspaper who is played by Jared Leto, his jet-black hair cut
short and his face bearing that Sensitive Type look. The killings turn out to have
something to do with a massacre that occurred 25 years ago in a campus dormitory building
that is abandoned for some reason has not been torn-down (Guess where the climax occurs,
and, no, it's not at McDonalds). The heroine goes about trying to alert people that
Something is Going On, but is either dismissed or otherwise proves to be highly
ineffectual, at least as far as keeping her friends from being iced. She is, of course,
the last one to face having terrible things done to her, but not before the killer,
identity exposed, says with sparkling wit, &quot;Yeah, I guess you can say I'm --
'nutty&#146;!&quot; After which -- harooph! -- said villain is given a dispatching which,
at least from the film's viewpoint, is supposed to be suitable.</p>

<p><img src="images/rurban-2.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="left" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">The girls cower and
run and cower in dark hallways, and you're always wondering why they never think to use a
well-aimed elbow toward the solar plexus. But while the film is formulaic, I'm guessing
that's exactly what draws people to these movies, just as people were essentially drawn to
the Andy Hardy and Abbott and Costello and Seventies disaster movies in the past: they
know exactly what to expect, so they can turn their heads off for an hour or so and just
watch, and the filmmakers, perfectly knowing this, give them exactly what they expect,
using all the clichés they're expected to use, cordially telegraphing every plot turn and
twist and wrapping it all up in a much more neater package than <i>Friday the 13th</i> was
delivered in (Some of the cinematography, here, by James Chressanthis, is particularly
good). Thus: the comforts of a formula along with the vicarious enjoyment of murder and
mayhem.</p>

<p>What is surprising, though, is that, even though people are being throttled and
garroted, there's not really not a whole lot of violence on-screen. Like sex, violence, or
at least the messy type, seems to be disappearing from mainstream commercial movies. The
altruistic may want to head to the lobby when the microwave oven scene comes on, but there
turns out to be nothing to worry about, because you don't really see anything. The camera
jumps-back and averts its gaze before the audience even has to.</p>

<p><img src="images/rurban-3.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">As for <i>Urban
Legend</i> itself, it's not a masterpiece, but, I've seen worse, this year (I'm still
recovering from the deadliness of Harry Connick, Jr.'s scenes in <a href="rhope.html" target="_top"><i>Hope
Floats</i></a>). Alicia Witt, as plucky Natalie, comports herself well enough. But it's
Rebecca Gayheart, as Natalie's friend Brenda, who contributes the performance that most
sticks in your mind afterwards. Her face framed by auburn hair that seems to swirl at
times, her character both warm and forthrightly appealing, yet alluring and glittering
with all sorts of unexplored, or unrevealed, potentials underneath. And the director,
Jamie Blanks, and screenwriter, Silvio Horta, come up with a twist ending that doesn't
disappoint. But the movie's gonna play exactly the way the filmmakers, and the studio,
want it to, no matter what anyone has to say about it: it'll make bucks at the box office
during the opening weekend, maybe the one after that, too, before it's shuttled off to
bargain houses as the Fall movies open, then cable and video, where people can invite
their friends over, watch it with some beverages, some pizzas, and lots of popcorn, and
enjoy it as much as they want.</p>
