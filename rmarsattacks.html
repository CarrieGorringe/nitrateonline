television will soon come to realize, the solution is just too wickedly good to give away
on any level. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Based upon a set of 1960s trading cards of the same name, <i>Mars
Attacks!</i> owes a considerable degree of debt to Kubrick&#146;s master satire on
xenophobia, <i>Dr. Strangelove</i>, not only in terms of characterization, but also in
terms of sensibility. There are, however, several problems with this type of wholesale
borrowing, foremost among them an appalling sense that <i>Mars Attacks!</i> suffers from a
bad case of anachronism that is not only creeping, but terminal. It&#146;s questionable
whether or not the concept of sudden annihilation from above is topical enough to evoke
the magical mixture of both laughter and fear generated by <i>Strangelove</i> (unless you
believe in little green men who plan to abduct you for your DNA sample); <i>Mars Attacks!</i>
might have stood a better chance if the aliens had landed in Russia and made off with
several pounds of plutonium -- a much more likely and far scarier prospect in the
contemporary world. Moreover, Kubrick&#146;s satire was built, as is all effective satire,
upon a strong base of character devolution; the audience watched as the paranoid Ripper
and the pompous Turgidson, among others, were stripped of what little dignity they were
permitted to hold, and rendered completely cretinous and scary. Unfortunately<i>, Mars
Attacks!</i> doesn&#146;t even allow for this development to occur; its characters start
out as nasty clichés, and consequently their behavior (and the film) can&#146;t get
anywhere from there. This may also be a side-effect of the anachronistic plot; it&#146;s
difficult for modern audiences to believe in public officials possessing any sanctity, and
that might be the most terrifying aspect of the film. All of the performances are
excellent (standouts include Brosnan as the sanctimonious Kessler and Bening as a
recovering alcoholic turned New-Age dipstick), but there&#146;s a severe disconnectiveness
between them and the film in which they appear; they&#146;re hitting their marks, but the
film isn&#146;t. Nevertheless, all is not lost, because the audience still has Tom Jones
available for a post-apocalyptic reprise of <i>It&#146;s Not Unusual</i>. Tom Jones as the
repository of Western culture: now,<i> that&#146;s</i> really scary. </font></p>
