<p></font><strong><font size="5">T</font></strong><font size="4">he brilliant fall foliage
of folksy Gravestown provides a lovely opening for this well meaning but fatally flawed
drama of New England small town prejudice and hidden relationships. Unfortunately, <i>Simon
Birch&#146;s</i> bark shrivels under the weight of its two-hour length and dramatically
under-developed script. Had it been a half-hour shorter than its nearly two hour length
and more emotionally seeded in its story than its characters, writer and rookie director

Yes, <i>The Starr Report</i>. You&#146;re downloading it, overloading the internet over
it, reading it, and watching television specials about it. Heck, I wonder if anyone&#146;s
been going to the movies lately. Which has nothing to do with why <i>Simon Birch</i>
didn&#146;t work for me, but adds another reason why <i>Simon Birch</i> probably
won&#146;t make it out of the box office gate.</font></p>

<p><img src="images/rsimon-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">Johnson, who penned
<i>Grumpy Old Men</i> and its sequel, graduates to a piece (truncated in spades from John
Irving&#146;s <i>Prayer for Owen Meany</i>) squarely resting on two individuals
generations younger than the stars of his earlier efforts. And while these two kids give
it the ole Sunday school try, they&#146;re placed in a void of a thirty-something
flash-back screenplay that punctures any possible tension in the screenplay by telling us
(through a cloying voice-over by a non-comedic Jim Carrey as one of these stars many years
later) two key plot developments at the film&#146;s opening.</p>

<p>This slow moving tale centers on the friendship of one simple Simon (Ian Michael
Smith), a pint-sized pre-teen with a big heart and grand intentions, and his best friend,
the bright Joe Wenteworth (<i>Jurassic Park</i>&#146;s Joseph Mazzello), a son born out of
wedlock to an earth-goddess mother (<i>Kiss the Girls&#146; </i>Ashley Judd). Her refusal
to reveal the identity of Joe&#146;s father in 1960s America would suggest her being
branded an outcast, but her immaculate honesty and stunning beauty instead merit worship
by many of the town&#146;s male population, especially the diminutive Simon. Go figure.
Smith, a truly gifted non-actor, has most of the best moments in the film and shows a
genuine gusto in tackling the role of one of life&#146;s &quot;peculiar little
disappointments.&quot;</p>

<p><img src="images/rsimon-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="133" HEIGHT="200">When a foul ball hit
by Simon removes Rebecca Wenteworth from the picture, the film begins to further deflate.
The boys embark on a stealth quest in search of Joe&#146;s dad, while Simon continues his
nagging and endless commentary on his heroic destiny. Sprinkled about their playing field
are a handful of talented actors in search of a script. Jan Hooks is the autocratic Agnes
Leavey, a prissy bible-belt teacher who gets a hellish comeuppance courtesy of &quot;Baby
Jesus&quot; Simon&#146;s sudden infatuation with a fellow schoolmate&#146;s budding
bustline at the Christmas Pageant. (I guess even martyrs-to-be are human.) Oliver Platt (<i>Funny
Bones</i>, <a href="rbulworth.html" target="_top"><i>Bulworth</i></a>) is local drama teacher Ben
Goodrich, a intrepid suitor of Rebecca&#146;s affections who befriends the boys with a
stuffed armadillo and a plateful of peas, then later offers heartfelt homilies as
pseudo-dad/cheerleader to the youngsters in lieu of proper instruction from Rebecca or the
local priest, acceleratingly morose Reverend Russell (David Straithairn).</p>

<p>Of course, the discovery of Joe&#146;s dad&#146;s identity and saintly Simon&#146;s
&quot;I-told-you-so&quot; heroics bring the film crashing to its icy saccharine
conclusion. And it&#146;s definitely several tear-inducing moments overdue&#133;for me and
probably for you. Hey, if you want a sugar fix, go buy a milkshake. Geez, guess I really
am just a grumpy old man.</p>
