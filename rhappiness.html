<p><big><strong><big>I</big></strong>n Todd Solondz&#146;s latest satirical look into the
root cellar of American culture he leaves the adolescent cruelty of the <a href="fsiff96-5.html#Welcome-to-the-Dollhouse" target="_top"><em>Welcome to the Dollhouse</em></a>
junior high school setting for the even nastier, more corrupt adult world of&#133; New
Jersey. Yeah, ha ha. Easy target, like much of Solondz&#146;s glib slice of old fashioned
American misanthropy. Solondz piles on the taboos and lampoons them with assured comic
lobs. There&#146;s no denying it&#146;s funny, but at what cost? <em>Happiness</em> is an
assured, slick study in loneliness and urban alienation, slathered with irony and
sparkling with heartbreaking moments of connection, and perhaps that&#146;s the problem.
For a few brief scenes Solondz touches the souls of his characters and loves them. For the
rest of the film they&#146;re merely stooges for his intellectual slapstick.</big></p>

<p><img src="images/rhappiness-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="130">Solondz centers
his universe around the lives of three sisters. Joy (Jane Adams), a 30 year old would-be
folk singer and walking liberal cliché whose narrative purpose appears to be to embody
the adage &quot;No good deed goes unpunished,&quot; maintains a drippy optimism in the
face of heartbreak and abuse. Trish (Cynthia Stevenson) is a blithely insulting, shallow
housewife living the suburban dream and Helen (Lara Flynn Boyle) an egotistical,
self-centered poet with a glamorous (but equally shallow) lifestyle and imperious
pretentiousness even she recognizes as completely phony. Revolving around this little
galaxy are Helen&#146;s lonely neighbors Allen (Phillip Seymour Hoffman in one of the
film&#146;s standout performances), who acts out his sexual yearnings for Helen in obscene
phone calls (which, naturally, turn her on), and Kristina (Camryn Manheim), an overweight
lonely-heart who pines for Allen and harbors her own secrets. </p>

<p>Meanwhile their parents (Louise Lasser and Ben Gazzara) live a barely civil existence
in a modern retirement community in Florida while their neighbor Diane (Elizabeth Ashley)
puts the moves on Gazzara. And then there&#146;s Trish&#146;s family, the seemingly
sitcom-perfect brood. Bill (Dylan Baker) is a successful psychiatrist and loving,
attentive father haunted by violent dreams (it&#146;s hard to call them nightmares because
he wakes up feeling happy) and a crippling sexual perversion. You see, he likes little
boys, and when he sees the boy of dreams (shot in the same gauzy slow motion manner you
get in love stories, complete with the romantic strains of violins) he plots his
&quot;seduction,&quot; a child molestation engineered with the precision and timing of a
Tarantino movie heist. In Solondz&#146;s little universe, he&#146;s the most sympathetic
adult character.</p>

<p><img src="images/rhappiness-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="126">Okay, it&#146;s
not really that simple. Solondz gives Bill a depth lacking in his other adult characters.
Throughout the picture Bill&#146;s adolescent son Billy comes to him for that old
father-son talk about sex, and Bill takes him aside for a very frank and sincere
discussion of things that would normally send an audience giggling in discomfort (and for
all I know will regardless). But Dylan Baker&#146;s thoughtful delivery, his gentle eyes
and soothing voice create a caring father of Bill. And that&#146;s what makes his violent
transgressions (thankfully off screen) so much more profoundly troubling. It&#146;s the
character that&#146;ll have every viewer talking and every critic arguing, but for all
it&#146;s calculating controversy it remains the painfully moving heart of the film.</p>

<p>The rest of the cast become cartoon figures in a social landscape Solondz creates in
masterful detail. He keeps the camera restrained, just this side of intimacy so we
don&#146;t get too close, and constructs an urban/suburban world just right enough in the
details to suggest the real world and the bland homogeneity of TV at the same time. But he
doesn&#146;t trust his audience enough to let it stand at that -- the soundtrack is an all
too obvious construction of glibly ironic music: lushly romantic swells, jazz-lite, bouncy
latin rhythms, chirpy feel good music, strings and glockenspiel muzak, and syrupy pop
songs by Barry Manilow and Air Supply. It&#146;s like a constant dig in the ribs -- I get
it already!</p>

<p>The irony between Bill&#146;s powerful, honest relationship with his son and his
monstrous pedophilia may be calculated but it&#146;s also moving and real -- when Billy
bravely confronts his father about it, and Bill answers with naked, pained honesty. I can
think of few films that reach that depth of empathy with anyone, let alone a figure we
normally see treated with utter contempt. Bill is self aware, perhaps the only character
who really understands himself -- he knows he&#146;s sick and Solondz offers us the
complicated duality of a man who hates the monster inside him while embracing the emotions
such actions bring.</p>

<p>Similarly, Solondz offers a few moments of solace to Allen and Kristina, a tender dance
in a smoky bar, a night spent in quiet embrace, a sweet sample of non-coital love. Philip
Seymor Hoffman&#146;s nervous nerd is as self aware as Baker&#146;s Bill, but that
doesn&#146;t end his yearnings or his lust, he just channels them into solitary moments of
fevered self gratification (which Solondz spices with an uncomfortably, hilariously
outrageous spurt of bodily fluids). In these scenes Solondz&#146;s craft and craftiness
come together to create complex portraits in modern alienation. If we can&#146;t exactly
identify with them, at least we get a peak into their soul. Allen may be pathetic, but
it&#146;s a pathos we can understand.</p>

<p><img src="images/rhappiness-3.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" WIDTH="200" HEIGHT="130">That makes
Solondz&#146;s seeming contempt for the rest of his cast harder to fathom. The three
sisters seem hardly worth feeling for: Trish and Helen can hardly see past their own
plastic self images and Joy, heaped with scorn by all she meets, is played for easy laughs
as if Solondz figures she deserves it for her chirpy optimism. And so it goes for the rest
of the cast. It&#146;s no so much that their lives are miserable, blind, shallow, and
desperate, but that Solondz seems to agree and makes that the joke. That&#146;s the
calculation I can&#146;t stand.</p>

<p><em>Happiness</em> is funny -- at times blackly, hilariously funny -- but the way
constructs his characters as figures of ridicule becomes too wearing by the time the film
ends. In <em>Welcome To the Dollhouse</em>, Solondz had everyone laughing in recognition
of the cruelty of adolescence, but he never gave up on his lead. She could be pathetic,
clueless, victimized, made fun of, and even find someone lower on the pecking order and
become a bully herself, but we never lost touch with her feelings -- she was real and she
maintained her dignity throughout. In <em>Happiness</em>, but for a few beautiful scenes,
Solondz has let the dignity go and ends up with a sitcom from hell. It&#146;s funny, but
at whose expense?</p>
