<p><big><strong><big>T</big></strong>he first truly outstanding major American film of the
year. And it's directed by an Australian. And by the time it's released here, it will have
already opened in Finland (March 13th) and France (April 22nd). C'est la vie. Ah, the
wonderful world of global film marketing. The film was actually ready late last year, but
Paramount opted for a half-year delay to gear up its promotion machine. That aside, for
those of you expecting another explosively wacky Jim Carrey piece, forget it. You won't
find Ace Ventura here. Or Stanley Ipkiss a.k.a. <i>The Mask</i>. Taming of the maniacal
beast fell to director Peter Weir, who performed a similar circus feat with Robin Williams
in <i>Dead Poet's Society</i> nearly a decade ago.</big></p>

<p>This infectiously subdued and brightly-lit comedy features Carrey again involved with
the television industry, but not as the darkly drawn (and abysmally bad) Chip Douglas from
<i>The Cable Guy</i>. His Truman Burbank is Carrey as Everyman, a colorful character lost
in a Disneyesque gingerbread landscape. Be warned right now! Don't take any pretensions in
with you when you see this film. Let it flow over you like hot chocolate on a three-scoop
ice cream sundae. Sure, sprinkle on some nuts &#150; heck it is a comedy. Yummy!</p>

<p><img src="images/rtrumanshow-1.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" WIDTH="226" HEIGHT="168">Truman's the
star of a 24-hour, 365-day-a-year soap opera, his true life story (as he sees it, at
least) constantly playing out against a phenomenally huge global, over-captive audience.
But Truman gets no residuals, nor gains from the billions in licensing fees for the dolls,
pillows, and t-shirts (&quot;Love Him. Protect Him.&quot;) promoting his image, because
the amiable but clueless insurance agent lives a lie. And oh what a big lie it is! Unknown
to Truman, his community (the serenely bucolic Sea Haven), as well as his family, friends,
and co-workers (actually everyone) are all a ruse in the life of the ordinary existence of
the 29-year-old who is the centerpiece of one of Tinsel Town's biggest and longest-running
gambles of all time. No, not the <a href="ftitanic.html" target="_top"><i>Titanic</i></a>. Bigger. <b>Much
Bigger</b>. Since Truman happens to be the first child ever adopted by a business, the
OmniCam Corporation has made him the unwitting subject of the most popular television show
of all time.</p>

<p>Sounds like one wild and crazy screenplay? Doesn't sound like it can work on the big
screen? Yes it is and yes it can. Andrew Niccol created this rock-solid piece, his second
produced script after the weakly-received <a href="rgattaca.html" target="_top"><i>Gattaca</i></a> last
year. <img src="images/rtrumanshow-2.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="left" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="168">It is
director Peter Weir that deserves the kuddos for creating this fantasy work, seemingly
Hollywood's biggest set (a large techno-bio bubble overlooking the L.A. cityside). It does
work, marvelously. Weir has a great knack for handling actors well, bringing out
subtleties that other directors would miss. To name a few: Jeff Bridge's Max Klein and
Rosie Perez's Academy Award-nominated performance as Carla Rodrigo in <i>Fearless</i>
(1993), Weir's last effort. Robin Williams (again, an Oscar nomination) in <i>Dead Poet's
Society</i>. Linda Hunt's Oscar-winning performance in the male role Billy Kwan in <i>The
Year of Living Dangerously</i> (1983). Weir himself has been nominated thrice by the
Academy (<i>Green Card</i> for writing, <i>Dead Poets</i> and <i>Witness</i> for
direction). <i>Truman</i> might be his ticket to a well-deserved golden statuette come
next March.</p>

<p><img src="images/rtrumanshow-3.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="168">So what is <i>The
Truman Show</i> like? It's a second cousin to the highly original late 1960s television
series <i>The Prisoner</i> with a light dose of Sartre's <i>No Exit</i> and a few Luis
Bunuel films for good measure. Beyond that, you'll have to experience it firsthand. The
manipulation of Truman falls under the singular direction (as it has since just after the
lad's conception) of Christof (Ed Harris), a megalomediac who plays god to all that
surrounds Truman. He controls 5,000 hidden cameras (including masked-edge button cams)
that track Truman's daily routine. He rolls away the darkness before the light and the
light before the darkness, not to mention programming excessively localized weather. He
spoon-feeds lines to Truman's synthetic wife Meryl (Laura Linney) and his &quot;best
friend&quot; Marlon (Noah Emmerich). All this produces a show with ratings off the Richter
scale, which allows for the omnipresent corporation to deliver an abundant and unabashed
display of product placements and commercial endorsements in every scene.</p>

<p>Yes, it's a perfect world. Too perfect. Like Chicken Little, Truman's sky begins to
fall (in the form of a broken stage light) and he begins to sense that something's not
right in the state of Sea Haven. His car radio accidentally picks up set blocking
instructions. He inadvertently spots extras relaxing between &quot;takes.&quot; The entire
&quot;cast&quot; goes into a tailspin as Truman strays from his &quot;script.&quot;
Between the 10909th and 10913th day of his life, the protagonist's attempts to escape his
confused state are met with bold and ultimately wrathful counter-measures by Christof
(traffic jams, forest fire, nuclear power station leaks, hurricane). The media follows his
every step, misreporting some key events that send the program's sponsors into a tizzy.
But just when you think all is lost, the skies clear and hope beckons, not only for our
star, but for the entire glassy-eyed world. Here is a provocative and profound film that
deserves your undivided attention. Don't change the channel.</p>
