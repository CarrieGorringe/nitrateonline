<p><big><strong><big>T</big></strong>his first comedy release and third overall from the
wunderkings Spielberg-Katzenberg-Geffen (following their actioner <a href="rpeacemaker.html" target="_top"><i>The Peacemaker</i></a> earlier this year and day-and-dating
with Spielberg's Oscar-aimed <a href="ramistad.html" target="_top"><i>Amistad</i></a>) is a serviceable
and somewhat above-grade effort that benefits from the talents of its cast, particularly
stars Nathan Lane and Lee Evans. Modestly budgeted at $38 million, this <i>Home Alone</i>
clone is genetically spliced with childhood memories of <i>Tom and Jerry</i>,
recollections of the decaying mansion sets of <a href="rjumanji.html" target="_top"><i>Jumanji</i></a>
and <i>The Addams Family</i>, and further stirred with the drabness of <i>Blade Runner</i>
(on which Mouse's production designer Linda DeScenna worked). Coincidentally, screenwriter
Adam Rifkin's current project is <i>Jumanji 2</i>. Much of the above-line crew associated
with this film &quot;borrow&quot; from other movies on which they were connected.
Realizing its derivative nature, the Dreamworks Pictures marketing department has
highlighted pull quotes that place the film in the same class as its higher-grossing
cousins, with WNBC-TV's Jeffrey Lyons' &quot;It's <i>Home Alone</i> Meets <i>Babe</i>&quot;
being placing high in pre-release newsprint ads. I suspect this low-key push will continue
to snowball through holiday season promotion blitz. Stay tuned.</big></p>

<p><img src="images/rmousehunt-1.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">The funeral of
irascible string meister Rudolph Smuntz (&quot;A world without string is chaos&quot;)
opens the film, a fitting tribute to the late William Hickey, best known as the Mafia don
in Prizzi's Honor, and whose raspy voice could make gravel curdle. The Brooklyn-born
Hickey is catapulted out of his casket and down an open sewer manhole in a pre-credit
sequence that pays homage to suspense meister Alfred Hitchcock (recalling his umbrella
sequence in Foreign Correspondent). Hickey, who died in late June from complications of
emphysema and bronchitis, reappears throughout the film in an oil-based canvas as the
family patriarch, his facial expressions ever changing based on the dimwitted shenanigans
of his sons. </p>

<p>Mouse Alone, er, <i>Mouse Hunt</i> is the story of the hapless brothers Smuntz. Ernie
(Lane) is a pompous, self-inflating celebrity wannabe who would dump the family business
into the greedy hands of a mob-controlled conglomerate. Lars (Evans) is a quiet,
financially-challenged, henpecked mensch who is dedicated to carrying on the family's
investment against the changing times. These siblings' antics portend a bleak future for
string. Eccentric dad left his factory to his kids, but Ernie would rather spend time as
the pseudo-French chef at a trendy niterie. His luminary status collapses when a cockroach
hidden in a box of Cuban cigars (part of his inheritance) causes the death of the mayor
while patronizing the restaurant. Lars, meanwhile, is kicked out of his home by wife April
(Vicki Lewis) and the two siblings commiserate at a local diner before taking up residence
in a crumbling, old mansion that is willed them by their father, as the soundtrack
counterpoints with the Bing Crosby holiday favorite &quot;I'll Be Home for
Christmas.&quot;</p>

<p><img src="images/rmousehunt-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">When they learn
their dilapidated domicile is the lost masterpiece of an architectural genius (&quot;A
committed architect before his committal&quot;), their effort to unload the house at a
planned auction is complicated by a rodent problem. Enter, stage right, the mouse. As a
former New Yorker, I know that rats and their little cousins always come in bunches (just
like grapes!). While the movie parlays the many attempts Ernie and Lars to rid their
goldmine of its single other occupant, I kept wondering how this little orphan came to be
living all by itself. A lonely life indeed. And certainly the immense home is big enough
for all three of them to live in peacefully (and prevent the apocalyptic demise of the
structure), but then we wouldn't have a movie without some conflict in it, eh? Sorry about
these small asides &#150; my mind works that way and undoubtedly the creators decided
these small oversights weren't important. (Don't take my comments too seriously. You'll
probably enjoy the movie if you go in with an &quot;anything goes&quot; attitude.)</p>

<p>Using a combination of 60 real mice, animatronics, and computer-generated images (kudos
to effects wizards Stan Winston and Charles Gibson, and animal trainer Boone Narr),<img src="images/rmousehunt-3.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150"> the title star eludes
capture and certain death at the hands of the harried homeowners, who connive numerous
methods of extinction. Of course, the mouse, a brainy fellow to say the least, proves a
much better opponent. Be it against &quot;Catzilla,&quot; a mammoth and fierce beast
brought in from the city pound for brief dismissal by its diminutive adversary. Or against
Christopher Walken as a techno-exterminator (&quot;You have to think like a mouse and get
in their minds.&quot;), who gets bludgeoned and dragged through the bowels of the house.
There is lots of physical comedy and sight gags throughout the film, much of it from the
mouse's point-of-view. I wonder if Dreamworks plans on registering the rodent-cam&#153;
method of filmmaking used extensively in this production. Thankfully, the ending is a
crowd-pleaser.</p>

<p>Nathan Lane, most recently seen in <a href="rbcage.html" target="_top"><i>The Birdcage</i></a>, will
gain a wider audience as viewers realize his comedic talents. Personally, I'm elated that
Lee Evans finally gets a co-starring role. His debut in <i>Funny Bones</i> (1995) was a
side-splitter as he had me rolling in the aisles. His brand of verbal and physical comedy
is not fully realized here in Mouse Hunt, but there are glimpses and these are choice
moments for this British-born performer.</p>

<p>Director Gore Verbinski has successfully graduated from the Budweiser frogs and the
Nike 100 Foot Hoop commercials to arch-Disney mouse feature. The fact that the film feels
like a John Hughes production is probably due to producer Alan Riche, the former president
and C.O.O. of Hughes Entertainment and responsible for <i>Dennis the Menace</i>. And yes
there are &quot;in&quot; jokes taking on the Eisner kingdom and <i>The Lion King</i> in
particular (Lane being the voice of Timon in that blockbuster masterpiece).</p>
