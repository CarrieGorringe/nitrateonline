<meta name="description" content="U.S. Marshalls - This technically efficient spin-off of The Fugitive is a mind-boggling letdown.

Combining set pieces and plotlines from ConAir (crash landing a convict airliner), The Peacemaker (foot-chasing around the U.N. headquarters in New York), and any Tarzan film (vine swinging ? you?ve seen this one in the trailer), the action sequences are fine in their surgical precision, but the storyline lacks the excitement of its predecessor. The original escapee was a scared Dr. Richard Kimball (Harrison Ford), convincingly intelligent enough to search out his brutally murdered wife?s killer in the 1993 thriller. Wrongfully accused Mark Roberts (Wesley Snipes) is nowhere near as genuinely concerned for his well-being. He?s an emotionless &quot;secret government operative&quot; ? i.e. urban Rambo ? who obviously knows how to go head-to-head against the best federal agents and foreign spies. Swiss actress Irene Jacob (The Double Life of Veronique, Red) is wasted as Roberts? love interest, who, when not serving capucchio at Starbucks, obediently rushes pell mell to New York to shop at Saks.">

<p><big><strong><big>T</big></strong>his technically efficient spin-off of The Fugitive is
a mind-boggling letdown. Former editor Stuart Baird directs his second feature after his
1996 debut (Executive Decision) in paint-by-number fashion. Chase, cover-up crash, chase,
cover-up, jump, chase. Combining set pieces and plotlines from ConAir (crash landing a
convict airliner), The Peacemaker (foot-chasing around the U.N. headquarters in New York),
and any Tarzan film (vine swinging &#150; you&#146;ve seen this one in the trailer), the
action sequences are fine in their surgical precision, but the storyline lacks the
excitement of its predecessor. The original escapee was a scared Dr. Richard Kimball
(Harrison Ford), convincingly intelligent enough to search out his brutally murdered
wife&#146;s killer in the 1993 thriller. Wrongfully accused Mark Roberts (Wesley Snipes)
is nowhere near as genuinely concerned for his well-being. He&#146;s an emotionless
&quot;secret government operative&quot; &#150; i.e. urban Rambo &#150; who obviously knows
how to go head-to-head against the best federal agents and foreign spies. Swiss actress
Irene Jacob (The Double Life of Veronique, Red) is wasted as Roberts&#146; love interest,
who, when not serving capucchio at Starbucks, obediently rushes pell mell to New York to
shop at Saks.</big></p>

<p><img src="images/rusmarshals-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="100">There are lots
of small gaps in continuity and a big one large enough to drive a tank through. This
faux-pas occurs about two-thirds of the way through the over two-hour film, when one of
the underlings of Chief Deputy U.S. Marshal Sam Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) is critically
wounded by one of two men. As Gerard purposefully was not killed earlier by one of the
combatants, it doesn&#146;t take a screenwriting genius to figure out who the shooter is
and what Sam&#146;s reaction should be. I kept shaking my head in disbelief while the
movie dragged on for another 30 minutes, through a shoot-out on a freighter and an
unimaginative double-cross sequence in Roberts&#146; hospital room. Guess I should have
expected something like this as the film is being released by Warner Bros., their market
share continuing to plummet from a steady stream of boxoffice losers. Producers Arnold and
Anne Kopelson have been key characters in perpetuating WB&#146;s fall from grace with such
bombs as <a href="rmadcity.html" target="_top"><i>Mad City</i></a>, <i>Devil&#146;s Advocate</i>, and <i>Murder
at 1600</i>.</p>

<p>There will be no Oscar nominations here, either (<i>The Fugitive</i> garnered seven).
Jones, who won for Best Supporting Actor, first appears as a costumed Chiko-Rama
yellow-tighted chicken mascot during a stakeout that sets up his bad boy problem with
authority (read Dirty Harry). He spends the rest of the movie trying to wipe the egg off
his face and find the real culprits (read Dirty Harry, again). Jones is one of
American&#146;s great leading men, but I can hear the change purse jingling off to the
side of the camera as the producers begged him to appear in this lesser effort. It&#146;s
a polished role, but not one as worthy as his best (in <i>Coal Miner&#146;s Daughter</i>, <i>JFK</i>,
and <a href="rmib.html" target="_top"><i>Men in Black</i></a> on film and in <i>The Executioner&#146;s
Song</i> and <i>Lonesome Dove</i> on TV).</p>

<p><img src="images/rusmarshals-2.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="left" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="150">When the
reluctant Gerard is forced to baby-sit a doomed flight transporting a bevy of social
misfits in the unfriendly skies departing the windy city, he realizes the occupant of seat
10D (Snipes) isn&#146;t Passenger 57. In the aftermath following the plane&#146;s
spectacular crash when an assassination attempt against Roberts goes awry, ruthless and
annoying Federal Agent John Royce (Robert Downey, Jr.) is assigned to help the marshals
track down the skillfully evasive Roberts. Gerard, aware that Roberts&#146; past is masked
in secrecy but not so sure he is responsible for the murder of two diplomatic Secret
Service attaches in the Big Apple, quickly realizes Royce and Roberts are cut from the
same government mold and that mold smells rotten. It boils down to bad eggs at the U.S.
Mission to the United Nations and some corrupt Chinese diplomats. Screenwriter John Pogue
throws in everything but the kitchen sink. While the production notes lead off that he
&quot;is considered one of Hollywood&#146;s most successful unproduced
screenwriters,&quot; I suspect he may soon be one of the most unsuccessful produced
screenwriters.</p>
