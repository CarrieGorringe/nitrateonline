adaptation of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, with L.A. street gangs waxing too poetically with
the Bard&#146;s dialogue transplanted verbatim, this version of <i>Great Expectations</i>
is thoroughly modern, and almost entirely laudable in its aims and achievements.</big></p>

<p>The scene of the would-be crime has been shifted from Victorian London to the lush
tropicality of Florida, in a decaying Southern plantation named Paradiso Perduto (the
setting and tone resemble nothing so much as a setting from one of Robert Aldrich&#146;s
1960s mad-woman melodramas &#150; <i>Hush, Hush, Sweet Charlotte</i> immediately comes to
mind and/or Tennessee Williams gone to seed). <img src="images/rgreatexp-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="122" HEIGHT="150">Within the gates of this lost paradise, the
embittered Ms. Dinsmoor plays cha-cha records, swills martinis by the pitcherful and fumes
over her missed opportunity to disengage herself from her virginity some fifteen years
earlier (at age forty-two!) in a manner befitting a good Southern girl (i.e., in the
marriage bed). With the loss of her &quot;gentleman caller,&quot; Dinsmoor has, she
believes, learned the bitter truth about dependence upon the kindness of strangers. The
grown-up Estella (Paltrow) is Dinsmoor&#146;s ticket to revenge upon the entire male sex;
through the entrapment of Finn (Hawke), Dinsmoor wants another to feel her pain. Finn
nearly fulfils Dinsmoor&#146;s destiny for him, except for one little incident beyond her
control: prior to encountering the malevolently distaff atmosphere at Paradiso Perduto,
Finn gave assistance to an escaped convict named Lustig (De Niro). At the point of
Finn&#146;s deepest despair, a lawyer appears, promising the talented young artist a
chance to have his own one-man show in New York. His guardian, Joe (Cooper), encourages
him to take the opportunity. Just as Finn is beginning to get back on his feet, in sails
the spiteful Estella, clad in skintight Donna Karan, who toys with him over whether or not
she should marry another man. Then Lustig reappears to deliver more revelations to him,
and it&#146;s difficult to tell which apparition from the past is more unwelcome.</p>

<p><img src="images/rgreatexp-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="150">This film is
nothing if not psychological territory scraped raw over and over again, and the scraping
is done with such self-assurance at all levels that it&#146;s a delight to watch for those
in the mood for a good, old-fashioned, emotional wallow. By no means is it <i>Brief
Encounter</i> on steroids, but it does provide a reasonable enough facsimile of such an
approach. Curaron provides <i>Great Expectations</i> with a sumptuously corrupt feel;
it&#146;s like watching an overripe peach on the verge of rotting. The performances, by
and large, supplement this overall atmosphere. Paltrow has the elusive mix of come-hither
glances and psychological armor down pat. Hawke lifts the specter of the tormented,
love-obsessed artist above the level of cliché. De Niro infuses Lustig with a great deal
of vulnerability and tenderness, especially in the later scenes; it is the most likeable
and layered performance he has given in some time. <img src="images/rgreatexp-3.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" WIDTH="87" HEIGHT="150">Even Bancroft pulls off her late Bette-Davis
posturing by giving it far more oily charm and less overblown emotional amplitude than the
prototype ever did. The overall effect provided by the film is one of an almost-sensual
beguilement, beginning with an incandescent, unreal visual style, filled with mysterious
shadowing and diffused lighting that nevertheless glows with an unabashedly decadent feel
(even the darkest of rooms featured seem to shimmer more than perhaps might be thought
decent). The film slinks confidently through its paces, like a femme fatale with a
strategically-bared shoulder, daring you to think your worst. If there is one false note
about the film, it may stem from the negligence displayed by Curaron and Glazer in
omitting the novel&#146;s revelations concerning the relationship between the convict and
Estella (he was her biological father); the preservation of it might have injected a
somewhat greater sense of irony and loss to overcome some of the stasis into which the
film falls in its final scenes. Despite that one potential flaw, <i>Great Expectations</i>
does indeed live up to its own title.</p>
