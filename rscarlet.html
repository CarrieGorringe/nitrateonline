<p><font size="5"><strong>T</strong></font><font size="4">here is a disease that tends to
affect second-rate actors who achieve sudden and monumental fame, particularly if that
fame lasts longer than the aphorisitically-alloted fifteen minutes. After obtaining the
fabulous salaries and right-of-first-or-at-least-second-script-refusal characteristic of

they want R-E-S-P-E-C-T, to coin a phrase. These actors become convinced that
&quot;culture&quot; with a capital &quot;C&quot; is the missing link in their careers. So
they find themselves a literary &quot;classic&quot; and attempt to put their acting
imprimatur upon it, envisioning themselves as the next John Barrymore. Unfortunately, the
results more often than not owe more to Drew's style of acting than to John's, for the
very good reason that the relationship between the elegance and relevance of the work that
they seek to interpret and their own abilities belong most definitely to that species of
proportional relationships known as the inverse. Harry Zimm (he of <em>Get Shorty</em>)
summed up this mindset of the hyper-egotistical and hypo-talented most succinctly:
&quot;He's the same schmuck who made it on his tight pants and capped teeth, but now all
of a sudden he knows everything there is about making pictures.&quot;</font></p>

<p>Substitute the obvious change in pronoun and &quot;controversial photo-spreads in
'Vanity Fair'&quot; for &quot;tight pants and capped teeth&quot; and you have Demi Moore
and her latest dilemma, the movie adaptation of <em>The Scarlet Letter</em>. The novel is
indeed an unqualified classic, by American or any other standards. It addresses issues of
group cohesiveness as a survival tactic and how much personal freedom can be permitted in
the face of potential group annihilation by forces acting both from without and within. In
the center of this debate, Hawthorne places one Hester Prynne, a woman who has given birth
to a child which is not her husband's, but has been fathered by the local minister, a man
whose piety and reputation has been deemed by his community to be beyond reproach. As
punishment not only for her sin of adultery but also, and more specifically, her refusal
to name her co-transgressor, Hester is made to wear a scarlet letter, denoting her status
as an adulteress. For modern audiences, the notion that violating the seventh commandment
is the equivalent of endangering the community at large might strike some as being a
rather quaint notion. But, as cultural historian Leo Marx has rightfully indicated, the
landscape in which Hawthorne's Puritans found themselves, now part of the state of
Massachusetts, is not merely a backdrop for events; it is &quot;inseparable from policy
and action and meaning.&quot; Hester's judges are deadly serious: with the threat of
Indian attack ever-present, they cannot afford to see her silence as anything but
dangerously insolent willfulness. The speculation that will result from her silence will
poison the community with speculation and suspicion, threatening damnation from God in the
form of weakened moral fiber and group solidarity, making the community divided and
vulnerable.</p>

<p>However, Ms. Moore, obviously not one for the finer points of literary significance or
historical context, objected to the novel's unhappy ending and demanded that it be changed
to reflect her conception of Hester as what can only be described as a misunderstood
proto-Feminist &quot;victim.&quot; Director Joffé apparently concurred with this
interpretation; he has been quoted as referring to those who object to the wholesale
makeover of Hawthorne's novel as &quot;fuddy-duddies.&quot; It isn't that the film isn't
faithful to the narrative structure of the book; in fact, upon a second reading of
Hawthorne's novel, I was struck by how much the filmmakers had relied upon the novel in
their adaptation. Unfortunately, their adherence was to the letter and not to the essence
of the book, and therein lay their very fatal error. The problem with what can only be
called a contemptuous approach to Puritan standards of morality, however well-intentioned
and correct the outrage may seem by modern standards, is the unmistakable fact that those
same standards are the very underpinnings of the book. Again, as Leo Marx has noted, <em>The
Scarlet Letter</em> is not a psychological novel in the sense that its characters are
multi-dimensional. Indeed, the characters are very one-dimensional, acting merely as
allegories in response to the environment in which they live. Part of that environment
consists of the moral standards under which they labor. Only by their actions within and
against their environment do the characters' behaviors attain any relevance. Strip the
moral-historical context away, and the one-dimensional nature of the characterization in
Hawthorne's work becomes embarrassingly apparent, not to mention unintentionally
hilarious. </p>

<p>This is exactly what happens in this adaptation of <em>The Scarlet Letter</em>. Demi
Moore's Hester possesses none of the necessary nuances of conscience provided by
Hawthorne, who illustrates quite unequivocally that his heroine suffered for her crimes,
both real and perceived by herself and others, from the very beginning. Her ordeal of
public penance Hawthorne described as &quot;all that nature could endure&quot; and Hester
later recalls her mindset on that day as one that was &quot;abased by sin and
half-maddened by the ignominy that was still new....&quot; After seven years of such
punishment, the literary Hester has lost no awareness of her shame; she is still wracked
from time to time by moods of suicidal despair, wondering whether or not it would be
better &quot;to send Pearl [her daughter] at once to heaven, and go herself to such
futurity as Eternal Justice could provide.&quot; Moore instead opts to portray Hester as a
scappy heroine who cares nothing for consequences. When she stands in front of the
congregation, unrepentant, wearing a brightly-colored (by Puritan standards),
off-the-shoulder dress, one half expects her to burst into a chorus, à la Aretha and
Annie, of &quot;Sisters Are Doin' It For Themselves//Standin On Our Own Two Feet...,&quot;
and the tone of defiance never abates in her performance. Moore's idea of deep emoting is
simply to lift her head ever higher in disdain for those around her -- apparently the very
real threat of a death penalty is not a very strong deterrent. During her character's
pregnancy, Moore demonstrates love in the face of intolerance by baring and caressing her
swollen abdomen in extreme close-up; this Hester is preparing for a photo-spread in
&quot;Ye Olde Vanitie Faire.&quot; No doubt the audience is supposed to infer from this
display that the sight of Moore's body is to act as a temporary distraction from her
acting (in)ability. </p>

<p>Since Hester is not allowed to suffer in this adaptation of <em>The Scarlet Letter</em>,
the other actors' roles have been written with sufficient indifference to nuance so as to
enable the actors to suffer in her place, but their tortures are being inflicted on the
rack of bad acting. As the not-so-good Reverend Dimmesdale, Gary Oldman resembles nothing
so much as a rather intense California surfer who took a wrong time warp and ended up in
the seventeenth century. Oldman alternates between making cow's eyes at Moore and slamming
his fists on the pulpit by way of emotional expression when he isn't wandering around
looking half-wild with something -- either a combination of religious zeal and guilt, or
maybe it's the bloody flux. Robert Duvall's performance as Hester's vengeful husband takes
a more serpentine approach; in a startlingly original conception, Duvall's character
narrows his eyes and flares his nostrils to denote how evil and depraved he is. One half
expects him to emerge swaying from a basket at appropriate moments. Nevertheless, these
performances are fascinating in a macabre sort of way, somewhat like watching an impending
train wreck, or like watching a usually fine actor like Duvall waste his time and career
on chaff like this. Only Joan Plowright emerges with her dignity intact; as Mistress
Hibbins, the local busybody and suspected witch, she provides much-needed comic relief,
primarily because she is the only member of the cast who isn't suffering from the
affliction of taking him or herself too seriously. </p>

<p>As might be expected, with no context to cement them in place, the visual signifiers
are nothing more than the &quot;spot-the-hair-motif&quot; type, a.k.a. Symbolism 101.
Passion is symbolized by -- surprise -- a red bird. This unfortunate avian specimen
resembles nothing so much as a canary who lost a fight with a bottle of iodine; perhaps a
cardinal wouldn't work for scale. Hester and the Reverend consummate their relationship on
a pile of ever-shifting grain (intercourse on bed of grains equals fertility). Normally,
Joffé can do wonders with the natural world; the landscapes in his films tend to resonate
with significance (witness <em>The Mission</em> and <em>The Killing Fields</em>) but this
time his instincts seem to have deserted him just when he needed them the most. The
Reverend Dimmesdale, not surprisingly, is very fond of invoking the Deity when necessary.
He even does so with his beloved, exclaiming with most annoying frequency, &quot;God help
me, Hester, I do love thee.&quot; Aside from the obvious question of whether or not the
Reverend is heading for perdition on the grounds of violating yet another commandment, the
invocation is in vain: God cannot help thee, for thou hast placed thyself in a very
pretentious and badde filmme.</p>
