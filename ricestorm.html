<p></font><strong><font size="5">N</font></strong><font size="4">ovember 1973 in New
Canaan, Connecticut. There&#146;s an ice storm approaching the day after Thanksgiving, and
the entire metropolitan New York City area is about to be paralyzed. Of course, one could
argue that the paralysis had set in some time ago, and its prognosis appears to be
terminal. The cause of the paralysis is easy to detect: a &quot;drug-resistant
strain&quot; of the &quot;Summer of Love&quot; mentality has infected this privileged
suburb. Paterfamilias Ben Hood (Klein) has gotten far too familiar with his next-door
neighbor, Janey Carver (Weaver). Hood&#146;s wife, Elena (Allen), suspecting that
something isn&#146;t right, has been reduced to ingesting 70s literary schlock such as <i>Jonathan
Livingston Seagull</i> and any other feel-good, self-help program as her tolerance for her
husband&#146;s behavior grows thin. Despite Elena&#146;s discomfort with the status quo,
she is the odd woman out in New Canaan; when the fondue pots run empty at the weekend
get-togethers, spouse-swapping becomes the order of the day, in the form of &quot;key
parties,&quot; and Elena, for all of her sleek modern exterior, still retains a semblance
of old-fashioned values where such deviations from the social norm are concerned.</p>

<p></font><font size="3">Meanwhile, in the midst of parental absence and hypocrisy, the
children struggle to raise themselves the best they can. When not glued to the set
observing the immediate fallout from the Nixonian fiasco known as the &quot;Saturday Night
Massacre&quot; (proof that firing a special prosecutor is an act not without political
consequences), Wendy Hood (Ricci) is following in Daddy&#146;s footsteps and playing her
own sexual games with the Carvers&#146; sons, Mikey (Wood) and his younger brother, Sandy
(Hann-Byrd). Her brother, Paul, (Maguire), home from his prep school, heads to New York
City in hot pursuit of a beauty (Holmes) from his alma mater, whose parents have a habit
of going on vacation with her younger siblings and leaving her behind like so much excess
baggage. As a result, she likes existentialism and recreational drug use (the two are
obviously linked in a cause-and-effect chain here). The arrival of the storm unleashes far
more than Nature&#146;s fury on this group of people.</p>
<i>

<p>The Ice Storm</i>, in film and book form, captures brilliantly the corrosive,
anti-personal responsibility, anti-child mentality, a cultural leftover from the 1960s
that worked so well for hedonistic, uncommitted youth, but which didn&#146;t translate so
well into middle-class life, with all of its attendant responsibilities (even Strauss and
Howe, whose book, <i>Generations</i>, heaped mountains of praise upon the so-called
superior nature of their own Boomer cohort, were forced to acknowledge the malevolent
effects of their more hedonistic viewpoints upon younger generations stranded in the
Boomer wake). The resentment this mentality generated in professionals in their late
thirties, still young enough to play and angry at having missed the first wave of what
looked like fun, was a particularly poisonous strain, undermining not only parental
authority but their children&#146;s sense of trust in their parents to protect and guide
them. Ironically, for all of the much-touted benefits of this type of
&quot;self-discovery,&quot; their tangible manifestation is fairly minimal; Ben Hood, in a
car ride home from the train station with his son, still cannot discuss sexuality in an
open fashion with him even though Ben is indulging in the covert edition of &quot;open
marriage&quot; (adultery in prettier packaging &#150; courtesy of the O&#146;Neills and
their fraudulent tome of the same name). Anyone who was unfortunate enough to be raised in
this period knows it all too well as an era in which family life threatened to go to
pieces at any moment, or, even if he/she was personally sheltered from the misery, knew of
someone who was experiencing it first hand. If nothing else, the era, as portrayed in <i>The
Ice Storm</i>, aptly demonstrated the sardonic maxim that the middle and upper-middle
classes simply couldn&#146;t do the upper-class lifestyle of habitual adultery very well,
since they had neither the large amounts of money or lack of responsibility to carry it
off with style, not to mention the servants that sheltered the children from its worst
effects. This is not to suggest that Lee and Moody aren&#146;t sympathetic on some level
with the aspirations of their characters; simply, they have allowed the means to their
goals to become the goals themselves, and it is this central error that plays havoc with
their, and their children&#146;s, lives. The resulting combination of pity and contempt
that Lee and Schamus infuse into their version of <i>The Ice Storm</i> is a perfect one;
it ensures empathy with the adults&#146; plight, while also securing the right amount of
detachment with which to judge their behavior.</p>

<p>The only problem with the film, under the circumstances, is its ability to find an
audience that will appreciate its merits: it isn&#146;t a nostalgia piece, except for the
hopelessly misguided or delusional, so that leaves only the childhood survivors, who may
or may not be thrilled to have their own worst suspicions about the era laid bare in such
chilling detail. Any such perceptional polarization would be unfortunate, for <i>The Ice
Storm</i> embodies the oft-quoted, but often never attained, concept of a flawless
ensemble cast..</p>

<p>The performances are masterful in their evocation of the internal confusion so common
in this period, as middle-class people desperately sought to throw off old conventions
while simultaneously being uncomfortable with the process of doing so. Klein and Allen, as
the disintegrating centers of this atomic world, give this film its inner strength. Both
Ben and Elena are in pain; they know it and, thanks to the actors&#146; talent, we feel
it. Weaver gives one of the best performances of her career as an adulteress wrapped up in
her own personal hell of sexual insecurites; she wants her freedom, verification that
she&#146;s still attractive and that great van der Rohe sofa in the living room
simultaneously, and thinks she&#146;s found the way to have it both ways. Cruelly, she is
the only one who isn&#146;t aware of her own ruse &#150; yet. Maguire and Ricci give all
of the adult actors a run and a half for their money; they mix bravado and insecurity into
a screen presence that is eerie in its accuracy. </p>

<p>The use of pathetic fallacy (literal storm reflecting metaphorical storm), usually so
insufferably obvious, works brilliantly within the story&#146;s strict parameters. When
the storm arrives, and the inevitable tragedies ensue, it awakens the adult participants
to the belated realization of what they&#146;ve done, or tried to do. For some of them, it
may be too late for a mid-course correction in their plans. It&#146;s not necessarily true
that social experimentation leads to destruction, but the unthinking brand of it most
certainly does. This is the central message &#150; and the strength &#150; of <i>The Ice
Storm</i>.</font></p>
