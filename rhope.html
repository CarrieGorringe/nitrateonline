<p><big><strong><big>A</big></strong>t times heartwarming home-town kitsch, at other times
predictable puppy-love pablum for the young and recently separated, <i>Hope Floats</i> ...
but just barely. Sandra Bullock dons an executive producer's hat for the first time and
the results are mixed. Better than average, handsomely mounted, but the uplifting suds on
this Texas romantic brew fail to sustain and the film seems destined to wander just below
the top performers at the box-office for a few weeks before being muscled out by some of
the bigger summer films. This screams chick-flick; the guys are out roaring at <i>Godzilla</i>
while the gals will gather here.</big></p>

<p><img src="images/rhope-1.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" WIDTH="147" HEIGHT="200">Returning after some
dismal outings (<i>Two If By Sea</i> and <i>In Love and War</i>) and one lead weight of a
dud (<em><a href="rspeed2.html" target="_top">Speed 2</a></em>), Bullock has assembled the production
team (Lynda Obst and Mary McLaglen) responsible for the single-parent romance <i>One Fine
Day</i>, the acclaimed director (Forest Whitaker) of <i>Waiting to Exhale</i>, and Caleb
Deschanel, one of the premiere directors of photography, whose beautiful imagery has
mesmerized audiences of <i>The Natural</i>, <i>The Right Stuff</i>, <i>Fly Away Home</i>,
and <i>The Black Stallion</i>. The script by Steven Rogers plays a smidgen toward the
overly melodramatic, but, hey, it's his first produced work. Look for more focused efforts
from this freshman in the HBO tele-feature <i>Early Positions</i> and future projects
featuring such leading ladies as Susan Sarandon, Julia Roberts, and Jodie Foster.
Obviously here's a newcomer who displays some promising penmanship.</p>

<p>Birdee Calvert (Bullock) is thrown for a loop when her cozy suburban Chicago life
disintegrates on national television. The former prom queen married to the one time high
school quarterback (Michael Paré) gets colorized when her best friend Connie (Rosanna
Arquette) reveals on a pseudo-Ricki Lake/Jerry Springer talk show that she has been having
a one-year fling with Birdee's husband. The humiliated housewife packs up the family
wagon, picks up anchor, and hightails it back home to Smithville, Texas. In tow is her
young bespectacled daughter Bernice (Mae Whitman, another alumni from <i>One Fine Day </i>and
seen as Christine Lahti's daughter on TV&#146;s <i>Chicago Hope</i>), a daddy's girl who
can't cope with her mother's deep funk and the absence of her father. Whitman has some of
the best lines in the film and delivers a strong performance as the little girl lost. (Not
lost on this viewer was Whitman's connection to <i>Sleepless in Seattle</i> and that
film's reflection on <i>An Affair to Remember</i>, while <i>Hope Floats</i> recalls
through a television viewing the 1957 soaper <i>Love Is a Many-Splendored Thing</i>.) Very
strong talent in such a small body!</p>

<p><img src="images/rhope-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">The turmoil between
Birdee and Bernice is contrasted with Birdee's recollections of her snobby teenage days
and her attempts to make things right to those people she wronged back in high school.
There is also much ado at home with eccentric matriarch Ramona (Gena Rowlands), a twisted
taxidermist (take a gander at her scaredy cats) who wants her emotionally-bruised child to
bandage herself back to good mental health. And what better way than through handyman
Justin Matisse (singer-actor Harry Connick Jr.), a childhood friend who offers the wounded
Birdee (ah, now I see why the screenwriter gave her that name) the chance of building a
new nest together. Justin's pleasant looks and demeanor are supplemented by his growing
attachment as a father figure to young Travis (Cameron Finley), Birdee's nephew, the
unfortunate reject of a failed marriage. Now living with earth mother Ramona, the boy
appears in a number of hilarious makeup/costumes (Kermit, Charlie Chaplin, cowboy) at
meals and in between, but ultimately provides a down-to-earth crutch for Bernice as she
gets battered by school bully Big Dolores.</p>
<i>

<p>Hope Floats</i> is a moderately pleasant walk in the park. Small in budget and in
scope. Bullock seems to have found her footing again and has surrounded herself with good
technical talent and a cast that provides adequate and occasionally compelling
performances, but her achievement handling the emotional roller-coaster aspects of her
character is not a strong one. Let's face it, she's no Meryl Streep. She's a pretty face
that people like to watch, and it is her limitations as &quot;America's sweetheart&quot;
that hold back this film from soaring any higher than it does. Some people might fault
that more than I do, but <i>Hope Floats</i> deals with a topical subject and difficult
issues. It certainly scores some brownie points, but can't muster enough punch to earn a
merit badge.</p>
