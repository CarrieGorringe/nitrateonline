I left. I don&#146;t have to waste my time this weekend or a blank VHS tape. This is not
one I care to place in my video library.</p>

<p></font><font FACE="Times,Times New Roman" size="3">Director Rob Cohen (<i>Daylight</i>)
tries his best to get a handle on the fast-paced and over-packed screenplay by Kario
Salem, whose <i>Don King: Only in America</i> was a well-received and well-awarded
telefeature on HBO last year. Too bad Cohen couldn&#146;t harp back to his first feature,
the delightful <i>A Small Circle of Friends </i>(1980), a mercifully less-cluttered
character-study. <i>Rat Pack</i> is on the other extreme -- a too big circle of friends,
beginning with the stellar five: self-proclaimed manic-depressive Frank Sinatra (Ray
Liotta), lush ladies man Dean &quot;How did all these people get in my room?&quot; Martin
(Joe Mantegna), determined Sammy Davis, Jr. (Don Cheadle), nervous nelly Peter Lawford
(Angus Mcfadyen), and fast-talking, rarely-scene Joey Bishop (Bobby Slayton). The ensemble
then spreads out across the land from brooding mobsters Momo Giancana (Robert Miranda),
Cohen (Alan Woolf), and Johnny Roselli (Joe Cortese) to strong-armed Kennedy&#146;s Joe
Sr. (Dan O&#146;Herlihy), John F. (William Peterson), and Bobby (Zeljko Ivanek).
Undoubtedly the late night shows will joke about comparisons between President
Clinton&#146;s recent adulterous revelations and President Kennedy&#146;s bed-side
associations with Elizabeth Taylor look-a-like Judy Campbell (Michelle Grace) and Monroe
(Barbara Niven), as JFK&#146;s philandering and Sinatra&#146;s pimping are examining in
tawdry detail.</p>

<p>There are some poignant moments (don&#146;t blink or go to the bathroom), as the film
starts with the lonesome Chairman of the Board, weakened by age and the death of his
comrades, muttering before going on stage that his misses his guys. Liotta does convey the
mannerisms, arrogance, and style (acutely enhanced by costume and hair stylists) of one of
the 20th century&#146;s greatest personalities, but his moments (and the rest of the
quintet&#146;s) are cut too short and the film sputters about some of the more important
moments in the life of the Rat Pack: Frank&#146;s mob and political connections,
Sammy&#146;s inter-racial affair then nuptial with Swedish starlet May Britt (Megan
Dodds), the sullen Lawford&#146;s marriage to JFK&#146;s sister and his subsequent role as
unremitting go-between for Sinatra and the White House. In an even more blatant exposure
of the script&#146;s shortcomings are the use of floating headlines, announcing weddings,
divorces, break-ups, and related tragedies, to bridge huge gaps in the narrative.</p>

<p>The actors make every effort to sound like their original, but the master&#146;s
singing duties (the surprisingly few that there are) are relegated to voice-overs by
Michael Dees, although Mantegna does warble well for Dino. Cheadle (<a href="rdevilb.html" target="_top"><i>Devil
in a Blue Dress</i></a>, <a href="rboogie.html" target="_top"><i>Boogie Nights</i></a>, and <i>Picket
Fences</i>) does very well in his role as the born-again Jewish nightclub entertainer,
especially showing his despair when harassed by a cross-burning Aryan public. Regretfully
director Cohen&#146;s use of surrealistic histrionics when Davis is set to perform at a DC
nitery appears out of sorts from the rest of the film&#146;s pastel realism. Production
designer Hilda Stark Manos and freshman cinematographer Shane Hurlbut capture well the
period tone of Vegas, the wacky planet Hollywood, and Sinatra&#146;s luxurious digs in
Palm Springs (catch for the pool and the toy train playroom to see what I mean). Visually
this does help make this a somewhat more watchable production, but you still need a
scorecard and program to follow the action.</p>

<p>Movie references (<i>Some Came Running</i>, <i>Oceans 11</i>, <i>Sergeants 3</i>)
abound, but just one scene-behind-the-scene is reenacted, wherein producer-director Lewis
Milestone gets one-upped by arrogant star Sinatra over doing a second take.</p>

<p>Too much, too much! I may not be a Sinatra fan, but I&#146;d rather turn off the set
and listen to any of his memorable hits than watch this forgettable sprawling condensation
of a master and his comrades better remembered for their fame than their foibles.</font></p>
