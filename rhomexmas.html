<p><big><strong><big>F</big></strong>amily fare. Pure, sweet, and PG-rated. It&#146;s
sugar-coated household comedy wrapped in a simple holiday gift wrap and starring Home
Improvement&#146;s Jonathan Taylor Thomas. According to press material Mr. Thomas
maintains a straight &quot;A&quot; average in school. No such luck here, but it&#146;s a
bearable B&#150; effort. Disney&#146;s pre-Thanksgiving holiday, live-action greeting-card
is an obvious variation of Planes, Trains, and Automobiles. The less likely title -- in
the style of the old Bob Hope-Bing Crosby features -- would have been The Road to
Larchmont, that upper-class, Westchester County, New York, community that is the ultimate
destination of our self-centered, entrepreneurial hero, college freshman Jake Wilkinson.
And at a brisk 80-minute or so length (including a extreme sport Goofy cartoon at the
film&#146;s head), at least you won&#146;t stumble out bleary-eyed as if you just had a
three-hour date with death. The closest Joe Black gets here is the fact that Jake is upset
with dad (Gary Cole, in a role about as short as his other Christmas release, <em>A Simple
Plan</em>) for re-marrying to a sweetheart of a step mom (Eve Gordon) less than a year
after the family matriarch died. The undergrad would rather vacation in a three-bedroom
condo in Cabo San Lucas than hit the ole homestead and tangle with his parents and
disgruntled younger sister Tracey. Until dad dangles a big carrot before the car-conscious
kid&#133;a red-hot 1957 Porsche, but only if sonny boy makes it home in time for Christmas
dinner.</big></p>

<p><img src="images/rhomexmas-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">Director Arlene
Sanford (A Very Brady Sequel) starts the film with a breezy bouncing Santa hat title
sequence and settles down for the cross-country trek, although the filmmakers cheat a
little to save on production costs, subbing Californian and Canadian (mostly Vancouver)
locations for the real American thing, and as I grew up not to far from Jake&#146;s
suburban New York objective, I felt gypped at not spotting some of the local relics of my
past. It would seem that one of the scriptwriters (Harris Goldberg and Tom Nursall; their
first produced feature, from a story by Michael Allin, who lives on Long Island) grew up
nearby as well.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas doesn&#146;t over-extend his acting abilities (not that the screenplay
paints any characters too deeply) as a college student at Palisades College in Los
Angeles. His on-again, off-again girlfriend, Allie (model/actress Jessica Biel) hopes to
hitch a ride back East with Jake over winter break as she also hails from the same home
town, but the lad ends up abandoned in the middle of the desert in a Santa suit, beard and
hat super-glued to his head, and not a penny or phone card to his name. His scheme to help
several prominent jocks pass a history final now has gone awry at the hands of neanderthal
Eddie (Adam LaVorgna), a snide, not-too-smart, fellow student with the hots for Allie and
her Ally McBeal short skirts (perhaps an in-joke as director Sanford has helmed episodes
of that Fox TV series), so he enlists the crashed test dummies and plops poor Jake out in
the middle of nowhere, thereby positioning himself as Allie&#146;s knight in shining
armor. The desperate woman, in search of a last minute ride home, reluctantly accepts
Eddie&#146;s realizing the boy&#146;s deep deficiencies in gray matter, and setting strict
ground rules for the testosterone-hyped youngster.</p>

<p><img src="images/rhomexmas-2.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="left" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="144">The charm of the
film are the various characters the Santa-clad Jake meets, his wily road-warrior efforts,
and the Rube Goldberg atmosphere as one circumstance leads to another. After a lift from a
carload of aging Tom Jones queens and leaving them with some barf in the back seat, Jake
nearly gets run down by Nolan Briggs (the skating messenger in Caroline in the City), a
hamburger helpless fence who catches a dose of the Christmas spirit and helps dole out
toasters and hand-held vacuum cleaners at a children&#146;s hospital. An over-friendly cop
(Sean O&#146;Bryan) attaches himself to Jake, who helps the policeman with marital
problems. An unlikely teaming of the arch rivals chomping on twinkies is short-lived, and,
as luck would have it (and it does a LOT in this film), the penniless Santa ends up
dashing through the streets of Madison, Wisconsin, in a 5K run expressly for hundreds of
red-trimmed St. Nicholas&#146;s. And so on. All ends well, as expected, in a one-horse
open sleigh. &#145;Tis the season.</p>

<p>The problems with the film, and you can easily forgive them if you must, lie mostly in
the under-developed script with its cartoon-deep characters, but hey, it is a Disney film.
Never explained is why Eddie is always behind the wheel and Allie just his passenger. And
considering all the roads that lead from California to New York, it&#146;s too
coincidental that Jake keeps running into Allie and Eddie along the way. It&#146;s to
Sanford&#146;s advantage that she generally lifts this semi-pleasant film above its lesser
origins.</p>
