<p>I&#146;ve got a lot better things to do with my time that sit through three hours of
this futuristic pseudo-epic babble dedicated to the same people who make a common habit of
killing off their former supervisors. Some people therefore might want to classify this a
black comedy. Many will laugh--albeit unintentionally.</p>

<p><img src="images/rpostman-1.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">Over-long and
maddeningly narcissistic (&quot;Dances with Mailmen&quot;), this Christmas-day Warner
Bros. release caps a year when the Looney Tune studio has unleashed such dreadful box
office duds as <a href="rct.html" target="_top"><i>Conspiracy Theory</i></a>, <i>Father&#146;s Day</i>, <i>Free
Willy 3</i>, <a href="rmadcity.html" target="_top"><i>Mad City</i></a>, <i>The Man Who Knew Too Little</i>,
and <a href="rmidnite.html" target="_top"><i>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil</i></a>. At least
they had a critical success <i>with</i><a href="rlacon.html" target="_top"> L.A. Confidential</a> and,
to a lesser degree, with <a href="rcontact.html" target="_top"><i>Contact</i></a>. Their bottom line
doesn&#146;t look too good and <i>The Postman</i>, at $80 million, won't help keep the
nails out of the coffin. The buzz on the film has studio execs clucking about like
ostriches (or whatever ostriches do), quickly repositioning a dreadful initial promotion
plan created by a now dismissed WB marketing exec. A screening of the trailer a month ago
in a Washington theater was greeted with hoots and groans. Obviously, this didn&#146;t
build up any interest in this film above the other holiday movies glutting your
neighborhood multiplexes.</p>

<p>So is it really a turkey? Well, it is fowl, or perhaps foul anti-fascist fodder, but
I&#146;ve seen a lot worse this year. <a href="r8heads.html" target="_top"><i>8 Heads in a Duffel Bag</i></a>,
for one. Costner&#146;s view of the not-to-distant future is actually pleasant enough to
look at, although director of photography Stephen Windon&#146;s breath-taking vistas of
the Pacific Northwest and the deserts of the Southwest are branded with an obvious Western
influenced soundtrack by four-time Oscar nominee James Newton Howard, striking chords
derivative of his earlier Costner connection <em>Wyatt Earp</em>. One of the film's
problems is its attempt to straddle the fence between being a wide-screen John Ford
wannabe and a post-apocalyptic <em>Mad Max</em> rip-off. Makes me want to head for my
laserdisc player and watch <i>Silverado</i> (1985). Please letterbox version only! Yup,
slide that shiny disc in and play one of the last great westerns of the 20th Century and
Costner&#146;s first brush of acting greatness.</p>

<p>Back to <i>The Postman</i>. Set 15 years in the future, after some undefined war has
destroyed the fabric of our nation, leaving us without cars, telephones, and Monday Night
Football, a &quot;lone drifter&quot; (Costner) wanders the countryside with his mule, his
rhetorical conversations recalling strange visions of both Juan Valdez and<em> A Boy and
His Dog</em>, a mid-1970s post-apocalyptic Don Johnson vehicle about a wanderer and his
telepathic pooch. Hmmm, too bad Costner&#146;s four-footed companion doesn&#146;t talk.
Regrettably, Costner's character does ... spots of Shakespeare that send townspeople
agiggle. He spouts lines of The Bard in exchange for food and lodging, but his career
plans are dashed when he is conscripted by the Holnists, a radical right wing faction lead
by the despot General Bethlehem (Will Patton). For a color film, Costner's paints all his
characters in single shades of black and white, particularly the &quot;bad guys&quot;
(black leather, black horses). Oh for a touch of gray. </p>

<p><img src="images/rpostman-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">After Bill comes
up in dinner conversation, the drifter makes his escape and takes shelter in a postal
vehicle. Disrobing the skeleton of its uniform, he becomes THE POSTMAN, spinning a tale
for the humble, hippy folks of Pineview, Oregon, that he has been sent as a representative
of the Restored U. S. of A. to deliver old mail. Ah, he's delivering new hope, of course!
Hailed as a savior, he beds Abby (Olivia Williams), who needs his good semen so that she
and her husband can have a child. Yeah, it gets pretty strange here. Then, in a scene
reminiscent of the Kent State massacre, the bedraggled residents of Benning, Oregon (the
postman's latest mail drop) revolt, instilled with a new defiance against Bethlehem, who
has taken Abby as an unwilling love slave. The Postman, his pride and body wounded, is
nursed back to health by Abby (her husband being conveniently killed by Bethlehem) as the
movie reaches its midpoint.</p>

<p>The second half follows the rag tag team of postmen that have been corralled and
inspired by Ford Lincoln Mercury (Larenz Tate), an ambitious youngster previously
&quot;deputized&quot; by The Postman. Learning of the mailmen's success in restoring
delivery of junk mail to the area, The Postman realizes that the bad guys won't like this,
not one bit. As expected, it's cat-and-mouse for the next hour as both leaders exhort
their troops to the final conflict.</p>

<p>The year is 1997.<br>
This is no movie to see.<br>
I want my MTV.</p>
