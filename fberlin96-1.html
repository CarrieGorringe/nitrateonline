<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>&quot;Let's wait,
we'll see,&quot; Berlin Film Festival co-director Moritz de Hadeln
murmured when told his main competition section could be the most well-received in years.
And it was a few brief hours until he presented Emma Thompson with the European première
of <a href="rsense.html" target="_top"><em>Sense and Sensibility</em></a> to a capacity audience of VIPs
at the massive festival flagship Zoo Palast Theater. A bystander could chalk up his answer
to either serene acceptance or stark terror.</b></font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">But from all indications during the early stages of the 46th edition of
this huge festival (running February 15th to 26th in this great city which blankets itself
not only in a slushy snow but all manner of poster and banner trumpeting the show), he
need not be too worried yet. </font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Actually, de Hadeln's comment can be seen as a motto for the hardy filmgoer as well.
Even though Berlin is universally acknowledged to be the best-run event of its type in the
world, there's a certain amount of &quot;let's wait&quot; involved in an endeavor of this
size: press credentials, phone, fax, queues, ticketing and the like take up a good chunk
of time, but with good administration and good old trial and error, things seem to be
running splendidly.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And if you're visiting the festival, &quot;you'll see&quot;, no doubt - a quick skim of
the half-dozen or so catalogues necessary for deciding what to catch yields some 263
titles in the main programs. Of course, that doesn't include the market section, which
runs 400-plus films on 13 screens for 12 hours a day to interest buyers from around the
globe, or the retrospective tributes to directors William Wyler and Elia Kazan, which
feature all titles known to exist in each man's oeuvre.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><img src="images/fberlin96-1.gif" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="209" HEIGHT="148">Berlin's huge, all right,
but the bear can be
tamed. The main competition section is selected by de Hadeln, who has taken a lot of heat
over the years for some seemingly eclectic and often unpopular choices. But even the
notoriously tough German press should cut him some slack this year. Fifteen countries are
represented with 29 entries - 14 of them world premières. Great Britain will sport
Richard Loncraine's <em>Richard III</em> (pictured), Michael Hoffman's <em>Restoration</em>,
Ang Lee's aforementioned <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> (a US co-production) and the
hotly-anticipated world première of Stephen Frears' troubled <em>Mary Reilly</em>,
starring Julia Roberts, John Malkovich and Glenn Close.</font> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">While the harshest competition criticism
is usually reserved for the American choices - too few and there's no glamour, too many
and the festival's sold its soul - this year's Hollywood lineup struck a fine balance
that, as in all film programming, is part luck, part skill... and a larger part luck. <em>Dead
Man Walking</em>, the world première of Paul Mazursky's <em>Faithful</em>, <a href="rgetshrt.html" target="_top"><em>Get Shorty</em></a> and <a href="r12monky.html" target="_top"><em>l2 Monkeys</em></a>
will all compete for the Gold and Silver Bear prizes, while <em>From Dusk Till Dawn</em>, <em>Holidays</em>,
<a href="rnixon.html" target="_top"><em>Nixon</em></a> and <a href="rtoystry.html" target="_top"><em>Toy Story</em></a>
will all have their first European showings out of competition (what's the difference? -
who knows - it's all part of the complicated dance de Hadeln does with distributors). His
choices have yielded Oscar gold as well, with seven of the competition entries garnering a
total 24 nominations (an eighth Academy Award-nominated title, <em>The Battle Over Citizen
Kane</em>, is showing elsewhere in the festival).</font> </p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As this is filed, only two competition films have unspooled for the press. <em>Sense
and Sensibility</em> got a warm round of applause at the press show Friday afternoon -
although some scribes have groused at its gentility. Writer-star Emma Thompson wowed the
VIP crowd at the subsequent première.</font> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And on the subject of stars, there are lots here and
more expected, including Julia Roberts, Danny De Vito, Ian McKellen, Bruce Willis, Robert
Downey Jr. and Claudia Cardinale. Jodie Foster (pictured here directing on-set) is set to
receive the special Berlinale Camera award at the first European showing (16th) of <em>Home
for the Holidays</em> out of competition. Kazan is here for his tribute, as is Jack Lemmon
for an official nod and showing of his Oscar-winning performance in John Avildsen's <em>Save
the Tiger</em> (23rd).</font> </p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">William Wyler (pictured) is deceased but is represented in Berlin by his four grown
children, including producer Catherine Wyler, who gave organizers access to her father's
private collection and is serving on the jury for the competition section. The jury itself
features Israeli actress Gila Almagor, Hong Kong director Ann Hui, German actor Jürgen
Prochnow, British writer Ray Weldon and others, all serving under Jury president Nikita
Mikhalkov, the Russian director of last year's Cannes prize winner <em>Burnt by the Sun</em>.
Truly, the Berlin Festival is one of the largest concentrations of global film types in
one place anywhere on the festival calendar (if not <i>the </i>largest).</font> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><a name="Bitches" target="_top"></a>Back to the competition:
The festival catalogue describes the new Hungarian/German co-production <em>Csajok</em>
(<em>Bitches</em>) as &quot;a fragmented and bloody farce&quot;, and its emotionally
fever-pitched story of three contemporary Hungarian women and their husband troubles is
all that and more. <em>Bitches</em> is the third directorial effort from former actress
Idilkó Szabó, following the critically acclaimed <em>Damn Real</em> (1987) and <em>Child
Murders</em> (1993). Her all-over-the-map storytelling style won't be to all tastes, nor
will the penchant for putting her three leading ladies through some pretty grueling paces
involving spousal abuse (much of it seemingly played in part for laughs) and bodily fluids
(uh, ditto).</font> </p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But Szabó's point seems to be that each woman, despite setbacks large and small,
rebounds and gives at least as good as she gets throughout the picture. &quot;All the
scenes actually happened, either to me or to my friends,&quot; she told one journalist,
and while it must be left up to the individual moviegoer to assess her credibility on this
volatile issue, <em>Bitches</em> is a bracing assault on the American moviegoing
sensibility and a film sure to spark discussion - and controversy. In the end the press
corps - perhaps still groggy from the opening night party that was still going sort of
strong as 2:00am came and went - gave the movie respectful applause.</font> </p>
