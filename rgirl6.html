<p><font size="5"><strong>W</strong></font><font size="4">hat&#146;s an ambitious, yet
principled, actress (Randle) to do after she loses a major role, her agent and her acting
coach in a very short time -- and all because of the nasty and ubiquitous intersection of
sex and money (she wouldn&#146;t show her breasts during a rehearsal, so she won&#146;t
get hired and won&#146;t be paying anyone anytime soon)? Well, after a series of jobs too
demeaning to be classified as merely &quot;dead-end,&quot; she takes up a new position as
content provider to a phone-sex line, playing out fantasies for whoever produces a
credit-card number; if you have the money, she most definitely has the time. She is Girl
Number Six, whose gamut of performances-for-pay range from the sweet girl next door to
emotional crisis counselor. </font></p>

<p>But, in solving her financial woes, Girl Six -- the audience never learns her real
identity -- discovers that there are unforeseen occupational hazards; like any other
dealer in fantasy can, she succumbs to the temptation and becomes dangerously addicted to
the product she pushes, to the detriment of her original career. First, she attempts to
transcend the gap between fantasy and reality by agreeing to make personal contact with a
customer, known as &quot;Bob Regular&quot; (Berg). When he fails to appear as scheduled,
she sinks into a malaise, one which she attempts to cure by heading for the
&quot;harder&quot; stuff: an S&amp;M line whose motto is &quot;No inhibitions&quot; (as if
to emphasize that fact, the owner of said services is played by Madonna, a.k.a. Our Lady
of the Wholly Peusdo-Sexually-Transgressive). On top of all this, Girl Six&#146;s
ex-husband (Washington), an incorrigible klepto, wants to rediscover those old feeling
that they once had for each other, especially after he finds out about the kinkier aspects
of her current occupation. However, reality is about to take an unexpected turn; in
crossing the line into more dangerous territory, Girl Six soon finds herself vulnerable to
the unwelcome attentions of a most unpleasant individual, who not only has a penchant for
&quot;snuff&quot; fantasies, but who also has her home address. Like Girl Six, the
sociopath wants to turn his fantasies into reality by acting out on others, but his
impulses are an uncomfortable reminder that sociopathy is a more literal -- and
potentially deadly -- realm.</p>

<p><em>Girl 6</em> is at its best when it addresses the issue of technology and its
intersection with the growing urge for instant gratification as a commodity without any
corresponding obligation to respond to the outside world. After all, why go to all the
bother of having to consider the feelings of another individual or wasting all of your
valuable time on dating when you can just simply call up a sex line and get your rocks off
as efficiently as possible? There are no emotional scenes, no chance for betrayal, and,
best of all, as the consumer, you control the entire scenario. If you don&#146;t like what
you&#146;re getting, it is a simple matter of changing girls or services. No personal
engagement equals no risk, and that mindset extinguishes any regard for the humanity of
individuals. In its first forty minutes, <em>Girl 6</em> clearly and skillfully delineates
how that belief system is not restricted to those who work in the phone-sex business (a
sleazily hilarious cameo by director Tarentino as -- what else -- a sleazy director who
has mistaken the prevalence of T&amp;A in his films for personal significance is
especially illustrative in this regard) .</p>

<p>However, Lee takes this promising premise, and the subtly sensual and luminous
performance by Randle, and does absolutely nothing with them except to allow them to
wander aimlessly through the final third of the film. As Lee and Parks see it, there are
no additional psychological insights necessary for explaining why Girl Six goes overboard
into her fantasy world, and the idea that this choice is merely a logical, if extreme,
extension of her professional life is an inadequate one, since the first thirty minutes of
<em>Girl 6</em> make painfully clear the contrast between the fantasy world of show
business and the painful realities of what one has to undergo in order to be permitted to
construct those fantasies. The need for cash is not Girl Six&#146;s only motivating
factor, and some attempt to address the other causes might have made this film more
compelling. As it stands, the half-hearted and last-minute attempt to save the film just
doesn&#146;t provide this film with an appropriate amount of saving grace; in fact, it
only underscores the weakness of the previous material. Even Lee&#146;s performance as
Jimmy, the nice, if ineffectual friend of Girl Six who is encased in his own fantasy world
of making it big from the proceeds of sports memorabilia, doesn&#146;t provide the film
with adequate underpinnings to overcome its lack of focus, proving thereby that no matter
the extent of personal appearance, it cannot act as a substitute for a personal imprint. </p>

<p>A more fitting title for this film, rather than <em>Girl 6</em>, would be &quot;Lee: 0
For 3.&quot; In the wake of realizing his magnificent vision of <em>Malcolm X</em>, Lee
has made three films -- the other two being <em>Crooklyn</em> and <a href="rclock.html" target="_top"><em>Clockers</em></a>
-- which are, in substance, of little substance whatsoever; they seem to have been made
through a fog of dissociation, in contrast to Lee&#146;s earlier work, which bore as its
hallmark a strong infusion of Lee&#146;s own personality. Hence, the earlier films had a
more coordinated feel, precisely because Lee&#146;s unequivocal explorations of the
injustices of life kept their narratives firmly on track, a trait which is sadly lacking
in his most recent work. Naturally, Lee&#146;s directorial, not to mention personal,
evolution would entail some degree of withdrawl from this earlier intense, stance, but the
post-<em>Malcolm X</em> work has created an impression that Lee&#146;s talent is less in
withdrawal than in full-scale retreat. One can only hope that this talented director will
manage to reconnect more clearly with subsequent works. </p>
