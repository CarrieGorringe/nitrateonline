improbable but broadly enlightening (not to mention funny and entertaining) fable is set
against the Italian fascist movement of the late 1930s and ends in an unidentified
concentration camp at the end of World War II. In between, the film&#146;s talented
director, co-writer, and star Roberto Benigni embraces, through broad physical and verbal
humor, the central character&#146;s attempts to shield his young son from the anti-semitic
horrors of mass genocide. It is to the film&#146;s glorious advantage that it does reveal
that every cloud, especially the black nimbus of war, has a silver lining and that,
indeed, <i>Life Is Beautiful</i>.</p>

<p></font><img src="images/rlifebeaut-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="168"><font FACE="Times" size="3">Benigni imbues his childlike Guido Orefice with an unflappable <i>joi
de vivre</i> and a ton of fate-filled instances and acquaintances that all afford suitable
ammunition in his courtship of a &quot;princess&quot; and, in the darker portion of the
feature, a giddy array of circumstances to spin a fairy tale in the face of tragedy.
Benigni, a recognized madcap comic treasure in his homeland, is no stranger to American
audiences, having appeared in Jim Jarmusch&#146;s <i>Down By Law</i> and <i>Night on Earth</i>,
as well as showing some brighter moments as Inspector Clouseau&#146;s pratfall of an
offspring in the feeble <i>Son of the Pink Panther</i>. <i>Life Is Beautiful (La Vita è
Bella)</i> has already garnered some incredible laurels: Grand Jury Prize at the Cannes
Film Festival, audience awards at numerous other festivals, and eight David di Donatello
(the Italian &quot;Oscars&quot;). It&#146;s easy to see why. Chaplinesque in stature and
mannerism, the malleable Benigni has fashioned a charming story of a calamitous fellow
pure of heart and noble of mind. It&#146;s hard not to please most of your audience when
you do this, and Benigni does it well. The film deserves to expand beyond its art-house
market openings here in the U.S., with a broader appeal based on the good word-of-mouth
and reviews that the film continues to amass.</p>

<p>1939, Arezzo, Italy. To this small Tuscan municipality arrives our hero, an
non-observing Italian Jew, with his poetic sidekick Ferruccio (Sergio Bustric), having
already been mistaken for a prince when their automobile loses its brakes. A forced stop
and a blink later allows Guido the fortuitous rescue of a damsel in a dress. A walk around
town, looking for work (eventually serving tables at his uncle&#146;s elegant Grand
Hotel), imparts our student of observation snippets of information on its inhabitants.
Like a invasion of boomerangs, these nuggets of information (a tossed key, some hat
tricks, an Offenbach opera, a riddle-obsessed German doctor, et al) return to delightful
use in Benigni&#146;s thoughtful script (co-written with Vincenzo Cerami).</p>

<p><img src="images/rlifebeaut-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="168">He literally
falls for rescued damsel Dora (Nicoletta Braschi, star of many of Benigni&#146;s other
films), when he crashes his bicycle into the young school teacher. After a protracted
series of courtship encounters on Guido&#146;s part, he ultimately learns she is already
betrothed to town fascist Rodolfo (Amerigo Fontani). The wily yet clumsy Guido proves
himself the better man at her engagement party, his spirit soaring as she begs her suitor
to take her away. Rodolfo ends up with egg on his face (again) while Dora rides off with
the man she loves. The fairy tale jump cuts several years as the film&#146;s first hour
comes to an end and the war drawing to a close. The family, now including son
Giosué/Joshua (Giorgio Cantarini), is reluctantly forced to consider the realities of the
racial laws of the time when Guido, his son, and his uncle are forced into cattle cars.
Stunned and alone, Dora, a gentile, adds a dramatic twist with a defiant gesture at the
railway station.</p>

<p>Perhaps a little too melodramatic as the setting moves from sunny countryside to the
grey landscape of barracks life, although Benigni straddles the fence with deft humor and
a smile on his face. Into this unimaginable, barren world, the father speaks to the naïve
boy of points to be earned and contests to be won as the family is torn asunder.
Far-fetched, sure, but when a German officer asks for a volunteer to interpret for him,
Guido immediately steps forward and &quot;translates&quot; into Italian instead the rules
of his fancied game, not only for his child, but for the other startled prisoners who
listen with slackened faces. The shtick continues through to the contrived and obvious
conclusion, never disrespectful and guaranteed to leave a lump in your throat.</p>

<p>Vittorio De Sica dealt with a similar theme more than 20 years ago with his
extraordinary <i>The Gardens of the Finzi-Continis</i>, about a wealthy Jewish family that
carries false hopes too long and are forced to tragic ends at a death camp. Benigni now
makes a bold attempt for another Italian Oscar. He&#146;s on solid footing and his
celebration elevates the human spirit. <i>Life Is Beautiful</i> is beautiful.</font></p>
