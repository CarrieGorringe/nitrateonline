            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>There are two places where Clint
            Eastwood's new picture, <i>Space Cowboys</i>, flares into life. The
            second is a breathtaking thirty-minute sequence in which an orbiting
            device slowly, and inexorably, begins to spiral apart, and the men
            who are in, and outside, the U.S. space shuttle that is docked
            beside it can only watch and prepare themselves for whatever is
            coming towards them, where it is going to hit them and when. The
            sequence is choreographed so that you can practically feel the slams
            and jolts before they happen.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The first occurs when Eastwood's
            character, Frank Corvin, confronts Bob Gerson (James Cromwell), an
            old nemesis from the days when Corvin tested jet aircraft in the
            desert, and who is now a NASA official. Corvin has managed to
            maneuver things so that he and the three other men from his test
            pilot days, the <i>Project Daedalus </i>team, can go up into space
            and repair an old Soviet-era satellite that, somehow, has some of
            Corvin's old circuitry design built into it and cannot be fixed from
            the ground. This way, Corvin and his three aging colleagues will
            finally get a chance to soar into space, something that was snatched
            away from them back in the Fifties. (The film recreates a scene
            described in Tom Wolfe's <i>The Right Stuff</i>, when officials held
            a press conference to announce that the first American in space
            would be non-human.) But when news of the mission is leaked to the
            press, Corvin becomes fiercely indignant. He figures this is part of
            a plan that Gerson had in mind all along, one where he'll replace
            the old crew members at the last minute with younger astronauts of
            his own. Gerson replies that it's quite the opposite: Now he has to
            send the <i>Daedalus</i> team into space, because the news stories
            about them have created a whole new wave of interest in the N.A.S.A.
            program along with, most important of all, increased funding from
            the government. Eastwood gives Corvin an incredibly intense, but
            silent, look of outrage and indignation. Not only have he and the
            three other men been reduced to publicity gimmicks, they've become
            shills.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There's a particular moment in
            Eastwood's films where the main character is confronted with having
            to choose which path is the most honorable to take. But what other
            purpose would Corvin have to fly into space other than to show the
            young whippersnappers how it's done? The hands-on approach would
            seem sensible thirty or forty years ago, but with modern technology
            and communications, he could easily stay on the ground and talk a
            another, strapping young astronaut through the procedure and watch
            him do so all at the same time.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Corvin's motives aren't really
            explored in full, and they're part of the reason why <i>Space
            Cowboys</i> turns out to be Eastwood's weakest film in years,
            something of a surprise, since, as a director, Eastwood has
            consistently shown that he's a genuine craftsman, and even with a
            running time of just over two hours there isn't a wasted frame in
            this film, right up to the exact point at which the very last shot
            of the film cuts to black. (Eastwood is again working with longtime
            colleagues, cinematographer Jack N. Green, editor Joel Cox,
            production designer Henry Bumstead, and composer Lennie Niehaus.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But the story, from an original
            screenplay by Ken Kaufman and Howard Klausner, is awfully patchy,
            and the characters are barely sketched in. Corvin and Hawk (Tommy
            Lee Jones) are still quibbling over who's really to blame for
            smashing up that million-dollar piece of aircraft back in 1958, and
            they even go out into a parking lot outside a tavern to brawl it
            out. (Fortunately, the film doesn't turn into <i>Fight Club</i>
            redux.) Corvin himself is reprimanded distinctly, on three separate
            occasions, for &quot;not being a team player,&quot; but by the look
            of things it's obvious that Hawk, with his open contempt and
            uppityness, who is the least cooperative. Donald Sutherland, as
            Jerry, is an aging swinger who flirts with both pretty young things
            and with a doctor (the scintillating Blair Brown) who's more towards
            his age. Sutherland keeps breaking into a wolfish grin and looks
            handsome in a pair of shimmering dark, wraparound sunglasses. He's
            still got more to work with than James Garner, whose character, Tank
            Sullivan, has drifted into becoming a Baptist minister in an
            Oklahoma church. Garner brings a wonderful sense of slight
            befuddlement to his opening scenes, like someone who has wandered
            into the wrong party but starts mingling with the guests, anyway.
            But he's tremendously underused, and why put actors like Garner and
            Sutherland in parts like this if you're not going to tap into their
            tremendous source of talent?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film as a whole feels a little
            underdeveloped. Eastwood's scenes with Barbara Babcock, as the wife
            Corvin has comfortably settled down with, promise some interesting
            chemistry that never materializes. And it's easy to almost totally
            forget that Marcia Gay Harden is in the picture when you're
            recalling it, later, even though she has one of the main roles. (To
            be truthful, Eastwood has always had a little trouble handling the
            female characters in his films.) I credit Eastwood for not being
            afraid to broaden his work and try something a little risky and out
            of the ordinary -- some of his best films fall right into this
            category -- but here he seems a bit lost in the cosmos.</font><o:p>
