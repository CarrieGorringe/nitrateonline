            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 29 December 2000</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Taiwanese-born director Ang Lee
            has become one of the world’s most acclaimed directors by defying
            the stereotypical expectations many westerners have about Asian
            filmmakers. His subtle, character-driven approach in films like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Wedding Banquet</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Sense and
            Sensibility</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Ice
            Storm</i> have allowed him to switch genres and locations with
            astonishing ease. All of his films, whether set in
            nineteenth-century England, the American Civil War and the swinging
            70s in New England, are equally credible. Therefore, it’s not
            surprising that his martial arts adventure <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Crouching
            Tiger, Hidden Dragon</i> works. What is pleasantly unexpected is how
            effortlessly Lee’s low-key dramatics mesh with the kinetic sword
            battles. In most action movies, storytelling takes a backseat to
            hand-to-hand combat. Lee, however, manages to imbue <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Crouching
            Tiger, Hidden Dragon</i> with an emotional depth and sense of
            integrity that make the fights seems even more exciting. As a
            result, the gravity-defying leaps and eye-popping flying scenes are
            icing on the cake to an already filling desert.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Lee’s and his frequent writer
            James Schamus’ fingerprints are noticeable from the opening
            frames. When Li Mu Bau (played with regal charm by Chow Yun-Fat)
            returns to his home after a long period of contemplation, it’s
            obvious he’s had a lengthy and reciprocated crush on fellow
            warrior Yu Show Lien (Michele Yeoh from <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tomorrow
            Never Dies</i>). The two stare at each other so intently, that even
            though they never talk about it, they’re crazy about each other.
            If the stress of keeping an intense attraction repressed weren’t
            enough (Show Lien’s engagement to a long dead soldier prevents her
            from ever acting on her feelings), Li’s journey has left him more
            horrified than enlightened. Deciding that his experience is a bad
            omen, Li decides to retire and give his treasured 400-year-old sword
            to his friend Sir Te (Lung Shi Hung).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Li’s days of fighting are far
            from over. Shortly after Shu Lien presents Sir Te the sword, it’s
            stolen. The prime suspect is the Jade Fox (Chen Pei Pei), an outlaw
            who killed Li’s master and stole many of his martial arts
            techniques. The Jade Fox has a lethal disciple, and it doesn’t
            take Show Lien long to figure out that she is the local governor’s
            soon-to-be married daughter Jen Yu (Zhang ZiYi). Jen Yu looks small
            and dainty and speaks to Show Lien with a reverent tone. But she’s
            more than a wannabe warrior. Jen can hold her own against bandits
            (don’t even think of stealing her jade comb) and still has a
            passion for Lo (Chang Chen), a desert thief she once loved. With
            Jen’s considerable skill and potential for greatness, Li and Shu
            Lien try to lure her into using her gifts for high purposes.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Normally a quest like this might
            seem simplistic and even silly. Schamus, Wang Hui Ling and Tsai Ku
            Jung (working from Wang Du Lu’s novel) imbue the tale with
            psychological details filmmakers of supposedly deeper genres often
            ignore. When Shu Lien first confronts Jen about the theft of the
            sword, she plays a subtle mind game with her instead of swinging her
            fists. Shu Lien sounds as if she’s recalling the robbery as if she
            is merely telling the story to a disinterested party, but she’s
            actually needling Jen into returning the weapon. Touches like these
            make the talk of warriors’ codes seem less like idle tirades and
            make the scenes between the battles just as compelling as the
            face-offs themselves. They also give the actors more of a chance to
            show their craft. Chow has really been underutilized in his American
            films, and because he looks so imposing behind a pistol in John
            Woo’s movies, it’s easy to forget how talented he really is.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Not that Lee shortchanges action
            fans. The fight scenes were coordinated by Yuen Wo-Ping, who also
            choreographed the stunts for <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Matrix</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Charlie’s Angels</i>. The digitally-aided flight scenes are a marvel
            in themselves, but one of the things that really makes the duels
            fascinating is that the actors even have their own fighting styles.
            Chow moves with a cool, but elegant efficiency, while Cheng’s
            movements are wild and sloppy. As with the tunes in musicals, the
            fight scenes do more than dazzle. They actually give us information
            about the characters and make the battles far more compelling.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Lee and his collaborators have set
            a formidable standard that other action filmmakers should follow.
            While many adrenaline-driven movies have subordinated dramatics to
            eye candy, some recent flicks like the remake of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Get
            Carter</i> (with its clumsy photography and inept editing) can’t
            even seem to get the explosions right. By providing his audiences
            with the brain, heart and dazzle of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Crouching
            Tiger, Hidden Dragon</i>, Lee reminds audiences of the joy they’ve
            been missing.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
