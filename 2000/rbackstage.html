            opens with a quick look back at 1993. The camera, situated amid a
            crowd, looks up at a scrawny kid, freestyling like nobody's
            business. The folks on screen respond enthusiastically: he's got
            obvious skills. As the image fades out, this scrawny kid declares
            himself: &quot;Jay-Z, the greatest nigga.&quot; <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Cut
            to 1999. Jiggaman's all grown up and headlining the &quot;Hard Knock
            Life Tour&quot;. The camera still looks up at him, but now the image
            is high-resolution, the lighting is designed, the stage is huge, and
            Jay-Z is The Matrix, a bonafide superstar flashing Roc-A-Wear
            clothing and serious ice (Roc-a-Wear being the clothing line
            attached to Jay-Z's label, Roc-A-Fella: anyone who's anyone in
            hiphop these days has a clothing line). And here, as the documentary
            <i>Backstage</i> introduces the tour, Jay and DMX are performing <i>Snoopy
            Track</i>. Larger than life, Jay raps, &quot;Here's to the black
            culture.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Named
            for Jay-Z's first crossover single -- the one that samples from the
            musical <i>Annie</i> -- the Hard Knock Life Tour was a smashing and
            surprising success, being both peaceful and profitable (to the tune
            of $18 million). <i>Backstage</i>, directed by Chris Fiore, tracks
            the multi-act show as Jay-Z -- along with fellow headliners X,
            Method Man, and Redman -- pack arenas, travel on buses, roll dice,
            smoke dope. The documentary's look approximates a raw and honest
            insider's view of life on the road, powered by handheld video
            footage, fast-cuts, and commotion in the frames. But after a few
            minutes, it's clear that what you're watching is not some wild and
            unpredictable mix-up of events and people, but a careful
            construction of image and effect. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            construction occurs by way of standard concert film techniques --
            interviews with performers (Jay-Z, X, Meth, Redman, Ja Rule, DJ
            Clue, Amil, et. al.) and managers (Jay's road manager Ty Ty Smith,
            tour manager Ron Byrd), a brief moment with that funny little guy
            named Pain in The Ass, who does the skit voices on Jay-Z's records
            (and who, once on camera, reveals he can rhyme some as well), as
            well as some clips from performances on stage and even a couple of
            impromptu rhymes on the bus or backstage. Most of the interviewees
            predictably give major props to the principals (<i>everyone </i>loves
            X; don't even look for a hater) and a few allude to beef, in
            particular, those interviews with Roc-a-Fella CEO and co-founder
            (and this film's producer) Damon Dash. He's what you might call a
            &quot;forceful personality,&quot; plainly proud of his
            accomplishments and ever-ready to take on anyone he thinks might be
            disrespecting him. And so, you see Dash chew out Kevin Liles from
            Def Jam (co-sponsoring the tour), whom Dash believes is hogging PR
            limelight. One of his more memorable tirades comes over the fact
            that Liles has provided the tour members with swank jackets
            featuring the Def Jam logo, meaning that said logo will be featured
            prominently in photos and personal appearances. According to Dash,
            this leaves Roc-A-Fella at a disadvantage, promotionally speaking.
            (Presumably, Roc-A-Fella jackets would have been fine, had Dash or
            someone else thought of the idea first.) Memorably, Dash makes his
            case -- loudly, at times -- while being barbered, his bald head
            popped up from a protective cape, the camera maintaining a
            deferential distance and sometimes swinging to catch Liles'
            relatively subdued rejoinders. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">On
            one level, this footage suggests Dash (who undoubtedly had some say
            in the editing room) is candidly revealing a moment of vanity and/or
            weakness, like when you're listening to Madonna complain about
            Warren Beatty in <i>Truth or Dare</i> or Biggie recall being
            suicidal in <i>The Show</i>. But there's something else going on
            here, in that Dash resembles one of those movie mafia dons who get
            manicures while planning their insidious business. Looked at from
            that angle, the scene seems less an instance of brutal honesty than
            part of an elaborate process of self-invention: Dash is transformed
            -- almost -- from behind the scenes wheeler-dealer to movie star,
            rehearsing his part for a straight-to-video gangsta picture. Of
            course, this kind of self-love is not news in the music-celeb biz:
            Puffy Combs and Jermaine Dupree used to be producers, too. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At
            the same time, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Backstage</i>
            is coming up on a wave (mainstream interst in &quot;hip hop,&quot;
            however it's conceived, has penetrated <i>Nightline</i>, running a
            three part series beginning on the night that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Backstage</i>
            and <i>Turn It Up</i> open). But this wave is incessantly,
            increasingly complicated: &quot;keeping it real&quot; isn't what it
            used to be. The film offers up some real-life stories, mostly about
            success. Taking you through brief histories of the up-and-coming
            stars, like Memphis Bleek and Beanie Sigel (he of &quot;The
            Truth,&quot; here deemed by Jay &quot;the next one&quot;), the film
            also grants some (subtly? inadvertently?) ironic distance on the
            hype. Peep Bleek, riding in his limo, as he's proclaiming, &quot;I
            live what I'm talking about, makes my music more real.&quot; Or
            check Beanie Sigel's manager, asserting that he was instantly
            impressed with his man's skills: &quot;He was signed twelve hours
            after I met him. True story.&quot; Cut to Sigel, who, for his part,
            maintains that, beyond his own &quot;good-ass looks,&quot; it takes
            hard work, long hours, and perseverance to make it: &quot;Go to them
            labels. Keep bangin' on them niggas' doors.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Of
            course, ambition, talent, good luck, and effort can only take you so
            far. The film addresses racism in the business by underlining the
            tour's lack of &quot;incidents.&quot; This stands as proof to the
            rest of the planet that it's possible to mount an expensive,
            large-venue hip hop show. &quot;Everybody expects violence,&quot;
            says Ty Ty Smith during his interview. But, he notes proudly, on the
            bus they're watching <i>Good Will Hunting</i>, not some gangster
            movie. DJ Twinz Z adds that, at white rock shows, mosh-pits are
            &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;bloody,&quot; but if a similar violence
            were to happen at a hip hop show, &quot;they'd shut it down.&quot;
            The point is well taken and far too familiar to anyone who pays
            attention to such things, and it's sad testament to current media
            culture that it has to be made at all. Given the subsequent success
            of last year's Cash Money-Ruff Ryders tour, and the so-far-so-good
            behavior of those involved with Up in Smoke (excepting Eminem's
            arrests on assault and weapons charges and one or two other
            altercations), we might be looking toward the day when such
            over-determined mainstream anxieties about hiphop tours per se
            (i.e., shows featuring young black males wearing baggy jeans and
            bandanas) will subside. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Aside
            from such testimony, the film offers precious little evidence of how
            the shows actually go down. The actual concert scenes are, in a
            word, brief. There's a limit to how &quot;live&quot; a filmed show
            can seem, certainly, but the long tradition of concert docs includes
            some unforgettable and thankfully recorded performances -- Biggie or
            Run-DMC in Brian Robbins' <i>The Show</i>, Dylan in D.A.
            Pennebaker's <i>Don't Look Back</i>, David Byrne in Jonathan Demme's
            <i>Stop Making Sense</i>. It's almost frustrating to see the
            legendarily charismatic DMX do less than a minute of &quot;Slippin&quot;
            or &quot;My Niggas,&quot; or to watch the jump-suited-and-harnessed
            Meth and Redman fly over viewers' heads in a series of different
            performances of &quot;How High.&quot; You believe X when he asserts,
            his head down and his body pressed against a wall, &quot;The only
            part of the tour I like is the one hour I'm onstage.&quot; Frankly,
            I would love to see a little more of that hour. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still,
            the film's onstage moments are the precious few where the two women
            on the tour -- Ruff Ryders' First Lady, Eve, and Roc-A-Fella's Amil
            -- get a chance to say much of anything. Amil appears on camera a
            couple of times to attest to her boys' prowess and loyalty, but
            other than that, the girls don't get much play -- or more
            accurately, the female MCs don't get much. To illustrate the full
            fun and glory of life on a music tour (and we all know this is true
            for rock and hip hop shows alike), <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Backstage</i>
            offers repeated images of the apparently always-available coochie-mamas,
            their identities blurred out by yellow smiley faces or signs that
            say &quot;Your Ad Here.&quot; While this cutesy device is startling
            at first, by the time you see the fourth or fifth anonymous-mama
            offering some crew member a lap-dance or heading off to a rapper's
            hotel room, you're way too used to it. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            most insistent note struck by <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Backstage</i>
            -- in interviews and performances -- is that everyone is glad to be
            there. They have flashes of homesickness and boredom, silliness and
            tension, but according to the film, these were more than made up for
            by the sense of camaraderie, mutual respect, and the genuine thrill
            they all developed during their months on the tour. And if you don't
            walk away from <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Backstage</i> feeling like you know more about these performers than you
            did before, you have probably seen them as they imagined themselves
            at this moment, real or not.</font></span>
