            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>While Chen Kaige was spending
            years laboring on <i>The Emperor</i> and the Assassin, fellow
            director Zhang Yimou turned out two modest films, <i>The Road Home</i>
            and this picture, which is starts out in one of the many modern-day,
            dusty, rural villages scattered around mainland China.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Wei (Wei Minzhi), a
            thirteen-year-old girl, is sent to take charge of a class of grade
            school-aged children while their instructor, Teacher Gao (Gao Enman),
            attends to a family matter. In exchange, Wei is to get about forty
            yuan (which currently is the equivalent of $4.83 in U.S. currency).
            Wei hasn't even finished her own schooling, and is scarcely older
            than some of kids whom she's to teach, and with little idea of how
            to go about doing it, let alone what their present curriculum is
            (Teacher Gao tells her, for instance, that she should just write a
            lesson on the blackboard and tell the students to copy it in their
            notebooks. When the sun, during days when it's sunny, reaches a
            particular spot on a schoolroom post, that's the time when she's to
            let them out of class for the day).</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Zhang (Zhang Huike), who has dark,
            mischievous eyes and a rascally smile, is the class' requisite
            cutup. When he doesn't turn up for school one day, Wei learns that
            he's been summarily sent to the city to work for his family. A
            government mandate states that every child must receive schooling,
            and Wei promised Teacher Gao that there would be the same number of
            children in class when he gets back as there were when he left
            (roughly the same number, in fact, of pieces of chalk that the
            schoolteacher gave Wei to use during his absence). Wei tries to get
            on a bus to go to the city, and bring Zhang back; when she can't
            take the bus, she walks to the city.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Some of the scenes in the film --
            such as those showing how Wei uses the class' help in figuring out
            how much it would cost her to accomplish her trip, during which we
            see her grow as a person and develop rapport with the students --
            have a schematic quality to them. The scenes showing Wei's search in
            the city, though, do not. They are genuinely affecting, perhaps even
            more so since Zhang Yimou used non-professional actors in the film
            (many of whom, in the end credits, are revealed to serve in the same
            capacity and professions, from shop proprietor to village mayor and
            television station manager, as they do in the film). Both Wei and
            Zhang Huiki have a spontaneity that comes across in ways that do not
            make their characters black-and-white. Zhang is not a genuinely mean
            kid, and Wei is neither entirely helpless, nor does she have a
            desire to become a stern taskmistress or a martyr. But her
            determination is quietly intense and fills the second part of the
            film, so that our feelings, in the end, are genuinely earned.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In a plot move that has particular
            significance to Western audiences, Wei's search comes to the
            attention of a TV morning show, which seizes upon it for its human
            interest angle, and the pert, cosmopolitanly-dressed host (Li Fanfan)
            presents Wei on the air, to tell the viewers all about her search
            for Zhang -- whereas Wei, having not grown up in a TV culture that
            cultivates savvy and self-promotion, promptly goes blank, until the
            host coaxes her to look into the studio camera's lens and speak as
            if she were talking to her lost student herself. Later, the show
            trucks its cameras back to the village to do a follow-up: Zhang is
            asked what he most remembers about his experiences in the city. The
            young boy's response is not vain or self-pitying, but direct,
            levelheaded, and quietly devastating: &quot;That I had to beg for
            food. I will always remember that.&quot;</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I would like to add one additional
            comment pertaining to <i>Not One More</i>. The film was scheduled to
            be shown locally, once a night, for one week only, in a multiplex
            auditorium that has forty seats and no stereo. Yet, on the night I
            attended, three ladies had made the twelve-mile trip from Medford
            specifically to see this film, and the showing for that night was
            half full. Yet, how many more people would have attended if it was
            being shown in better facilities?</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Exhibitors and distributors claim
            that people don't want to see movies with subtitles. This is bushwah.
            There is an audience out there looking for films such as <i>Not One
            Less</i>, but places must be made where seeing them doesn't turn a
            chore, and people can be comfortably<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>seated and receive the optimum projection and sound that they
            are entitled to. Otherwise, everyone loses.</font>
