            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Even before its opening credits
            conclude, you can tell that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Almost
            Famous</i> will be bulging with invention and unpredictability.
            Instead of simply scrolling some boldface words across the screen,
            director Cameron Crowe aims his camera at a boy’s scribbling hand.
            The youth is jotting down the acknowledgments across pages of a
            school notebook. Meanwhile, we sneak glances at his a desk, a
            music-lover’s treasure chest that’s chock-full of early
            seventies rock memorabilia. Names like Bowie and Rundgren are etched
            across laminated passes and tour posters. There’s a key from the
            Plaza Hotel buried within these trinkets. Even the name of Crowe’s
            production company, announced as &quot;Vinyl Films,&quot; is a
            tip-off that his latest movie doesn’t feature any current icons
            from MTV. We’re talking twelve-inch albums and Don Kirshner’s
            Rock Concert on television.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Before long, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Almost
            Famous</i> is eavesdropping on the family of William Miller, a model
            eleven-year-old son to Elaine, his college professor mom (Frances
            McDormand), who is seen flipping soy cutlets over a stove for her
            beloved son and his moody teenage sister, Anita (Zooey Leschanel).
            While Ma Miller debates the virtues of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">To
            Kill a Mockingbird</i> with her straight and narrow son (who
            idolizes the book’s noble attorney, Atticus Finch), Anita prefers
            Simon and Garfunkel and is soon ditching her repressed San Diego
            home with a hot rod driving boyfriend. Before departing, however,
            she leaves young William with a box of her cherished rock records.
            &quot;Look under your bed,&quot; she urges. &quot;It will set you
            free.&quot;</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">William’s mom, however, is
            obviously not an avid fan of Led Zeppelin’s &quot;Brown
            Bomber&quot; album. &quot;It’s the poetry of sex, drugs, and rock
            ‘n roll,&quot; she snaps. The devil’s music has no place in her
            academia-minded home, and certainly no place in the life of William,
            her &quot;accelerated son,&quot; whose high marks in school have
            seen him placed two grades ahead. William appreciates such maternal
            concern, but he’s becoming alienated and lonely, awash in a sea of
            older peers. The loss of his father in an auto wreck years earlier
            only adds to this awkward kid’s desperate need for acceptance.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There’s a magic scene in which
            William initially peruses his sister’s records. The Rolling
            Stones’ &quot;Get Yer Ya Ya’s Out,&quot; Led Zeppelin II, and
            classics from the likes of Bob Dylan, Joni Mitchell and The Who
            stare back at this starry-eyed onlooker, who probes the sacred discs
            like Indiana Jones relishing a priceless archeological find. As the
            familiar record covers jumped from the screen, audience members at a
            recent Seattle screening muttered audible &quot;Ooohs,&quot; &quot;Aahhs,&quot;
            and cheerful giggles, no doubt reliving their own adolescent
            initiations into rock ‘n roll.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Flash forward to 1973, and William
            is a high school rock fanatic who seeks out Creem editor and rock
            critic Lester Bangs (a weathered Phillip Seymour Hoffman). A
            seen-it-all cynic, Bangs believes that rock music is on a downward
            slide and on the verge of selling out. &quot;You got here for the
            last gasp of rock ‘n roll,&quot; he tells William. Despite such
            negativity, Bangs becomes a mentor to the doe-eyed kid, who aspires
            to become a rock writer. So much for following in the legal
            footsteps of Atticus Finch, as his mom would have hoped. &quot;The
            pay is low,&quot; Bangs admits, &quot;but you get lots of free
            records.&quot;</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There’s a telling scene where the
            hunched, homely Bangs (who could almost be the adult version of
            William, sprinkled with liberal doses of bitter wariness) looks into
            his protégé’s virgin eyes and lets loose with a hearty
            chuckle.&quot; There’s absolutely <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">nothin’</i>
            controversial about you, man. You’ve got an honest face.&quot;
            Sensing that bands will open up to William’s seeming naivete and
            benign presence, Bangs sends him on a mission. &quot;Thirty five
            dollars for 1,000 words on Black Sabbath,&quot; he offers.
            &quot;Make it honest. Unmerciful.&quot; His parting advice to
            William is the sacred rule that a rock journalist <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">never</i>
            makes friends with the band. &quot;Friendship is the booze that they
            feed you,&quot; he insists, convinced that such an error would
            result in a compromised article.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There’s genuine humor in the
            image of William’s mother driving him to the Black Sabbath concert
            and urging him to return to the car at the sound of her &quot;family
            whistle.&quot; Equally honest is the following scene, where the
            green journalist tries to persuade a backstage bouncer to let him
            in. &quot;You’re not on the list,&quot; he’s told, before having
            the door slammed in his face. Seemingly defeated, William eyes the
            concert’s opening band, up-and-comers Stillwater, as they emerge
            from a tour bus. Requesting that the band provide him with backstage
            access, he’s initially given the cold shoulder. &quot;You’re the
            enemy,&quot; grunts band vocalist Jeff Bebe (Jason Lee), &quot;a
            rock writer.&quot; However, when William starts babbling obscure
            trivia about the band, praising them for their choice in album
            producers, they suddenly take an interest in this runty dweeb with
            an encyclopedic knowledge base. Certainly, someone who is this much
            of a fan and so unthreatening of a presence can’t be <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">that</i>
            bad.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Stillwater takes the boy backstage,
            befriending him. Pleasantly overwhelmed by the barrage of energy
            found amidst this zoo of roadies, groupies, musicians, and
            amplifiers, William’s jaw drops like that of a lottery contestant
            being told he holds a winning number. He hangs out with
            Stillwater’s enigmatic, mysterious guitarist, Russell Hammond
            (played by the under-appreciated Billy Crudup), and meets Penny Lane
            (Kate Hudson, daughter of Goldie Hawn), a young strawberry blonde
            who insists she’s not a groupie but might be in denial. &quot;We
            don’t have intercourse with band members,&quot; she insists,
            referring to the Band Aids, a group of female fans who travel with
            Stillwater as they tour from city to city. &quot;Only blow jobs.
            We’re in it for the music.&quot;</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Eventually, William is hired by
            Rolling Stone magazine to cover Stillwater’s rise to prominence.
            His over-the-phone conversations with assistant editor Ben
            Fong-Torres (Terry Chen) are comic masterpieces. Unaware that
            William is a mere fifteen years old, the magazine asks him
            sight-unseen to do the feature. William deepens his pipsqueak voice,
            trying to sound like an older, more seasoned writing veteran. Later,
            when Fong-Torres demands that William picks up the pace and
            completes the story, the boy responds, &quot;I’m getting a lot of
            good stuff out here.&quot; Listening to the nubile young Band Aids
            giggling in the backdrop during a party, the Rolling Stone staffer
            offers the classic retort: &quot;Yeah -- it <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">sounds</i>
            like it.&quot;</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The rest of the film follows
            William’s odyssey as he tours the country with his newfound
            musical friends. Meanwhile, ever-vigilant mother Elaine monitors his
            every move via phone conversations, ending each talk with her
            gospel: &quot;Don’t do drugs!&quot; It’s a hoot to watch the
            brown-haired, corduroy-covered lad holding out a microphone, only to
            pull the tape player off of a table and onto the floor. The band
            gets a charge out of this new blood, but they’re also wary that
            William’s pen could be used as a formidable weapon. &quot;Remember
            that he’s writing for the magazine that broke up Cream, and
            trashed every record that Led Zeppelin ever put out,&quot; snaps
            blowhard singer Bebe. &quot;But it <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">would
            </i>be great to be on the cover.&quot;</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Bebe’s warnings have merit.
            Stillwater aren’t always a model of competent perfection, as when
            samples of new tour merchandise are brought backstage, and the
            singer fights with Hammond over the fact that the guitarist’s
            silk-screened image stands out more than those of the other band
            members. &quot;I’m one of the out-of-focus guys,&quot; he snarls.
            Bebe’s jealousy over the more handsome and popular Hammond also
            comes to the surface when he points an accusing finger and barks,
            &quot;Your <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">looks</i> have become a problem.&quot; Meanwhile, William also gets a
            glimpse of Russell at his most candidly reckless, when the musician
            drops some acid at a fan’s house and climbs onto the roof.
            &quot;I’m a golden god,&quot; he exclaims, before leaping into a
            swimming pool below.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Almost
            Famous</font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2"> culminates in an
            inevitable cycle of betrayals. Penny Lane, covering up her teen
            vulnerability with tough talk and surface sophistication, becomes
            Russell’s love interest, but William is also smitten with this
            energetic waif. Jealous of her romance with the guitarist, and
            disappointed with Stillwater’s poor treatment of her, the boy
            ultimately confronts the band and risks losing both their trust <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">and</i>
            his hard-earned story. Suddenly, Stillwater doesn’t look so cool
            anymore.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The miraculous thing about <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Almost Famous</i>, however, is its ultimate faith in humanity -- even
            the humanity of road-weary rock stars. This is the flip side of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Sid
            &amp; Nancy, The Doors</i>, and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Decline of Western Civilization, Part II</i>, all of which pummeled
            us with rock’s most unsavory, and excessive qualities. It’s
            ironic that Crowe, who actually lived life in the clutches of Led
            Zeppelin, The Allman Brothers, and The Eagles, portrays his subjects
            in a much more sympathetic light than previous directors helming
            rock films, who didn’t &quot;live it.&quot; Crudup’s
            string-picker Hammond has a dark side, but he’s also capable of
            truly decent deeds, shifting from sinner to saint depending on how
            guilty his conscience is at any given moment. Compared to Oliver
            Stone’s portrayal of Jim Morrison in 1989’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Doors</i>, where booze and blow jobs seem the only true priorities,
            Hammond at least comes across as a guy who cares about what others
            have to say. During a telephone conversation with Elaine, she
            chastises him for having &quot;compromised values and diminished
            brain cells that you throw away like confetti.&quot; Instead of
            laughing her off, however, Russell is terrified by this maternal
            call onto the carpet. &quot;Your mom kind of freaked me out,&quot;
            he admits to William after hanging up the receiver with a trembling
            hand.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s this genuine concern for
            others that makes Crowe’s motley crew a more sympathetic bunch
            than, say, Motley Crue. These are guys trying to be ruthless, but
            feeling the wrath of Jimminy Cricket whenever their lives veer too
            far into the fast lane. Such was the spirit of Crowe’s last film,
            the megahit <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Jerry Maguire</i>,
            where Tom Cruise played a sports agent whose decency is challenged
            by his yuppie peers, but ultimately acts as the anchor that balances
            his marriage and career. While Maguire’s arenas were marked by
            touchdowns, not guitar solos, he could almost be seen as a spiritual
            cousin to the less extroverted, but equally tormented Hammond.
            There’s also an echo of John Cusack’s character from Crowe’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Say
            Anything, </i>a hopelessly romantic slacker who ultimately wins the
            heart of high school overachiever Ione Skye by throwing his jacket
            over glass shards so that his goddess can walk across a curb uncut.
            He might not be <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Gladiator</i>,
            but his noble gesture truly does come from the heart. This sense of
            goodwill permeates all of Crowe’s work and sets him apart from
            other directors.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you’re after the seedy side of
            rock ‘n roll, read Stephen Davis’ books <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Hammer
            of the Gods</i> (a less-than-sympathetic Led Zeppelin tell-all) and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
