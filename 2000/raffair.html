            review by <a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>, 18 August 2000</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Belgian director Frédéric
            Fonteyne’s second feature (based on a screenplay by invariable
            collaborator, novelist/playwright/director Philippe Blasband) is a
            short but ultimately tedious affair. Even the title is immemorial,
            destined to be as misremembered as the pronouns (Her and Him) that
            share the anonymous lead roles. Arriving on U.S. shores a year after
            its European premiere as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Une
            liaison pornographique/A Pornographic Affair</i>, distributor Fine
            Line Features opted for a blander designation for this decidedly
            non-graphic role-playing fantasy. But changing from one confusing
            moniker to another? <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Zut alors!</i></b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Whatever lightness there is in the
            title, this Gallic gabfest is heavy on words. Printed ones (personal
            ads in a porno magazine) lead to initially nervous spoken others by
            two strangers (Nathalie Baye and Sergi Lopez) in search of sexual
            fantasy. The uneventful story unfolds as a series of flashbacks
            during separate interviews with each of the principals by an unknown
            documentarian (Jacques Viala) for unidentified reasons. The intimate
            relationship develops, deepens, weakens, and disintegrates, mostly
            around a bistro table across from the Parisian hotel where the
            couple copulate every few days. Whatever Olympic ecstasies they
            experience are hidden behind closed doors or under rumpled sheets;
            everything they’re into is mostly inferred through conversation
            (She’s into hairy Spaniards). Their flights of carnal fancy are as
            undefined as the clandestine Venus Flytrap maneuver espoused on
            TV’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">L.A. Law</i>. After months of these guilt-free explorations, all I could
            wonder was: don’t these people have jobs? They might not have
            lives, but surely they have to work. How do they get off having so
            much free time to chat it up, get it on, and sip a glass wine (Her)
            or dunk a sugar cube in cognac (Him)?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Fonteyne experiments with colors --
            garish red hotel hallways and a bright blue bedroom -- but fails to
            titillate any hue-filled excitement. The camerawork by Virginie
            Saint-Martin is pedantic except for some darken, deserted city
            streets highlighted with a blur of streetlights. Or an intoxicating
            restaurant scene when the couple is encircled, their dinner table
            seemingly a wagon train surrounded by Indians. The ambient sound of
            other patrons is muted so we hear just the couple. But they quickly
            head back to the hotel for a hanky-panky nightcap and the same old
            boring, prurient-free, chit-chat.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, chat-em-ups can be just as
            exciting as shoot-em-ups. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">My
            Dinner with André</i> and the Spalding Gray’s monologues (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Swimming
            to Cambodia</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Monster in a
            Box</i>) are terrifically entertaining. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">An
            Affair of Love</i> isn’t.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The only intriguing characters are
            the short-lived Mr. Lignaux (Paul Pavel), a confused old man who
            collapses outside their bedroom. Estranged from his wife
            (&quot;I’ve been killing her for forty years.&quot;), he’s a
            devout philanderer who has strayed through a succession of sluts.
            Hospitalized, his unhappy wife (Sylvie Van den Elsen) is notified
            against his wishes and both end up worse off for the involvement of
            Him and Her in their lives.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I know it shouldn’t be, but one
            obstacle is the film’s in French and the subtitles endless. If you
            still need a good French &quot;flique,&quot; go see Patrice
            Leconte’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Girl on the Bridge</i>,
            an unusual and absorbing love story. Another problem with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">An
            Affair of Love</i> is that the performances by Baye and Lopez are
            stronger than the under-stuffed material. A great actress such as
            the three-time <i>César</i> winner Baye (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Return of Martin Guerre</i>) and the strong presence of Lopez
            aren’t enough to give this European entry more than a passing
            glance by American audiences. We have no sympathies, no brass ring
            to clasp as they go round their merry way. Their histories are empty
            pages, a novel with no heart. They don’t exchanges names, phone
            numbers, or addresses. Oddly they mention in their interviews that
            their relationship evolved from emails (after the magazine ad,
            before the physical contact), so why not use screen names to
            identify one another? Were their Internet names &quot;Him01&quot;
            and &quot;Her02?&quot; At the least you would think they’d have
            some pet designations for each other:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Mickey and Minnie, perhaps, in deference to EuroDisney?
            Ultimately the film gets as lost as &quot;She&quot; does during one
            of her recollections, her motion slowing and the focus blurring. And
            you snoozing.</font>
