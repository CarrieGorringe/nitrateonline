            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>You
            haven't lived until you've seen Drew Barrymore moonwalking to
            &quot;Billie Jean.&quot; This isn't to say that you absolutely need
            to run out to see <i>Charlie's Angels</i>, but it's a good reason to
            think about doing so. As Dylan, the troubled-tough-girl member of
            this big screen version of Charlie's famous TV/T&amp;A squad,
            Barrymore brings her usual energy and edge, as well as her
            Hollywood-veteran's muscle (she co-produced the movie with her
            Flower Films partner Nancy Juvonen). She also brings her signature
            good humor (as demonstrated in her frankly terrible moonwalk), her
            ex-boyfriend (Luke Wilson, playing a very pleasant bartender), and
            her current fiance, Tom Green, playing Dylan's tugboat captain
            boyfriend, Chad. Or, as Chad refers to himself, &quot;The
            Chad,&quot; as in his plaintive query when she departs abruptly
            after receiving a mysterious phone call: worried that she's leaving
            him because of his own poor performance, Chad whines, &quot;Was it
            The Chad?&quot;</b></font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Of
            course, the reason for her departure is not The Chad, it's The
            Charlie (John Forsythe repeating his invisible man role from the TV
            series), calling on His Angels to perform yet another impossible
            mission. Red-tressed Dylan's partners in derring-do are blond
            Natalie (Cameron Diaz) and raven-haired Alex (Lucy Liu), each useful
            in her own way. Sweet Nat's a bit dingy; brainy Alex tends to be
            stern and Sabrina-ish (Kate Jackson's character on the TV series);
            and Dylan, well, she's just an archetypal bad girl -- in her
            introductory flashback, she looks real surly in her prison uniform.
            All the Angels can, of course, kick and karate chop like nobody's
            business, and all are remarkably adept with their many high tech
            gadgets (minus guns -- the Angels adamantly and politically work
            without them). A preliminary mini-escapade establishes their supreme
            in-chargeness, not to mention their extraordinary fashion sense.
            They're tracking a villain who's on his way out of town with his
            stolen goods, seated on a plane -- unfortunately for him -- next to
            the imposing LL Cool J (and if you've seen the trailer, you know
            good sport LL is really playing a <i>Mission-Impossible</i>-ish
            disguise for one of the girls). The Angels proceed to get the crook
            off the plane and take plummeting through the atmosphere sans
            parachutes (in a sleek black jumpsuit, Alex gets to do that cool
            shoot-through-the-air-like-a-human-bullet routine), and then land
            him in a speedboat, driven by a radiant, bikini-clad Natalie. </font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            movie is full of such James Bondish excitement, as well as elaborate
            martial arts (digitally enhanced and choreographed by <i>The Matrix</i>
            coordinator, Cheung-Yan Yuen), well-cast supporting players
            (including Bill Murray as Bosley and Crispin Glover as the sinister
            Thin Man), and much adorable girl-bonding. So what if the actual
            plot is ridiculous in conception and most of its execution? The
            basics go something like this: a stereotypically wussy software
            billionaire, Eric Knox (Sam Rockwell, last seen abusing mice in <i>The
            Green Mile</i>), has been kidnapped, and his company's shady
            president, Vivian Wood (Kelly Lynch), hires the Charles Townsend
            Agency to retrieve him, along with some stolen secret
            voice-identification software, which, in the wrong hands, will
            surely cause worldwide destruction. Charlie sends the Angels after a
            nefarious and charismatic suspect, Roger Corwin (Tim Curry). While
            undercover at a swank party, the Angels spot Thin Man (who
            apparently works for Corwin) and chase him down a back stairway,
            tossing their girly garments as they go, so that by the time they
            catch Thin Man and engage in the inevitable tussle, they're wearing
            appropriately audacious black leather and spandex. Voila! Ready for
            another spectacular action scene! </font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Blah
            blah blah -- they retrieve Knox, go after the software, find
            themselves betrayed and fight their way out of a carefully
            orchestrated situation, so that each Angel has her very own nemesis
            to beat down, the most flat-footed being Liu's encounter with Glover
            and the most fun being Barrymore's outsmarting a slew of cocky
            brutes, using the chair she's tied to as a weapon. Directed by music
            video dynamo McG (he's worked with Wyclef, Korn, Smashmouth, and,
            um, Mase), the film maintains a good-natured, nonsensical speediness
            while skipping blithely over its narrative voids. And this seems a
            reasonable strategy for what the film is: a po-mo sample movie that
            looks pretty good and that borrows liberally from any number of
            sources, including a house where Dylan (naked and running for her
            life) must seek refuge, surprising two young boys watching TV --
            this is the very house where eight-year-old Drew filmed <i>E.T. </i>so
            very long ago. </font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            pleasant as it is to watch a movie that's so clever and cheerily
            ironic -- and it is surprisingly pleasant -- it might be worth
            asking what's at stake for the Angels in 2000. Are they ass-kicking
            role models, Nokia spokesmodels, or what? On her press campaign for
            the movie, Barrymore has developed her own definitional mantra: the
            Angels are capable as well as beautiful, they're not afraid to flip
            their hair. And it's true, like their TV predecessors, these girls
            are proudly self-parodic, with more expensive FX and less time to
            establish their friends-till-the-end camaraderie (which, on TV, was
            never true anyway, with all the Angel turnovers). They're very nice
            and self-mocking superheroes, like the Spice Girls with martial arts
            training, not so angst-ridden as the X-Men or so brooding as the Mod
            Squadders. (Okay, they misstep occasionally: Dylan sleeps with the
            wrong guy and pays for it, but she survives to return to her true
            love and reassure him that &quot;The Chad was great!&quot; The
            totally in-love and grateful look on Tom Green's face at this moment
            is almost worth the price of admission.) You could say that the
            Angels are <i>the</i> exemplary non-threatening, multi-culti
            millennial-year poster girls. As much as they're obviously making
            fun of the familiar sexed-up conventions they embody, they also
            don't appear to be conceding much ground on the
            &quot;chicks-can-do-it-too&quot; front. They can look as fine as
            Keanu Reeves flying through digital air with legs swinging (and Diaz
            can play white as easily as Reeves), and their jokes are as
            preemptive as the next guy's (our non-man LL groans when he sees <i>T.
            J. Hooker, The Movie</i> on the plane). </font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">What's
            more, the Angels are quite hip to their own socio-political
            environment. Their angelic perkiness is most often underlined by
            completely bubbly soundtrack choices -- &quot;Angel of the
            Morning&quot; to mark their perpetual dewiness; &quot;Turning
            Japanese&quot; when they're undercover in an Asian massage parlor;
            Blur's &quot;Song 2&quot; or Heart's &quot;Barracuda&quot; when they
            need some adrenaline pumping; Destiny's Child's &quot;Independent
            Women (Part 1)&quot; when they're at a fast food drive-in (let's
            imagine this as a comment on &quot;crass commercialism&quot;). But a
            couple of songs are manifestly aggressive, even obnoxious, choices
            -- Pharoahe Monch's &quot;Simon Says&quot; (the clip omits lines
            like &quot;Rub on your titties!&quot;) or Prodigy's
            once-controversial &quot;Smack My Bitch Up&quot; during a relatively
            brutal fight scene. And there it is: smacking your bitch up needn't
            be cause for uproar when said bitch's identity is in question:
            Cameron Diaz or Crispin Glover? (You decide.) And this does seem the
            film's most profound point, that eventually, everything that might
            once be deemed offensive -- from '70s network jiggle to '90s MTV
            outrage -- is grist for the mainstream mill. <o:p>
