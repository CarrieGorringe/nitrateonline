            Phelps (Tim Meadows) has a big dick. Or at least, this seems to be
            the primary idea behind this latest unfunny comedy from SNL Studios
            and producer Lorne Michaels. Leon's prominent member apparently
            drives women wild with desire and men -- especially the wealthy
            white ones who have young trophy wives who look like they've just
            stepped out of <i>Beverly Hills, 90210</i> -- wild with jealousy.
            (Unless those men are driven wild with desire as well, a possibility
            nearly-exposed during one of the film's many less-than-subtle
            moments.) Caught somewhere between these responses, Leon Phelps, the
            un-smoothest of love machines, kind of ambles along, quaint and
            sweet-natured and never more than remotely interesting. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Did
            I say &quot;remotely interesting&quot;? Let me rephrase. As an
            example of someone's recycled concept of black male sexuality circa
            the 1970s, Leon Phelps is annoying and reductive. And it's not that
            I don't get that he's a joke. It's that that premise in itself is
            annoying, first, because Leon is just never very funny, and second,
            what little bit of humor might exist (mainly in his costumes:
            matching plaid bellbottom pants and jacket with extra-wide lapels,
            and that cute 'fro) is never very sharp or satirical. Leon is too
            accommodating and easily distracted -- by his you-know-what -- to
            remind anyone of the more famous emblems of the 70s, f*ck-the-man,
            streetwise heroes like Shaft and Superfly. So, Leon is left with the
            Huggy Bears as his most obvious satirical target, which is too bad,
            because when he was stealing scenes on <i>Starsky and Hutch</i>,
            Huggy Bear (Antonio Fargas) was already his own best joke (as Keenen
            Ivory Wayans knew when he had him wear goldfish-bowl platform shoes
            in <i>I'm Gonna Get You Sucka</i>). Meadows devised Leon for those
            endless <i>Saturday Night Live</i> four-minute skits back in 1997
            (according to SNL Studios' press materials, Leon's appearance with
            guest host Monica Lewinsky last year &quot;drew national
            attention,&quot; whatever that means), and co-wrote the film script
            with Dennis McNicholas and Andrew Steele. He says that he modeled
            the character after guys he used to see when he was working in a
            Detroit liquor store, guys whose clothes always matched no matter
            how cheap and cheesy they were. And yes, Leon's clothes do match. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            the joke on the &quot;era&quot; -- say, on its many excesses and
            peculiar trends and tastes -- that he might have embodied tends to
            be lost in the film's shuffle of skits (Leon and company can't
            sustain a scene longer than a couple of minutes). <i>The Ladies Man</i>
            is also tediously preoccupied with white men's fear of black men's
            sexual prowess. This is an old, easy-joke theme, but the film is
            like a dog with a bone -- so to speak. <i>The Ladies Man</i> spends
            an inordinate amount of time following the activities of the anxious
            (mostly) white men whose (mostly) white wives and girlfriends have
            had affairs with local black stud Leon (there is, to be fair, one
            black man in one or two of the gang-of-angry-cuckolds shots). Chief
            among these men are Lance DeLune (Will Ferrell), married, unhappily
            it appears, to Honey (ex-<i>90210</i> bitchy babe Tiffani-Amber
            Thiessen... oh, sorry, she's now going by Tiffani Thiessen) and
            Barney (Lee Evans). Leon's exploits are so very legendary and the
            hearts he's left behind are so very wounded, that the men have
            formed a support group whose meetings are announced on their
            website. At the time you become privy to the action, the group is
            deciding to take action: they gather up their golf clubs and rolling
            pins and 9mm handguns and pursue Leon with the intention of killing
            him. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Around
            the same time, it so happens (and if I'm making this sound like
            there's a plot at work here, I certainly don't mean to), Leon has
            been fired from his job as host for a Chicago radio talk show,
            &quot;The Ladies Man.&quot; His loyal producer, Julie (Karyn
            Parsons, last seen doing a decent Valley Girl imitation as Hilary on
            <i>Fresh Prince of Bel Air</i>) quits her job in protest, and
            together they traipse about the local environs looking for work. A
            sequence of overkill ridiculous job interviews and auditions ensues:
            watch the middle-aged station manager squirm when he hears Lester's
            ribald sexual advice demo-tape; watch Lester squirm when he
            interviews a nun who wants to tell stories about her upcoming
            missionary position. Each of these mini-scenes could pass for one of
            those overlong <i>SNL</i> skits. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            you must know, given the fact that Parsons has second billing, Julie
            and Leon eventually realize their true love for one another, despite
            the fact that she seems a fairly sensible and sensitive woman with a
            rudimentary helping of self-esteem. In addition, after the (mostly)
            white men track Leon down and pull out their weapons, they get a
            glimpse of his penis -- lit by a heavenly glow below the frameline
            -- and their jaws drop and their eyes go wide. It's clear now that
            they have found their arch-nemesis, the overwhelming threat to their
            (mostly) white masculine privilege and related assumptions about
            property and potency. They circle round their man, and, save for
            that black guy somewhere in the group, they're looking a little too
            much like a mob. And then, for a brief instant, the worm almost
            turns. When Lance decides that the most appropriate revenge is for
            him to Greco-Roman wrestle this presumptuous Ladies Man to the
            ground, the film is at a crossroads. Lance oils his chest and hairy
            arms in anticipation: will the truth come out? At this point, it's
            do or die: the movie might hold true to its conviction -- or maybe
            just its most likely punchline -- but it cannot. Instead, Leon
            proves to be the sagacious black advisor who shows up in just a few
            too many movies where white folks are in need of goals and guidance.
            Leon performs as he must: he offers the guys his most heartfelt
            counsel on how to treat their ladies right. And all's well with the
            world. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Except
            for one thing. <i>The Ladies Man</i> is set up as something of a
            fable, with Lester, a twinkly-eyed narrator, who, appropriately, is
            the bartender at the local watering hole where Leon has picked up
            many women over the years. Wise and observant and good at wiping
            glasses as such a character must be, Lester is also played by Billy
            Dee Williams. Now there's a puzzlement. Certainly, it's not unusual
            for older actors to play sage second fiddle or confidant to younger
            actors (Jimmy Caan, for example, has developed a second and very
            cagey back-from-the-dead career doing just that). But jeez. Back in
            the day Billy Dee Williams had it all <b><i>over </i></b>those guys
            that Leon aspires to be. It's just not right that he's reduced to
            standing around and nodding his head while Leon runs all his crude,
            rude, edgeless gooniness, from engaging in a pigs-feet eating
            contest to grousing about his latest failed pick-up line. Poor Billy
            Dee. It's just not right. <o:p>
