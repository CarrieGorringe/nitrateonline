            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>That glorious gold on
            producer-director Robert (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Forrest
            Gump</i>) Zemeckis’ Oscar has turned to gloss-plated lead with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">What
            Lies Beneath</i>, a turgid, never-say-die, and -- despite its
            pretentious homage to Hitchcock and King <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>--
            occasionally scary vehicle. Thrilling and subtle it ain’t. What
            little tension the film held in it’s first hour turns to
            fog-and-mirror supernatural shenanigans and visual effects sleight
            of haunted house hand-held camera work that will make you genuinely
            squeal and your popcorn fly -- and not much else. When the final end
            comes (not the first, second, or third ending -- there may have been
            more, I lost count) a VERY long hour later, you’re left with an
            empty feeling of time and money not well spent, of suspense tossed
            to that wind scuttling the leaves. If you suffered through last
            year’s similarly spooky and equally crappy <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Haunting</i>, the result this go-round is just as barren.</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Clark Gregg’s debut screenplay
            could have benefited from a chop-sock rewrite, lopping off a good
            thirty minutes filled with too many doors creaking open and a
            McGuffin stew of neighborly plot devices shamelessly going nowhere.
            Hitchcock had a knack for doing this right (Heck, he may be dead but
            he’s still the Master of Suspense. Thank God for film, video, and
            dvd’s!), and few have been able to follow in the shadow of his
            footsteps. As for diversionary tactics, Jake Kasdan did a better job
            back in early 1998 with his little remembered gem <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Zero
            Effect</i>. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">What Lies Beneath</i>
            easily misses by a fathom or two.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Megastars Harrison Ford and
            Michelle Pfeiffer are there for widescreen crowd appeal (and their
            fans showered them with more than thirty million dollars’ worth on
            opening weekend). Unfortunately both suffer anew after his recent
            romantic disasters (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Random
            Hearts</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Six Days/Seven
            Nights</i>) and her underwhelming efforts (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Story of Us</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Deep End
            of the Ocean</i>). Damn it, bring back Indiana Jones and give this
            man some real character! Zemeckis drags both actors through a
            glacially-paced story of deception and revenge, figuring the longer
            you have your talent on screen the more the audience gets to ogle at
            them. Not quite.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As Dr. Norman and Mrs. Claire
            Spencer, they live a surface New England postcard existence in a
            House and Garden lakeside fixer-upper, devoted and virile, but
            hiding some emotional baggage in their trunks (not too shabby
            there!). For beginners, she’s a nervous, over-protective mom
            recovering from a traumatic, year-old car accident and a tragedy
            that killed her first husband and doomed her budding career as a
            skilled cellist to a storage case in the basement. Whew. He’s an
            overworked university professor on the verge of a monumental
            genetics discovery, whose professional calling keeps him away at all
            hours. Oh brother. When their teenage daughter heads off to college,
            they become temporary empty-nesters, until she discovers a nasty
            ghost haunting their bath tub, knocking over picture frames, and
            performing other-world antics (but not playing <i>Heart and Soul</i>
            on her cello). Claire gets razzled and frantic, funks into a near
            nervous breakdown, and still has time to snoop on a perhaps
            murderous neighbor (James Remar in a role lost if you blink).</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The rest of the supporting cast
            barely registers despite the film’s length. Diana Scarwid is
            Claire’s best friend’s Jody, a somewhat wacky divorcée who
            relishes in her ability to get a fashionable car from her ex. They
            play (Ouija) board games and read witchcraft for dummies before the
            script makes her disappear. Fourth-billed Joe Morton has two or
            three scenes as a shrink.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Norman (as in Norman Bates) isn’t
            all that normal himself and he gets to show his other side in the
            last horrifying hour. The film switches gears abruptly after
            Claire’s detective work (assisted by a microfilm reader, the
            internet, and some ghost writing from Madison Elizabeth Frank; i.e.,
            the girl in the tub). There’s one startling sexy, possessive
            moment when Claire transforms into a sultry siren welcoming the man
            of the house with some baser instinct, leaving all the men in the
            audience hot and bothered. Pfeiffer has better moments and shows
            broader range than Ford, but neither gets good mileage out of this
            derivative ghost story stuff. Further harm was done when Dreamworks
            moronically mis-marketed the picture with a trailer that unveils a
            shocking (but not entirely unexpected) plot twist that was better
            left for the audience to discover.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Standard fright fare, and hardly
            inspiring. You’ll jump but you’ll catch no net with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">What
