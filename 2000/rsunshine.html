            his latest movie, <i>Sunshine</i>, Hungarian director István Szabó
            compresses almost an entire century into three hours. In recounting
            how the last 100 years have affected the people of Szabó’s
            homeland, <i>Sunshine</i> juggles a multitude of ideologies, people
            and events. At times Szabó’s control slips because of the immense
            burden, but he still manages to present a convincing story of
            tragedy and hope. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Szabó
            and co-screenwriter Israel Horovitz frame their microcosmic view of
            the 20th century through the fortunes of the Sonneschein family.
            Throughout three generations, the Jewish family witnesses the fall
            of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the horrors of World War II and the
            atrocities committed in the name of Communism. Despite the bleak
            environment that surrounds them, the Sonnescheins become wealthy and
            occasionally powerful. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">They
            originate as peasant tavern keepers, but Emmanuel Sonneschein (David
            de Keyser) becomes a tycoon when he brings his family’s medicinal
            elixir recipe with him to Budapest. Called &quot;a taste of
            sunshine,&quot; the drink brings in enough money to send his son
            Gustave (James Frain, <i>Where the Heart Is</i>) to medical school
            and his other child Ignatz (Ralph Fiennes) to study law. Although
            both have promising careers, Emmanuel warns his sons not to aim too
            high for fear of rousing anti-Semitism. Ignatz ignores his
            father’s advice and climbs the bureaucratic ladder. He even
            changes his surname to ‘Sors’ lest anyone discover that he’s a
            Jew. Ignatz further strains his relations with his father by falling
            in love with and then marrying his cousin Valerie (Jennifer Ehle).
            He also alienates Gustave (who’s nursing a crush on Valerie) by
            embracing the Empire while Gustave has been an active Communist.<o:p>

            <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            family’s turmoil is reflected in the outside world. World War I
            destroys the old Empire, and Ignatz’s sons István (Mark Strong)
            and Adam (Fiennes, again) struggle to adapt to the new hostile
            environment. To combat some of the rampant anti-Semitism, Adam
            learns and then masters fencing. Unable to compete at the highest
            levels because of his religion, Adam and his brother convert to
            Catholicism. This move and his single-minded determination make him
            an Olympic contender. Nonetheless, there is little that he can do to
            stop the Nazi influence over the new Hungarian government. <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">When
            World War II shifts power to the Communists, Adam’s son Ivan (Fiennes)
            becomes one the government’s most feared interrogators. At first,
            Ivan is eager to punish the former fascists. But he has second
            thoughts when the authorities begin blaming Jews for recent unrest
            and force him to go after his old mentor (William Hurt).<o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Although
            cinematographer Lajos Koltai shoots most of <i>Sunshine</i> in a
            warm, amber glow, no one can accuse Szabó of looking back with
            rose-colored glasses. He views all of the ideologies that have
            dominated Hungary in the last 100 years with contempt. For example,
            the plight of the poor moves Gustave to become a Communist, but
            he’s willing to shed blood for the cause. Thankfully, Szabó’s
            cynical recollections don’t lead the film into nihilism. The
            director avoids addressing the last thirty years, so Szabó may be
            hoping that future generations of Hungarians, as well as the rest of
            the world, can learn from the mistakes of the past.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">With
            all of the ideas running through <i>Sunshine</i>, it’s no wonder
            that the movie sometimes feels more like a debate than a film. Many
            times the nightmare of totalitarian rule seems too abstract. Szabó
            sometimes reduces the factors that led to violent uprisings to mere
            shouting matches. Even some of the love affairs that pepper the
            story seem more a matter of philosophy than passion. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Fortunately,
            Szabó’s cast is up to the challenge. Fiennes gives all three
            generations of Sonnenscheins an eerie continuity, as if the same
            character inhabited the bodies of all three men. He’s especially
            effective as Ivan, giving his scariest performance since <i>Schindler’s
            List</i>. <i>Sunshine</i> is at its most involving when Szabó
            abandons the dialogue and lets the actors’ faces tell the story. <i>Sunshine</i>
            may not reach the stratosphere the way Szabó’s previous movies <i>Mephisto</i>
            and <i>Meeting Venus</i> do. Nonetheless, his mammoth intentions are
            as welcome and refreshing as the rays of the sun. <o:p>
