            inside madmen's heads is all the rage. This isn't to say it's news,
            exactly -- criminologists, detectives, and sundry monster-chasers
            have been doing it forever. Think: Sherlock Holmes, Ann Rule,
            Clarice Starling, Mulder, anyone tangling with Freddy Krueger,
            Millennium's Frank Black, the interchangeable women on <i>Profiler</i>,
            first-person-shooter games, even Spock, tripping on the Vulcan
            Mind-Meld. With all this history to live up to, as well as
            contemporary, high-tech competition, the generation next of
            criminal-mindf*ckers has to be <i>très</i> cutting edge to get any
            action at all. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Enter
            <i>The Cell</i>, Tarem Singh's film about an imagined technology
            that allows users to enter other people's minds, virtual-reality
            style: &quot;you don't just observe, you participate.&quot; If this
            sounds familiar, well, it is. Lenny Nero (Ralph Fiennes) in <i>Strange
            Days</i> and Sydney Bloom (Lori Singer) in tv's <i>VR5</i> were
            traversing lobal synapses five long years before <i>The Cell</i>. In
            this rendition, Catherine Deane (Jennifer Lopez) has to wear a
            special sensory catsuit -- though even that's old; recall a similar
            deal for Jobe (Jeff Fahey) and Dr. Angelo (Pierce Brosnan) in 1992's
            <i>Lawnmower Man</i>. Still, Catherine's outfit is sexier as well as
            scarier: deep red, rubbery, almost amphibian-looking. While in this
            suit, she must hang from wires and wear a bizarre computer-circuitry
            rag over her face. Like most every object in the film, including
            Lopez, the strange gear looks pretty fabulous (I saw a girl Lopez
            fan wearing a version of this suit on MTV's <i>Total Request Live</i>
            this week: as street wear, it does seem extreme, and sweaty). It
            goes without saying that you shouldn't go prying into the gear's
            logic or science. But then, <i>The Cell</i> doesn't pretend to do
            anything other than what it does: mess with your mind something
            awful. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Watching
            this movie might give you a headache. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            set-up is actually simple, as these things go. The emphasis is on
            images -- throbbing, creepy, brilliantly colored. Catherine is a
            psychologist with a &quot;gift&quot; for empathy (read: Deanna Troi
            with bite). She doesn't get out much. In fact, she and her team,
            Miriam (Marianne Jean-Baptiste) and Henry West (Dylan Baker), spend
            nearly the entire film inside the Campbell Center, a lab compound.
            Here Catherine takes psychotropic drugs and uses a
            &quot;brain-mapping device&quot; to rifle around inside the head of
            the team's only client, a boy comatose after nearly drowning (his
            filthy rich parents subsidize the research).<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            rifling looks terrific: when you first see her, Catherine rides a
            ravishing black horse across the burnt-orange sands of a desert
            inside the kid's mind (i.e., as far from water as possible). The
            colors are hard and surreal: against the blue sky, Catherine's
            white-white dress, with a feathered bodice, looks almost like wings
            atop her black horse. Dismounting, she starts walking: the aerial
            shots are incredible (her teeny white-gowned body walks endlessly
            across miles of dunes, emptiness all around her) and Howard Shore's
            score -- screaming vocals and Middle Eastern instrumentation --
            becomes intense, harsh, alarming to ears used to typical movie
            soundtracks, rising strings and melodies. You might anticipate such
            striking visuals from Singh, who directed the 1991 video for REM's
            &quot;Losing My Religion.&quot; And from here, the metaphors only
            become darker and more complicated, drawn from a range of cultural
            sources, biblical, mystical, mythological, artistic, and
            S&amp;M-fantastical: imagine <i>What Dreams May Come</i> meets <i>Faces
            of Death</i> meets <i>Tomb Raider</i>. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Alternating
            with these bizarre shots of the team's &quot;good&quot; work, you
            see shots of sick-f*ck murderer Carl Stargher (Vincent D'Onofrio,
            the best glowerer in the business: see <i>Full Metal Jacket</i> and <i>Men
            In Black</i>) doing his very bad work. Under the watchful eye of his
            spooky albino German Shepherd (your surrogate? you hope not), Carl
            gazes longingly at his young woman victim, floating dead in the
            glass cell where she has recently drowned. He drains and treats the
            body, turning her into a &quot;doll,&quot; painted and pale, and
            then suspends himself over her corpse, using hooks he has implanted
            in his back (hooks like those in the <i>Re-Search</i> wild-piercings
            books). Already, you see the similarities between Catherine and
            Carl: both in suspension, both yearning to save and be saved. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Using
            a basic Ted-Bundyish ruse, Carl kidnaps another woman, then (oops!)
            lapses into a coma, due to his peculiar kind of schizophrenia. Yadda
            yadda: Catherine is asked by the FBI -- Agent Peter Novak (Vince
            Vaughan) and Agent Gordon Ramsey (Jake Weber) -- to penetrate Carl's
            mind and discover the whereabouts of the kidnapee, whose cell is
            scheduled to flood in a few hours. He's a maniacal, dreadful
            individual whose psyche is sure to be gruesome and dangerous. How
            can she refuse? The rest of the film tracks Catherine's efforts to
            reach the &quot;little boy&quot; version of Carl, trapped inside and
            alongside the large monstrous version, and surrounded by memories of
            an abusive father who beat, burned, and river-baptized him so
            fervently that the boy nearly drowned. A pattern emerges: water
            water everywhere, equally a means to spiritual ruin and psychic
            salvation. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Be
            that as it may: Catherine suits up and gets inside these memories,
            complete with shadowy A-frame house, besieged mom, horridly
            sliced-up horse, and collection of women-as-dolls in display cases
            (including some modeled after famous art, like Degas'
            &quot;Dancer&quot;). Catherine is appalled but also intrigued: she
            goes in deeper. That Catherine will be caught in a tussle between
            little boy Carl and serial killer Carl is foregone, as is the fact
            that she will learn something about her own dark side and need
            Peter's ineffectually gung-ho help while inside Carl's head. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            movie doesn't get much past its spectacular-nightmare imagery: plot
            and characterization are plainly secondary, except as they might
            affect what you see on screen (or more precisely, how you think
            about yourself watching all of it: are you participating, in your
            own way?). Still, this very lack raises a good question: what is
            character or plot in a film if not an occasion to illustrate visions
            in filmmakers' heads? We're mostly used to watching movies with
            narratives -- conflicts, crises, resolutions -- but this needn't be
            the only reason to watch them, or to like them. We're used to
            gauging films by how &quot;realistic&quot; they seem. But what can
            this mean, in the context of an explicitly imaginative experience,
            where what you understand to be &quot;real&quot; is abandoned from
            shot one: reality isn't even a point of departure here, it's more
            like a quaint notion, something lost long ago, like, say, religion.
            On one level, you can see how all this would be fascinating to a
            film director wanting to expand the possibilities of digital
            representation: forget <i>Antz</i>, <i>Final Fantasy</i>, Buzz
            Lightyear, or even Simone (Al Pacino's upcoming CGI co-star). Movies
            don't need to be about stories (how pedestrian); they can concoct
            and reflect and distort, they can play games or be games. They can
            refigure reality, re-present it so that you only half-recognize it,
            make you believe you recognize it. It's on you to keep up. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Carl
            the character has &quot;no reality,&quot; only a consummately warped
            imagination. (As a cultural product, he's a function of multiple
            clichés and stereotypes -- the atrocious childhood, the psycho dad,
            the incomprehensible religious rituals -- however real they might be
            at any given point in his (or our collective) consciousness.
            According to <i>The Cell</i>'s made-up and self-fabricating experts,
            he's &quot;an idealized version of himself, a king in his
            kingdom.&quot; That is, he's a character, hypothetical, and the film
            treats him as such, just as it treats Catherine and the doctors and
            the federal agents, as compilations of common movie-character
            traits. So, Catherine makes the correct decisions (whether she's
            decked out as a lethal swordsperson or the Virgin Mary -- and this
            latter image is frankly more disturbing, as she's reenacting The
            Pieta with <i>her</i> victim), Miriam is comforting and wise, macho
            guy Peter barks orders to his minions, reveals his own banal
            backstory (as a DA, he lost a child-killer case on a technicality),
            and eventually cozies up to Catherine (who has a dead brother in her
            own background). They're all wounded, sad, and angry, all looking
            for redemption. And the film doesn't pretend to give it, to them or
            to you. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            other words, unlike standard serial killer movies like <i>Silence of
            the Lambs</i> or <i>The Stranger Beside Me</i>, or even gutsier ones
            like <i>Summer of Sam</i>, <i>The Minus Man</i> or <i>Felicia's
            Journey</i>, <i>The Cell</i> is not the least bit inclined to make
            sense of itself. Sure, you get the requisite race to rescue and race
            to put right as sort of parallel climaxes, but neither is
            particularly interesting and certainly neither has a clear moral
            ground. For <i>The Cell</i>, the serial killer's mind is the hook,
            not the point. A potential point -- never rally determined -- might
            be Catherine's mind, the do-gooder's intentions and motivations, but
            even these ideas are left waysided and disjointed (by design or bad
            filmmaking? and does it matter?). Catherine is your point of entry,
            the position with which you want to empathize -- but she's so
            empathetic that she's off putting, as if she's just too ideal, a
            hypothetical construct, like her (or is it your?) version of Carl. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Or
            maybe there's something else at stake. Maybe you'll find yourself
            wondering about your desire, your investment, your need, even your
            grip on what's real or your faith in what's not real. Carl,
            understandably upset at Catherine's intrusion, roars the film's best
            question: &quot;Where do you come from?&quot; Where indeed? You
            watch with your own backstory, but do you know (or care) how that
            affects your watching, how it becomes your reality? While such
            questions doesn't redeem <i>The Cell</i>'s many faults as a regular
            movie, it may be enough that it does ask them. Most movies don't ask
            enough questions, of itself or its viewers. Once you've left the
            theater, <i>The Cell</i> becomes increasingly interesting. And you
            may conclude that being regular -- logical or satisfactory -- is
            overrated. Fed-boy sidekick Ramsey's description of the movie's
            absurd denouement fits the whole shebang: &quot;I'd say pretty f*cking
            strange is par for the course.&quot; It's infuriating and boring,
            predictable and jumbled, brutal and romantic. And it's looking like
            movies to come. <o:p>
