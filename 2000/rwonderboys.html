<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="5"><b>I</b></font><font size="4">n
the late eighties, while writing their tangled gangster epic Miller’s
Crossing, Joel and Ethan Coen hit that brick wall most every writer collides
with from time to time. They contracted a nasty case of writer’s block. But
while their malady was common, their solution was something else altogether.
Seeking an escape from their creative torpor, they decided to actually write
about the writer’s block. The result was <i>Barton Fink</i>, a whacked-out
fantasia that took the condition as a starting off point for an absurdist
examination of some of human nature’s darker recesses. Half a decade later, we
have Michael Chabon. After making literary waves with his debut novel, <i>The
Mysteries of Pittsburgh</i>, he found himself in a pickle while delivering his
follow-up. He couldn’t stop writing it. He had writer’s block too, but it
was a block of a different sort. He hadn’t run out of ideas. He had run out of
the ability to filter a flood of ideas through any sort of unifying principle.
He lost his direction, and so, like the Coens, he put the magnum opus aside and
began writing a story about his block, which brings us to <i>Wonder Boys</i>,
published in 1995 and now presented as a screen adaptation. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
writer’s block a clef conceived by Chabon is even more autobiographical than <i>Barton
Fink</i>. <i>Wonder Boys</i> is about aimlessness quite literally, with its lead
character, Grady Tripp, experiencing precisely that which haunted Chabon
professionally, as well as some emotional gymnastics symptomatic of the same
problem. Tripp, played with a nice lived-in ease by Michael Douglas in the
movie, cannot seem to finish his second novel. A writing professor at a
prestigious Pennsylvania university, this now middle-aged shaggy dog of a man is
trying to live up to the promise he delivered during his wonder years, only
seven years ago. But he’s wallowing in the inability to choose, whether it be
a thematic through-line for his novel, or the path of his own love life. After
having been married to a string of pretty younger women, all of whom have
eventually left him, he’s presented with the possibility that the woman for
him may just be one his own age, school chancellor Sara Gaskell (Frances
McDormand), with whom he’s been having a long-standing affair. On the same
day, Grady is dumped by his latest trophy wife, visited by his bisexual editor
Terry Crabtree (Robert Downey, Jr.) who is desperately looking for a finished
novel, and walloped with a potentially life-changing piece of news from Sara.
With so much weighing down on him, it’s no wonder Grady decides to focus the
lion’s share of his attention on something else, on the plight of one James
Leer (Tobey Maguire), the quiet, mysterious student who lurks around with a gun,
writes like the dickens, and faintly reminds Grady of the man he once was.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Grady’s
attention darts around throughout <i>Wonder Boys</i>, and that lack of focus
becomes the story’s guiding principle. This is a case of form following
function, and that isn’t always a good thing. The last thing a writer wants to
do to convey boredom in his characters is to make their experiences boring to
the audience, and almost the same can be said when the chief attribute in
question is aimlessness. Grady’s farcical two-day trip into and out of trouble
around his Pittsburgh haunting grounds involves a dead dog, heaps of marijuana,
more than a couple kooky characters, and the black satin jacket worn by Marilyn
Monroe during her wedding to Joe DiMaggio. And the overriding impression this
kitchen-sink approach conveys is that the story isn’t quite sure where it’s
heading (which is something considerably different from a confident story that
leaves the audience unsure of where they are heading). There just isn’t much
momentum carrying <i>Wonder Boys</i> from scene to scene. No matter how strong
and confident the acting, photography, and music choices, and the movie is
exceptional in all those categories, that’s a very high hurdle to leap. <i>Wonder
Boys</i> may have worked better as a novel, which can be revisited again and
again at one’s leisure, but as a movie, which lends itself more to a single,
continuous experience, lack of forward movement is particularly painful (though
I did have much the same trouble wading through the book). <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Within
the movie’s most successful area, the relationship between Tripp and James,
whom Maguire plays with a gentle, magnetic stillness, lies the entire problem in
microcosm. James has a dark personality, mirrored in his short stories, that
hints at a troubled existence. He also worships his professor Tripp, and during
the course of the story attempts to woo the attention of his mentor with stories
of the severe life he now leads. The running gag of the relationship is that
James is a natural born storyteller, even when it comes to his own life.
That’s a perfectly cute little idea, but all that tale-telling costs the movie
when it comes time to give James an emotional rescue of sorts. James spends so
much time weaving tall tales about himself he prevents the story from pinning
him down. He remains an empty shell of a character, a story conceit rather than
a human being. That may have worked fine in a straight farce, but <i>Wonder Boys</i>
does have real emotional aspirations. By the time Grady reaches his own place of
personal peace, you may wonder what all the busy to and fro had to do with it in
the first place. It’s all much ado about not much, even though director Curtis
Hanson does his best to keep things moving at an entertaining clip. The movie is
frequently funny, sometimes touching, and more than a little non-involving. <o:p>
