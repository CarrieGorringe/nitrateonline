            review by Loey Lockerby, 17 November 2000</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In this modern, sexually
            liberated world, are we really as open-minded as we like to think?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>That’s the question posed by <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Just
            One Time</i>, which throws its &quot;average&quot; characters into a
            situation that would inspire soul-searching in even the most jaded.</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Anthony (Lane Janger), a New York
            City firefighter, gets what any good <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Penthouse
            Forum</i> reader dreams about – an agreement from his fiancée,
            Amy (Joelle Carter), that she’ll have sex with another woman in
            order to fulfill his greatest fantasy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </span>The only catch is that Anthony has to sleep with another man
            to fulfill <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">her</i> fantasy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </span>After all, it’s only fair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Right?<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Anthony certainly doesn’t think
            so, but he goes along with the plan, hoping Amy will change her mind
            as the fated night draws near.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>He spends some time "dating" a young gay man (Guillermo Diaz)
            who lives next door to the couple, while Amy gets to know a lesbian
            neighbor (Jennifer Esposito) who is more than a little amused by all
            the fuss.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
            experience is life-changing for virtually everyone involved, but not
            exactly in the ways they expect.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Janger, who directed and co-wrote
            the film, could easily have turned it into a mildly diverting
            revenge story for all those women whose boyfriends indulge in
            stereotyped girl-on-girl daydreams.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>He takes it further, however, and the result is a
            refreshingly honest look at love and sexual identity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Janger and his co-writer, Jennifer Vandever (he wrote the "guy"
            scenes; she wrote the "girl" scenes), don’t let any of their
            characters off the hook, especially the two leads.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Both are too proud to let the other win their little game,
            and Amy, in particular, slowly becomes fascinated by the prospect of
            doing something that she once found incredibly uncomfortable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Anthony doesn’t go quite that far, but he is forced to deal
            with his own double-standards and latent homophobia, especially when
            he discovers that his macho firehouse buddies are more adventurous
            and enlightened than he could ever imagine being.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Just
            One Time</i> is an expanded version of a short film Janger made in
            1998, and he is clearly at ease with the material.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The dialogue is witty and insightful, and he captures the
            easygoing, eclectic feel of his East Village setting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The actors, most of whom also starred in the original short,
            fit effortlessly into their roles, although the central romance is
            hampered by a lack of onscreen chemistry between Janger and Carter
            – we’re constantly <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">told</i> how much they love each other, but it never quite feels
            authentic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The ending
            is a little hackneyed, but the characters are wiser and more mature
            because of their experiences, which is the point of having them go
            through all this in the first place.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This isn’t a groundbreaking film,
            or even a particularly memorable one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>As romantic comedies go, however, it is unusually brave in
            its depiction of just how confusing love and sex can really be, even
            to those who think they’ve got it all figured out.</font>
