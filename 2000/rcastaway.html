            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Thank the merciful saints of
            movie-going for Robert Zemeckis and Tom Hanks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Virtually every critic in America, including yours truly, has
            bemoaned the dearth of quality films in the year 2000, yet just as
            things are at their bleakest, along comes <i>Cast Away</i>, an
            emotional tour-de-force all but guaranteed to sweep the 2001 Oscars.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>A disaster movie hasn't been this marketable--or as
            well-crafted--since <i>Titanic</i>, and no, that's not intended as a
            backhanded complement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Cast
            Away</i> is a powerful piece of narrative storytelling, anchored by
            one of Hanks's best performances, and the sheer depth of the story
            will make it an experience the viewer will remember for a long time
            to come.</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hanks stars as Chuck Noland, a
            Federal Express executive who specializes in finding ways to shave
            minutes off a package's delivery time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Although his life is dominated by his career, Noland
            maintains a warm, loving relationship with his girlfriend Kelly
            (Helen Hunt), and plans to propose to her at an upcoming New Year's
            Eve party.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When a
            last-minute Christmas rush threatens to delay the delivery of some
            Fed-Ex packages, Noland boards a plane to go help out his
            co-workers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>En route,
            the aircraft encounters a severe winter storm and crashes into the
            Pacific Ocean.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Noland,
            the sole survivor, washes up on a tropical island and spends the
            next four years trying to fashion a return to civilization while
            insanity eats away at him.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hanks's performance is so inspired
            that no words I can write could possibly do it justice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The emotional range Hanks conveys has to be seen to be
            believed, and his physical transformations are no less remarkable --
            filming was actually suspended for a year so that Noland's aging
            would appear more believable -- resulting in one of the most
            consistent performances of Hanks's already remarkable career.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>We share firsthand in both his triumphs and his heartbreaks,
            and witness how his unwavering love for Kelly becomes a source of
            inspiration during his exile.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Desperate for company, Noland
            creates a friend for himself by painting a smiley face on a
            volleyball found in one of the water-soaked boxes near the crash
            site.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Christening his
            new buddy &quot;Wilson,&quot; after the ball's manufacturer, Noland
            uses the ball as a sounding board for his loneliness and
            frustrations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>What’s
            amazing is the skill and sincerity with which Hanks conveys the
            growing &quot;friendship&quot; between the pair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Amusing and frightening at the same time, these scenes reveal
            the sheer scope of Noland's longing for companionship far better
            than any amount of cloying voice-over narration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>By seeing how important Wilson is to Noland, we begin to
            share his affection for the grinning volleyball.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>If you’re not touched by the final fate of Noland’s
            silent companion, you’re made of sterner stuff than I.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Robert Zemeckis, who last worked
            with Hanks in 1995's <i>Forrest Gump</i>, clearly knows how to
            squeeze the maximum amount of drama from a story; as a result, even
            though <i>Cast Away</i> is a tremendous viewing experience by any
            standard, it will prove especially interesting for those viewers
            interested in the craft of filmmaking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Zemeckis adopts a minimalist approach for much of the story,
            abandoning a conventional orchestral score in favor of a far more
            haunting alternative: utter silence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>This was an excellent -- and brave -- choice on the part of
            the director, and it truly allows the audience to share Noland's
            sense of isolation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Also
            witness how, with a confidence bordering on bravado, Zemeckis
            orchestrates the movie's showpiece scene -- the plane crash -- into
            something that manages to horrify while simultaneously retaining a
            cold, stark beauty.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's intriguing to note that the
            movie's title is alternately being given as <i>Castaway</i> and <i>Cast
            Away</i> in the various advertisements I've seen, a clever
            promotional ploy that lends a double meaning to the tale and also
            serves as clever (and subtle) foreshadowing for the story's third
            act.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Cast Away</i>
            is not really about Chuck Noland's adventures on the deserted island
            so much as it's about the repercussions of his time there.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The film's lengthy post-island epilogue sets up a new series
            of obstacles with which poor Chuck has to deal.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The movie's final shot is some kind of masterpiece, depicting
            a confused and sullen Chuck Noland standing at both a physical and
            metaphorical crossroads.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It's
            perhaps the most striking visual symbol I've seen in any film this
            year.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Cast Away</i> is both triumphant
            and heart-wrenching, and it touched me like few other cinematic
            works.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>While it would
            be an exaggeration to say that I came out of the theater a changed
            person, the story left me with more to think about than any other
            movie in recent memory, and continues to haunt me as I write these
            words.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You know a film
            has affected you on a profoundly personal level when your first
            actions after seeing it are to run home as fast as you can, throw
            your arms around your loved ones, and remind them how much they mean
            to you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Cast Away</i>
            has the power to remind you of what's truly important in life, and
            for that reason alone it's the best holiday gift you'll ever
            receive.</font>
