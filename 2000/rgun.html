            the record, I'll call myself Mr. Parker, and my associate will be
            Mr. Longbaugh.&quot; By the time Parker (Ryan Phillippe) names
            himself, about three minutes into <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Way of the Gun</i>, you've already seen him in a brief spurt of
            disastrous action, and have a sense of why he'd like to go by a
            pseudonym. He's a self-styled menace, swaggering and sometimes
            stumbling, perpetually exhausted and enraged. You know all this
            because you've just seen Parker and his boy Longbaugh (Benicio del
            Toro) fight with some stupid guy who insists they stop leaning on
            his parked car. There's no reason to fight, except the guy is
            showing off for his foul-mouthed girlfriend, and Parker and
            Longbaugh don't have anything else to do that night. The pair get
            their asses kicked by the guy's crew. The partners are lying on the
            street, bloodied and rag-doll-like, as the camera pulls out and up,
            hanging over them like a vulture. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Such
            predatory positioning leaves little doubt as to how this movie is
            going to treat its both its characters and viewers. Parker has named
            them after the real names of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,
            which means both ways: &quot;our&quot; Parker and Longbaugh are the
            real deal but also not. There's no real to be, anymore. The West is
            long dead, and that <i>noir</i>-ish voice over that Parker has going
            is world-weary all right, but not very wise or hardcore, or even
            cynical: it's so done already. He and his boy are old school bad-guy
            partners, with a code and extraordinary loyalty to one another, but
            they lack proper good guys to fight: the world around them is so
            confused and vile; there's no clear moral, legal, or even personal
            ground. They have, as Parker puts it -- in writer-director Chris (<i>The
            Usual Suspects</i>) McQuarrie's elegant bad-guy-speak --
            &quot;fallen off the path.&quot; At such a point, past crisis and
            past redemption, you have no choice, Parker observes: &quot;Keep
            your life simple and you can self-sustain.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            this being a McQuarrie film, there is no such thing as
            &quot;simple.&quot; Indeed, within minutes Parker and Longbaugh's
            lives are so unbelievably f*cked up and complicated that there is no
            chance in hell that they will ever be able to get back to that first
            moment when they're laid out on the street, a moment which, looking
            back, is suddenly sublime in its simplicity. While this moment
            establishes their viciousness, aggression, and devotion to one
            another, it actually sets up very little in terms of what will
            befall them. All you know for sure is that something will befall
            them. Something dire and harrowing and, of course, quite off the
            path. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Tellingly
            (and what you tell from this may reveal something about you), the
            plot kicks in just as Parker utters the word &quot;simple.&quot; A
            sound bridge takes you from their unconscious bodies to the next
            scene, where the guys essay rather desperately to make some bucks,
            by selling their sperm (the way of the gun, indeed). Longbaugh
            informs the interviewer, &quot;I never killed a man, that's a
            qualification.&quot; He's lying, of course: he has killed men. But
            the fellow at the desk has no idea of this. And at this moment you
            might not even be so sure, except that you've seen Longbaugh behave
            so violently for no good reason, that you can only imagine what kind
            of damage he wreaks if actually provoked. The scene works to bond
            the partners in your mind, intercutting between their interviews at
            the sperm bank, so their answers seem to interlock and speak to one
            another, their psycho-killer psyches alternate, like a rhythm. Each
            makes his case: he's not homosexual, he's never had sex with a dead
            person. And the question that neither can answer because they're too
            alienated and too-early abandoned to know: &quot;Any history of
            mental illness in your family?&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's
            by chance that they come upon a plan, or think they come up with one
            (though, as Parker says, &quot;A plan is just a list of things that
            don't happen&quot;). While waiting to hear if they
            &quot;passed&quot; the interview, Parker and Longbaugh overhear a
            phone call concerning a surrogate mother, and the plan hatches.
            They'll kidnap this woman who's been paid to carry a rich guy
            couple's child, and demand mad cash. The surrogate mother is Robin (Juliette
            Lewis), nine months into her pregnancy and waddling hugely. The rich
            couple is a gangster-businessman named Hale Chidduck (Scott Wilson)
            and his icy-bitch wife Francesca (Kristen Lehman). By the time the
            kidnapping occurs, you know enough about these people to understand
            why Robin might decide to take leave of her bodyguards, silky-smooth
            Jeffers (Taye Diggs) and young-tough Obecks (Nicky Katt), to take a
            chance with these leftovers from the wild, wild west. Also by this
            time, you're quite aware that no good will come of any of it. Parker
            and Longbaugh make their move as she's leaving the doctor's
            high-rise, nylon pulled down on their faces and guns drawn. A group
            of bystanders is lolling about in the office building lobby, only
            vaguely surprised to see the weapons. Or maybe they're missing
            something. &quot;Can't you people see there are guns here?!&quot;
            whines Parker, exasperated. But civilians, by definition, can not
            fathom how guns work or what they mean, the way of the gun. Even
            when they do exit the building, they wait around outside to watch
            the action, like it's a movie. Once the shooting starts (which you
            don't even see, remaining behind, inside the building with Robin),
            the civilians become statistics, bodies left behind as the plot
            moves on. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            piles up a lot of bodies. The outlaws head from the Southwest US to
            a dusty, worn-out Mexican border town, followed by Jeffers and
            Obecks, who are in turn followed by Chidduck's ace hitman, Sarno
            (James Caan), the veteran gangster-thug-performer. Sarno describes
            himself as versed in &quot;the art of adjudication.&quot; And every
            other guy understands this for what it is: he's a bagman, cunning,
            experienced, honorable, not to be trusted. Everyone knows how this
            bad business will end and each has a mix of reasons -- pride, money,
            boredom, bloodlust, greed -- for not turning back. Such inexorable
            motion doesn't require thinking through. When asked who -- between
            Parker and Longbaugh -- is the &quot;brains of the operation,&quot;
            Longbaugh answers, &quot;To tell you the truth, I don't think this
            is a brains kind of operation.&quot; The machinery grinds on. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></span></font></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            ground-up object, of course, is Robin, who becomes, quite literally,
            meat. During a particularly gruesome and lengthy finale, while the
            men gather to point guns at one another, her worn-down body
            collapses in a Mexican brothel, where her doctor Allen Painter
            (Dylan Kussman), is forced to perform a Cesarean. Robin's passed out
            from the pain, and Painter's standing over the bed, his hands all up
            inside her bloody gut, a couple of thug corpses strewn about the
            room. It's an ugly scene, made uglier by the fact that the gunmen
            just keep at their business. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            ugliness makes a point, of course, having to do with the effects of
            violence, its costs and purports. And here -- at this clear point of
            brutality and hatefulness -- where the film, so ambiguously and
            awkwardly named, poses what may be its central question. What is the
            &quot;way of the gun&quot;? <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Break
            it down: consider the many measures of meanness, immorality, and
            chaos that have brought Parker and Longbaugh, Jeffers and Obecks,
            Sarno and Robin, to this moment in time, to this place. Can their
            adventures all come down to a question of genre? Is the &quot;way of
            the gun&quot; a set of expectations based on media experiences --
            gangster movies, LAPD shootouts -- or is it something more
            profoundly constitutional, something tied to genes, testosterone,
            the NRA, or bad parenting? Do this movie's generic roots -- its
            patent investments in action flicks, thrillers, Westerns, and films
            noirs -- make it just another genre picture or does it manage a
            thoughtful challenge to such familiar (not to say stale)
            configurations? Is it possible for a movie that includes car chases,
            bags of money, and men with guns be anything buy conventional? Does
            the &quot;way&quot; preclude or necessitate responsibility and
            self-awareness? <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            film poses all of these questions and a few more. But it's quite
            uninterested in answering them, out of slyness or orneriness. Based
            on their self-defining dialogue throughout the film, you can
            probably imagine Parker's or Sarno's answers (cryptically
            philosophical), but other characters -- Robin, Jeffers, even
            Longbaugh -- are probably harder to nail down. And in characters
            like these this is where genre can become less predictable, more
            thrilling. For all the precision of the plots and character
            interrelationships in McQuarrie's film, it's this possibility for
            messiness that is most beguiling. <o:p>
