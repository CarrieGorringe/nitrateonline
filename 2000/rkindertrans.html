            related documentaries have polled well with Oscar voters over the
            last five years, winning three times. Poignantly reflecting on one
            of mankind’s darker moments, the Academy has deservedly recognized
            the important heroics of the subjects and the filmmakers for <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Last Days</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Anne Frank
            Remembered</i>, and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Long
            Way Home</i>. The latter, an extraordinary tale of concentration
            camp survivors who endured additional physical hardships in WWII’s
            aftermath, was directed by Mark Jonathan Harris. His latest effort, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Into
            the Arms of Strangers</i>, inspired by producer Deborah
            Oppenheimer’s journey of discovery about her late mother’s past
            and produced in cooperation with the United States Holocaust
            Memorial Museum, appears legitimately destined for award
            consideration. Spearheaded with an unusual early push by Warner
            Bros. (many documentaries only get attention <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">after</i>
            they win a golden statuette, and then merely via cable/educational
            television networks or limited home video release), the two-hour
            feature just opened on single screens in five major markets (New
            York, Los Angeles, Washington, Boston, and Toronto). The
            well-crafted film highlights the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Kindertransport</i>, an unprecedented humanitarian rescue effort that
            ultimately saved 10,000 children, mostly Jews, from certain death.
            On a historic scale, the number pales to the 1,500,000 children who
            perished in the Holocaust, yet for those under-17-year-olds
            dramatically wrenched from their German, Austrian, and Czech parents
            and guardians, life, no matter how uncertain in a land of
            English-speaking strangers, was better than none at all.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sparsely
            narrated by Dame Judi Dench, the filmmakers have 12 witnesses
            recount their horrifying, yet startlingly fresh, childhood stories
            of 60 years ago. These <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Kinder</i>
            survived and flourished despite being torn from their families in
            the nine months before the onslaught of World War II. A pair of
            rescuers and two parents are also called upon to provide their
            perspective. Their distressing stories of separation anxiety unfold
            before a stationary camera and a soft-focus blue backdrop, unlocking
            deep-rooted experiences that brings their past to life and transfix
            the viewer. The still and moving archival images that overlay the
            soundtrack (expertly designed by seven-time Academy Award winner
            Gary Rydstrom) effectively supplement their heart-rending tales.
            Despite the growing library of such films, locating unique, fresh,
            newsreel, home movie, and photographic material (kudos to researcher
            Corrinne Collett) did showcase some disturbing representations of
            the era, particularly a brief glimpse of an intoxicating carousel, a
            bouquet of helium-filled black balloons emblazoned with the Nazi
            swastika, and shattering images of a German synagogue being burned.
            There are several ghostly recreations (all using only authentic <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Kindertransport </i>artifacts) evoking the horror of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Kristallnacht</i>,
            "the night of broken glass," a nationwide series of attacks
            orchestrated by Josef Goebbels, Hitler’s propaganda minister, on
            November 9, 1938 that set a thousand synagogues ablaze, destroyed
            more than 7,500 Jewish businesses, and kidnapped tens of thousands
            of male Jews to ransom back, dead or alive, to their families. This
            turning point in the fate of Germany’s Jews prodded Britain’s
            Parliament to temporarily accept refugee children and thus began the
            <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Kindertransport</i>.<o:p>

            the Arms of Strangers</i>, that film also was springboarded by the
            daughter of a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Kind</i> émigré
            (costume designer Ruth Morley), with some of the same survivors
            re-telling their stories: Vienna-born Kurt Fuchel, one of the
            handful of children eventually reunited with his parents after the
            war; novelist Lore Segal, whose determination as a ten-year-old
            adrift in England managed to secure the necessary domestic service
            visa for her parents and a birthday reunion on safe ground (her
            95-year-old mother </font></span><font face="Verdana" size="2">Franzi
            Groszmann is also interviewed); and now-deceased rescuer Norbert
            Wollheim, 25 years old when he began organizing the Berlin end of
            the rescue program that saved between six and seven thousand
            children.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            the children are collected and shipped east, their farewells are
            tearfully recreated, their harrowing journey painstakingly
            recreated. The actual train route from Berlin to Holland is
            re-filmed as several survivors recall the trepidation and sadness
            permeating their excursion, the muted clatter of the metal wheels an
            ominous heartbeat. It is only after safely being delivered to Dutch
            authorities that there are any images of the children smiling in the
            entire undertaking, savoring hot cocoa and sweet Zwieback biscuits
            as if they were manna from heaven.<o:p>

            witness, Lory Cahn, recalls her father’s tear-filled farewell only
            to have him, unable to part with his daughter, pluck her from the
            train window as it was departing the station. She survived</font></span><font face="Verdana" size="2">
            Theresienstadt, Auschwitz, and six other death camps; her parents
            did not. When liberated at Bergen-Belsen she weighed 58 pounds.<o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">All of the interviewees should be
            recognized for their touching memories -- some painful, others less
            so -- and their uplifting courage in a Hellish world unfit for any
            child; all were truly innocents cast into the arms of strangers, all
            hoping they would some day be reunited with their families. <span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times">It
            is a compelling film, sharply focused in story and content.
            Cameraman Don Lenzer and editor Kate Amend zoom and pan to the
            important faces, generally children, found in the archival
            materials, concentrating your attention where it should be. The film
            zig-zags between its subjects as their stories unfold, connected by
            shared experiences and overlaid with history lessons that expand the
            subject beyond its intimacy. Such is the case of Alexander Gordon, a
            Hamburg orphan who was one of the first to leave Germany, yet was
            later arrested as an enemy alien in England in mid-1940 and expelled
            to Australia aboard the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">HMT
            Dunera</i>. Then just 18 years old, he remembers being subjected to
            two months of near starvation at sea, scraping bits of jam from an
            empty pot. On a ship filled to twice its capacity, barely escaping
            destruction by a German U-boat, he survived the journey, believing a
            simple box of food (cheese sandwiches, apples, and bananas) he
            received as the boat docked down under to be the best meal he ever
            had. Newsreels, stills, headlines, and other documentary techniques
            efficiently flesh out the sequence.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            faded hopes of repatriation closed the door on one of history’s
            most painful chapters. Those left to fend for themselves did as best
            they could. Alexander Gordon insists, on the verge of tears, that "I
            was meant to survive to bring on another generation." Nicholas
            Winton, the London organizer for the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Kindertransport</i>,
            believed most of the children were happy. "Everyone was at least
            alive at the end of the war." Deborah Oppenheimer and Mark Jonathan
            Harris have a much larger family to be proud of with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Into
