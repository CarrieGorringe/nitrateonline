<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>When
the Directors' Guild of America announces their annual award nominations on
January 24, there will be one name that will not be among them. Current Guild
president Jack Shea has announced that the name of D.W. Griffith will be
stricken from the honorary award given by the Guild for career excellence. The
reason has to do with Griffith being a &quot;racist&quot; director, and that,
through his work, in Shea's words, he &quot;helped foster intolerable racial
stereotypes.&quot; <o:p>
 </b>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">No
matter how many films they may make during their careers, one film will usually
stick to a director, whether it be Mike Nichols with <i>The Graduate</i>, or
Martin Scorsese with <i>Raging Bull</i> (a film which, upon its initial release,
was so uncommercial that it actually set Scorsese's career back by several
years), François Truffaut with <i>The 400 Blows</i> or Quentin Tarantino with <i>Reservoir
Dogs</i>. For Griffith, that film has been his 1916 <i>The Birth of a Nation</i>,
probably the most widely-seen film ever made, the first feature-length film ever
made, the first commercial film to be release with a running time of over two
hours, a film whose battle scenes have been likened to the classic Civil War
photography of Mathew Brady, and a film which U.S. President Woodrow Wilson
likened to &quot;history written by lightning.&quot; The film is remembered for a
number of reasons, including its use of a mobile camera, of optical effects, of
cross-cutting, and for using superimpositions and split-screen effects. It also
contains, mostly in its second half depicting the South during Reconstruction,
what many regard as adverse depictions of African-Americans, and uses white
actors in key roles wearing &quot;blackface&quot; makeup. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I
have often wondered how Griffith's reputation would have fared were his 1918
film <i>The Greatest Thing in Life</i> still in existence. A victim of nitrate
decomposition and eventual destruction, it was the third in a triptych of war
films which began with <i>Nation</i> and continued with his First World War film
<i>Hearts of the World</i> (also released in 1918). In <i>The Greatest Thing in
Life</i>, the main character, a prejudiced white soldier, comes to the aid of a
blinded, fatally wounded black soldier who cries out in panic and terror. The
white soldier helps him, comforts him, ensures that the dying man's final
moments are ones spent in peace, and experiences a profound change of heart as a
result of his experience. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
film is said to have been immensely moving. It is also the only other of
Griffith's feature films that dealt directly with white people's attitudes
towards persons of color. But in its absence, and with the absence of much of
Griffith's work from the public view (Kino Video's release of <i>Way Down East</i>,
for instance, is currently in moratorium), those critical of the director can
reduce his work downwards with one stroke.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Never mind that the DGA has only now realized this, after having given
out the award in Griffith's name for forty-six years. Or that there has been no
vocal protests about changing the award's name on the same scale as those being
held over the fate of Elian Gonzales. Or that, on January 8, the National
Society of Film Critics, for the first time in the organization's history,
issued an open letter asking that the Guild rescind its decision. Or that
Griffith made over 400 films prior to <i>Birth of a Nation</i>, most, if not
all, social-minded, and that he continued to make social-minded films after the
production and release of <i>Birth of a Nation</i>. Griffith is, now, plainly
and simply, a &quot;racist&quot; director. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And,
not only that, but, depending on which news story you read, he is being
excoriated for creating a film which caused the resurgence, in the 1920s, of the
Ku Klux Klan as a hate group. (which is untrue: social and economic conditions,
in the Northeast and South, after the First World War were the cause for the
Klan's revival.) <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">How
historically accurate is <i>Birth of a Nation</i>? Griffith said that what he
wanted to get at was the &quot;truth&quot; about conditions in the South during
the Reconstruction, and it is a matter of record that freemen did extract some
amount of vengeance upon former slave owners for what they experienced under
slavery. William Styron's 1966 novel, <i>The Confessions of Nat Turner</i>,
offers a vivid, even terrifying, portrait of such actions. It is a page of
history that Hollywood was unable to deal with even in the late Sixties, when
Norman Jewison wanted to direct a film version of Styron's novel, starring James
Earl Jones. The studios' unconditional turndown of the film is said to have been
one of the great disappointments in Jones' career. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
first incarnation of the Ku Klux Klan was in response to the lawlessness and
injustice that was being extracted, mostly by carpetbaggers from the North, upon
Southerners during the Reconstruction, a time when many people took advantage of
the circumstances to further their own means or, worse, to punish the South for
its instigation of the Civil War. Lawlessness broke out, and the courts could
not be counted on to enforce justice. As a result, the organizers of the Klan
took matters into their own hands, and punished offenders through
&quot;underground&quot; means. Parades of Klansmen, on horseback, wearing their
white, hooded uniforms and insignia, would create periods of quiet and civil
order in towns and localities where there had been unrest. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">When
some groups wearing Klan outfits began committing lawlessness, the original
organizers of the group issued an order to disband in 1869. An 1871
Congressional report on Klan activity, which encompassed 13 volumes, included
the summary statement: &quot;Had there been no wanton oppression in the South,
there would have been no Ku Kluxism [<i>sic</i>]. Had there been no rule of the
tyrannical, corrupt carpetbagger or scalawag rule, there would have been no
secret organizations. From the oppression and corruption of the one sprang the
vice and outrage of the other.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Griffith,
born in Kentucky in 1875, the son of a Confederate cavalry officer known as
&quot;Roaring Jake&quot; Griffith, and raised in a household amid stories of the
Civil War, was not out to glorify the Klan with <i>Birth of a Nation.</i> The
once-proud North Carolina family, the Camerons, shown in the film could very
well have been his own, for the Griffiths had been reduced to poverty as a
result of the Reconstruction, and David Wark Griffith worked in Louisville
taking odd jobs to support his family before he was pointed in the direction of
a career as a stage actor. What Griffith saw in the source material, Thomas
Dixon's novel, <i>The Clansman</i>, was a base upon which he could depict how
Northerners ran roughshod over the South after the war and following Lincoln's
assassination (the president who succeeded Lincoln, Andrew Johnson, became so
ensnared by political maneuverings in Washington that he was virtually rendered
ineffective), and that Southerners responded by having to resort to vigilante
means. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If
he had hewn to this more closely, the film might have better withstood the test
of time. But Griffith was also fond of the use of melodramatics. Thus the scene
where the corrupt political leader Silas Lynch, a mulatto (the product of a
white man and a, possibly unwilling, black woman), attempting to force the white
daughter of a Northern reformism to marry him, and the scenes where enraged
blacks, in militia uniform, storm a cabin to get at a handful of defenseless
white people huddling inside. When this sequence floods across the screen, it is
admittedly difficult to maintain some sort of objectivity. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If
Griffith is truly guilty of anything, it is of directorial choices in <i>Nation</i>
that look bad in hindsight, and for not displaying a modern politically-correct
attitude. He was raised a Southern gentleman, and he worked as an actor on the
stage at a time when the conventions of the minstrel show were widely accepted.
But he did have the vision and courage to move the motion picture beyond the
level of filmed skits into something more ambitious and vital. In terms of
technical innovation, one would hope to be able to make as much of a protean
contribution, a leap into the land of the unknown, as Griffith did. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
I think the reason that an eighty-five-year-old film like <i>The Birth of a
Nation</i> continues to affect people long after other various bits of flotsam
and jetsam have passed down the stream is because Griffith made pictures with
something that used to be called &quot;moral fervency," as well as technical
aptitude. He was against censorship, believed in showing the bad as well as the
good, and spoke his mind. I think he was concerned about hurting people with his
work. After the NAACP voiced objections to aspects of <i>Nation</i>, Griffith
expanded the film he was then currently working on, <i>The Mother and the Law</i>,
into a four-part depiction of injustice through the ages, <i>Intolerance</i>, a
film into which he poured all his earnings from <i>Nation</i> and which would
never end up making a dime, but he made the film. (And <i>Intolerance</i> is the
film which, from my standpoint, is Griffith's true masterpiece, every bit as
alive and moving today as it was when first released.) <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">A
still painting can depict the beauty of a tree, Griffith pointed out, but a
moving picture can depict that beauty as well as the beauty of the wind moving
through that same tree, and it is for this reason that we also cannot reject all
of Griffith's work out of hand. That would comprise a considerable amount of
work. Lillian and Dorothy Gish as sisters who are separated, but then reunited,
by chance, in <i>Orphans of the Storm</i>. Lillian Gish baptizing her newborn
child in a snowbound cabin in <i>Way Down East</i>. Lillian Gish, again, hiding
within a closet, terrified of being beaten by Donald Crisp, in <i>Broken
Blossoms</i>. The valiancy of Constance Talmadge's character, the &quot;mountain
girl," in the Babylonian sequences of <i>Intolerance</i>, and the beautiful
spiritedness of Mae Marsh, in the modern sequences of that film (Marsh's best
screen acting work, before she went on to make studio films and remade herself
over as a Star). The stark, even harrowing, quality of Griffith's last film, <i>The
Struggle</i>, with its depiction of a spirited, perfectly happy man, a good
husband and father, gradually reduced, through chronic alcoholism, into a
shambling, incommunicative animal. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">After
the release of <i>The Struggle</i>, in 1931, Griffith never worked as a director
again. For the next 17 years, he shuttled between his ranch, in the San Fernando
Valley, and Hollywood. In the 1940s, he would speak with journalist Ezra Goodman
about the current films being shown and coming innovations, such as the
&quot;broad&quot; or &quot;wide-angle&quot; film format, which he believed would
combine visual and pictorial depth and clarity in such a way that would bring
together the best qualities of both film and the theatrical stage. (And future
films, from <i>Lawrence of Arabia</i> to the recent <i>The Insider</i>, bore him
to be right.) On later trips to Hollywood, though, he would check into his room
at the Hollywood Knickerbocker Hotel, opening his door only to take in meal
trays or deliveries of liquor. He gave up on writing his autobiography, said
that <i>Birth of a Nation</i> and <i>Way Down East</i> weren't so hot after all.
&quot;In my arrogant belief,&quot; he said, &quot;we have lost beauty.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
1959, eleven years after Griffith's death, Frank Capra stated, &quot;Since D.W.
Griffith, there's been no major improvement in the art of film direction. Of
course, there have been the strictly technical improvements -- many. But as far
as sheer creative direction is concerned, no one really has advanced beyond the
achievements of Griffith. Run down the whole gamut -- starting with his
introduction of suspense, editing, the flashback, close-ups. You name it, and I
can show you where he employed it.&quot; The occasion for these remarks was
Capra's receiving the Screen Directors' Guild's D.W. Griffith Award for
&quot;creative achievement in the film industry." <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Of
course, it's the Guild's award and they can do with it however they wish. As
Steve Martin said of the Academy Awards, &quot;It's their contest.&quot; (With
the emphasis on the word &quot;their," not &quot;our.") But how much further
should we take the stick to Griffith's back for <i>Birth of a Nation</i>? And at
what cost? <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Lillian
Gish was fierce and unflagging in her devotion towards Griffith all her life.
She so believed in Griffith as a director and an artist that, during the
sequence in <i>Way Down East</i> where her character's unconscious body floats
downriver on an iceflow, Griffith told her to trail one hand in the genuinely
icy water, and Gish did as he requested -- resulting in permanent nerve damage
to that hand for the rest of her life. But that did not dissuade her feelings
about Griffith. During one of the televised American Film Institute Life
Achievement Awards ceremonies in the Seventies, she addressed the student
filmmakers who had just been given awards bestowed in Griffith's name, and, in a
voice which pealed like a bell, Gish told them to honor well the name of the man
that is on those awards. Gish was one of the first people to work, ceaselessly
and tirelessly, towards film preservation in America. She was the one who
pointed out that the twentieth century is the first time in history where man
could record the events of times he was living in using moving pictures. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
Birth of a Nation</span></i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
is a record of its time. It was an attempt, by the sensibilities that existed in
1915 and 16, to depict the struggle and outcome of one of the worst times in
American history. Some of the attitudes that have become attached to this film
are ones which I do not, and can not, advocate. I do not believe in the
demeaning of any group or minority in ways that are pernicious. I have seen
firsthand the pointlessness and petty meanness of people who hurl abuse at
persons who mean no harm yet are hurt because their skin was not white, and
could not defend themselves from receiving abuse because of it. And I have seen
and experienced the hatred and viciousness that comes from other forms of abuse,
and the further harm, and evil, that can be caused by it. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I
do not know if <i>The Birth of a Nation</i> has caused anyone who has seen it to
become a racist. I do not think D.W. Griffith was a hatemonger. If he had been,
he wouldn't have made the films that he made. If anything, he tried to present
in <i>Nation</i> a depiction of the time of the Civil War and afterwards that
was, to him, accurate, and in some respects was, but which is in other ways
faulty, whether because of erroneous perceptions on his part of some of the
people he was depicting, or because of the accepted attitudes at the time the
film was made towards those people. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
he should not be denied his place in history. It was a hard-won place. He bucked
the odds considerably with <i>Intolerance</i>, alone. He would not live to see
that film's estimation elevated. If he paid a price for the stigmatization of <i>Nation</i>,
he did so in his final years. Let us acknowledge what may be wrong with <i>Birth
of a Nation</i>, but let us also acknowledge what is right about the rest of
Griffith's work. Let us give him the benefit of a fair mind.</font></span></p>
