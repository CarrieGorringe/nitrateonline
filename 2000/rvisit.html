            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Alex
            Waters is a embittered, confused thirty-three-year-old convict with
            three strikes against him. He's been imprisoned for five years
            twenty-five at the Union Grove State Penitentiary, found guilty for
            a rape he insists he didn't commit. A recovering crack cocaine
            addict, his body is now deteriorating from AIDS he has contracted
            under unrevealed circumstances. And he is estranged from his
            middle-class African-American family, particularly a stubborn,
            stern, and, perhaps, abusive father sarcastically unforgiving of the
            child-man who was once his pride and joy. Jordan Walker-Pearlman,
            wears the producer-director-writer stripes (he also co-edited) on
            this his first fiction feature (after the 1998 snowboarding
            documentary <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Snow Taxi</i> --
            unseen by this reviewer, but obviously nowhere close in intensity to
            his current effort). This very introspective piece is a concentrated
            vision of Kosmond Russell's play (inspired by a true story), barely
            letting the viewer escape beyond the claustrophobia of close-ups and
            two-shots. Like Alex, wrestling with his soul, his life, and his
            relations, we are imprisoned in our seats, struggling to accept why
            an uncaring, impersonal world would hammer down such a star-crossed
            spirit. The filmmaker draws out some exceptional performances from a
            well-worn cast who, like the alchemists of olde, transform
            themselves and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Visit</i>
            into a remarkable healing process, using the medicine of family and
            faith to heal a tortured soul.</b><o:p>

            sparks the story as Tony, the stoic older brother, who is
            celebrating at the family's large thanksgiving gathering, its first
            in many years. Haunted by the absence of his younger sibling, he
            masks his uneasiness and guilt behind a false face of cheer.

            Hill Harper) has been difficult -- he doesn't wish to subject his
            wife and their two children to black sheep of the family -- but the
            successful businessman is poised to break the physical and mental
            stranglehold that is emaciating his brother. Thus begins the arduous
            journey for family and friends in this absorbingly spiritual indie
            effort.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            nervous reunion with his parents runs hot and cold: a caring mother
            tearfully embraces her son, joy pouring down her cheeks, while dad
            scowls in shameful small talk across the table, an emotionally
            wounded animal observing and then erupting in a cynical rage,
            carelessly comparing prison life with Disneyland. Tony's visits
            increase, and he is the catalyst that brings childhood Felicia
            McDonald (Rae Dawn Chong) on a two-hour trek to call unannounced on
            the sullen inmate, who barely recognizes the woman. She's also
            suffered at the hands of society's demons: an incestuous father who
            sired her a child suffering from cerebral palsy, and a drug
            addiction from which she is recovering. Chong creates the most
            memorable performance of the film and her illustrious career (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Quest
            for Fire</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Color Purple</i>, and the PAX-TV series <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Mysterious Ways</i>). In just a few short scenes there's a brilliant
            honesty in her face -- a survivor in a cruel world now hoping to
            help Alex find the spiritual fulfillment that she embodies. Prison
            psychiatrist Dr. Coles (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Cosby Show</i>'s Phylicia Rashad) is the deliberate eye in Alex's
            tormented hurricane, a calm center determined to break down his
            mental barriers and cope with his sulky demeanor and forthcoming
            parole hearing.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">With
            each successive visit (including those of the doctor), Alex retreats
            to semi-visualized dreams that transport him out of prison along the
            train tracks that border the penitentiary, &quot;to gamble in
            Atlantic City, grab some sweet corn in Iowa, or see titties in
            Vegas&quot; as he explains to Dr. Coles. He also escapes into
            enlightening reveries from within his drab cell, the walls barren
            save for the focus of family photographs. As the muted heartbeat
            click-clacks of the incessant trains rumbling by and the chit-chat
            of other inmates dim, the jazz-scented score (pungent original music
            by Michael Bearden, Stefán Dickerson, Ramsey Lewis, Wallace Roney,
            and Stanley A. Smith) kicks up and the basic brown texture of the
            film explodes in hallucinogenic glow. His mother caresses her lost
            son ; Tony jubilantly hugs and hip-hops with him; his father proudly
            reads a bedtime story, resting the boy's head on a welcomed
            shoulder; Felicia slow dancing with him; and Dr. Coles offering the
            challenge of a friendly game of chess and good news from the parole
            board. By the mirage fades and the past memories of better times
            creep into his and the other characters' thoughts, crucial moments
            that define where life's paths diverged into disruption.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hill
            Harper impresses as the tragic prisoner of life's unlucky breaks,
            his voice hushed by the weariness of incarceration and disease. At
            times he sounds very much like Denzel Washington (whom he was
            featured with in Spike Lee's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">He
            Got Game</i>), in compelling world-weary mode. As Lois and Henry
            Waters, Marla Gibbs and Billy Dee Williams both add their own
            passion in roles that reveal their true depth as actors. Talia Shire
            (!), David Clennon, Glynn Turman, Efrain Figueroa, and Amy Stiller
            are the parole board members who bicker amongst themselves, but
            ultimately offer up little more than a rubber stamp impressing how
            America deals with its outcasts.<o:p>

            emotionally-charged ending of the film perhaps covers too much in
            flashback mode, tackling closure through sermonized post-scripted
            reflections, but that in no way detracts from the penetrating power
            of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
