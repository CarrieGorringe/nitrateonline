there is a more perfect expression of life's pains and elations than Al Green's
&quot;Love and Happiness,&quot; I don't know it. Under Green's seductive vocals,
at the start of Gina Prince-Blythewood's <i>Love &amp; Basketball, </i>everything
you see as the camera swings through LA's upper middle class burb, Baldwin Hills
-- sun-dappled trees, houses with green lawns and long driveways, kids shooting
hoops -- is suddenly vibrant and sensual. </font><o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
time is 1981, and the camera slows to focus on three pre-teen boys imagining
themselves as future pro ballers (&quot;Wait till I get big like Kareem!&quot;).
Between dribbling and messing with each other, they pause to greet a new
neighbor who wants to play. Reluctantly, they agree, only to be horrified when
the new kid takes off his cap to reveal long hair: &quot;Awww, he's a
girl!&quot; Monica (Kyla Pratt) persists, and soon impresses her neighbors with
her fierce determination and skills. Even Quincy (Glenndon Chatman), whose
father Zeke (Dennis Haysbert) is a former star player for the LA Clippers,
admires her grit, though of course he won't say so. Instead, he gets into a
fight with her right off the bat, and shoves her to the ground, so that she
scrapes her face. Shortly after, his mother Nona (Debbi Morgan) and hers,
Camille (Alfre Woodard) are forcing the kids to make nice, while they (the
mothers) are comparing outfits and furniture. It's immediately clear that the
basketball court isn't the only competitive arena. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">During
this &quot;First Quarter&quot; (the film is organized as a game), the
youngsters' early relationship is awkward and vaguely cute: when they're not
scrabbling for the basketball, they're testing out boundaries. &quot;Wanna be my
girlfriend?&quot; asks Q, with not an idea in his head what that might mean.
They agree to initial terms (a first, five-second long kiss), but in the next
heartbeat are fighting again, as Monica refuses to give up her own bike in order
to ride on Q's with him. They remain buddies and mutual courtside boosters,
until the film's &quot;Second Quarter,&quot; when they've grown up into Sanaa
Lathan and Omar Epps and are playing high school ball. While Monica struggles
with her game and her aspirations to be the first woman in the NBA (Camille is
on her case about being too tomboyish), Q's a natural talent, a star point guard
already being wooed by his dad's alma mater, USC. The film is hardly subtle
concerning the first part of its title, and its strength is its emphasis on the
second, especially as it follows Monica's stop-and-start career. Still, in high
school, love rules: she resents having to carry love notes to him from other
girls and he's jealous that her date for the Spring Dance is some college hunk
lined up by her more traditionally feminine sister. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">At
this point, the film falls back on a conventional high school movie moment:
Monica and Q spot each other at the dance, across the proverbial crowded room.
Wearing a sheer white dress and her grandmother's pearls, Monica piques Q's
interest, and he leaves his date on the floor to say so. And there are few
surprises in the ensuing action: they dump their respective dates in order to
hook up after the dance (Q crawls in through her window, as their ground floor
bedrooms face each other, adorably). Both are admitted to USC, where they play
basketball and revisit their competition in various forms (this during the
&quot;Third Quarter&quot;). The sweetest of these is a sexy strip nerf-basketball
game in Q's dorm room. The most muddled is Q's insistence that she break curfew
to &quot;be there&quot; when he discovers that his father has been cheating on
his mom for years. Monica refuses to lose her newly assigned starting position
on the USC women's team), and of course, Q can't realize that he's asking her to
perform the same long-suffering, self-abnegating role he's seen his mother play,
because he's a freshman facing his first real emotional crisis. To get back at
her, he takes up with a pretty party girl (<i>The Best Man's </i>Monica
Calhoun), then decides to give Monica a chance to apologize, showing up on the
sidewalk outside her dorm. Monica won't back down, and he stomps off down the
street, needy and angry, as the camera pulls out and up. Sidewalks outside dorms
always look so lonely at times like this. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">All
through the film, Monica is advised -- by Camille, Q, her no-nonsense coach
(Colleen Matsuhara) -- to lose her &quot;hot ass temper,&quot; while Quincy is
encouraged to reap extensive benefits from the NBA &quot;lifestyle&quot; (the
same one that tempted Zeke). Rejecting his dad as a role model (and his advice
that he get an education to &quot;fall back on&quot;), Q decides to enter the
draft after his freshman year: the film suggests this is a self-destructive
move, though, given the increasing pressure on high school stars to turn pro,
the lesson is left hanging at a disappointingly perfunctory level. Instead, <i>Love
&amp; Basketball </i>focuses on Monica's life decisions, on the court and in her
own emotional life. After college, Monica spends a few years in Europe, playing
for Parma's championship women's team, but even when they win, the women don't
get the adulation and perks that are common for the most lowly NBA teams. When
Monica comes home to work at her father's (the wasted Harry J. Lennix) bank (and
finds out that Q's engaged to Tyra Banks, or rather, her flitty tall girl
character, obviously not Q's best match), she and Camille have it out in the
kitchen (yes, Camille's cooking). The scene is strong for not giving either
woman a cheap high ground: you can see their different positions and pains. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">While
the protagonists are clearly shaped by their home lives, the film spends
relatively little time in their homes. Instead, it shows them on the court and
in relation to each other, as rivals, friends, USC teammates, and lovers,
quarreling and not. Most often taking Monica's point of view (strikingly during
a couple of game scenes, the camera takes her on-court perspective while you
hear her voice-over, breathing heavily and telling herself, &quot;Watch the
ball&quot; and &quot;Play smart&quot;), the film is also fair to Q. In granting
both characters fully developed personal and professional storylines, the film
adroitly spreads out the generic demands of melodrama, sports action, and
romance, while making the case that Monica's (non)options as a female athlete
are functions of backwards social, political, and financial thinking. By film's
end, the WBNA comes to the rescue, meaning that at last, the rest of the planet
has caught up with the progressive thinking that <i>Love &amp; Basketball </i>has
presumed throughout. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">But
of this resolution might be forgiven for being too tidy, the finale for the
romance is just silly (not to mention reminiscent of the father-son play-off at
the end of <i>L&amp;B </i>executive producer Spike Lee's <i>He Got Game</i>).
During a one-on-one late at night, the estranged couple competes for Q's
&quot;heart.&quot; (What?!) Still, if you can see past this unnecessary
contrivance (which is somewhat ameliorated by the fact that it plays out under
Me'Shell NdegeOcello's superb &quot;Fool of Me&quot;), the rest of <i>Love and
Basketball </i>does well in conveying complex relationships, at least one of
which is left admirably unresolved. For all its clever basketball metaphoring,
the movie does best when portraying the hard work that goes into love and
happiness.</span><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p>
