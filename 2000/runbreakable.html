            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 24 November 2000</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In <i>Unbreakable</i>,
            writer-director M. Night Shyamalan is again working in the same
            muted colours and hushed, rapt atmosphere that mesmerized audiences
            last year in <i>The Sixth Sense</i>. He is again working with Bruce
            Willis, who seems to respond particularly well under his direction.
            And Shyamalan shows an increasingly fine ability to work with young
            actors, with Spencer Treat Clark, playing the son of Willis'
            character this film, giving a performance that is just as good as
            Haley Joel Osment's in Shyamalan's previous film. How we're supposed
            to ultimately respond to <i>Unbreakable</i>, though, is another
            matter. (And if you're planning on seeing the film, stop here, and
            come back after you have done so.)</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">David Dunn (played by Willis),a
            Philadelphia security guard, emerges from a huge passenger train
            wreak not only as the sole survivor, but completely unharmed, as
            well. The incident somehow helps save his faltering marriage (Robin
            Wright Penn plays his wife). It also puts him in contact with
            another man (Samuel L. Jackson) who could be seen as the exact
            opposite of David: born with a genetic disorder that makes his bones
            extra-brittle, he's spent his entire life either recovering from
            injuries or trying to avoid them. Now, steeped in the world of comic
            book art and comic book heroes, he pursues David, trying to convince
            him that he should use his extraordinary abilities towards the
            benefit of others -- giving both their lives, um, &quot;mythic
            resonance&quot; in the process.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Willis' performance contains some
            of his best work in a while, with grace notes that compensate for
            the fact that, most of time, he has to be unremittingly somber.
            Shyamalan and cinematographer Eduardo Serra spend a lot of time
            revealing valleys and planes of melancholy and sorrow in Willis'
            face, even when there doesn't seem to be any particularly good
            reason to do so. Jackson's portentous line readings (&quot;Now it
            begins.&quot;) and eccentric appearance -- wooly hair, outfits made
            of shiny fabrics with accents of royal blue -- as the mysterious
            stranger (named Elijah) don't make sense until the very last scene
            of the film, when Shyamalan springs his double-whammy ending.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As in <i>The Sixth Sense</i>, he
            waits until the last moment to drop in the last piece that makes the
            entire picture become clear. But he doesn't really follow through on
            his story concept, here. Either he should have gone full-speed-ahead
            and shown David and Elijah becoming the real-life equivalents of
            super-hero and arch-villain, or revealed the whole thing to be a
            fallacy. (Which it very well might be: while David is shown actually
            saving some people from becoming victims of a heinous crime, except
            for the train accident, and some heretofore unexplored psychic
            abilities, his ability at being impervious is never entirely put to
            the test.)</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Instead, the picture falls,
            unconvincingly, right in the middle. It's too serious-minded to even
            enjoy as camp, even though you may very well feel like doing so
            after one of the characters refers to the story as taking place
            during &quot;mediocre times.&quot;</font>
