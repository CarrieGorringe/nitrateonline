<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><i><b><font size="5">P</font></b><font size="4">rice
of Glory </font></i><font size="4">opens with a boxing match in Phoenix,
Arizona, 1977. While the mostly Mexican/Latino ringside crowd yells and hoots, a
young man takes a terrible beating. His trainer urges him on, his face is
bruised and panicked, and the scene lurches into that boxing film cliché, the
eight-frames-per-second knock-out punch: his jaw contorts, his blood flies, and
he hits the floor. Hard. Cut to &quot;13 years later,&quot; and the loser of
that bout, Arturo Ortega (now grown up into Jimmy Smits, driving a station
wagon), is a family man, taking his three young sons to their own boxing
competitions. &quot;Come on my little contenders,&quot; he smiles, as they run
to him. &quot;We got some rough-housing to do.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">This
opening sequence sets up <i>Price of Glory</i>'s potentially complex premise:
Arturo is a driven man, seeking salvation, revenge on the unscrupulous trainer
and system who set him up with an opponent beyond his abilities and ruined his
career, and recovery from his own emotional damage. Like any father living his
dreams through his children, Arturo imagines he can set things right by guiding
his two older, talented sons through the stormy world of professional boxing,
shaping their careers to make them champions, not exploited vehicles for someone
else's profit (and especially, he doesn't want them to end up where he is,
trapped in some &quot;crappy assembly line job&quot;). He also thinks he'll be
able to keep his youngest son, Johnny, out of the business altogether. While his
perfect wife, Rita (Maria del Mar), encourages the boys to do their math
homework and hopes they'll eventually go to college, she willingly puts up with
this father-son bonding and battling in the meantime (she spends too much of her
onscreen time picking up the pieces following familial spats).<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Of
course, due to various predictable circumstances -- including the kids's
responses to their doting and demanding dad -- nothing actually happens quite
the way Arturo plans. Middle son Jimmy resists his father's incessant goading
(&quot;Be a chess fighter, not a checkers fighter!&quot;), eldest son Sonny
represses his own growing reluctance, and Johnny takes up boxing just when his
brothers become most fragile and insubordinate: &quot;Because,&quot; the
six-year-old informs his startled but also heartened father, &quot;them two
stink.&quot; The film cuts from the locker room where Arturo has been berating
Jimmy's poor performance, to shots of Arturo with the tiny Johnny in trunks and
gloves, walking through a dimly lit hallway and then down a dimly lit staircase
on their way to the ring: the pair looks magical and hopeful but also vaguely
foreboding. This is a kid headed for trouble, no matter how much he'll be able
to please his father. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">All
three brothers are, in their disparate ways, determined to please Arturo as a
means to find or create their own identities, as athletes, artists, and yes,
men. The problem is, given their inevitable physical imperfections, lapses in
talent or nerve, complex emotions as they grow up competing with and supporting
one another, and absolute commitment to their father's dream -- all while trying
to survive the everyone-knows-it's-crooked boxing cosmos -- the brothers are
constantly absorbing Arturo's criticisms and he's rarely able to see the damage
he's doing. His education, then, becomes <i>Price of Glory</i>'s focus, and his
sons are the conduit for his coming to terms with his own lost dreams and his
continuing hopes for the future.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">While
this early part of the movie is pretty much solely focused on Arturo's ambitions
(the story of the patriarch), once the sons are old enough to manage adult
arguments with Arturo and each other, it turns into something else, and
something unusual, that is, a kind of male melodrama. As the sons train daily at
the LA gym Arturo has established for them, the Mariposa Boxing Club --Clifton
Collins Jr. plays increasingly sullen Jimmy, Jon Seda is pretty boy (and
practically career- and marriage-minded) Sonny, and the charismatic Ernesto
Hernandez (in his film debut) as dog-loyal prodigy Johnny -- the tensions
increase exponentially. While Rita certainly mediates among her menfolk --
pushing Arturo to look at himself, encouraging Sonny to have faith, or Jimmy to
find an &quot;inner&quot; strength -- the movie's emotional focus is steadfast
on the guys. No doubt, this focus is occasionally uneasy, and leads to some
formulaic moments and exchanges, mostly used as transitions to more interesting
moments and exchanges. But for the most part, the film works hard to avoid
stereotypes, to treat its characters and its audience with respect.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Like
most boxing movies, <i>Price of Glory </i>is about honor and anxiety, as these
concerns inform that quaint notion, &quot;character.&quot; Here, as usual,
crises focus on what it means to be a man. For the Ortegas, of course, these
predicaments are complicated by racism, ethnocentrism, and commercialism. They
continually tussle over how to protect and provide for their family, achieve a
consummately styled machismo, and, oh yes, vanquish their oppressors, incarnated
emphatically -- and prosaically -- by Ron Perlman's cigar-chomping promoter,
Nick Everson (aided by Pepe [Paul Rodriguez], the preemptive Latino heavy).
Arturo sees demons everywhere, but unsurprisingly, his kids are less inclined to
view &quot;selling out&quot; as sinful. In turn, Arturo has trouble forgiving
their apparent wussiness: Sonny is just too damned telegenic (think: Oscar de la
Hoya) and Jimmy succumbs to despair and drugs (in one stagy melodramatic scene,
anyway, perhaps standing in for worse transgressions, perhaps not). Golden boy
Johnny, too virtuous for his own good, must suffer for everyone else's egos and
inability to compromise. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">But
compromise is a difficult concept in a sports story, and perhaps especially in a
boxing film, by definition invested in manly stereotypes and &quot;ideals.&quot;
Written by sports journalist/novelist/playwright Phil Berger (he also worked
with Joe Frazier and Larry Holmes on their autobiographies), <i>Price of Glory </i>is
often exasperatingly banal, depicting corruptions in the business as if its
higher-minded characters are perpetually startled (or at least dismayed) to
discover them. While watching them struggle and emote, I was reminded of Don
King's late 1999 appearance on <i>The Chris Rock Show, </i>during which he
denied up and down that boxing is fixed, while Rock called him out for being so
ridiculous. <i>Price of Glory </i>portrays a similar sense of incredulity, on
all sides -- Everson acts offended that Arturo distrusts him, Arturo is stunned
that his boys reject him -- as if all this astonishment (and the morality it
intimates) might explain, maybe even justify, how the system of deceit and
desire remains so entrenched.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">But
the mendacity and the appetite persist because the myths persist, and the myths
keep on in part because media fictions laud the courage of winners (and on
occasion, as with Rocky, losers with gumption). The myths script triumph over
adversity and redemption by good intentions, as if such plot turns make the
larger problem -- the multiple abuses built into the sports-entertainment and
promotions industries -- just one more set of tribulations to overcome with
moral piety and faith in Number One. It's an old-fashioned and so, substantial
and even important story, yes, but it's also old, as in, it doesn't tell you
anything you don't already know. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Price
of Glory </span></i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">does
try to update its situations and tone, in part with its soundtrack -- featuring
a host of contemporary Latino hiphop, Mexican, and rock &quot;en Español&quot;
acts, including Cypress Hill, Los Lobos, Quetzal, Pastilla, Ozomati, Puya, and
Caminando (whose track on the CD, &quot;El Gran Silencio,&quot; is flat out
great), not to mention that great cowboy poser, Kid Rock -- and in part with its
character details, especially by allowing the terminally patient and always
sympathetic Rita to demonstrate, repeatedly, her own intelligence and honor, as
when you see her frustration at Arturo's outrageous snub of Sonny's
in-laws-to-be, her consistent generosity in negotiating between father and sons.
You want to see more of Rita, but it is Arturo's film, and he's a larger than
life character if ever there was one. Indeed, as intimated in that first scene,
Arturo is full of potential and laid low by devices that anyone who's seen a
boxing movie might have anticipated. Angry, aggressive, and full of conflict,
he's also too often reduced to uplifting allegory, so that his bad fortune and
culpability become a matter of poor judgment rather than a substantive
indictment of the commercial and cultural structures that produce and consume
his story, again and again. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">In
part, the movie is bound by generic demands: the triumphant boxing ring finale
is inevitable, and it's hard to conceive of a movie that would take you through
all the emotional travails this one does and then not give you <i>something </i>to
feel all right about. Still, even if you might wish that it had pushed its
critique of the business harder -- and obviously, I wish it had -- you can also
grant that it's taking on a terrible burden from frame one, a burden that is
broadly cultural, classed and raced as well as gendered. The saga of the Ortegas
is certainly true, in that there exist any number of families and individuals
who see boxing as a &quot;way out,&quot; a way to get a chunk of the
&quot;American Dream,&quot; whatever that might be anymore. But what the saga
leaves out is fundamental: what is this glory, and who determines its meaning
and price? <o:p>
