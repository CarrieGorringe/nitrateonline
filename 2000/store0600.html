            review by <a href="../eddie.html">Eddie Cockrell</a></font></i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">There’s
            a sense of wonder permeating <i>Bicentennial Man</i>, as in, "wonder
            why Robin Williams can’t seem to shake this sappy phase he’s
            going through," or, "wonder why somebody in the actor’s immediate
            orbit can’t prevent him from starring in such breathtakingly
            miscalculated projects as <i>What Dreams May Come</i> (1998), that
            bizarre remake of Jacob the Liar (1999), and now <i>Bicentennial Man</i>."
            These are pertinent and interesting questions, but the answer lies
            with the actor alone; in the meantime, audiences are left bewildered
            by such supposed family fare. Adapted from an Isaac Asimov short
            story, the film follows 200 years in the life of Andrew, a robot who
            yearns to be human after watching his host family through numerous
            generations. Other than being slow as molasses (those two centuries
            play out like, well a couple hundred years), <i>Bicentennial Man</i>
            isn’t bad or anything, just cheerless, witless, and, ultimately,
            bloodless, with a final courtroom scene awash in righteous posturing
            as grating as it is preposterous. Williams has built an admirable
            career as a comic actor with some depth and taste, but the recent
            dilution of his filmography with this kind of treacle has to be
            alarming to the Hollywood establishment and is distressing to his
            legion of fans. The DVD features a making-of featurette.</span></font>

            schlubby pool, pond and toilet cleaner (co-writer Rob Schneider), so
            broke he takes the bus around Los Angeles with his equipment, falls
            into the "man-whore" business and proves that kindness is a virtue
            in <i>Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo</i>, a not-so-Swiftian satire which
            demands it’s audience to wade through a flood of bodily function
            humor on it’s way to the message that it’s far more important to
            be happy with yourself than pay for sex (or something along those
            lines). "You have a way of satisfying a woman that would sicken a
            normal man," Deuce’s "man-pimp" T.J. (Eddie Griffin) tells him
            with undisguised glee, and it’s true, as Deuce nurtures the inner
            beauty of a string of women with various infirmities ("hand me my
            leg," says one). Lowbrow comedies of this ilk, if done, ah,
            properly, provide satiric windows not only on popular culture, but
            social mores and personal fortitude as well. Thus, Deuce is able to
            win the day through his plucky combination of intrepid disposition
            and extreme tolerance. "Did I bring you pleasure," he plaintively
            asks one client (an unbilled Marlo Thomas, of all people). "Not
            really," she says, and while some audiences may feel the same way,
            the grossly goofy <i>Deuce Bigalow: Male Gigolo</i> has something to
            say and a determinedly frat-house approach to saying it. Available
            on video since early December 1999, the new DVD release includes,
            for those completists out there, both wide- and full screen
            presentations, a "Making Of" featurette and storyboard-to-scene
            comparisons.</span></font>

            cross between <i>The Snake Pit</i> and <i>Clueless</i>. Winona Ryder
            plays a girl in the late 1960s who gets tossed into a sanitarium by
            her parents so she won't turn into a student radical; Angelina Jolie,
            in a self-consciously showy performance (which won her an Oscar),
            plays a spiritedly rebellious fellow patient. Jolie may be able to
            do cute things while sucking on cherries, but she doesn't come close
            to Celeste Holm, who played a somewhat similar role opposite Olivia
            de Havilland in the 1948 <i>Snake Pit</i>. James Mangold directed,
            with supporting performances by Vanessa Redgrave, Whoopi Goldberg,
            and the ubiquitous Jared Leto. A Spanish subtitled tape is
            available, and the DVD features a commentary track from director
            James Mangold (<i>Cop Land</i>), an HBO First Look documentary on
            the film’s making, deleted scenes with commentary and an isolated
            music score.</span></font>

            adaptation of a Stephen King novel (which was originally published
            in serial-like installments). Tom Hanks plays a prison guard who has
            second thoughts about whether an inmate (Michael Clarke Duncan) on
            Death Row should be executed or not. The story, though, ultimately
            feels like an episode of Rod Serling's <i>Twilight Zone</i> which
            somehow ended up running three hours. The altruistic may want to
            step out to the lobby (or a variation thereof) when Michael Jeter's
            character is finally led to the chair. The DVD includes a featurette

            about its first half hour or so, <i>Mr. Death</i> seems more like
            the profile of a Mr. Mouse: the son of a prison warden and a trained
            engineer, owlish and mild-mannered Fred A. Leuchter, Jr. sort of
            stumbled into a successful business designing various machines for
            use on the Death Rows of American prisons. He seems to be a
            persuasive, if somewhat eccentric craftsman in a macabre business,
            and joins a long list of unusual people to be profiled by
            uncategorizable filmmaker Errol Morris (who makes what might be
            described as stylized documentaries). Then, Leuchter’s life takes
            a fateful turn after he’s asked to inspect the ruined gas chambers
            of Auschwitz for cyanide gas residue by a neo-Nazi<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">&nbsp;
            </span>named Ernst Zundel. After surreptitiously gathering and
            analyzing samples by pounding away at the walls and floors with a
            hammer and sending the mess to a lab with little guiding criteria,
            Leuchter concludes in the absence of such residue the Holocaust
            never happened. Needless to say, this pronouncement turns Leuchter,
            who from all appearances is an unpleasantly outspoken popinjay, into
            a pariah in some quarters and a hero in others. It isn’t often a
            documentary has a production designer, but then again, there
            aren’t many filmmakers like Morris, who told Nitrate Online’s
            own Cynthia Fuchs &quot;you couldn’t possibly make Fred up. It is
            just too bizarre.&quot; So too is the film, which employs the kind
            of impressionistic real-life storytelling<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">&nbsp;
            </span>Morris has pioneered in such films as <i>The Thin Blue Line</i>
            (1988) and <i>A Brief History of Time</i> (1992), here massaged by
            the extraordinary score of Caleb Sampson, to allow Leuchter to
            present himself warts and all. Morris makes some documentary purists
            uncomfortable, but there’s no denying the seductive immediacy and
            immense power of his approach. According to Morris, Leuchter likes
            the film, a fact which, in light of the mammoth contradictions
            inherent in his life, makes perfect sense.</span></font>

            Given the sheer number of movies he makes, and the intricate detail
            involved in even the most routine production (one, say, with no
            period trappings and few special effects), the craftsmanship and
            precision evident in every frame of <i>Sweet and Lowdown</i> makes
            the production all the more noteworthy in the Allen canon. Taking a
            page from his <i>Zelig</i> playbook, Allen has fashioned the
            tumultuous early years of one Emmett Ray, an obscure guitarist in
            1930s America whose talent for the instrument is matched only by his
            self-destructive ego. Sean Penn, who seems to keep announcing his
            imminent retirement from the acting profession, is the most
            prominent among the alphabetically listed cast (an Allen hallmark)
            and gives a terrific performance as the self-centered musician.
            He’s matched step for step by relative newcomer Samantha Morton
            (Oscar nominated) as Hattie, an adoring, subserviant mute who
            maintains a shining dignity in the face of his torrents of abuse.
            Framed by a distinctly period hat, she’s endearingly expressive in
            the way that such silent film stars as Mary Pickford were,
            calibrating an endless series of facial expressions to speak in
            shades that language just can’t express. It is this very nuance
            and depth that permeates the film as a whole, a level of dramatic
            sophistication which Allen has rarely achieved (think <i>Crimes and
            Misdemeanors</i> or the early and underrated <i>Interiors</i>).
            History will reveal Woody Allen as certainly among the most prolific
            directors of the latter half of cinema’s first century, but the
            record will also place him among the most dramatically successful
            artists in the medium -- no faint praise for the guy who had to
            overcome a reputation for all those comedies. In keeping with
            Allen’s spare approach to credits, the DVD edition is a
            stripped-down affair, offering only subtitles and a trailer.</span></font>

            perfectly respectable filming, by Anthony Minghella, of the Patricia
            Highsmith novel (which was previously filmed, gloriously, by René
            Clément as <i>Purple Noon</i> in 1959), with Matt Damon as an
            ambitious young man who seeks to rise in the world by insinuating
            and copying other people's mannerisms. The picture works fine during
            the first hour, but drags badly in the second, and the film runs
            almost two-and-a-half hours as a whole. Still, gorgeously
            photographed (by John Seale), great 1950s jazz music score (by
            Gabriel Yared, who uses two of Chet Baker's signature songs to
            bookend the action), and while the supporting ranks include Jude
            Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Cate Blanchett, and Philip Seymour Hoffman,
            the actor everyone seemed to talk about afterwards was Jack
            Davenport, who plays the gentle concert pianist (a character
            invented by Minghella) whom Ripley next attaches himself to. The
            features-laden DVD includes documentaries on the making of the movie
            and the creation of the soundtrack, as well as a commentary track by
            Minghella and a couple of music videos.</span></o:p>

            the collaboration of W.S. Gilbert (Jim Broadbent) and Arthur
            Sullivan (Allan Corduner) almost fell apart for good, until it was
            revived by an idea for a nice little show set in the Orient, <i>The
            Mikado</i>. A movie nobody thought director Mike Leigh, a maker of
            thoroughly here-and-now films, was going to come close to
            pulling-off -- and everyone turned out to be wrong. The picture
            succeeds beautifully, and was the least poky of the majestic-sized
            1999 year-end releases. The performances are uniformly excellent,
            but special attention deserves to be paid to Richard Simon, who
            makes a brief appearance as Gilbert's ancient father (who is,
            alternately, howlingly funny, and hair-raising poignant); Timothy
            Spall, as D'Oyly Carte company member<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">&nbsp;

            his one big solo number; and Lesley Manville, who, as Gilbert's
            wife, delivers one of the most haunting and affecting soliloquies in
            recent film. There’s a Spanish subtitled VHS tape available, and
            the DVD features production stills, a &quot;making of&quot;

            of the <i>Palme d'Or</i>, or grand prize Golden Palm (with Abbas
            Kiarostami's Iranian drama <i>Taste of Cherry</i>)at the fiftieth
            Cannes Film Festival in 1997, the great Shohei Imamura's <i>The Eel</i>
            is a precisely visualized smorgasbord of emotions adapted from Akira
            Yoshimura's novel <i>Glimmering in the Dark</i> that finds the
            revered director, at seventy-one, in complete control of his craft.
            Released from prison after serving eight years for killing his wife
            in the gruesome but oddly poignant passage that opens the film,
            taciturn ex-con Takuro (Koji Yakusho) retreats with his eponymous
            pet to a seaside village and the rural life of a barber. Joined by
            the frail young woman he rescues from a botched suicide attempt (Misa
            Shimizu) and a gaggle of local eccentrics, Takuro slowly builds for
            himself a life full of little disappointments and modest victories,
            small heartbreaks and big laughs. &quot;Do you know that eels travel
            far?&quot; someone says by way of sublime moral, &quot;They travel
            as far as the equator, then come back to live in the mud here.&quot;
            Modest yet moving, <i>The Eel</i> is just like that folksy wisdom:
            low-key yet illuminating. New Yorker’s spotless video transfer
            preserves the movie’s delicate aura.</span></font>

            tight, atmospheric thriller that stumbles only in the last few
            minutes, <i>The Last Stop</i> is a British Columbia-shot B-picture
            that’ll do nicely if your first -- okay, and your second --
            choices aren’t on the shelves. Adam Beach (from <i>Mystery, Alaska</i>
            and <i>Smoke Signals</i>) stars as Colorado state trooper Jason, who
            finds himself stuck at The Last Stop Café and Motel with a group of
            locals and strangers as a snowstorm whips through the region. Aided
            by owner Fritz (Jurgen Prochnow), Jason must grapple with a couple
            of mysteries, including a pair of dead bodies and a bagful of money.
            The suspects include the vexingly mannered Rose McGowan as Jason’s
            former flame and Canadian character actor Callum Keith Rennie (<i>Last
            Night</i>, David Cronenberg’s <i>eXistenZ</i>) as a priapic truck
            driver. For much of its ninety-four-minute length the movie is
            divertingly taut, with director Mark Malone (<i>Bulletproof Heart</i>)
            using the blowing snow and a maze of opaque plastic strips (the
            motel is in the midst of a renovation) to ratchet up the tension and
            confusion. Unfortunately, Bart Sumner’s script decrees that the
            bad guy is revealed to be a gleefully cackling psycho, and the
            picture backs off from a truly larcenous twist ending by climaxing
            with a cheap, off-camera comeuppance for one of the felons. Still,
            it’s these kinds of movies that nurture new talent and keep vets
            working, and <i>The Last Stop</i> feels like this kind of stepping
            stone for Malone and Beach, at least. The DVD edition features
            optional Spanish subtitles, cast and crew interviews, and an audio
            commentary track by the director.</span></font>

            chilling, incisive view of generational clashes in contemporary
            Islamic culture, Dariush Mehrjui’s <i>Leila</i> is also a kind of
            horror story, as a calculating mother-in-law breaks the spirit of
            her son’s infertile wife, the Leila of the title. To underscore
            the selflessness of this unfortunate but strong creature, the story
            has her assist in finding a second wife for her husband (polygamy
            remains legal in Iran) even though she knows she’ll succumb to
            grief once the marriage goes forward. Mehrjui is a bit older than
            Abbas Kiarostami and Jafar Panahi, two other Iranian filmmakers
            whose works have excited American audiences (<i>Taste of Cherry</i>
            and <i>The White Balloon</i>, respectively), and as such his film
            has a sharper yet more controlled fury at the absurd gulf between
            cutting-edge technology and humiliating customs in contemporary
            Tehran. Ironically, while many of the popular Iranian films take
            children as their subjects, the absence of them and the yearning
            that springs from that gives Leila a devastating force unique to
            Iranian cinema. Both a VHS tape and DVD edition of the film are
            available.</span></font>

            of the British &quot;Survivor,&quot; this series (broadcast recently
            in America on PBS) plops a contemporary British family, the Bowlers,
            into a retrofitted Victorian London townhouse with instructions to
            live as an average family might have in 1900 for three months. The
            series has been called a cross between MTV’s <i>The Real World</i>
            and everything from <i>Upstairs, Downstairs</i> to <i>This Old House</i>,
            and while those titles provide a suitable frame of reference the
            show’s current appeal lies in just how different it is from
            &quot;Survivor&quot; in approach while covering much of the same
            territory: the pace is much quieter, and there are no tacky
            production values à la the &quot;Tribal Council&quot; set or
            endurance tests to weed out the weak and different. No rat feasts
            here, only an admirably practical family fraying ever-so-decently
            around the edges at such taken-for-granted conveniences as housework
            and laundry. Of particular interest to history and do-it-yourself
            buffs is the first episode, which goes into exhaustive detail about
            the search for a suitable house, the construction challenges of
            taking out the modern amenities and particularly the problems
            getting an accurate kitchen installed. This VHS box set collects all
            four hours of the series on two tapes, and is an even-tempered and
            appealing antidote to the self-centered titillations of the CBS
            phenomena.</span></font>

            genuine curio from the post-World War II studio years, <i>On Our
            Merry Way</i> (a.k.a. <i>A Miracle Can Happen</i>) continues the
            laudable commitment of Kino Video to spotlighting the lesser-known
            vehicles, programmers and rarities of some of Hollywood’s biggest
            stars. In this case it’s Henry Fonda and Jimmy Stewart, who have
            what amount to clever cameos in the first of four delightful short
            stories woven together by the quest of ambitious young reporter
            Burgess Meredith (who co-produced the film) to get a human-interest
            story from the man on the street. More than a decade before they
            teamed for <i>My Three Sons</i>, Fred MacMurray and the great
            William Demarest play con men out-conned by a ten-year-old hellion.
            But the centerpiece of the film is a howlingly funny spoof of
            Dorothy Lamour production numbers starring, well, Dorothy Lamour as
            a famous actress who tells Meredith the story of her success. The
            film was directed by King Vidor (who next tackled Ayn Rand’s <i>The</i>
            <i>Fountainhead</i>) and Leslie Fenton, with assistance from John
            Huston and then George Stevens on the Fonda/Stewart segment (which
            was written by novelist John O’Hara). Also released from Kino in
            June is the 1946 Douglas Sirk period adventure <i>A Scandal in Paris</i>
            (a.k.a. Thieves’ Holiday), which features a terrific performance
            by George Sanders as a smooth French rogue -- based on a real-life
            thief -- who maneuvers his way into a high-level police job.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">&nbsp;</span></span></font>
