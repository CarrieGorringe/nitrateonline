<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>At
the beginning of <i>Small Time Crooks</i>, Woody Allen's thirtieth feature film,
Allen, as Ray Winkler, slowly appears from behind a newspaper he's reading while
standing on a New York City sidewalk, as he becomes entranced by the idea of
robbing a bank standing right across the street from him. (A recording of Hal
Kemp singing <i>With a Little Money and You</i> beautifully sets the mood on the
soundtrack.) The bank is located only a few doors down from a vacant pizza
joint. <o:p>
 </b>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Since
Ray has already served time in prison for robbery, this new scheme does not go
down well with his wife, Frenchy (Tracey Ullman), but Ray, along with two
accomplices, Tommy (Tony Darrow) and Denny (Michael Rapaport, definitely a step
up from <i>Kiss Toledo Goodbye</i>), and an unexpected third (Jon Lovitz), lease
the pizza joint, with the intent of having Frenchy, whose home-made cookies are
adored by Denny, run the upstairs as a cookie shop, while the four men, in the
basement, use the oldest plan in the book: tunneling under and up into the bank
vault. It's not as if these men were out-and-out dumbbells; it's just that they
are the type of guys who seem fated to get but one important detail always
wrong. They get set to use a power drill, for instance, then get into an
argument over whether it's going to make too much noise or not. (&quot;Whoever's
gonna work the drill, I can tell you now, it's gonna make a lotta noise,&quot;
says Denny.) As it turns out, noise is the last thing they needed to worry
about. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="2" face="Verdana">What
they don't expect, though, is that Frenchy's home-made cookies catch on with the
public. She has to bring in help to accommodate the lines that start forming
around the block. The bank robbery never comes off, but, a year later, Frenchy's
cookie-shop front has turned into an empire. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The
movie then shifts-gears to show how life for the Winklers would be once they
were flush with money, legitimately. Instead of retiring to Miami, which is what
Ray wanted to do all along, he and Frenchy end up in an uptown apartment filled
with furniture of astonishing taste. The production designer, Santo Loquasto,
and costumer, Suzanne McCabe, get the showy-without-the-remedy-of-taste look
precisely, to increasing effect (the matched set of gilt ibis statues, the huge
stuffed gnome in the bedroom, and the weirdly tailored purple-blue, high-waisted
blazer and mustard-colored slacks Ray wears in one scene). But any humor made at
the Winklers' expense is cut short by Ullman's portrayal of Frenchy as someone
yearning to belong, somehow, in a big way. Ullman beautifully delivers a scene
where Frenchy's pink bubble bursts and she suddenly sees, as other people are
seeing, what she really looks like. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So,
she gets an art dealer, David (Hugh Grant), to educate and show her how to be
refined, tasteful, and, as Ray puts it, &quot;putting on airs.&quot; The scenes
not only give Ullman and Grant, two of the best comic performers to come out of
the U.K. in recent years, a chance to work together to subtle effect, but they
also introduce two new elements: how wealth ends up pulling Ray and Frenchy
apart (Ray is perfectly content to have a hamburger for dinner instead of quail,
and stay-in to watch old movies on TV), and how the Winklers end up on the other
end of some crookery, themselves. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This
is the first time in years that Allen has incorporated physical humor into his
films -- one goes back to <i>Annie Hall</i>, in which he did battle with a
spider &quot;the size of a Buick,&quot; and sneezed when he attempted to partake
of some cocaine, for the first time in his life, at a party -- and he seems to
be quite enjoying it, here. <i>Small Time Crooks</i> culminates in a big party
that Ray and his cousin, May, go to which is being thrown by a socialite (the
peerless Elaine Stritch) who has an expensive necklace in an upstairs safe. It's
not that Ray needs the money: one senses that he feels the only way he can get
back to having a normal life again is to pull one more job. The sequence has
some hugely funny moments: Ray trying to, inconspicuously, go upstairs by
walking backwards, being mistaken for a physician because of the stethoscope
'round his neck, and haplessly slamming the safe door shut during every
distraction. It also provides some grist for Ray and Frenchy's eventual reunion,
in which they become romantic when he recalls that, during their first date, she
listened to how the tumblers worked while he cracked a safe. They may start out,
with all cylinders firing, like the Bickersons, with the type of perfectly-aimed
salvos only people who have been living together for a long time can deliver,
but they end up like the Kramdens, sparing and then realizing that they're
really made for each other. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Tracey
Ullman has worked for Allen before, but either her roles were reduced (as in <i>Bullets
Over Broadway</i>), or eliminated altogether. (Ben Stiller was supposed to have
appeared in <i>Small Time Crooks</i>, but his part didn't make it into the
picture.) Allen seems to have written the part of Frenchy with her in mind, and
Ullman couldn't have done a better job with it than she does, here. But the one
performer who made me laugh the most and at-length is the vaguely-recognizable
actress who plays cousin May, the type of relative who, somewhere, seems to have
lost a few connections along the line, or was winged by a cab and hasn't quite
got her bearings, yet. She's the one with whom Ray watches <i>White Heat</i> on
TV, sipping cola and eating Cracker Jacks, while Frenchy and David, in Venice,
are listening to a cello soloist when Frenchy's cell phone rings. (&quot;What is
it? I'm in a crypt!&quot;) She's also the one who tries to cover for Ray at the
party while he robs the safe: when, in reference to Aspen, a couple asks her,
&quot;Do you ski?&quot; May, at a loss, replies, &quot;Do either of you play
miniature golf?&quot; She also meets a wonderful man (George Grizzard) with whom
she strikes a chord. She tells Ray that he said she reminds him of his late
wife, &quot;well, not when she's dead, but when she was alive.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If
the comic timing and delivery are familiar, that's because it's Elaine May, who,
with Mike Nichols, did some legendary comedy sketch work in the 50s and 60s. I
can with all honesty say that her performance in <i>Small Time Crooks</i> was,
at one point, so funny that I laughed so hard it hurt. Elaine May herself has
taken a beating in recent years, whether with her directorial work (the
much-hashed-over <i>Ishtar</i>) or her writing (the stage comedy <i>Taller Than
a Dwarf</i>, which opened disastrously on Broadway this spring). But what a
comeback, here, with a funny and utterly original performance. Enough to make
one wish she'll at least giving acting one more go.</font></span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">&nbsp;</span></p>
