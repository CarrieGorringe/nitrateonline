</span>Well, the main character in the novel is not a fully-drawn character and
what we do get from her is that she is sort of quivering and shy. And she doesn’t speak very
often. I didn’t think that movie would actually get made through a script that
was sort of a literal, but there so much else that is interesting about that
novel. It’s very different from the rest of her work in that it
has darker currents running through with the slavery business and even the whole
atmosphere of sexuality in <i>Mansfield Park</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes"> </span>The authorities are not necessarily benevolent and the
presentation of poverty is much more extreme in this one. It’s usually kind of a passing one little poor scene in her other
novels and here she is thrown into the midst of abject poverty. I think Austen herself had a great fear
of poverty.<o:p>

So just reading it drew my attention to the author and I couldn’t figure out
why she would write a character that was annoying because she is capable of
writing completely fascinating articulate and interesting protagonists. I was
drawn to reading about Austen. I read a few biographies and I found this almost
anarchic spirit in her when she was writing her first works especially and I
just thought it would be interesting to write this meta-fictional mix or
something. I’m not sure why but it felt like a contemporary strategy to
include the reality of the author and her other fiction into the author’s work
of fiction (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Mansfield Park</i>). There’s
a collage or prismatic like approach. Everything you know is mixing reality and
fiction now anyway. You get your newscasters in fictional films playing
newscasters reporting on fictional events. Major political figures are showing
up in works of fiction.<span style="mso-spacerun:

character more like Austen.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>That’s who
I was interested in when I was reading the novel. There’s always that
automatic interest when you’re reading someone’s work. How much of this is

I don’t necessarily believe that they are power people. Right? They don’t
have positions of power in their world. They’re dismissive often then over the
course of the film I make them more worthy of our affection. Men tend to do male
characters and women tend to do female characters. I think that the great male
directors can do good female characters and I hope that I can do good male
characters. That is definitely a point of pride for me that the male characters
are believable and interesting human beings. It’s far too simple to make all
of the women good and all of the men bad. It’s nutty and not even worth

Like a little. Put some syrup on your candy. That’s what I lived in dread of.
The novel itself doesn’t lend itself to that kind of treatment and I set out
to make something that had an aesthetic that would appeal to me. I normally
don’t like costume dramas as they call them and I could be less dramatic. I
tried to minimize the difference. I just thought I’m only interested in the
kind of emotions or dynamics that are eternal or at least last a century or two.
So I just stayed a lot in close ups. I wrote it first as a contemporary drama
and then I translated it into the period. So I went from old to new to old
again, so I could be sure that every joke would work now and that every dynamic
or argument would work now. I think that it pretty much holds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>

An embarrassment of riches, I tell you. There’s a tendency, especially with
the English actors working with one of their greatest writers, toward expressing
a preference as to how they would like to present the line. Harold could get a
bit declamatory too and it’s legitimate if it is the style the director is
going for, but it’s not my style. I like to just throw it away. I like to make
it look accidentally dramatic.<o:p>

Or a writer-- not that any of those jobs are easier. The hours and constant
struggle of being a director is pretty demanding, which is why I don’t do it
very often. I love having the writing stints in between. Writing makes me feel
like a real human being. I get to actually really focus on something and I’m
not on and out there sending myself out and promoting or organizing the world.
I’m just engaging. So it’s a nice rhythm. Interior for the writing then
exterior for the directing then interior again for the editing and exterior
again for the promoting and the releasing of it. I can’t wait to get back to
the writing. Because it’s all there. That’s where movies are made. Movies
are written. Actors flock to well-written things. The scenes direct themselves
if they are written properly. It’s real easy to know what the right thing is.
When the scene is not clear, you don’t know what the intention is: then you
don’t know where to put the camera.<o:p>
