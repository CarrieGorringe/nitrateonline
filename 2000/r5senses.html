            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The
            too-literal scheme of <i>The Five Senses</i> is more than a little
            daunting. Just as the title hints, each of its major characters is
            dealing with a crisis that reduces in some way to one of the five
            senses. So, a widowed massage therapist has lost her sense of human
            &quot;touch,&quot; a young baker has lost her sense of taste, a
            French eye doctor is going deaf, etc. (it doesn't help that all of
            the characters' names begin with the letter &quot;R&quot;). And yet,
            there are also moments when the sheer strangeness of the situations
            threatens to bust out of the film's near-airless structure. At such
            moments, <i>The Five Senses</i> turns into something both more and
            less than the sum of its very precise parts.</b>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Patently
            influenced by his fellow Toronto native Atom Egoyan,
            director/co-producer/co-writer Jeremy Podeswa favors slow camera
            pans and elegant compositions, warm-unto-spooky lighting and
            dialogue that's abstract and self-distancing, but also uncomfortably
            revealing. This comparison doesn't extend to thematic complexities,
            however: if Egoyan's many films over the years have intensively
            explored particular issues (voyeurism, sexuality, loyalty, distrust,
            family relations), Podeswa's feature is just beginning to map a bit
            of terrain. The plot involves a series of domestic dramas linked
            only by the coincidence of characters working in the same office
            building. With this setting, <i>The Five Senses</i> sets out to
            consider something akin to urban alienation, especially as this is
            fanned by media sensationalism and the common luridness of tall
            anonymous buildings and alleyways. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And
            yet, the movie isn't about panic or violence, per se. Rather, it's
            about the ways that the senses are deluded and depressed by daily
            emotional beat-downs, the kinds of events that are so routine, they
            hardly register, except by their long-term effects. And of course,
            such effects have everything to do with the ways that characters
            know and also deceive themselves, as well as their
            self-presentations. What is the relationship between perception and
            reality? Choice and fantasy? Love and desire? Trust and generosity?
            All these questions come up, of course, but they're obscured from
            the outset, more academic than immediate. The single thread that
            affects each character – as observers or participants – is the
            disappearance of a little girl in a park across the street from the
            office building, which means that reporters set up camp and try to
            interview most everyone who comes in or out and that the location
            itself, so humdrum to everyone who works there, turns slightly
            exotic as it appears on their TVs. As they find themselves
            renegotiating their feelings about their daily lives, they also must
            recognize their responsibility in shaping those lives. All this
            makes for a chain of life-changing revelations.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Each
            of these revelations is occasioned by an ostensible choice. For
            instance, the reticent, terminally self-conscious cake baker Rona
            (Mary-Louise Parker) has to decide what to do when her beautiful and
            sensuous Italian lover Roberto (Marco Leonardi) -- whom she met
            while on vacation in Europe -- comes for a visit and presses for a
            commitment. The fact that they share virtually <i>no</i> language is
            the least of their problems: the more he acts out his excitement and
            willingness to love her, the more Rona backs away. And the more
            advice he offers on her gorgeous but flavorless cakes, the more she
            resents him. She's unable to accept him as he is, or to be kind to
            herself. Her mother tells her bluntly during a phone call,
            &quot;Nothing's perfect. The sooner you accept that, the happier
            you'll be.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Afraid
            to make such a leap of faith, Rona turns to distracting
            conversations with her best friend Robert (Daniel MacIvor), a
            bisexual housecleaner whose sense of smell is so finely attuned --
            or so he thinks -- that he believes he can smell love. While Rona
            tries to avoid intimacy, Robert seeks it avidly, to the point of
            making a list of past lovers whom he invites, one by one, to a local
            café for a drink and a sniff, hoping to determine whether he or she
            is the real thing. By juxtaposing their seemingly different
            approaches to romance, the film makes clear that both Rona and
            Robert seek a similar self-affirmation, which neither can reach on
            his or her own. Both are suspicious of the surfaces they can
            understand only through their &quot;senses,&quot; yet both are
            equally unsure of deeper possibilities, in themselves, their
            relationships, and their pasts. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            film offers this kind of observation repeatedly, in each character's
            anxious quest for truth and love. Just so, the French eye doctor and
            opera buff Richard (Philippe Volter), knowing that he is going deaf,
            goes about collecting sounds that hold significant memories for him,
            while also fearing what his imminent loss actually means to him,
            becoming dependent on other people. Looking for a way to express his
            independence, Richard spends an evening with a prostitute (Pascale
            Bussieres), who, as prostitutes tend to do in such contrived movie
            situations, gives him wise advice on loss and change. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            the midst of all this order, the most unruly and intriguing
            character is, perhaps unsurprisingly, a teenager. Rachel (the
            stunningly brave Nadia Litz) is the angry daughter of the massage
            therapist, Ruth (Gabrielle Rose). The good-hearted Ruth is having
            trouble recovering from her husband's recent death (i.e., she's
            &quot;out of touch&quot;), and in turn, has drifted away from
            Rachel, who is feeling confused and spending her days alone.
            Rachel's ascribed &quot;sense&quot; is sight: she's
            age-appropriately concerned with her own appearance (she wears
            heavy-rimmed glasses, her body is changing) and also trying to
            figure out what it means to be sexual, to have sexual desire or
            sexual identity. Her crisis comes when she's supposed to be looking
            after a young daughter of one of her mom's clients (this would be
            the aforementioned central &quot;thread&quot;). The child wanders
            off in the park while Rachel is distracted by a couple making out on
            a bench, which leads to a media onslaught, and a serious discussion
            about loss between Ruth and the girl's mother, Anna (<i>Kissed</i>'s
            Molly Parker, again simultaneously radiant and steely), while Rachel
            is essentially left to deal with her guilt and panic on her own. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Wandering
            through the park again, half searching for her missing charge and
            half searching for a way out of her unhappy life, Rachel meets
            sixteen-year-old Rupert (Brendan Fletcher), a fellow misfit and
            novice voyeur. While the film's other relationship vignettes take
            you pretty much where you might expect to go, this one remains
            slightly off-balance and unresolved. As they discuss their mutual
            feelings and interests, Rachel and Rupert also delve into gender
            limitations and sexual expectations, coming to an understanding of
            each other and themselves that is refreshingly generous and
            nonjudgmental: when Rachel dresses Rupert in girl's clothes and
            makeup, he's more than willing to embrace the chance to feel -- even
            be -- something new. He reassures Rachel, &quot;Not fitting in
            forces you to be original,&quot; which might stand as the film's
            guiding sentiment: where the characters try hard to fit in, to be
            unseen, untouched, and untasted, they are missing potential
            experiences and connections. As Rachel watches and participates in
            Rupert's transformation, she is able finally to see herself in
            relation to someone as &quot;other&quot; as she feels and also
            desires to be. As she puts it, she feels like she's looking at
            Rupert &quot;inside out.&quot; The rest of the film could use a
            similar shake-up. <o:p>
