            review by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 15 September 2000</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Little that happens in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Solomon
            &amp; Gaenor</i> is surprising. Writer-director Paul Morrison
            borrows the motifs that run throughout previous stories like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">West Side Story</i> and leaves them intact. From the first frame,
            everything that follows seems a foregone conclusion.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What keeps the film from stagnating
            is its setting. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Solomon &amp;
            Gaenor</i> recounts the uneasy relationship between the native
            residents of Wales and the Jews who moved to the area at the turn of
            the twentieth century.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>At
            that time, the natives lived in bleak villages where the mines
            barely supported the economies. The workers had an almost impossible
            time of trying to convince management to take their needs seriously.
            The merchant Jews are hardly better off than their neighbors. When
            the miners fall on hard times, no one can afford to buy the goods
            they sell. Nonetheless, the Welsh seem far more tolerant than the
            locals in their former homeland in Russia.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Young Solomon (Iaon Gruffud, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Horatio Hornblower</i>) tires of the drudgery of sitting around the
            house and keeping books while his relatives annoy him with the
            chanting of their prayers. When given the chance, he eagerly takes a
            job as a <i>pacman</i>, or wandering cloth merchant. Along his
            route, he finds himself smitten with a young chapel girl named
            Gaenor (Nia Roberts). Solomon may be infatuated, but he’s not
            stupid. As he begins romancing her, he keeps his ethnicity a secret.
            One visit to her village is all he needs to know that Jews are still
            considered outsiders. They still pronounce, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">&quot;</i>Jew<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">&quot;</i>
            as if it were an epithet. While he constantly fears discovery,
            Gaenor quickly reciprocates his affection. He gradually makes more
            frequent visits and even becomes acquainted with her family. Their
            relationship may be passionate, but the danger to both is constant.
            The two live in strict religious communities that don’t warm to
            foreigners. The tension escalates when Gaenor becomes pregnant, and
            the mining economy worsens.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Where the tale goes from here is an
            easy guess. Still, Morrison creates a credible, if not terribly
            original atmosphere. Both communities are well-captured and
            sympathetic. The Welsh may be xenophobic in this film, but Morrison
            shows how life in the mines could instill that attitude. A solid,
            relatively unknown cast also helps. Gruffud and Roberts are comely
            but still look as if they might inhabit the landscape. Their
            previously unrecognizable faces make their stock characters more
            believable. The film also looks great without ever glamorizing the
            setting. Production designer Hayden Pearce and cinematographer Nina
            Kellgren create dozens of captivating landscapes that, while
            gorgeous, never detract from the bleak tone of the story.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Solomon
            &amp; Gaenor</i> is executed nicely, the routine storyline becomes
            grating. Many of the revelation in the story aren’t jolting as
            intended because they can be detected miles away. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Solomon
            &amp; Gaenor</i> never really becomes universal because its
            environment is ultimately more memorable than its characters or
            story.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
