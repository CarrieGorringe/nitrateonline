<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Robinson Devor has only one movie to his

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The director in him came out when I started
shooting photos of him. He was at the Fine Arts Theater in Kansas City promoting
his freshman effort, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Woman Chaser</i>,
and I thought it would be fun to snap a picture of him standing next to a poster
of the flick. From the viewfinder of my camera, it was obvious the picture was
going to look staged and dull. He immediately told me to shoot him at a low
angle outside the building so that both he and the marquee of the theater would
be in the same shot.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">He then guided me into the theater, where he
browsed through the videotapes and gravitated toward the film noir section. His
eyes lit up as he pointed out Jules Dassin’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Naked
City</i>, so it’s not too surprising that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
Woman Chaser</i> demonstrates a heavy <i>noir</i> influence. Devor based his
movie on Charles Willeford’s (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Miami
Blues</i>) 1960 pulp novel and even filmed it in black-and-white. It stars <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Seinfeld</i>’s
Patrick Warburton as Richard Hudson, a shady used car salesman who decides to
give meaning to his life by making a movie called <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
Man Who Got Away</i>. The fate of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Man
Who Got Away</i> provides much of the bleak humor that runs through Devor’s
film. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Woman Chaser</i> is so far
coming to a happier fate. It’s received glowing reviews and won the Audience
Award at the South-by-Southwest Film Festival in Austin, Texas.</font></p>

<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Dan
Lybarger:</i></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"> You’ve been travelling
a lot lately to promote the film, but haven’t you been travelling most of your
life?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i>Robinson
Devor:</i></b> I’d like to think I've been a few places. I lived in Amsterdam
and Africa for a year. I’d like to think that those are two good places to get
a different kind of experience.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>DL:</i></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
What did you do in Africa?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i>RD:</i>
</b>I was working for one of the largest indigenous African banking interests.
They were a conglomerate that had interests in agriculture, and they had dairy
farms. We were just doing the advertising for a smart card [an ATM/debit card
that can do it’s own data processing] they were implementing. [Smart card use]
is starting to go global. They’re starting to say now that in the year 2002,
all welfare will be done by smart card chips which will have fingerprints,
addresses, and bank information. It’s pretty amazing.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>You shot <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Woman Chaser</i> mostly
during the weekends. What did you do during the rest of the week?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">RD:</b>
</i>I was putting on a suit and tie. I was a vice president at a PR firm. I was
handling everything from Wiskas cat food to a woman who was running for
Lieutenant Governor of California. It was a wide range of media relations. It
was mostly talking to the press and getting [my clients’] faces on TV.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I was very proud of the fact that I never let
on that I was working on a film, because in LA everybody talks about that and
says, “I’m getting my screenplay sold next week.” I was quiet about it
because I was confident it would take off.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>Many of the times the stories about how independent films like this one get
made are as interesting as the movies themselves, like some of the stories
I’ve read about Orson Welles in the Fifties, are really fascinating.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">RD:</b>
</i>You hear about these guys who can cajole and through the force of their
personality get the commitment and the money. I’ve got a lot of things to
learn, but I hope that I don’t have to go to the extremes that these great
talents went through. You hear about that, and you think, ‘Jeez, one of these
days, I’m just going to have to force my way into the door instead of being
invited.’ You have to do what you’ve got to do. It’s like originally in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Trial</i>, Welles used an abandoned hospital or subway, and it all
happened by happenstance. I hear you have to be open to all those happy
accidents.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i>DL: </i></b>I
had a terrible time trying to find Charles Willeford’s book of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Woman Chaser</i>. Where did you discover it?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i>RD: </i></b>I
went to a bookstore in Redondo Beach in the South Bay. It really wasn’t a
bookstore. It was called, “The Silver Door.” I was looking for used
bookstores, and I think I was looking through the Yellow Pages when I was
staying down at the beach. I saw this ad for mystery books. So I go into this
residential neighborhood, and there’s little house with a silver door. This
couple [who owned it] were set designers for Hollywood movies from the Forties
on. Their entire home, wall-to-wall, had mystery and crime novels in every room
of their house, out of print stuff, hardcover stuff, amazing stuff. It was a
gold mine for somebody looking for an undiscovered classic that you might want
to adapt. I went through it a couple of times and bought a bunch of books. And I
found this Willeford book, not the original, but the reprinted one that they
had. The funny thing was that it was great pleasure in getting a book called <i>The
Woman Chaser</i> and then reading it and seeing that there was nothing in it
that had anything to do with what you thought the book was about.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Many people have asked me, Why did you keep <i>The
Woman Chaser</i> title?” I think the pulp publishers knew what they were doing
when they changed the title [Willeford originally dubbed his book, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
Director</i>]. It’s unfortunate because Willeford was a brilliant guy, and as
an artist he should have had the right to have his title.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>DL: </i></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">You
have this morally repulsive character for your lead, but he’s endlessly
fascinating. Why do you think we can put up with a slimeball like Richard
Hudson?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">RD:</b>
</i>I don’t think he’s just a slimeball. What’s fascinating about Hudson
is the breadth of his exposure to the arts. This blue collar sociopath as this
erudite guy who knows <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Miraculous
Mandarin</i> by heart is this astounding character. I’d never seen that sort
of melding of a tough guy pulp immoral character who has a passion for the arts.
That’s the kind of person I want to hang around with and listen to.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>You wouldn’t want to buy a car from him, though.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">RD:</b>
</i>[laughing] No, you wouldn’t.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>:
</i>You’ve had to do a lot of the same negotiations that he does in the movie,
but you’re working with a better story than he was.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">RD:</b>
</i>I still believe that it’s a great film that he was pitching. My tastes run
to something absurd and dark, so I like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
Man who Got away</i>. If anybody could hand you any material in the world, I’d
take Willeford over almost anybody to try and make something interesting.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>Had you followed much of Willeford’s work?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">RD:</b>
</i>No. This whole project was a learning experience. I’d picked up a book of
his called <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Way We Die Now</i>. It was
one of his later books. A year and a half later in L.A, I pick [<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Woman Chaser</i>] up, and I didn’t put the two together. When I
thought back about how much I enjoyed this Hoke Mosely novel [<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Way We Die Now</i>], the humor got me. The Hoke Mosely book had more
heart because he’s a detective who’s very kind to his stepdaughters, but
there was that dark sexual humor. On the lines that stuck with me was, “I
jerked off gloomily in the shower.” I just thought that was a great line. I
don’t know why [bursts into laughter].</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>The supporting players in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Woman
Chaser</i> look nothing like the people you usually see in Hollywood movies.
Emily Newman, who plays Hudson’s secretary Laura, is very attractive, but she
doesn’t have that anorexic look that so many actresses have today.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">RD:</b>
</i>To me the ultimate failure in a lot of movies-- and a lot of people will
agree with me -- is that a lot of the actors look like they’re in the 90s or
2000. They’re just too good-looking; they’re just too coifed. Their bodies
are just too cut, and there are no flaws. That’s not the kind of look people
had in the past, and it’s not appropriate for this project.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">My formula for this when I was casting -- God
love the actors; they’re wonderful, attractive people as contemporary human
beings -- ,but I wanted Hudson to be this kind of normal looking guy surrounded
by these grotesques. I wanted to stack the deck and to make his bullying almost
more of a mismatch. I wanted to make Leo [Hudson’s stepfather] so unaggressive
and so unthreatening that when he ultimately betrays Richard, it’s very
absurd. It’s difficult to find somebody. A lot of people would come in, and
they’d be character actors playing [Leo] like a wacky intellectual. This
non-actor was a very down-to-earth sweet guy. He was a real person. He allowed
us to film him in unflattering ways. There were very few self-conscious actors
on the set, which was great.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>Warburton really carries this movie. He’s in almost every scene and often
seems to be supporting the other actors.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">RD:</b>
</i>That’s one way to look at it. He’s got a lot of stuff emotionally and in
the plot. It’s a great dominant role, and he did really well in it. I don’t
have any problem saying that he carries it at all.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>:
</i>How did you get him?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">RD:</b>
</i>Patrick was sent in very unassumingly and not with a lot of fanfare from our
casting agent. This is the real story, by the way. In those days I was trying to
go after a an actor who meant something in terms of money. I was going after
Jason Patric, whom I like as an actor, so I went to his manager who didn’t
help us at all. Eventually after a year and a half of trying to get Jason Patric,
so Patrick [Warburton] was the next level who would be a great person to have in
it. Patrick came in, and, as you can see in him, he has a little of John Wayne
in him at times. He came in and did this opening scene where he buys the car lot
and did it like John Wayne. I thought it was hysterical but totally wrong. He
came back four times to work with me on the role. I knew that we would never get
anyone closer with physique and comic delivery than this guy, but it did take us
a while to wipe away all the mannerisms and to break him down into a guy who
just cared about people.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>It never occurs to Richard Hudson that he’s ruining people’s lives right
and left.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">RD:</b>
</i>He doesn’t look at [people] as if he’s a bird of prey. He looks at it as
if he’s assisting people. He looks at what he does as the logical thing to do.
There’s no kind of moral universe he’ll have to find himself on one side or
the other.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>In some ways, the way you’ve been promoting this little film: you’ve
been a type of salesman.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i>RD: </i></b>[Laughs]
I see where this is going with this. Actually, this is the first trip [to Kansas
City] I’ve made all by myself. Usually we have the star and the producer along
for comic relief. I think it’s important when you don’t have money and the
distributors don’t have money for advertising you have to get out and meet
people and be part of the film’s release.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>Tim Burton insisted on shooting <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Ed
Wood</i> using black-and-white film stock, whereas you shot <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Woman Chaser</i> in color stock so that you could have both color
and black-and-white prints. Is there a difference?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">RD:</b>
</i>Black-and-white has been a big problem with us in distribution, and all I
can say is our cinematographers lit for black-and-white while shooting in color.
Some of our cinematographers did not light for black-and-white knowing we were
going to print in color. It was a real problem for me because I would say this
is going to be projected in black-and-white, and I know secretly they were
protecting it because they thought it was going to be shot in color. Until I got
my sea legs to say this is not the way it’s going to be, it was kind of a
fight to keep the black-and-white lighting.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i>DL: </i></b>The
black-and-white does help establish the period. What else did you do in that
regard?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">RD:</b>
</i>I had to find locations that I didn’t have to add anything or take
anything away from. We found a house a house that had lots of old furniture, so
that was pretty incredible. The secret was to spend a little money on locations
that had flavor of the period.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The <i>mise-en-scène</i> was very contained.
There were a lot of close-ups, which was appropriate for the period. I wanted
the faces to be the stars. When you’re in tight, you don’t have to see a lot
of the set. There are a lot of close-ups that ask what the world is around us,
and the black-and-white helps mask a lot of things, too. There things in color
that would make you think there’s a tinge of the twenty-firstcentury.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>DL: </i></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
movie appears to be a tricky sell, but you are making an impact with it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">RD:</b>
</i>I guess the numbers are a factor, and I was glad that people in LA did go
and see it. We ended our first week today [July 28], and we did $17,000 in one
week. That was <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">one</b> screen. We
didn’t have any money for advertising or anything like that. It was critical
[reviews] and word of mouth. That was a nice vindication because that’s in our
backyard. I don’t know if it’ll mean that somebody will swoop down and
decide to put money behind it for wider distribution.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I’d hate to look at this project as a calling
card because it’s not. It’s a Willeford book, and that’s what it’s
about, bringing it to the screen. I do have a few people who thought it was
funny and were at least interested in seeing if they could do something with
what I come up with next.</font></p>
