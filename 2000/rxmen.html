            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 14 July 2000</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The new <i>X-Men</i> film
            starts, during a time in the &quot;not too distant future&quot;,
            with a hirsute Washington senator (Bruce Davison) addressing a
            divisive issue, albeit not one having to do with race, gender, or
            sexual orientation, but -- genetic nonconformity. The human race, it
            seems, is mutating, whether it likes it or not, but that doesn't
            stop people from finding a way to turn it into an us-versus-them
            situation for personal gain. Quite easily, the film slips this plot
            device into use in a way which makes it seem perfectly believable.
            The mutants who are springing up in our midst have powers and
            abilities which are unusual, different, even dangerous. They must be
            registered. Do we want them teaching our children in our schools? Or
            in our homes?</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Along with the <i>Fantastic Four</i>,
            <i>X-Men</i> was one of the &quot;cool&quot; comics to read when I
            was growing up, because it not only suggested that the things which
            keep you from not &quot;fitting in&quot; with everyone else were not
            that bad after all, but could be entirely beneficial, indeed. Over
            the thirty years since its inception by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, <i>X-Men</i>
            took on the qualities of an ongoing epic story, and the film Bryan
            Singer has directed does its best at capturing most of the original
            material's most distinguishing qualities.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the film, an adolescent girl
            (Anna Paquin) discovers, in a terrifying way, the sudden onset of
            her special abilities -- an inability to have physical contact with
            anyone else. She becomes a runaway, and, in a snowy part of Canada,
            meets a reticent bar fighter who goes by the name of Wolverine (Hugh
            Jackman) -- he has the ability to produce lethal, badger-like claws,
            only longer and made of steel, from his fists when in a
            confrontation situation. Jackman, who's quite good, brings a
            guarded, feral quality to the role, but he also shows how, when he
            sees the cast of beautiful desolation in Paquin's face, the most
            best intentions in his character would come forth, gradually but
            irresolutely, and the two characters end up creating a special bond
            between themselves.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Paquin's character, who takes the
            name of Rogue, and Wolverine end up finding themselves in an
            institute run by Dr. Xavier (Patrick Stewart), who teaches mutants
            how to use their powers, instead of letting their powers use them,
            and fosters a deeply-felt belief in respecting humanity, despite the
            fact that mankind would very well like to get rid of them.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film turns out to have snap,
            smarts, wit, gentleness at times (a young man gives Rogue a flower,
            cupped in his hand, that he has fashioned, out of the air, from
            ice), style, and, most gratifyingly, action sequences that you can
            actually watch (they were staged by the superb Hong Kong action
            director Corey Yuen). I found the film to be entirely enjoyable
            (even with the, sigh, requisite earsplitting S.D.D.S. sound roaring
            forth at times), but it still only works up to a point. Some of the
            characters at Xavier's institute include Jean Grey (Famke Janssen),
            a physician who has developing extrasensory powers; Cyclops (James
            Marsden), whose eyes emit violent storms of laser bolts that are
            controlled with specially designed glasses; and Storm (Halle Berry)
            who has long snow-white hair and can call down the elements of the
            sky when she turns her eyes pearl-white.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">On the other side, there is Magneto
            (played by no less than Ian McKellen, who, with Davison, appeared in
            Singer's film <i>Apt Pupil</i>). He -- in an opening scene that's a
            rather audacious move for a summer blockbuster picture -- discovers
            his electromagnetic powers as a boy in Poland, when his parents are
            dragged away by the Nazis. Now, he figures the only way to protect
            himself and other mutants is by turning everyone into a mutant
            (&quot;'Homo sapiens' and their guns,&quot; he says desultorily,
            when faced with a passel of armed policemen), and one of his helpers
            is Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), who can assume any guise and
            then change back into her original form, a blue creature whose skin
            looks as dappled and textured as an oil painting by Van Gogh.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film tries to keep things
            centered by interjecting a believable, human touch in even the most
            outlandish situations, but it loses the center of its story. This
            would logically seem to be the experiences that Rogue and Wolverine
            have while they essentially try to find their identities and
            determine their fate. But there is also the contest between Dr.
            Xavier and Magneto, and Magneto's plan to unleash a cataclysm on New
            York City -- from the top of the Statue of Liberty, yet -- that,
            according to Xavier, would be worse than even Magneto knows (we've
            already seen some of Magneto's handiwork, when he changes a human
            into a mutant and causes the person to completely liquify).<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And the characters of Storm,
            Cyclops and Jean Grey are sleek, poised figures ready to leap into
            action when necessary. We just don't get to know them very well. The
            film doesn't break-through to a more dramatically resonant level,
            such as Tim Burton did with his two <i>Batman</i> films, or the
            magical scenes that unfolded between Christopher Reeve's Superman
            and Margot Kidder's Lois. In those films, the filmmakers did have
            fewer characters to contend with. But <i>X-Men</i> still has a
            personalized touch to it, something that has been crafted with a nod
            towards people and not just special effects, glib condescension, and
            rampant mayhem. Whether moviegoers who are mostly used to bing-bang-boom
            will accept or reject a humanistic superhero adventure remains to be
            seen.</font>
