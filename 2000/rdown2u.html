this: Freddie Prinze, Jr. is lip-synching Barry White's &quot;Can't Get Enough
of your Love,&quot; with spoon-as-mike in hand. In a reverse shot, Julia Stiles
smiles warmly, obviously touched by his efforts. Then, as Prinze dances over to
her, the camera shows them nestled up against each other in the frame, the
perfect couple, united in a deep soul love. </font><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
image is too precious and too silly, a conspicuous parody of nice-boy Prinze's
lack of fit with White's oozy sexuality that's not as funny as someone thought
it was. As the final image in <i>Down To You</i>, a pop romance with a tie-in
compiled CD, it underlines the film's half-baked white-breadness, its
simultaneous aspiration and failure to be different enough to surprise anyone.
On one level, it's the first feature for writer-director Kris Isacsson (whose
resume includes serving as assistant director for Barbra Streisand on <i>The
Mirror Has Two Faces</i>, which might explain his predilection for predictable
drama and quirky personalities passing for characters). Presumably, this guy
pitched an idea that sounded new enough to get funding from Open City Film and
distribution from Miramax, both companies with stated aims to support
&quot;independent visions.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">But
on another level, <i>Down to You</i> is also very Hollywood, a formula flick
designed as a Star Vehicle for pre-stars, performers who aren't yet surefire
enough for, say, a Julia-Roberts-and-Richard-Gere all-stops-out treatment, but
popular enough among a specific &quot;target demographic&quot; (teens-to-twentysomethings)
to warrant posters featuring their smiley embrace. That is, the movie is a
combined launching pad and proving ground for its stars-on-the-verge, each
coming to the table with recent hits, he with <i>I Know What You Did Last
Summer’</i>s and <i>She's All That</i>, and she with the adolescent version of
<i>The Taming of the Shrew</i>, <i>10 Things I Hate About You</i>. Playing a
couple destined to be together by the last reel, Stiles and Prinze are up
against it: there's not much tension in their fights or passion in their
make-ups, mostly because their conclusion is so foregone. Prinze plays Al, an
aspiring chef, in love with Imogen (Stiles), an art student. Lack of plot or
action is not a problem, however: the film is geared for girls, who -- according
to &quot;research&quot; -- are more concerned with stars. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Accordingly,
the film's promotional campaign has been more selective than wide, and it has
assumed a specific emphasis-on-the-couple shape, showing scenes with ostensible
girl-appeal (he's on TV proclaiming his love for her, she's responding with
appropriate shyness: the deal here seems to be that a public forum legitimates
and somehow enhances the declaration, as any number of lucrative dating and
confessional TV shows attest, and girls are the target viewers for such
declarations and confessions). The story covers the couple's ups and downs, much
like a standard high school romance, and features players who have previously
been in high school movies. But it's not a high school movie. It's actually set
just post-high school, which would appear to be its most prominent claim to
&quot;newness.&quot;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">There
are several interesting points to make about his claim, not the least being that
it's clearly part of a marketing-to-girls trend, seen mostly in magazines, like <i>Cosmo
Girl</i> and <i>Teen People</i>, which exploit the recent &quot;discovery&quot;
that girls are major consumers with much disposable income. The temporal marker
for this discovery tends to be <i>Titanic</i>, whose phenomenal success was
premised on girl viewers returning again and again to see Leo and Kate in a
grand romance. Since then, big- and small-screen teen romances have played to
this market in increasingly sophisticated ways, including appeals to girls'
desires to be (seen as) older. Thus, the established magazines reoriented for
girls. And thus, high school romances that feature characters no longer in high
school. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Down
to You</span></i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
overtly pitches to girls imagining themselves beyond high school. One of the
first signs of this appeal is that the story is sacrificed for the star
showcasing (appealing to kids usually means a focus on a minimally grabby plot, <i>The
Phantom Menace</i> notwithstanding; appealing to older viewers often depends on
celebrities for their own sake). Stiles and Prinze are asked to carry a lot of
weight in <i>Down To You</i>, which never seems to figure out how to make its
protagonists more interesting than their supporting characters. Their many
duties include appearing in every scene (one or the other or both of them), and
repeated talk-to-the-camera moments, apparently the most popular thing to do
these days to make your movie or TV series look self-aware. It's hard to
overstate how corny this device has become already, but Isacsson's movie is all
over it, as if it's the coolest thing going. Al (Prinze) is the first to face
the camera, while standing on line in a gourmet coffee shop, presumably to give
the impression that he's &quot;just like everyone else.&quot; He uses the public
place as an opportunity to comment on a cuddly couple, essentially saying,
&quot;Enjoy it while it lasts.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Al
knows, you see, because he's been there, and he proceeds to narrate his own
experience with first love gone bad. That this young person is looking back on
his life with some assurance and humor suggests that the movie is granting him
-- and by extension, his young audience -- some measure of respect. The twist
would seem to be that Al is actually not so self-aware and wise as he suggests,
and that his experience is generally ridiculous, if comedic. At one point when
he's feeling especially pressured by Imogen's moodiness (she's anxious about
being pregnant but he doesn't know that: it's a girl thing), Al dreams that he's
on an episode of <i>The Man Show</i> (&quot;Men Who Wear Skirts&quot;), whose
hosts and studio audience members ridicule him for being whipped. The show is
certainly familiar, as is the general anxiety that informs it: fed up with
trying to be &quot;sensitive&quot; and feeling disenfranchised (see, for
instance, Susan Faludi's <i>Stiffed</i> or David Fincher's <i>Fight Club</i>, in
addition to <i>The Man Show</i> and <i>The X Show</i>), guys just wanna drink
beer and get head, without flack from their women. Al's anxiety, however, is
more complex, because he actually is a sensitive guy, and feeling a mix of guilt
and resentment about it. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Al's
anxiety is compounded by the examples of his buddies, best friend Monk (Zak Orth),
a part-time porn star and aspiring Orson Welles, and college dorm-mate Eddie
(Shawn Hatosy), who pumps iron to build a chick-magnet bod. As if these
anti-examples weren't enough to make Al nervous, he also must deal with the
apparently good role models offered by his sensible, liberal-minded parents,
Judy (Lucie Arnaz) and Ray (Henry Winkler): she's a DJ (as Al puts it, &quot;She
spins&quot;) and he hosts a long-running TV cooking show. Surrounded by people
dispensing advice, Al hardly knows how to rebel or conform, both options seeming
equally uninteresting.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
film offers two slight torques on the high school romance formula, aside from
the fact that its protagonists are too old to be doing this. First -- and this
seems addressed at the girl audience members, who can &quot;relate&quot; --
Imogen, fearful of Al's infidelity throughout the film, cheats on him (how
ironic!), but feels horrible about it and so, the whole episode that only makes
his sensitive guyness more appealing. (Note: you don't see her family life or
friends, so no matter how much talking she does at the camera, it is his movie).
Second, and much less visibly, unless you're paying attention, Prinze is, as you
know from his personal history as Freddie Prinze Sr.'s son, a Latino actor
(actually, as he reminds interviewers, his father was half Puerto Rican and half
Hungarian, and his mother is English, Irish, and Native American). His movies
are so far positioning him as &quot;raceless&quot; (that is, white), and in this
respect, he's had no publicized problems with the stereotyping that so troubled
his father or that continues to trouble other young Latino actors like Jacob
Vargas and Jesse Borrego. Let's hope that Prinze's luck holds and more, that it
spills over enough for others seeking to get past homeboy typecasting. <o:p>
