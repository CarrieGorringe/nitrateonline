            review by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 10 November 2000</i></font>
            <p><font size="2"><font face="Verdana"><b>A friend of mine once
            observed than any flick that focuses on a cute kid is a shoo-in for
            a Best Foreign Film Oscar. With <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Burnt
            by the Sun </i>and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Kolya</i>
            as previous examples, it would seem as if Iranian writer-director
            Bahman Ghobadi had better start practicing acceptance speeches for <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">A
            Time for Drunken Horses</i>. With several powerful moments, it’s
            easy to see why the Iranians submitted the film and why Ghobadi tied
            for the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Camera d’Or</i> (the
            award for best new feature director) at this year’s Cannes Film
            Festival.</b></font></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thanks to the movie’s
            convincingly harsh atmosphere and unique subject matter (Ghobadi may
            be the only Kurdish filmmaker), one can forgive Ghobadi if <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">A
            Time for Drunken Horses</i> unfolds awkwardly. Many of the
            transitions are abrupt and crammed together by voiceover. Much of
            the patchwork quality of the film can be attributed to the arduous
            nature of its two-year making. When some of the sequences were
            deemed unsatisfactory, Ghobadi had to pay for its completion himself
            by selling his possessions and borrowing money from friends and
            relatives. He also worked in inhospitable terrain with a cast
            composed entirely of amateurs of varying talent.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">More abundant resources may have
            helped Ghobadi, but these circumstances also give <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">A
            Time for Drunken Horses</i> an urgency that it might not have had
            otherwise. Loosely drawn from Ghobadi’s experiences growing up in
            the Kurdish sections of Iran, the movie follows a group of siblings
            who have had the burden of raising themselves. Their mother is dead,
            and their father, who makes his living smuggling goods from Iran to
            Iraq, is rarely home. Ayoub (Ayoub Ahmadi) tries to raise money by
            wrapping packages and participating in confidence schemes that
            sometimes don’t pay. When he and other children are recruited to
            smuggle goods from Iraq to Iran in their clothing, they are busted
            before they can get paid. Ayoub and the rest of his family also have
            to take care of his sickly brother Madi (Mehdi Ekhtiar-Dini). The
            youngster cannot walk, and his illness has stunted his growth. It
            will also kill him if he doesn’t receive expensive surgery in
            Iraq, and the operation may do little good.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Their situation deteriorates when
            their father dies. Their uncle, who has eight children of his own,
            can only provide limited support. Desperate to get Madi the
            operation, Ayoub follows in his father’s footsteps and takes up
            smuggling. The journey across the mountains is so dangerous that
            even the pack animals are wary. In fact, to make the mules compliant
            enough to endure the trip, the smugglers have to pour alcohol into
            their drinking water. Watching two poor beasts being "fortified" is
            a chilly sight. In addition, the smuggling runs are prone to
            ambushes, and clients sometimes "forget" to pay. Ghobadi’s ambush
            scenes are hair-raising, particularly in one scene where the mules
            are too drunk to move. His documentary-like approach creates the
            vivid depiction of the hardships that people in Kurdish villages
            face. He also avoids wallowing in gloom. One of the more ironic
            sequences involves a reading lesson, where the children hear a story
            involving an airplane. In a village with few modern amenities, the
            tale seems as remote and fantastical as a fairy tale.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With his current accolades, one
            imagines that Ghobadi’s next films will be easier to make. Still,
            one hopes that he doesn’t lose sight of his roots. In his
            unblinking depiction of the world he grew up in, Ghobadi has found
            stories that are worth telling and sharing with the rest of the
            planet.</font>
