            men in dresses tend to be objects of comedy in mainstream media,
            broadly drawn characters who elicit laughter more than desire.
            Think: Flip Wilson's Geraldine, Martin Lawrence's Big Momma, Eddie
            Murphy's bevy of female Klumps, even Wesley Snipes in <i>To Wong Fu,
            Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar</i>. They're all flamboyant and
            broadly drawn, and they're also definitively unthreatening, mainly
            because they're so upfront about being men in drag. Not gay men, not
            femmey men, but men who wear dresses to make statements about
            themselves: they're fearless actors, good actors, the mere act of
            putting on a dress connotes having <i>cojones</i>. The glorious
            RuPaul is the exception who proves the rule -- he became mainstream
            as a drag queen. The breakthrough embodied by RuPaul was that he was
            an overtly gay man who was, suddenly, everywhere -- battling Milton
            Berle on MTV, promoting MAC cosmetics, hosting his own TV talk show,
            and appearing in movies like <i>The Brady Bunch Movie</i> or <i>Crooklyn</i>.
            Unfortunately, some years after RuPaul's grand appearance,
            mainstream media and audiences haven't quite been able to embrace
            the possibility that black male celebrities might actually be okay
            with their &quot;feminine&quot; sides, that they might flaunt them
            or enjoy them openly. The fact that Dennis Rodman is so often
            dismissed as a &quot;freak&quot; suggests that mixing gender codes
            is still a dicey business. Unless you're playing a very het cop
            undercover, wearing a dress isn't exactly the most immediate ticket
            to longstanding stardom for a black man. </b><o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ving
            Rhames in a dress is another story. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            Robert Townsend's <i>Holiday Heart</i>, Rhames plays a drag
            performer named Holiday Heart. As the film opens, Holiday is singing
            and playing the organ in church and in grand, self-loving style.
            Holiday's long-haired head tilts back as his big-boomy voice
            proclaims his love for the Lord in no uncertain terms. Amen, amen.
            Immediately, the film cuts to another Holiday Heart performance,
            this time in a club called the Penthouse: here comes Holiday in full
            Diana Ross regalia, a large, well-muscled black man backed by two
            oohing-and-aahing singers and wearing a gorgeous sequined gown,
            lip-synching with all his considerable heart. It appears that
            there's nothing this guy doesn't do full-on. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Holiday
            has deep history, too, conveyed in several minutes worth of
            flashbacks. Here you learn that his lover was a closeted policeman
            who was killed, and that Holiday's appearance at the funeral service
            made the other cops mightily uncomfortable. (So much for the
            &quot;undercover&quot; cop as the only possible route to mainstream
            drag.) All this is only the beginning of Holiday's incursion into
            mainstream masculinity. That it's Ving Rhames who embodies this
            incursion is noteworthy, since he's not known as a comedian (like
            Wilson or Murphy) or as a particularly beautiful movie star (like
            Snipes). He's a big, rough-looking guy, famous for playing Don King
            and Tom Cruise's <i>Mission Impossible</i> sidekick (I like to
            remember his remarkable, movie-stopping performance as Cinque in
            Paul Shrader's <i>Patty Hearst</i>). True, no one will ever mistake
            Ving Rhames for a woman, but there's something else going on in his
            portrayal of Holiday, something that's by turns daring and awkward,
            and precisely because of this unusual range and risk-taking, expands
            the possibilities of gendering as a social and media process. Unlike
            most mainstream male stars who put on dresses, Rhames takes Holiday
            seriously, and asks you to do the same. That isn't to say that
            Holiday doesn't appear in some funny situations or cut loose with
            occasional jokes or outrageous bitchiness. It is to say that Holiday
            is not a victim. Holiday is a rich, warm, and wholly appealing
            character, equally feminine and masculine and quite unapologetic
            about it. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Holiday's
            adventures begin when he meets a young girl in trouble, Niki (Jessika
            Quynn Reynolds), a child wise beyond her years, mostly because her
            mother, Wanda (Alfre Woodard) is a crack addict. Niki spots Holiday
            on the street one Halloween (which means Holiday is in a sparkly
            gown and foofy high heels), takes him by the hand, and leads him to
            the apartment where Wanda is in the middle of a beating by her big
            meanie junkie boyfriend. Holiday knows what to do -- abandoning his
            feminine demeanor and high-pitched voice, he roars at Bad Boyfriend
            to back off. When the villain comes at him anyway, Holiday whips out
            a knife: &quot;Come on man! Trick or treat!&quot; The crowd that has
            gathered in the hallway is duly impressed, as is Bad Boyfriend, who
            does indeed back off. It's clear that Holiday is not, as Bad
            Boyfriend calls him, &quot;stupid ass faggot.&quot; Holiday is a
            man, however unconventional his outfits and mannerisms. He's a man
            who can take care of himself and protect women and children from
            bullies.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            film goes on to make the case that Holiday is a good man, fully
            capable of adopting and looking after a family. He provides Niki and
            Wanda with a free apartment in one of the buildings he owns, an
            apartment that happens to be across the hallway from his own, so
            that they can spend a lot of increasingly intimate time together
            (Holiday is a good landlord too -- he fixes the toilets himself). At
            first, both Niki and Wanda are skeptical, but soon the girl happily
            finds out that Holiday has tastes she can understand (&quot;You like
            rap, like I do!&quot; she exults), wears pants on occasion, and
            cooks great meals. Her mother is a little harder to convince,
            harboring some understandable distrust of men in general and some
            expected ignorance concerning gay men in particular. &quot;Just so
            you know,&quot; she spits, &quot;I don't do fags!&quot; But Holiday
            has a quick and wicked comeback: &quot;And I don't do no-good evil
            bitches who sleep all day instead of taking care of their
            children!&quot; Wanda is taken aback. In this moment, when Woodard's
            extraordinary face reveals Wanda's rapid reconsideration of just
            about everything she's assumed about gender roles and social
            conformity, <i>Holiday Heart</i> makes its most cogent point, that
            indeed, Holiday is a good man whose sexuality has nothing to do with
            his capacity for boundless, unconditional love. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            being a movie with about an hour more to run, you know that
            Holiday's capacity will be tested. Crisis must come, even after the
            threesome have formed something of a happy home: Wanda is a poet who
            is working on a book, while Holiday continues to perform at the
            Penthouse and take in rents. Wanda, however, just can't stay quite
            straight. Soon she brings home a smooth-talking, smartly-dressed
            drug dealer, Silas (Mykelti Williamson), the &quot;successful&quot;
            version of her former man, mainly because Silas does not do the
            drugs that he sells. Because this is a movie with a lesson to teach
            -- more than a little movie-of-the-weekish in its sentiment and
            structure -- <i>Holiday Heart</i> makes everyone suffer some more
            before a stable family unit emerges. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">On
            the upside, this unit includes the two men, each redefining what it
            means to be a man in his own way. Sadly, as ambitious and laudable
            as this point is, <i>Holiday Heart</i> falls back on the tired
            stereotype of the bad, weak-willed, crack-addicted, out-of-control
            mother to make it. There is another movie in this one, waiting to
            get out. And at the center of that movie is Rhames' performance --
            solid as always, but also inventive, both gaudy and nuanced. His
            Holiday holds the film together, even during its uninspired and
            obvious moments. </font><o:p>
