            would be hard to come up with a couple who seem like a better fit
            than Zora Banks (Sanaa Lathan) and Franklin Swift (Wesley Snipes).
            Both are beautiful and gifted, ambitious and passionate. She's an
            aspiring and talented singer-songwriter, he's an accomplished, if
            yet unlicensed, woodworker. They meet cute as she's moving into a
            Brooklyn brownstone apartment where he's just laid down the gorgeous
            hardwood floor. He helps her move her furniture and boxes of CDs and
            books inside, they share conversation and flirtatious glances. You
            can almost feel the erotic tension. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So
            begins <i>Disappearing Acts</i>, a movie that -- you can't help but
            know if you're reasonably conscious -- is based on a novel by Terry
            McMillan. This means, of course, that the relationship is both fated
            to be and fated to undergo many trials and tribulations: McMillan's
            work explores the ways that painfully imperfect and dizzingly
            wonderful relationships arise between people who appear to fit. Like
            many McMillan heroines, Zora (named after Zora Neale Hurston, she
            graciously informs us almost as soon as we meet her) is a fiercely
            determined and resolutely independent survivor, hoping to find a man
            who will meet her high standards but not especially convinced that
            she will. Franklin, like many McMillan heroes, is a good-hearted man
            who's been beaten down by any number of systems set against him.
            When they meet, Zora is teaching music at an elementary school while
            she puts together enough material to make her own record. Franklin
            has found his calling -- renovating brownstones -- but at the moment
            is still scraping by. He has yet to get his GED so that he can take
            the test to become a licensed contractor, and so he has settled for
            working on non-union crews from which he can be dropped without
            notice (the film's primary embodiment of this problem is a guy named
            -- rather unimaginatively -- Vinney, played by the talented but
            typecast Michael Imperioli). Zora and Franklin share a love for
            Chinese food, Scrabble, and music. In other words, it's ordained in
            Terry McMillan's universe that they get together, which they do,
            almost immediately. They spend the next two hours trying to stay
            together. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">While
            both Zora and Franklin agree that art and integrity are more
            important than money (he informs her, &quot;If you're looking for a
            brother with a fat bank account, I ain't the one&quot;), they also
            must contend with basic pressures -- paying rent, for instance. The
            film's episodic structure lays out a series of these pressures
            alongside the characters' unspoken but quite evident fears, in terms
            both metaphorical and literal. For one instance, Franklin's parents
            (CCH Pounder and John Amos, whose appearances are far too fleeting
            here), provide a momentary point of tension, when Franklin and Zora
            go to visit and they judge their son harshly. Zora's attempts to
            smooth over the rough spot only aggravate a longstanding familial
            ugliness that the movie does not explore further. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            the most obvious example of the film's stiltedness comes one night
            when Franklin is awakened by Zora having an epileptic fit: though
            she has neglected to tell him about her condition, he's quite able
            to deal with it. While the scene showing the seizure is wrenching,
            the aftermath is puzzlingly abrupt. When Zora wakes in the morning,
            looking unusually bedraggled, Franklin asks her why she didn't tell
            him and she admits that she's afraid he would have left her if she
            had. He rightly points out that he's still there with her, and she
            seems comforted by that fact. From there, the film never refers to
            her epilepsy again -- even though she goes on to become pregnant,
            give birth, and cope with being a working mother -- making it the
            most flagrant of the film's telegraphic devices, but not the only
            one. This isn't to say that the movie must deal with the condition
            &quot;disease of the week&quot;-style, by making it a tragic focus.
            Rather, its metaphorical function -- to demonstrate that the
            seemingly unstoppable Zora has a &quot;weakness&quot; -- is made
            awkward by its lack of integration into the rest of the plot. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            plot comes to revolve around the couple's troubles with money -- it
            becomes an emblem and manifestation of Zora and Franklin's mutual
            and separate fears. She finds a producer, Reg Baptiste (Kamaal
            Fareed, a.k.a. Q-Tip), who is willing to cut a demo with her, for a
            minimal fee if she promises she will always be available when he can
            fit her in to his schedule, her day job (and eventual pregnancy)
            notwithstanding -- as soon as she makes it, you know it's an unkeep-able
            promise. Franklin's pitfalls are more immediate: it turns out that
            he has two sons who live with their mother, to whom he sends
            informal child support -- in other words, he's no deadbeat, but he
            is always short of cash. Also wanting to meet the relatively higher
            living standards he sees embodied by Zora, poor Franklin is
            depressed and burdened by long-term expectations, which makes it
            hard for him to make healthy decisions. When he's upset, he heads to
            the bar where he commiserates with his buddy Jimmy (the underused
            Clark Johnson, who played Meldrick on <i>Homicide: Life on the
            Streets</i>); in times of emotional need, she turns to her girls
            Portia (Regina Hall) and Claudette (Lisa Arrindell Anderson), both
            of whom live upscale lives that only underline the diurnal
            difficulties of Zora and Franklin's scraping by. And oh yes,
            Franklin's drinking becomes an issue, as his anger and frustration
            become more physical when he's had too much. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            plot, however unsurprising, provides a means for Lathan and Snipes
            to show what they can do. The characters have more than enough
            ordeals to endure, together and apart, which makes the film
            something of a melodramatic roller-coaster. Still, it is elegantly
            directed by Gina Prince Blythewood, with whom Lathan worked on <i>Love
            &amp; Basketball</i>, and effectively scored by Me'Shell NdegeOcello,
            and comes with a made-to-sell compiled soundtrack, with songs by
            Angie Stone, Talib Kweli, Melky Sedeck, and Chaka Khan. And the
            stars are working such subtle nerves, so well, it's as if they're in
            a more carefully structured film -- if the paths of Franklin and
            Zora are preordained, the pleasures Snipes and Lathan afford viewers
            are plentiful. <o:p>
