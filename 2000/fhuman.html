<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Cynthia
Fuchs: </span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I
have to say straight off that I was happy to see a film about rave kids that
didn't demonize them. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Justin
Kerrigan: </span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Well,
that's why we couldn't get any financial investment in Britain at all, because
it wasn't moralistic about the use of recreational drugs, no one dies at the
end. What I was trying to do was represent an authentic weekend, based on
personal experience. And in all my years of clubbing and partying with my
friends, we've never seen anyone die, d'you know what I mean? It would have been
a complete sell-out to put that in, but if we did, we would definitely have got
financial investment. But like, this culture's been going for twelve years now
in Britain, and it's the first youth culture in history ever to be legislated
through the courts. Basically in Britain now, it's illegal for more than ten
people to dance to a repetitive beat. But when they shut the raves down [in late
1980s], it went mainstream, and now it's a worldwide phenomenon and it continues
to grow, and it doesn't look like there's anything coming up behind it to take
over. It brings people together from all different classes, races, and
sexualities; there's never any violence, I've never seen anyone fight. It's a
feeling of together. It's about having fun. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
irony is that nobody gave us any money, and then three years later when the film
did come out, when we got independent investors from outside Britain, it wasn't
controversial. Even right-wing tabloids, which had led the anti-rave and anti-x
campaigns, they were embracing and supporting [the film]. Basically they came to
realize that ecstasy and raves are not a threat to society, as they'd have you
believe in years previous. And that's a general consensus across the [British]
media, that x should be downgraded, so it's not in the class of crack and
cocaine, which everyone knows is ridiculous. There are quotes in newspapers from
policemen saying, &quot;I want to see marijuana decriminalized.&quot; Simply,
the war on drugs just doesn't work. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">CF:
</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
U.S. is behind the curve on this; the drug war persists, especially in the
press.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">JK:
</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It
reminds me, what I've seen in the press here and as I'm going around and
checking the clubs in each city I go to, of around 1993 in Britain, when it was
still underground but getting more popular. And the press was starting to give
it a bad name: they called it &quot;Killer E&quot; and everything. And since
then, like anything else, when you try to control it, it just gets bigger and
bigger, and blows up in your face. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">CF:
</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">And
there's a cultural absorption mechanism, where you get the rave-lite dance
videos on MTV, sometimes lumped in with &quot;alternative.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">JK:
</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Absolutely,
man. I mean, in Britain, every other advert on tv tries to favor a product with
dance music and &quot;hedonistic youth life,&quot; catering to this market and
yet, it's still supposedly illegal. It's been mainstreamed, <i>because</i> you
can't control it. It's not a bad thing, because there's never any violence.
People feel a lot safer at a club where everyone's on ecstasy as opposed to one
where everyone's on alcohol. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">CF:
</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Can
you talk more about the mixed populations at clubs? In the U.S., still, the
scene is still predominantly white and costs money. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">JK:
</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">That's
kind of how it started in Britain, predominantly white kids and it was a gay
scene as well. And it grew and grew, and gathered together people from all walks
of life. That's why it's a youth phenomenon. It's not one class system: you get
people there on the dole, you get super-rich kids, the in-betweens, you get
black kids, Indian kids, Chinese, right across the board, there's no boundaries.
I guess it's like the old hippie shit, it's about love: it's a great thing. <o:p>

</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">So,
the film is about people figuring out how to connect? <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">JK:
</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It's
all about me and my friends. Jip and Lulu, for instance, that's me and my
girlfriend. Every generation goes through the same thing, the paranoias of
boyfriend-girlfriend relationships, the social insecurities, the frustrations
and anxieties that build up Monday through Friday, working at McJobs, not
knowing what you want to do with your life. There's stress everywhere, whether
it's related to family or work or whatever. Everyone can relate to the Lost
Weekend, no matter what drug they use, ecstasy or alcohol or whatever their cup
of tea. Everyone can relate to saying, &quot;Oh f*ck it, I'm going out with my
best friends, my chosen family, and I'm going to have a scream.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">CF:
</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">In
another movie, Jip's mother might have had her story &quot;resolved&quot; in a
morally upright way. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">JK:
</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
only story that's actually resolved is Jip's sexual paranoia. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">CF:
</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">And
clearly that's the most important problem to resolve! <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">JK:
</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Yeah!
But if I had been tying everything else up, it wouldn't be a real weekend. It
doesn't build to a climax -<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>you
know what I mean? Friday night isn't the same as Sunday afternoon. So that was
the intention. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">CF:
</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Many
youth movies present parents as abusive, absent, or skeezy, but she seems pretty
complex, and Jip and his mother have a mutually supportive relationship. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">JK:
</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I
based it on real people. She's a prostitute, but I wanted to get over the clichés,
man. People are people, part of the fabric of society, I just wanted to break
the stereotype a bit, to show how it is, rather than a prostitute who gets
killed or a person on ecstasy who thinks he's god and jumps out the window.
That's bullshit. It builds drama in the film, but that wasn't the point. They
all have drama, but it's inside them, it's their insecurity. I wanted to go
inside their heads, that's where the real story is. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">CF:
</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Your
movie takes several points of view: how did you think about structuring that? <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">JK:
</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">I
didn't want to make a film about one person, because the whole angle of the
culture brings people together, it's about friendship and human chemistry. I
wanted to show everyone's angle, all their frustrations, all their anxieties, so
we get kind of a circle of friends, that's always the best life. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">CF:
</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">What
kinds of shifts in tastes in music have you seen in your years in the scene? <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">JK:
</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
music keeps on innovating. I tried to represent in the film all the different
genres of dance music which are dominant in Britain. At the same time, the music
had to be there to embrace the scene and tell the story, and the characters are
surrounded by music everywhere. In Britain you get genres, like house, techno,
drum'n'base, and they all break down into separate genres within themselves,
they keep on remixing it and remixing it. There's nearly every genre of music
being remixed into nearly every genre of dance music.</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">CF:
</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">What
do you make of critics who say that dance music isn't &quot;real music&quot;
because it's mostly mixed instead of created on &quot;real instruments&quot;?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">JK:
</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Well,
I think they're fearing they're going to be taken over. In Britain, the dj has
replaced the rock star. People travel from all around to check out this dj, like
Carl Cox or Fatboy Slim. And all of this music comes out of like, bedroom djs,
literally kids playing around with their computers in their bedrooms. You don't
have to be able to sing or hit a chord to make a fresh tune. That's the reason
it's massive, because you can have huge fat djs who're sex gods, and kids who
are fourteen and people in the clubs who are in their fifties. I used to go
clubbing with my old man. It's a feeling of unity, of coming together. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">CF:
</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Have
you found differences between U.S. audience responses to the film and those back
home? <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">JK:
</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Well,
this is the thing, we weren't expecting so many people to relate directly to
characters in the film. Even people who've never been a part of the culture or
who've never taken ecstasy, thirty-, forty-, sixty-year old people, have said to
me, I know Jip, or I'm like Koop. I never expected that it would cross over. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">CF:
</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Did
you work with the cast on the script? <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">JK:
</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It
was mostly scripted, but I always like to push an actor to improvise. If I see
him like really getting into something, we'll talk about it, and because the
actors all had experience in this scene, we could talk about it together, about
similar situations, and if there was anything that was interesting or funny,
we'd throw it in.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">CF:
</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">You
seem to have a specific confidence as a filmmaker, did this evolve over time,
and you always knew what you wanted at any given time? <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">JK:</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
The whole thing's ridiculous, mate. Basically all I could do was paint and draw
in school. I was all set to do a fine arts degree, and I started fooling around
with a roommate's secondhand video camera, and got hooked immediately. So I
started making dodgy installations and pretentious films, and I was all set to
go for it. It was like a new direction in my life. So I applied to film schools
all around Britain and got rejected everywhere, so I took a series of McJobs,
flipping burgers and selling jeans, and then bought a secondhand camera, quit my
job, and decided to write from my experience. Based on that film, I got into
film school, which was helpful, in the sense that they had equipment and
facilities I could use. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">CF:</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
It's also unusual that a movie showing in multiplexes has been made by someone
in the culture, rather than being made from a distance, packaged for mass
consumption. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">JK:
</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Right,
where you get older generations trying to be young and all that. And absolutely,
it was a prerequisite that all the actors had done the drugs and the extras
there really are on ecstasy. And the smaller characters are off the street and
really playing themselves, and they'd all done the drugs and the scene, so we
could all talk the same language. It's never been represented before in Britain.
And so many people were going to be watching for that authenticity. So it was
important that we get it right. <o:p>
