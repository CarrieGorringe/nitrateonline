was the kind of film that surprised most everyone when it was a hit, even the
folks who made it. Simply plotted and closely focused on the adventures of two
South Central homeboys, the film boosted several rising stars into stratospheric
dimensions, including director F. Gary Gray (a former music video director who
went on to make <i>Set It Off</i> and <i>The Negotiator</i>) and bendy-bodied
comedian Chris Tucker, as the impeccably named Smokey. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Friday</span></i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
worked in part because its ambitions were limited, like its budget, but its
spirit was generous: Smokey and Craig (played by producer/co-writer Ice Cube)
spent their day seeking not-quite-legal recreation as well as respite from randy
female neighbors, Craig's clueless dog-catcher dad Willy (John Witherspoon), and
a big old bully named Debo (Tiny Lister). So what if some of the adventures were
only half-funny or based in stereotypes and doo-doo jokes? The players were
charismatic and the comedy was premised on actual appreciation (rather than
disdain) for 'hood and head life. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
film did well in theaters, then exploded on video, and, of course, the
soundtrack still sells well. All of which means that a follow-up was inevitable.
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Arriving
in theaters five years later, <i>Next Friday</i> is the kind of sequel that will
do well enough, profiting its makers and delivering to fan expectations. Like
all sequels, it's designed to make money. It's also missing some of the
original's key elements:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>for
instance, novelty, low expectations, and crucially, Smokey (who is, we hear in a
brief voice-over from Craig, in &quot;rehab&quot;). The intentional changes
appear to be attempts at expansion: where the first film took place on one block
and involved bicycles, the second moves to the suburbs and includes some very
nice rides. And where the first had two protagonists, the second -- according to
director Steve Carr (also a video director, having made very smart clips for
Jay-Z's &quot;Hard Knock Life&quot; and &quot;Can I Get A&quot;) -- &quot;has
ten fully developed characters.&quot; Some of these are returning (Craig, Debo,
and Craig's father Willy) and some newly invented, like Craig's cousin Day-Day
(Mike Epps, a stand-up comedian in his feature film debut, clearly hoping to
emulate Tucker's wild success) and uncle Elroy (Don Curry), none seeming
particularly well developed. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">But
what constitutes &quot;developed&quot; is a vexed issue here, partly irrelevant
and partly determined by context. The film is built to sell, not expand, ideas,
with a decent &quot;inspired by&quot; soundtrack cd featuring music by Terence
Blanchard and songs by Ice Cube, Wyclef, Aaliyah, and the Wu-Tang Clan. Its
humor is broad and easy, with fucked-up situations (physical comedy initiated by
inept tortures and large guns waving), curious cultural critiques (the most
prominent sign of Elroy's new leisure-class status is his SM-lite gear), and
overt references to <i>The Jeffersons</i>, the sitcom that made the black
middle-class threat to white status quo visible, if somewhat contained by
George's comic antics. But you can see something resembling development in the
new film's general boldness: its swipes at propriety are just as likely to
target 'burban complacency as all that arrogant-seeming 'hood etiquette viewers
will recognize from the movies, if not experience. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Mostly,
though, <i>Next Friday</i> wants to mess with you. The good news is that its
story centers on Craig. True, this character looks really thin on paper: Craig
eats cereal, tries to avoid his dad's haranguing, and generally hangs around
(actually, not so unlike the character Seinfeld translated into much money and
fame). But Craig's appeal is not in what he does, but in who he is, that is, the
immensely charismatic Ice Cube: he only need show up to make any scene seem
fine. In large part this is a function of his reputation. At only 31 years old,
the former O'Shea Jackson and ex-NWA member has become something of a hiphop
icon, with solo albums (<i>AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted</i>, <i>The Predator</i>, <i>Lethal
Injection</i>), production and writing credits, and multiple collabos under his
belt. He's also got an impressive movie resume, turning in impressive
performances in John Singleton's <i>Boyz N the Hood</i> and <i>Higher Learning</i>,
as well as <i>The Glass Shield</i>, <i>Trespass</i>, and <i>Anaconda</i>, and
made a fine directorial debut with <i>Players Club</i> (1998). <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As
an actor, Cube's not hard like, say, Ice T, or showy like Master P. And he's
never silly or preening like Will Smith. No. Cube has what you might call a slow
affect. He smiles kind of crafty, hardly ever seems alarmed. He routinely looks
sensible amid chaos. (And why not? He's seen everything.) When someone acts out
near him, Cube turns his head just so, more like he's insinuating a double take
than actually delivering one. That he still passes as a
sneakers-and-sports-jersey-wearing hood kid may speak to his decent genes and/or
a healthy lifestyle. But it also underlines his ability to keep his finger on
various cultural pulses: he pays attention to what's interesting his audience --
players and gunplay, sexism and meanness -- and uses his tremendous popularity
to educate as he entertains. To that end, these days he's making cds with the
Westside Connection, and running Lynch Mob Records with his wife Kimberly. His
interviews tend to be thoughtful and informative. Even if you know nothing about
gangsta rap or hiphop culture, you can respect Ice Cube. The man has class. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">In
<i>Next Friday</i>, he reprises Craig's combination of naivete, street smarts,
and good intentions, in a plot set-up that's straight out of old Fresh Prince,
that is, ghetto boy out of water. The deal is this: Debo escapes from prison and
threatens revenge, so Willy sends young Craig to stay out in the burbs with
erstwhile lottery-winners Elroy and Day-Day (it's worth noting that, as Day-Day,
Epps turns in a winning performance: a scene in which he changes his cool guy's
&quot;outfit&quot; while Craig watches is a well-choreographed set of actions
and reactions). <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
fundamental joke in this set-up, of course, is that Willy's assumption that
wealthy folks have a corner on safety and respectability, is hopelessly
uninformed. And it's up to the ever-resilient Craig to come to the aid of his
hapless relatives: when he learns that they have mismanaged their winnings to
the point that the house is about to be repossessed, he connives to secure some
quick cash. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Craig's
only just been deposited on his relatives' doorstep, when he sees Day-Day's
ex-girlfriend D'Wana (Tamala Jones), pregnant and pissed off, standing in the
driveway and digging her key into Day-Day's shiny new car. Amazed at her wrath
and nerve (as well as her partner, another angry black woman played by Lady of
Rage), Craig also commiserates with his cuz, until suddenly, his attention is
captured by a fine Latina neighbor, Karla (Lisa Rodriguez). Though he's warned
that in the burbs, as elsewhere, races don't mix, Craig beelines for Miss Thang,
pretending to ignore the sure trouble posed by her three brothers, Joker (Jacob
Vargas, sending up the Latino &quot;thug&quot; he's been stuck playing since
Allison Anders' excellent <i>La Vida Loca</i>, even though he showed promising
range in that film and in the same director's <i>Gas Food Lodging</i>), Little
Joker, and Baby Joker. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It's
only a matter of time before hijinks commence: Willy falls in dog shit and eats
a fart-inducing burrito, Elroy's bosomy girlfriend Sugar greets Craig by sliding
her tongue along his neck, D'Wana stalks Day-Day, Day-Day and his boy Roach
(Justin Pierce), a fellow worker and doper at the local cd store (owned by a
pink Cadillac-driving mack-daddy played with jheri-curled vivacity by Sticky
Fingaz). Even though the original film &quot;crossed over&quot; big time, you
get the feeling that Fine Line wanted insurance for the sequel, hence the white
boy doper for comic and other reliefs. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">This
concern with crossing over is important in considering how and why <i>Next
Friday</i> was made. No doubt, it isn't and was never intended to be a great or
even a very good movie. But its all-rightness probably won't afford it the same
scale of success won by the equally all-right <o:p>
</o:p>
</span><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Austin
Powers 2</span></i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
or <i>Kingpin</i> (which was essentially the Farrelly brothers' sequel to their <i>Dumb
and Dumber</i>). The differences between these cases have to do with target
audiences and, importantly, critical responses. Even when critics sniffed about <i>Something
About Mary</i>'s retarded jokes (as well as its jokes about and at the expense
of handicapped people) or <i>AP2</i>'s fatman, midget, and sloppy poop jokes, a
lot of them applauded the films' rollicking good natures, looking the other way
on some &quot;issues&quot; and just giving up on others, in ways that likely
won't be repeated for <i>Next Friday</i>. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">This
isn't to compare the qualities of these films: surely there are differences in
writing, budgeting, and acting among them, and really, none of them are to <i>Next
Friday</i>'s detriment. It is to note, however, that definitions of humor are
perpetually troubled -- and specifically classed and raced -- no matter how much
money crosses over. <o:p>
