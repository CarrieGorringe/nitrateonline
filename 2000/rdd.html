            review by <a href="../joe.html" target="_top">Joe Barlow</a>, 15 December 2000</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Courtney Solomon’s<i> Dungeons
            &amp; Dragons</i> is a film that seems like it was specifically
            designed to annoy its viewers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Although supposedly based on TSR’s phenomenally popular
            role-playing game, this cinematic adaptation contains almost nothing
            in the way of dungeon crawls and hack-and-slash -- the very aspects
            that gamers no doubt expect to see in a movie bearing this name.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Instead, Solomon and his screenwriters allow the story to
            collapse into dreary political maneuvers and petty bickering.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>It bears about as much resemblance to the <i>Dungeons &amp;
            Dragons </i>game<i> </i>as it does to, say, the movie <i>Willow.</i></b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Political wars have become the
            dominant fad in contemporary sci-fi/fantasy stories (witness <i>Star
            Trek: Deep Space Nine, Star Wars: The Phantom Menace, </i>and <i>Babylon
            Five)</i>, and Solomon uses his debut film less as a means to
            entertain than to preach a dual message of racial tolerance and
            environmental awareness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
            <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons, </i>the plot of which exists only in the
            same vague sort of way that America currently has a president, we
            learn of a class struggle in the kingdom of Izmer. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The
            land, which has been segregated since time out of mind into mages
            (magic users) and commoners (everyone else), is starting to feel the
            effects of this segregation, with members on both sides arguing for
            -- and against -- reunification.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But not everyone supports this
            plan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The evil overlord
            Profion (Jeremy Irons) -- who, by the way, is so evil that he keeps
            a large, pixelized CGI dragon as a pet -- fears that a life of
            harmony will somehow jeopardize his power (exactly why is never made
            clear).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As a result,
            Profion and his henchmen embark on a quest for the Dragon’s Eye, a
            magic scepter that grants its holder power over all the red dragons
            in the kingdom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It’s
            a weapon that practically guarantees invincibility.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A group of adventurers gets wind of
            the plan, however, and moves to thwart the tyrant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The lot includes two thieves (Justin Whailin and Marlon
            Wayans), a young mage (Zoe McLellan), a dwarf fighter (Lee Arenberg),
            a 234 year-old elf named Norda (Kristen Wilson) and, finally,
            Norda’s breasts, which receive such attention from the camera that
            they deserve their own screen credit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The quest largely consists of the heroes walking around,
            hunkering down in dark places, and telling each other -- repeatedly
            -- to watch out for danger.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Probably
            a quarter of the film’s dialogue consists of variations on such
            helpful phrases as "Watch out!" and "Be careful, man!"<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It might at least have been
            possible to enjoy <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </i>as a dramatization
            of a mediocre game campaign if only the movie had any sense of
            cohesion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Consistently
            the film drops the ball on the little things, making errors that any
            player who has given the <i>D&amp;D Player’s Guide</i> even a
            cursory glance would catch -- the fact that the thieves in this film
            are allowed to use swords, for instance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Or the fact that Marina, the group’s mage, spends most of
            her time fretfully watching her companions during combat -- have the
            screenwriters forgotten that she possesses magic powers that would
            be useful during the fight scenes?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Or the fact that the film (hilariously) seems to have <i>no
            idea whatsoever </i>how portals work; sometimes they close shut
            immediately after our heroes (or the villain) enter them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Sometimes they stay open for inexplicably long periods of
            time, thus allowing our heroes or the villains the chance to catch
            up with the other (and artificially increase the level of suspense
            in the process).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sometimes,
            when two people enter a portal at the same time, they emerge
            simultaneously at their destination; sometimes one gets there
            several minutes ahead of the other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The lack of rhyme and reason is puzzling, though the visual
            effect is admittedly impressive.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Even more incomprehensible is the
            film’s bizarre use of dialogue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The characters speak a sort-of medieval high-brow
            ghetto-speak, with "thees," "thous," and "by your leaves"
            alternating with phrases like "Yo, man, check out that chick."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The biggest offender here is Marlon Wayans, who plays a thief
            with the unlikely name of Snails.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Wayans seems to have learned subtlety and dramatic nuance
            from the Chris Tucker School of Acting, where he apparently
            graduated with honors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I’m
            sure his "hip" language was intended as comic relief (from what?),
            but it only makes an already bad film even worse.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>It’s hard to take a story for racial tolerance very
            seriously when one of the characters is a live-action Jar Jar Binks,
            mugging to the camera in every scene while the rest of the cast is
            mired in stiff medieval-speak.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I really wanted to enjoy <i>Dungeons
            &amp; Dragons</i>, but such an act was quite simply beyond my
            ability.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>There’s not an original moment contained in the movie, and
            the familiar scenes that <i>are</i> here aren’t particularly well
            done (indeed, the few scenes of dungeon crawling that made their way
            into the final cut are so obviously ripped off from the <i>Indiana
            Jones </i>trilogy that I almost expected someone to say, "Short
            Round, get my stuff!").<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This,
            along with the atrocious acting, a laughable screenplay (which
            contains nary a sentence that it isn’t an impossibly stale cliché),
            and a blatant disregard for the rules of the very game upon which
            the film claims to be based, made me angrier than a Beholder with an
            eye infection.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
            temptation to leave midway through the screening was almost
            unbearable; fortunately, I made my "Repugnant Piece of Cinematic
            Garbage" saving role, which allowed me to stay for the duration --
            but just barely.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thank
            goodness I had that +3 bonus in Bad Movie Constitution.<o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Twenty-eight year-old
            producer/director Solomon reportedly lobbied the game manufacturer
            for eight years to get permission to make this film.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span><i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </i>was his dream project, the goal
            towards which he dedicated his life, and he deserves congratulations
            for getting the movie made.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It’s
            just too bad that all his hard work resulted in something that
