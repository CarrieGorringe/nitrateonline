            <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>David
            Mamet films have always held high marks in my book. Devilishly
            wicked if occasionally slight, he's brought us his third film in as
            many years, but, alas, one of his weakest (but still strong compared
            with the rest of the holiday film pack). Insightful, corrosive,
            snappy, snide: yes. Compelling, powerful, diverting: mildly.
            Following the delightful convoluted mystery <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Spanish Prisoner</i> and last year's remake of Terance Rattigan's
            play <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Winslow Boy</i>, his
            darkly comic slant on Hollywood's greedy invasion of small town
            America is haphazardly hilarious, painting a nasty spin on a harried
            production crew, a Jewish lawyer turned back-stabbing producer, a
            conniving director, and the self-absorbed cast that cracks the moral
            dam of civility in tiny Waterford, Vermont. (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">&quot;Where
            is it? THAT's where it is.</i>)</b><o:p>

            is one of America's greatest writing treasures, on stage (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

            Untouchables</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Wag the
            Dog</i> among my favorite of his scripts). When he takes to
            directing his own material (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">State
            and Main</i> is his seventh such self-flagellation), he uses the
            gift of deft dialogue to paint the shadier and/or comic side of
            life, keeping action to minimalist distraction. The ensemble cast,
            which won a group acting award from the National Board of Review,
            doesn't disappoint in zinging bits that bite, although it's also
            discouraging that too many scenes end with questions intentionally
            left unanswered, a joke hanging unsaid on an audience that may be
            looking for a more distinct punch line.<o:p>

            <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So
            when La-La Land comes a-calling to Hokumville, USA, where an aging
            bow-tied Doc Wilson strolls the street and offers up quaint morsels
            befitting Marcus Welby, the rest of the townspeople take a varying
            approach to the incursion. Rebecca Pidgeon, Mamet's real life muse
            and wife, portrays the winsomely smart Ann, the local bookshop owner
            and amateur theatrical director. She becomes the earth-goddess
            inspiration and girl-next-door love interest of Philip Seymour
            Hoffman's Joseph Turner White, the stuttering, suffering playwright
            (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Anguish</i>) turned blocked
            screenwriter of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Old Mill</i>,
            that turgid tale of New England passion and purity that is the film
            within the film. A pair of antiquarian locals provide rural comic
            relief colloquialisms as they &quot;get hip&quot; with the latest <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Weekly
            Variety</i> and discuss per-screen grosses. Rotund Mayor George
            Bailey (Charles Durning filling in for Jimmy Stewart years after his
            <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">It's a Wonderful Life</i> character has gracefully grown old) puts up
            with a hard to please, pain-in-the-ass wife (Patti LuPone) who
            busies herself remodeling their house for the socially elitist
            dinner of the season. Down the street teen bait Carla Taylor (Julia
            Stiles) reads the latest gossip rag to learn the foibles of leading
            man Bob Barrenger (Executive Producer Alec Baldwin) whose predatory
            proclivities nearly bring the film to a startling, media-frenzied
            halt. Ann's stiff-shirted fiancé Doug MacKenzie (Clark Gregg) is a
            politically ambitious ne'er-do-well ultimately swayed by the
            powerful forces he seems so bitter to defeat.<o:p>

            <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            other above-the-title star shipped into the sleepy hamlet is fretful
            Claire Wellesley (Sarah Jessica Parker) a dunce-capped hot head who
            is ready to bolt from location rather than bare her breasts as part
            of a contractually-bound nude scene. She's calmed by director Walt
            Price (Mamet stage and screen regular William H. Macy), still
            checking on the box office of his <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Gandhi 2</i> sequel and frantically smooth-taking, bad-mouthing, and
            tight-roping among the locals and the crew as filming looms just
            days ahead. David Paymer IS Marty Rossen, the quintessentially
            abusive producer, pulling out all stops in quest for Hollywood gold
            and a hard-nosed reputation. Either he's incredibly insipid (he opts
            to call Claire by less-than-glamorous nouns) or marvelously shrewd
            (when the cash intended to bare Claire's bosom instead kick-starts
            the film back from legal limbo). Mamet obviously is drawing from a
            long career associated with the likes of such lunatics, whose names
            have been changed to protect their stupidity.<o:p>

            <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            script follows the characters' interaction and plants amusing
            situations all over town. There's even a scene about the absurdities
            of the federal election process that's preciously funny in lieu of
            the Florida fiasco. As a running gag, associate producer credits are
            tossed about like Easter Eggs, and if you stay through ALL the end
            credits (skewered with some inhumane humor), you'll learn that
            &quot;A complete list of this film's associate producers is
            available upon written request.&quot;<o:p>

            <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            film was originally called <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">State
            and Maine</i> when the locale was set further north (it actually was
            filmed in Massachusetts). The final &quot;e&quot; was dropped and
            the reference now is to the town's single stoplight intersection
            where the reckless leading man and his teenage consort flip over a
            car and start the town talking.<o:p>

            sends up the same tinsel town prima donnas that populate <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">State

            while Mamet's comic ode to the venality of Hollywood catches those
            powerbrokers in the crosshairs of country bumpkinhood. Fine Line
            Features' release is a fitfully funny morality tale. Part of the
            distributor's campaign is a website that further expands the humor.
