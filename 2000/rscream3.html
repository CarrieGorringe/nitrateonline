<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="5"><b>A</b></font><font size="4">lthough
unlikely to have been envisioned as such, the February 2000 opening of the third
chapter in this wildly popular slasher franchise can be seen as a harbinger for
that inevitable pop culture tsunami, 1990s nostalgia. From the quaintly dated
metal on the soundtrack (Creed, System of a Down, Finger Eleven) to the
self-conscious irony of the self-referential story to the mayhem as gleeful as
it is inevitable, <i>Scream 3</i> feels instantly outdated, as if the original
was released in 1986 instead of 1996. The novelty’s worn off, the kids in the
target audience have moved on (to be replaced, of course, by new kids who may
wonder what the fuss is about), and even the series creator, currently
overworked scribe Kevin Williamson, moved on and let someone else take over.
Yet, like the masked demon that refuses to die and just keeps on getting up (a
conceit directly from John Carpenter’s <i>Halloween</i> -- which, of course,
swiped it from somewhere else), there’s life in the old boy yet: <i>Scream 3</i>
is a surprisingly fun conclusion to a unique cycle of horror films that were
products of their decade.</font></span><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt"><o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Inevitably,
the story at this point is pretty complicated, but after a slow start, the
screenplay by Ehren Kruger (<i>Arlington Road</i> and John Frankenheimer’s
upcoming <i>Reindeer Games</i>) presents the material in a relatively natural
way. Apparently graduated from the violent university that provided the setting
of <i>Scream 2</i>, the understandably reclusive Sidney Prescott (Neve Campbell)
has barricaded herself into a spacious mountain retreat above Los Angeles, and
works from her home through a phone link-up with the California Women’s Crisis
Counseling center. Cotton Weary (Liev Schreiber), unjustly accused of murder in <i>Scream</i>,
is now the host of the popular daytime talk show “100% Cotton.” <i>Stab 3:
Return to Woodsboro</i>, the third in the trilogy of films about the Woodsboro
massacre (the events of the original <i>Scream</i>) is currently in production,
and the unkillable but now limping Sheriff’s Deputy Dewey Riley (David
Arquette) has been hired as a consultant. Pushy TV newswoman Gale Weathers
(Courtney Cox Arquette), who wrote the book on which the <i>Stab</i> movies are
based, shows up to work with police detective Kincaid (Patrick Dempsey) after
the killer abruptly resorts to his old ways.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">New
characters include Matthew Keeslar, Jenny McCarthy, Emily Mortimer, Parker Posey
and Deon Richmond as the cast of <i>Stab 3</i>, hired in many cases for their
resemblance to the characters from the original <i>Scream</i> (resulting in a
slyly funny initial scene on the set of the porch of Sidney’s original
Woodsboro house in which each of the young actors, out of <i>Stab</i> character,
brood on the wisdom of this career move). Scott Foley (Cliff on “Dawson’s
Creek”) plays the harried young director of <i>Stab 3</i>, and Patrick
Warburton (“Seinfeld”’s Puddy) is a brusque rent-a-cop to the stars. And
in the movie’s most reverential tip of the hat to the schlock horror films
without which it couldn’t exist, former genre mainstay Lance Henriksen plays a
legendary B-movie producer named John Milton, Carrie Fisher has one good line as
an embittered studio archivist, and even the granddaddy of them all, Roger
Corman, has a brief scene as some sort of studio honcho. Oh, and Heather
Matarazzo (<i>Welcome to the Dollhouse</i>, <i>Now and Again</i>) pops up as the
sister of video store geek Randy (Jamie Kennedy), who died in <i>Scream 2</i> --
but not before making sure the rules of sequels are passed down to the
survivors.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Campbell
retains the most dignity as the now-reclusive Sidney, and manages to imbue the
character with a weary nobility which her inevitable showdown can’t erase.
Sensing the built-in appeal of real life events, Kruger has punched up the
scenes between the daffy but durable Dewey and the newly-chiseled Gale, giving
newlyweds David Arquette and Courtney Cox Arquette plenty of opportunity to
share the frame. Indie queen Posey makes the best of an underwritten role that
requires her to play a caricature of Cox Arquette’s character (whew), and
among the new class Warburton seems to be having the most fun with his fate
(certainly more than McCarthy, whose brief turn complaining that she’s been
cast as the blonde who gets offed must’ve looked clever on paper but stops the
film, uh, dead in its tracks). Amusingly, former teen heartthrob wannabe Dempsey
(remember 1989’s <i>Loverboy</i>?) comes off as the graybeard of the bunch,
and Kennedy once again steals the film -- this time without even appearing on
the set.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Like
the makers of the dismal <i>Man on the Moon</i>, the <i>Scream</i> franchise as
a whole and <i>Scream 3</i> in particular have made themselves critic-proof by
deriding their own existence upfront. Yet for all the meddling that apparently
went on behind the scenes of <i>Scream 3</i>, director Wes Craven has pulled
everything together and made a movie that succeeds both as mindless
entertainment and a sly meditation on growth, remorse and facing up to your
demons. If the eventual revelation of who, exactly, has done all of this killing
is anticlimactic (after the buildup, how could it be anything but?), it is also
a source of strength to the characters. Unlike Ripley in the <i>Alien</i>
franchise, their tormentor is mortal after all.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Where
Hollywood fads are concerned, “this too shall pass” is a phrase that
provides some comfort (think biblical epics, disco movies and Leonardo DiCaprio).
With that in mind, the <i>Scream</i> franchise could’ve ended a lot worse than
it has. And before you know it, nostalgia for this erratic but generally
satisfying series could provoke a <i>Scream 4</i>.</span></p>
