            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Walking down the passageways of
            a Catholic grade school on Long Island, the majestic Angela (Stacey
            Halprin) leads young Bruno (Alex D. Linz) by the hand while his
            classmates at school, who seem alarmingly lax in discipline, take
            the opportunity to throw the usual juvenile epithets, mostly
            regarding Angela's size. Angela, in the way she moves, looks like
            someone you would not want to mess around with<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">
            -- </i></b>her stride is determined and steady, as if powers great
            and small might reside in her, waiting to jump out. But one of the
            kids' crude remarks gets to her, and for an instant she just can't
            help herself: she stops and looks back, with the expression of
            someone who would like to get a break for once and can't. Then she
            quickly pulls herself together. <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">"</span>Ignore
            them,<span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">"</span>
            she tells Bruno, and they get into Angela's huge yellow car, with
            license plates that read <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">"</span>DIVA<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">,</i><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">"</i></b>
            and drive off, but not before Angela gives in just a little bit to
            her emotions, and pulls the car around just far enough up on the
            curve to throw a real good scare into the little kids with their
            little, stinging remarks.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The sight of Angela melting, in
            spite of herself, under the kinds of circumstances many of us<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">
            </i></b>had thought, or hoped, were left behind in school is one of
            the most affecting things about <i>Bruno</i> -- which marks Shirley
            MacLaine's debut as a feature film director (and which is getting
            its U.S. debut on the Starz channel this month) -- and Stacey
            Halprin's performance is remarkable not just for the way she allows
            herself to be shown as a <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">"</span>large
            woman<span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">"</span>
            in the film, but also for other points such as the way she expresses
            herself, how her character reacts to the way people treat her and
            how she compensates for it. She shows great paternal love towards
            Bruno, a kid who's just a little bit smaller than the other boys at
            school and, because of that plus the fact that he can't defend
            himself, gets piled on a lot. Bruno is bright, but not especially
            aggressive. Angela, on the other hand, seems sparring for a fight
            with the woman (Joey Lauren Adams) whom Angela's husband (Gary
            Sinise) left her for. Adams, stuck in a one-dimensional b-queen
            role, doesn't seem like much of an attraction; Sinise, on the other
            hand, who seems draped in melancholy in the picture, doesn't seem
            like much of a loss. But Angela's need to have him back in her life,
            even if the two of them aren't particularly suited for each other,
            is palpable and movingly depicted.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Part of <i>Bruno</i> is about how
            people habitually find ways to pick on other people for no good
            reason (or all the wrong reasons). The picture is also about how the
            title character wants to wear a dress. It has something to do with a
            dream he has, with quite possibly some Divine inspiration mixed in.
            With his upbringing in the Catholic faith, he sees the outfit not as
            women's clothing but as <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">"</span>holy
            rainments<span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">,&quot;</span>
            and he argues this point vociferously. <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">"</span>The
            Pope wears a dress!<span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">"</span>
            he tells the Mother Superior (Kathy Bates) in charge of his school,
            and who has a framed photo of John Paul II on her desk. Nonetheless,
            it drives everyone bananas, except for Angela, who not only
            accommodates Bruno but is an expert seamstress, and Bruno's new
            friend Shaniqua (Kiami Davael), a young girl who always comes to
            class wearing her school uniform, a bright red cowboy hat, and
            holsters with two toy pistols (and who may also be having some
            troubles at home which are only murkily alluded to). When one of the
            boys makes a crack about Shaniqua's skin color, Bruno clobbers him.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Bruno, Angela and Shaniqua are all
            outsiders, and the point of the movie is that people should be
            allowed to express who they really are in any way they wish. Except
            for his dream, Bruno's apparel decision doesn't seem to have
            anything to do with his identity one way of the other, except for
            the fact that he simply wants to do this. However, he has been
            spending lots of time studying the dictionary so that he can compete
            in a series of Catholic school spelling bees that culminate in a
            national contest and an opportunity for the winner to have an
            audience with the Pope. Bruno participates in the event wearing a
            dress. Does it cross anybody's mind in the film that he may want to
            make an exception on what he wears just for the competition, so that
            all his hard work won't be for nothing? No. Bruno wearing a dress
            and competing in the spelling bee are meant to be concurrent
            victories.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Unfortunately, Stacey Halprin's
            character is sidelined at the movie's halfway point, and MacLaine
            herself barrels right in as Bruno's grandmother, who wears men's
            style trousers, shirts, and outer coats, and dares anyone to say
            anything about them. She supports him and teaches him how to put up
            his dukes, so there's little doubt as to how things are going to
            turn out. Bruno shows up at the national spelling finals wearing a
            Western outfit and wig that makes him look like a combination of
            Dolly Parton and Dale Evans (and, I am afraid to say, Jonbenet
            Ramsey, a distinction which I hope was unintentional).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">MacLaine shows an aptitude for
            directing and working with actors: Alex D. Linz gives a winning,
            smart, chin-up portrayal of Bruno, and Kathy Bates is a hoot during
            scenes such as the one where, in private, she wearily genuflects,
            saying <span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">"</span>Oh,
            popi, popi....<span style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal; mso-bidi-font-weight: normal">"</span>
            to her photo of the Pope, before turning it face-down before
            producing a cigar and lighting it up. But the film belays its most
            interesting aspects in favor of ones that are more pleasing, easier,
            and reassuring, even if they end up seeming forced. We know who all
            the bad guys are, which characters we are supposed to root for, and
            what sort of message we're supposed to come away with from all this.
            In other words, the film turns out to be not nearly as brave,
            fearless, and daring as Bruno himself is.</font>
