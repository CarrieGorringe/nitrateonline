            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>For the past several years,
            Brendan Fraser, with his great, expressive eyes and generous smile,
            has been doing steady, consistent, and superlative dramatic and
            comedic work in films ranging from <i>Gods and Monsters</i> to <i>Blast
            from the Past</i> and the ill-fated, live-action<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span><i>Dudley Do-Right</i> (for which he was nonetheless
            perfectly cast in the title role). If director Harold Ramis' new
            film of <i>Bedazzled</i>, based on the 1967 Stanley Donen, Peter
            Cook and Dudley Moore comedy -- and which is a hard act to follow,
            for starters -- doesn't turn out entirely as expected, it at least
            gives Fraser a chance to get off to a raring start.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">He plays Elliot, a user support
            specialist at a computer company in San Francisco, who tries so hard
            to be ingratiating to his co-workers that they can't bear to be
            around him for long, let alone long enough to tell him to try to
            relax and be himself. He's tremendously busy trying be what he
            thinks everyone else wants him to be, so that he gives off an
            intense, desperate buzz that only makes people feel even more
            uncomfortable. Fraser gets the elements establishing Elliot's
            character in just the right proportions: while he may not be
            accessible to others, he is to the audience, and we can both
            recognize with amusement the type of guy he is but also sense where
            he's coming from with his behavior. Elliot figures that, if he works
            hard enough, he'll be liked, even turning rejection into some sort
            of experience that can be turned from a &quot;negative&quot; to a
            &quot;positive&quot;, although the way he forces a smile and turns
            away with a slump in his wide shoulders is affecting.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And Elliot can't seem to get
            anywhere with regards to his pining for Alison (the winsome Frances
            O'Connor), with whom he has worked at the same company for several
            years: either the timing's wrong, or he can't seem to come up with
            the right thing to say. So, when a lovely woman in red (Elizabeth
            Hurley) entices him with a stare while standing by the pool table at
            an after-work spot, she offers him some help. One thing he should
            know, she says, then leans in close to his ear: &quot;I'm the
            Devil.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In exchange for signing the usual
            contract -- &quot;I, Elliot Richards, hereby known as The
            Damned...&quot; -- she offers him seven wishes, all of which Elliot
            uses to finally be with Alison. This allows Fraser the chance to go
            through a series of what turn out to be wonderfully realized
            satirical character turns: a powerful drug lord (who happens to bear
            a passing resemblance to Antonio Banderas) with a mansion and a
            stable of stallions; a &quot;sensitive&quot; guy who cries when he
            sees sunsets and sings songs with his guitar about dolphins; a
            hulking basketball star with huge teeth and a fizzy-looking wedge of
            white hair; a smooth-talking author who seduces women by telling
            them how sensuous the cells in their skin are; and an unnerved
            Abraham Lincoln.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ramis, who co-wrote the film with
            Larry Gelbart and Peter Tolan, wants to show that he's essentially a
            softie at heart, and the film ends up short-circuiting. All the snap
            and pizazz of the original material (it wasn't called <i>Bedazzled</i>
            for nothing) has been removed, replaced by little messages and
            indicators showing that Elliot <b><i>grows</i></b> from his
            experiences, such as having him start showing up for work in a denim
            jacket, and the Devil turns out to be remarkably conciliatory and a
            good sport. Elizabeth Hurley, who should have played this part to a
            fare-thee-well, turns out to be the film's biggest disappointment.
            She plays it like a sulky pussycat, and while she can spin words
            like &quot;piquant&quot; to stunning effect, her low-key approach
            just doesn't work. In fact, the seductive, purring tones of her
            scenes with Elliot aren't as effective (there's always that sense of
            wariness between the two) as the camaraderie between the two men in
            the earlier film. Dudley Moore was the desperate love-struck
            Stanley, Peter Cook played the Devil in full, Swinging Sixties
            London gear, and their banter was shaped so that it would keep
            drawing Stanley in, disarming him just enough so that he would<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>once again fall for the other's tricks, use up all his
            wishes, and wind up with the Devil finally getting his soul.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ramis isn't out to let anybody get
            anyone's soul in the new picture. Instead, there's an ending which
            is both bittersweet and sentimental, but which bewilderingly
            nullifies any reason as to why we should be watching this picture.
            One gets the impression that the filmmakers didn't want to explore
            the possibilities inherent in the material, that they only wanted to
            take it half-way. As a result, the film lets both Brendan Fraser,
            and the audience, down. But it may hopefully bring him some renewed
            attention, and the possibility of lending his talents to a film that
            will truly show them off to best advantage.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
