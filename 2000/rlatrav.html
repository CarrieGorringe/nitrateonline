            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 25 August 2000</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>There are two very good reasons
            to see the new presentation of <i>La Traviata</i> (which is
            scheduled to air on PBS stations the week of August 27).</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The first is the production itself,
            which was staged, filmed, and broadcast <i>live</i> over French
            television, and throughout Europe, on June 3 and 4, during the same
            times-of-day as indicated in the opera's storyline. The story's
            setting was moved from the mid-19th century to the year 1900. The
            party thrown by Violetta, the heroine, was staged at the Hotel de
            Boisgelin, in Paris, and broadcast on the evening of Saturday, June
            3; the scenes depicting Alfredo and Violetta's retreat in the
            country were staged and broadcast the afternoon of the following
            Sunday, from Le Hameau de la Reine, the one-time &quot;country
            cottage&quot; of Marie Antoinette, at Versailles; and the final
            scene was played in an apartment on the Ile St.-Louis, in the heart
            of Paris and within sight of the Notre-Dame Cathedral, on the
            evening of Sunday, June 4. This last scene was done in one
            continuous take lasting just under twenty-six minutes, and was timed
            so that its conclusion would coincide with the bells of Notre-Dame
            ringing at midnight.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Twenty-six minutes???&quot;
            Yes! The production uses electronic Steadicams, rehearsed to move
            along, and within, the action as it is being played. The first thing
            one notices is that the process conveys a sense of intimacy without
            becoming intrusive, or &quot;cramping&quot; the actors. The second
            is that the pictorial quality is impeccable. The great
            cinematographer Vittorio Storaro supervised the photography of this
            production, and the technology combines both the mobility and
            fluidity of modern video with the high-detailed pictorial and color
            composition that is for the most part only achieved on film. The
            scenes at Le Hameau and at Le Petit Palais, where Alfredo humiliates
            Violetta in public against a twilight-colored sky, are as good as
            any of Storaro's work for Bernardo Bertolucci's films.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The second very good reason to see
            this production of <i>Traviata</i> is Eteri Gvazava, the young
            Russian-born soprano who plays Violetta, and who is as lithe and
            beautiful as an Erté figure or one of the dancers in Degas'
            photographs. And both fans of opera, and of just plain fine singing,
            will want to get a look at her, here: I am not kidding when I say
            that this lady is going to be a big star. It's probably too soon --
            and unfair -- to start making comparisons, pro or con, between her
            and the great singers such as Callas or Leontyne Price, but Gvazava
            both sings beautifully and performs beautifully, and there are
            moments -- such as during the opening scene, when she sings the
            famous &quot;champagne toast&quot; aria -- when she soars.
            Considering how fiendishly complicated this production must have
            been -- a similar presentation of <i>Tosca</i> nearly reached crisis
            level when Placido Domingo stumbled, on-camera, in one scene -- the
            performance, and its lead performer, play with the grace of a leaf
            floating in mid-air.</font>
