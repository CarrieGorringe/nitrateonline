            anthologies, a historical widescreen fancier earlier this year with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Patriot</i> and his 1995 award-winning <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Braveheart</i>,
            Mel Gibson’s roguish advertising executive in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">What Women Want</i> takes a sidestep, showcasing his hitherto
            second-tier romantic comedy talents that borrow a whimsical wink
            from <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Maverick</i> and a
            lateral pass from the head strong arrogance and lunacy of Detective
            Sergeant Martin Riggs. Particularly in his serial male view of the
            female psyche and of the opposite sex as authority figures. In
            Mel’s calmer, gentler, millennial mode (still sexy after all these
            years), bad guys and gunplay have been replaced by fantasy and
            foreplay, and an irascible twinkle that offers up a stocking-full of
            yuletide good cheer, even if the script is a little weak on the
            believability front. Some of you don’t believe in Santa Claus
            either. The initial holiday crowds appear to like the kinder side of
            womanizing Chicago ad man Nick Marshall, afflicted with a serious
            case of narcissistic self-importance. His disease approaches
            terminal repercussions until a few bolts of well placed electricity
            brings out an interesting solution to a Freudian dilemma. The
            unsaintly Nick’s good dose of shock treatment may not be as good
            as it gets, but, with a nice glass of eggnog, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">What
            Women Want</i> is an pleasant swallow.</b><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times">Director
            Nancy Meyers (her second effort after <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Parent Trap</i> remake) molds a footloose and fancy free approach to
            the tale of a male chauvinist who unexpectedly finds himself privy
            to every woman’s most innermost thoughts -- whether he likes it or
            not. She trots her star into several nightmarish scenes in which he
            is bombarded by the cacophonous truth that he is a fickle scoundrel
            detested by an ex-wife (Lauren Holly), a virginally-impaired
            fifteen-year-old daughter (Ashley Johnson, in a heartfelt, teenage
            performance), and a caseload of abused coworkers (pick a ticket).
            Despite his deficiencies, he embraces Sinatra (as does Alan
            Silvestri’s score and the selections by music supervisor Bonnie
            Greenberg Goodman) and dances like Gene Kelly, even if his only
            partner is a wooden coat rack. Obviously there’s room for
            improvement and hence this amiable task of commercial comeuppance.
            Meyers decides that most of the mental conversations being
            eavesdropped come from women that are caught straight on in the
            camera lens from Nick’s POV. Looking at a crowd, he’s
            overwhelmed, but key in on a closeup and the voice over is reduced
            to a single opinion. I wonder if some mystery could have been played
            up with the central character’s inability to connect the voice
            with the face, but since most of the cast plays some role in his
            life, there’s no secret in their mental messages. Although one
            scene introduces his ability to read minds over telephone lines, the
            script (by </span>Josh Goldsmith and Cathy Yuspa, writer/producers
            for the CBS sitcom <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The King of
            Queens</i>) never explains how or why this happens.<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            the hero/anti-hero’s desire to put his unwanted gift to his own
            calculated gain increases, a nagging sense of decency and growing
            attention (spurious, then amorous) toward Darcy Maguire (Helen
            Hunt), his ad agency’s new hotshot creative director (in a job
            Nick had been eyeing for some time), tugs at his male ego with a
            cautionary tale of woulda-shoulda-coulda remorse. His belated
            attempts to set things straight get clamped down just like the lid
            on his PowerBook. Seems he’s too scared just to blurt it out
            straight to her face, and thus drags the film on a bit too long.
            There are several subplots that both embrace Nick’s maturing moral
            sense and waning macho sexiness. Invisible office lonelyheart Erin
            (Judy Greer) unconsciously reveals her suicidal tendencies, while
            the sexy, ditsy Lola (Marisa Tomei), a lobby-level coffee shop
            worker, wants to offer Nick a sexy dessert to go along with that
            Cappuccino with extra foam. Meyers handles both sidebars with just
            the right touch of human concern or determined zestfulness.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Valerie
            Perrine and Delta Burke get a few precious moments as thoughtful yet
            thoughtless mother hens whose brainwaves (or lack thereof) don’t
            register with Nick’s supernatural powers. Mark Feuerstein (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Woman on Top</i>) and Alan Alda are Nick’s only male acquaintances,
            the former a co-worker destined to replace Nick as the office
            chauvinist. There are some other men in the film, but damned if they
            say anything.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If
            I have a gripe or two, it’s that for all the bitchiness attributed
            to Hunt’s character in the backrooms of the ad agency, she’s
            shown as nothing but hard-working cog with a solid, if lonely, head
            on her shoulder, trademark Helen Hunt looks, and a simple wardrobe
            that’s always solid colors (white, black, baby blue). I’m never
            fully convinced of the romance and the chemistry as I am of the
            vulnerability of the main characters to be attracted to each other
            by their frailties. But heck, I’m nitpicking and probably annoying
            any of you who’ve read this far. Sorry. Bring a date, buy a soda
            and some popcorn, make out in the back row.</font><o:p>
