            Max Färberböck’s captivating World War II saga of love found and
            lost in battle-weary Berlin, a fiercely determined Bohemian and her
            lover each discover a personal <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">joie de vivre</i> and scream back the Hell with War. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Aimée
            &amp; Jaguar</i> is a striking, poignant, and seductive saga of a
            Jewish lesbian in love with the dallying wife of a Nazi officer and
            mother of four. As far-fetched as this sounds, Färberböck’s
            impressive first feature, based on a true story, triumphantly walks
            that same fine tightrope that earned Roberto Benigni’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Life
            Is Beautiful</i> so much international acclaim. A much darker film,
            in style if not content, this official German selection for the
            Academy Awards (it didn’t make the final cut) is a fascinating
            saga that treads parallel story paths with Paul Morrisson’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Solomon
            and Gaenor</i>. Both are tragic love stories dealing with hidden
            Jewish identity and socially forbidden relationships, not to mention
            the obvious titular similarities.<o:p>

            <p style="tab-stops:121.5pt"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Färberböck’s bolder characters are
            actually pet names for Lilly Wust (Aimée), a hopelessly romantic,
            blonde-haired housewife whose carefree, heterosexual inclinations
            slowly melt under the seductive plotting of Felice Schragenheim
            (Jaguar), who leads an adventurous life under the assumed surname
            Shrager, hiding her religion, sexual inclination, and espionage work
            for the underground. Her job as an editor at a Nazi newspaper
            affords her access to a safe filled with state secrets while she
            harbors her own; her semi-lecherous boss clueless about her
            activities until close to war’s end. But the story, told in a
            54-year-old flashback, begins in mid-November 1943, with Felice and
            her girlfriend Ilse (Johanna Wokalek) attending an evening out at
            the symphony. Ilse points out the feckless Frau Wust (with her
            latest Nazi lover), for whom she works as the family’s nanny/maid.
            The cuckolded husband is off fighting (and fornicating) for the
            Fatherland. Quite the model family. As the Battle of Berlin streaks
            the bomb-laden skies with blood-tinged flames (one of the many
            effective shots by British director of photography Tony Imi), and
            the confused concert audience rushes to the bomb shelters, the
            ever-opportunistic Felice, offers a cool, bold exterior and makes
            her first, casual contact with Lilly.<o:p>

            <p style="tab-stops:121.5pt"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Despite the barriers that lie ahead, Felice
            forges on with her outlandish notions toward Lilly, refusing her
            best friend’s advice that such a plan is fraught with danger. She
            writes secret letters to her would-be lover, which are misconstrued
            as originating from one of the male officers that occasionally share
            her bed. She finagles her way into the family home through Ilse, who
            becomes a third-party observer and the potentially spurned
            third-woman-out. While playing silent cheerleader to Felice, Ilse
            roots for her friend’s defeat (while also hiding her friend from
            the Gestapo in her father’s apartment), knowing that her jaded
            employer’s ability to “smell out a Jew” will doom Felice’s
            gay designs. The reckless progress is followed by Felice and
            Ilse’s coterie of friends, who spend time drinking, carousing, and
            acting naughty.<o:p>

            <p style="tab-stops:121.5pt"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As embodied by Juliane Köhler and Maria
            Schrader (who shared best actress Silver Bear awards at the Berlin
            Film Festival), the eponymous leads are cut from the stereotypical
            mold of generations-ago German decadence and hedonism. Flashes of
            Marlene Dietrich and Louise Brooks flirt around the edges of these
            extraordinary women in Max Färberböck and Rona Munro’s
            screenplay, itself adapted from a best-selling book by Erica
            Fischer, based on Lilly Wust’s memories a half-century later. Köhler’s
            Lilly is the richer role, subtle with innocence, then aflame with
            childish curiosity and fascination before her new-found
            self-confidence is torn away and her life shattered into a thousand
            fragile pieces. As Felice, Maria Schrader epitomizes the clever Jew,
            boldly courageous in the face of adversity, vulnerable to a Nazi
            Germany bent on her race’s destruction, but refusing to be
            intimidated.<o:p>

Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Generally filmed in exceedingly low light
            situations and with blue/gray tones, faces are lost in shadowy
            darkness and the ominous starkness reflective of the times makes
            this remarkable story all that more emotionally charged. Lesbian or
            not, you’ll find a fatal attraction to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
