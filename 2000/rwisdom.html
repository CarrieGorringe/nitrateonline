            begins with some breathtakingly handsome images. So striking and
            unusual, in fact, that it's only toward the end of the scene that
            you come to recognize the carnage that you've been looking at. The
            camera pans down from a pale sky through the branches of a tree
            which is the occasion for a childhood memory, narrated by Steven
            Grlscz (Jude Law), in which he describes the panic he felt while
            falling from a tree: &quot;the blood pounding in my ears... the
            dread of falling.&quot; And then you're looking at the tree from
            another perspective, the camera panning up the trunk to reveal a
            car, hanging among the leafy limbs. Cop cars gather round the
            accident site and cranes and pulleys are put into place to undo the
            damage. &quot;She must have been out of her mind driving like
            that,&quot; says one observer. &quot;A hundred miles an hour.&quot;
            Steven approaches the tree, his eyes wide in wonder. And then you
            see the blood, dripping slowly, one drop at a time, onto Steven's
            hand. </b><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            is as bizarre an opening scene as you might see in a movie this
            summer, at once lyrical and awful. You might also use these terms to
            describe Law's character, who is, you soon learn, a vampire of
            sorts. And yet, he's not quite a &quot;normal&quot; vampire, being
            both less sensuous and more scientifically inclined and more able to
            walk around in the daytime -- than those living dead folks you've
            seen in movies before. Though he's properly tortured and beautiful,
            Steven doesn't really fit into such a recognizable category. And
            this means that writer Paul Hoffman and director Po-Chih Leong's <i>The
            Wisdom of Crocodiles</i> isn't so easily classified either, drawing
            ambiguously from thrillers, horror and detective movies, romances,
            and trendy urban malaise pictures. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">On
            one level at least, Steven fits the standard bloodsucker profile. He
            feeds off the pulsing life force of various &quot;girlfriends&quot;
            - women he picks up with some version of the sensitive guy
            performance. He seduces them with his pretty vulnerability and
            haunted interior, then invites them into his bed, where he pierces
            their necks and quickly, violently drains them, until his mouth is
            colored raw red and their bodies are left lifeless: as he bluntly
            puts it to one victim/paramour, &quot;I need the love that's in your
            blood.&quot; Steven is simultaneously ancient and youthful, renewed
            by his conquests but never sated or transformed by them. And so,
            he's seeking something that he can only believe exists, the ideal
            partner whom he has calculated precisely, whom he believes will
            sustain him emotionally and spiritually, no matter what. Miserable
            without her - he and the movie ostensibly presume she is a she -
            between his fatal affiliations, Steven hides himself away in his
            shadowy but well-appointed London flat (vampires are always
            unspeakably wealthy). There he reads great philosophers, catalogues
            and recounts for himself his many lost loves. That Steven is
            extremely self-conscious, and bears some vague sense of guilt about
            his nature, is not a new idea: Anne Rice's Lestat, the comic book
            character Blade (played by Wesley Snipes in the movie and its
            upcoming sequel), and the WB's Angel (David Borneaz) have made this
            tormented sensibility highly visible -- and sexy -- in today's
            popular culture. What makes Steven slightly different is that he
            approaches his condition not as a personal cross to bear or a
            political cause to champion, but as a kind of adventure, a means to
            eccentric self-discovery. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">While
            this last makes Steven an obvious metaphor for the contemporary city
            dweller's intrinsic estrangement and isolation, it also makes him
            more like the people he's feeding off and less Draculean than the
            average vampire. And it makes him vulnerable to some rather mundane
            life forces: for instance, the cops. Part of this is brought on by
            Steven's own self-destructive audaciousness. Since overconfidence is
            typical in homicidal maniacs, you might expect the cat-and-mouse
            relationship Steven establishes with a local detective, Inspector
            Healey (the magnificent Timothy Spall). Following that initial car
            wreck, which involved Steven's latest suicidal victim, Maria (Kerry
            Fox) -- whom you see in flashbacks, ironically saved from an initial
            attempt by Steven, who proceeds to ravage her a few scenes later -
            Healey picks up on a pattern of curious deaths, all of whom are
            girls Steven has known. Feeling both his class difference from and
            moral superiority to his quarry, the quietly clever Healey starts
            nosing around, appealing, much like Columbo, to Steven's manifest
            arrogance, just as Steven indulges in a certain familial fondness
            for the other man, whom he treats as both older and younger,
            substitute son, brother, and father. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Steven,
            correctly worried that Healey is onto him, accurately sees in the
            detective a mentor, confessor, and platonic lover, someone who might
            appreciate his brilliance and (fear of) mortality while also being
            attracted to his sensitivity, his almost feminine masculinity. The
            two men discuss the meaning and function of evil, Steven believing
            that it &quot;cuts through every human heart,&quot; and Healey
            conceding that such thinking is &quot;a bit subtle for me.&quot;
            Steven is only partly subtle, though. At other times, he's
            completely transparent, hungering for what seems to be his fated and
            fatal connection with Healey (who will die is not clear yet).
            Powerfully erotic - at least from Steven's repressed perspective --
            the men's relationship is also all about knowledge and control. Even
            in this film's iniquitous atmosphere, Healey's saving grace appears
            to be that he is happily married, to a woman, not to mention a
            gruff, shy man's man (though not quite so brutal and unself-conscious
            as most movie cops tend to be), and so Steven must content himself
            with a few heady conversations and rescuing Healey from street
            punks, a multi-culti crew of kid-monsters whom Steven dispatches
            with ease. Suitably impressed and grateful, Healey yet remains a man
            of principle: he's got a job to do.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            seeming sublimation, Steven finds himself another girl, Anne Levels
            (<i>Nadja's </i>Elina Lowensohn), quite too properly named for her
            career as an engineer. On the surface both ethereal and grounded,
            Anna complements Steven's double self, his eeriness and mutability,
            and she's intrigued by his odd behaviors and kills, such as his
            ability to write with both hands at once, and to draw her portrait
            upside down (what woman wouldn't be smitten!?). At the same time,
            Steven is attracted to Anna's ambiguities, her boyish enthusiasm and
            delicate femininity, her passion and her hesitancy, even as these
            qualities are exactly what he does not need. (Recall that he needs -
            or believes he needs, which amounts to the same thing - her undying
            devotion.) Anna's resistance to his charms (which, he suggests, have
            always worked in the past, at least until he chomped down on that
            tender neck flesh), makes Steven a bit unsettled and exposed. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana"><font size="2">And
            this self-disclosure, the film suggests, would seem to be the way
            toward wisdom. Unlike the perfection that Steven has pursued through
            his arduous mathematic and scientific labors, this one is formed in
            kindness, the ability to imagine and assuage someone else's pain.
            This particular art exists is beyond Steven, whose own ambiguities
            lie elsewhere, on a plain between life and death, human and not.
            Tiring as it can be at times -- its own use of limited gender and
            sexual stereotypes -- <i>The Wisdom of Crocodiles</i> also offers
            enough offbeat plotting and luscious imagery, that its ultimate lack
            of subtlety might be forgiven. </font><o:p>
