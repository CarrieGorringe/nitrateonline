How do you think <i>Love &amp; Basketball</i> is different from what its viewers
might have seen before? <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Omar
Epps:</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
It's a new slice of African-American life, with basketball as a backdrop. It's
refreshing in that it's part of that new movement in black films, looking at the
middle class, both the kids come from two-parent household, so it's not against
all odds, or basketball or die. And for me, the major draw was that the girl got
to have her cake and eat it too. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">CF:</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
It's also unusual in that it splits audience identification pretty evenly
between two protagonists. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">OE:</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
Well, it really is about the girl, about Sanaa's character, Monica. I think that
Gina did a good job of not making it only a statement for women's sports
outright. She let the situation speak for itself. I think it's a date movie and
a family film. I don't know why you wouldn't want to see it. With a lot of
films, I can see why someone from a certain area might not want to check it out,
but this one, with the love dynamic and the relationships among the family
members, has a lot to offer.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">CF:</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
Can you describe how you see the intergenerational relations? <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">OE:</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
I think it's important, especially for black cinema, because we don't get to see
too often the father and son bonded beyond biological circumstances: this father
raised his kid, living in the house with the mother. The last scene between my
character and his father leaves you with an optimistic feeling, because they've
both become men. I was so taken by the all parents' stories; they're so solid
and present throughout the film. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">CF:</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
How do you think it presents the tensions between career and relationships? <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">OE:</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
It's the real deal. You could use an older couple, who might not be in the
sports atmosphere, or who are in a corporate atmosphere. Here, basketball is a
metaphor for that tension. I know independent women in their thirties, who have
trouble finding a guy who may not be where he wants to be, and vice versa with
men. It's more prevalent now in the 2000s, because there are more women getting
into positions of power, and not just because it's a movement, but because
they're the better person for the job. So this movie comes right around that
time, when that's a discussion that people are having. And how do you work it
out? I don't know. I guess in our film, love triumphs over all -- but with
compromises. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">CF:</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
Given that you've been working for so much of your life, what kind of changes
have you seen in the industry? <o:p>
</o:p>

I see more chances being taken. To me it's not a surprise: it's just a process
of events. In ten years, I've seen two waves of actors come already. And I've
seen technology definitely do its thing. I remember when <i>Jurassic Park</i>
came out, that was like, &quot;Oh my god!&quot; but then when <i>The Matrix</i>
came out, it was on a completely different level. And I've seen people become
more accepting of art, coming back to that auteur mindframe. Hollywood is based
on money, so whatever makes dough, that's what they're going to duplicate,
whatever doesn't, they'll shelf. But I've seen studios take chances, make the <i>Good
Will Hunting</i>s once in a while. And the independent rush, that's the biggest
thing that everyone's seen. You can get a High 8 or Handicam, go out and make <i>Blair
Witch</i>, and it might make $144 million. That's all about chance, which is
exciting. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">CF:</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
And Spike Lee, one of the producers for your film, has important for that
increasing interest in independent films. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">OE:</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
Definitely, I think he helped push the independent mindframe, as a writer,
director, performer, and producer. Spike is like the magician who gives away his
tricks. Magicians don't usually give away their secrets, but Spike encourages
you and gives tricks away, as if to say, &quot;You can do this if you want to do
it.&quot; Cats like Spike, who inspire and show and prove by his work, it's only
good. And he has a huge responsibility. I remember at the inception of the new
black film renaissance, mid-eighties, there was Spike, and because he was a
young black writer-director, he had the whole plight of our people on his
shoulders. He basically had to rewrite our cinematic history. The
&quot;great&quot; films before that were <i>Superfly</i> and <i>The Mack</i>,
which were shitty films but for the time, they served a purpose. So Spike had to
show that we were artistic, and we were clever, and witty and smart, and that we
had the ability to make a credible film that was colorless. If you take Spike
Lee's name off of <i>Malcolm X</i> or <i>Mo' Better Blues</i>, they're still
great fucking movies. He's definitely one of our warriors. <o:p>
</o:p>

As your previous films have been &quot;mainstream,&quot; what's it like having a
film in festivals [<i>Love &amp; Basketball</i> is screening at numerous film
festivals before opening commercially]? <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">OE:</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
I dig it. Sometimes I get a chance to see some other films, which I might not
see otherwise. And everyone is here to see films: that's cool. <i>Love &amp;
Basketball</i> isn't really a festival type of film, but I guess the vibe has
people interested in it. It's a feel-good movie and inspirational, which is the
kind of film they use to open or close a festival. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">CF:</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
I suppose, to the powers that be, a film written and directed by a black woman
may be unusual, i.e., &quot;festival&quot; material. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">OE:</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
You know, someone asked me the other day, what was it like to work with a woman
director. I was like, what? I don't want to sound like Mr. Philosopher, but art
doesn't have a gender. What I wanna say is, she has the ability, she's an
artist. But it's the society we live in: that's still a battle. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>

I'm glad that now I've done a real date movie, I hadn't done a love story
before, and next I want to do a romantic comedy, show a lighter side. I want to
be respected. I think people know of my dramatic ability. I would love to be
heralded like Denzel, but at the same time, you would never believe him in a
light comedy. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">CF:</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
<i>Heart Condition</i>, no. But <i>Preacher's Wife</i>, a little closer. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">OE:</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
A little bit, maybe. But I want to be able to flip like Robin Williams and Tom
Hanks: these guys are brilliant comedians but when they do the dramatic stuff,
you're there with them. Or Jim Carrey, I thought he was amazing in <i>Man on the
Moon</i>. This [generically limited] system is set up because, people
individually, we don't control anything. But as a mass, <i>we</i> control. It's
hard to break the mold because the mold is a dollar: it's all about money. It's
hard to take a risk or gamble, because who knows what's going to miss. They're
going to make <i>Waterworld</i> for $100 million and it flops, but they'll do
another one because one of those is going to hit. <o:p>
</o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">CF:</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
What do you make of the emerging viewership, say, for <i>The Best Man</i>,
people who know how the business works and who network by email and make the
effort to see the film the first weekend to secure for it a huge opening office?
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">OE:</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
There's so much that's out of our control, as actors. But for viewers, what used
to be word of mouth is now word of keypad. The internet is another platform for
independent films: you can set up a website, get a following, who knows what
could happen. But word of mouth is big now because you might have that friend in
London, and type to her, &quot;Hey, this was a good movie, go check it
out,&quot; and then she spreads the word, like a disease. There are more
platforms for people to go against the grain. But it's hard when you try to make
a statement with a film. You automatically pigeonhole yourself, because only a
certain amount of people are going to come out and see it. And you can't be mad
at the masses who don't come out, because maybe they just don't want to deal
with that. So if it's <i>X</i> or a <i>Schindler's List</i>, well, that did
well, but it was harrowing. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">CF:</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
But you feel like <i>Love &amp; Basketball</i> does both.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">OE:</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
Sure, and that's a testament to Gina. There's not any scene in the film that's a
statement, like: here's the monologue. That's how you do it: you place life in
front of people, but you don't point the finger and say, you are here, let me
guide you through. That's what's exciting about the discussion of this film:
everybody's getting a different thing from it. Some people are more into the
relationship between the father and son, other people are into the relationship
between Sanaa and I, others are into the sports. There are many discussions to
be had. And that's the best thing. You want people to be entertained but to
think, to have something to talk about. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">CF:</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
Was there a part of the film that was difficult for you? <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>OE:</i></b>
The biggest challenge was to go back to the seventeen- or eighteen-year-old
mindset. Not to act it, I wanted to live it, because the eyes never lie. It was
hard to be consistent, and not think, because at that age, you're just full of
passion and you think you know but you don't know, and you do know, and all
those things at once. It was so uncomfortable. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">CF:</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
And the basketball -- as business as well as sport -- complicates that young
life. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">OE:</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
Definitely, especially for Sanaa's character. She's going against the odds,
being a woman player generally, but also for her individually. Monica wasn't
born with the talent, she had to learn it and work on it <i>and</i> deal with
her mother, who wanted her to be more an effeminate woman versus just realizing
her own potential, whereas my character has the talent and has the backing of
his father, has it laid out for him, and is surpassing all the things his father
had done at his age. But my character's question is, is basketball everything?
And if not, then what else is there? And he ends up with love, which is the
wealthiest thing of all. Which is important for kids now, because the mindset
you have now is, either you have a wicked jump shot or you sling crack rock. So
this film conveys that without preaching, without having that scene where
someone says, &quot;You ain't got no back up!&quot; For all these young kids
coming into the NBA, getting shitloads of money and endorsements, it's not so
much can they play the game: it's the lifestyle. It's hard to tell them
anything, because they're paying the bills, providing for their families. And
it's harder for them to teach themselves to learn. It's a whirlwind. I can only
imagine; it's been a whirlwind for me, but sports is completely different,
you're traveling everywhere all year round, and your face is on TV constantly,
and you're in video games and on jerseys, and how do you deal with that? All
you're doing is dribbling a basketball, and that can't be life. But it's
happening for a reason. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">CF:</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
And the reason is? <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">OE:</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
In my mind I can narrow it down. For the money thing, it's only fair. If a team
has $120 million to pay Kevin Garnett or Shaquille O'Neal, how much are they
making off of the guy? It's not like they're making 300 and want to give him
half. No. They're making billions. But the money thing aside, it's important
that these guys realize their responsibility and that basketball is not just a
means to an end, it's the first phase of whatever their greater destiny is. Once
I really got into the business, on the audition circuit, I dreamed of being on
the set and doing interviews. When I did get on the set, I was young, and I know
where I was mentally as a young man, and I know where I am now. And it's so easy
to stay in that young man's mentality, because it's all so surreal. You're
living out your dreams. But when you let your feet touch the ground, and you see
the responsibility and the opportunity spread out before you. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">CF:</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
Do you feel a responsibility to represent?<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">OE:</span></i></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
I feel it to a small degree. It's not something I wear on my shoulder. It's
something that's natural. I'm a black man and proud of it, I love my people. And
I'm all for the &quot;one world, one culture,&quot; but in order for us to have
one culture, each culture must be its own and understand its own. And as an
African-American man, we are the number one displaced people in the world,
because you can come to America and you can go to the Greek or Chinese part of
town, and people still have their own native tongue. We're the only people -- us
and white people, actually -- who don't have a native anything. We're just
trying to find our way, in the midst of everybody reaping the benefits of our
ancestors' work. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
the primary responsibility I feel is just to kids in general, no matter what
color. I'm inspired by kids, so I would like to return the favor. I want to push
it so that my daughter, godsons, and goddaughter won't have to go through and
see the same things that we saw. That's what it's all about: recycling and
sacrifice. I want to make the best of my time on earth, so the ones that come
after us can be smarter, wiser, stronger, more talented. The responsibility that
I feel comes naturally, it's the nature of my person. I don't have to go to the
school in the slums and put on my face. I live that every day, with every person
I come in contact with. And that's the easiest thing to do: be me.</font>
