<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>At
first glance, Karyn Kusama's <i>Girlfight</i> looks like a pretty regular
festival &quot;darling&quot; picture: it's the writer-director's debut feature,
it's about a young Latina in the projects who overcomes her unhappy home
situation to succeed in an unusual and topical arena (boxing), and finds true
love to boot. Played by talented and charismatic newcomer Michelle Rodriguez,
Diana is at once angry and sympathetic, and she gets to hit boys as well as
girls. It's executive produced by the venerable John Sayles (for whom Kusama has
worked as an assistant, and who appears in the film as a high school teacher),
produced by Sayles' veteran producers Sarah Green and Maggie Renzi, and
beautifully shot by Patrick Cady, camera PA for Roger Deakins on <i>Passion Fish</i>.
With all this going for it, you won't be surprised to hear that <i>Girlfight</i>
won Sundance's Grand Jury Prize. Arriving in theaters with much buzz, courtesy
of Screen Gems' enthusiastic marketing and a cd soundtrack featuring Fat Joe,
Carlos Santana, and Dilated Peoples (a cd available in &quot;Explicit&quot; and
&quot;Edited&quot; versions), the movie is plainly poised for success -- however
that might be measured. It doesn't hurt that <i>Girlfight</i> is also a good and
earnest movie, inspired by Kusama's own experiences boxing at Brooklyn's
Gleason's Gym and her observations of the kids who work out there. <o:p>

<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still,
in the post-festival, big-boys, first-weekend-box-office-means-everything world,
you never know what's going to happen. And so, I ask Kusama about her choice of
topic, namely, girls participating in a typically masculine arena. <o:p>

<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>Karyn
Kusama:</i></b> In this world of gendered expectations, it's very scary to see
violent women. Somehow we assume it's the province of men, and in many ways it
is. But there's another kind of underlying violence in that assumption, which is
that women don't have that rage and capability for violence in themselves. To
just deny it, as opposed to trying to acknowledge it and examine it, is where
this character [Diana] comes from. She's so much her father's daughter instead
of her mother's daughter, and has so much of his violence and way of handling
problems -- through dismissing them or belittling them -- she's taken into
herself, because it's the only way she knows. I see [the film] as a humanist
portrait of this character. What she wants is to be allowed to be her essential
self, and her essential self is a fighter, literally and figuratively. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We're
not all like that and I'm glad we're not all like that, but I wanted to start
making the audience ask questions of her behavior. It's interesting to me that
in boxing, when you see two women fighting, somehow it seems like you're seeing
the violence of the sport so much more explicitly than when you see two men
fight. And I think that's why many people have a problem with women boxing. What
disturbs me is when people have a problem with women boxing but don't have a
problem with boxing in general. The energy of the movie is watching a
character's physical self come into being, seeing something as simple as her
skin, or how her body changes, seeing that development of skill in her as an
athlete. And at this point it's sad, because it seems that because it's a woman
we're seeing go through this transformation, it almost feels radical. To me it's
a very old-fashioned story. <o:p>

which limits her options again. <o:p>

</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>KK:
</i></b>Yes. There's a very limited worldview available in those neighborhoods,
and if we really want to talk about violence and brutality -- which is something
I've had to talk a lot about [since making the movie] -- I think our public
education system is a form of brutality, and the housing conditions that we see
so many people living in, that's violence. Or social expectations and gender
stereotypes: these are forms of oppression and violence that far exceed what
boxing could possibly provide. I wanted to tell a story that was not making big
statements about poverty or the ghetto. I wanted to do something more matter of
fact, because there are so many people who live in these environments that I
didn't want to be insulting or make a big issue out of it. I do think that one
of the most interesting things in my experience in the gyms that I spent time
in, and in the gym where I trained for many years, is that you saw you many boys
from really tough environments, and you were at least slightly comforted to know
that during these two or three hours every day, they had some form of sanctuary
from the outside world. Perhaps it's a little bit convoluted, but they were
safer and freer from harm in a boxing ring than they were in their daily world.
And I knew that all of those kids had moms and sisters and girlfriends, and I
wondered, where do they go? What do they do? They live in the same sort of
depleted environment. The story was born out of that question: where are the
girls? <o:p>

<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CF:
</i></b>I notice that the soundtrack cd -- I guess it's inspired by the film --
features currently popular artists. Did you have input into that selection? <o:p>
</o:p>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>KK:
</i></b>I tried to have input into it. But I'll be honest, I feel like in the
end, as much as people want to be supportive of the film and come up with a
utopian hybrid of commerce and art, I remain suspicious of that hybrid. I think
it almost never works. This process has been interesting, because I do think
there's a lot of good music on the soundtrack, including some of the most
offensive work on it. I think the Cuban Links song is patently offensive, a lot
of the Remy Martin and some of the Fat Joe, that's offensive. But it's offensive
in a lyrical way, and a lot of times, musically it's really interesting. And
that, I think, is unfortunately, or fortunately, the interesting dialogue about
hiphop right now. Some of the songs that are just kind of boring, ditzy girl pop
songs, those are almost more offensive to me. What's disappointing to me is that
more of the score isn't represented on this soundtrack album, especially the
Latin traditional music. So I'm hoping, after the release of the film, that
we'll have another soundtrack that will adequately represent the spirit of the
movie.<o:p>

<hr size="1">
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CF:
</i></b>It sounds like the process of &quot;representing&quot; can become
difficult, like, for instance, as you're taking the film to festivals, being
picked up like your film has been is both your best hope and worst nightmare. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>KK:
</i></b>You said it, sister! In so many ways this process has been interesting
for me. It's great to be recognized, it's great to have so much public support
before the film has even been released, it's great that people like the movie
and that a distributor wanted to pay a lot of money for it and can imagine that
it can reach a lot of people. But that clause -- it can reach a lot of people --
has a lot of strings that I don't think I really saw before I got into this
process. And I want this film to be seen by a lot of people. So, at this point I
have to go on faith that if some of the promotional materials to me aren't as
representative of the film as I would like, I still have to believe that if it
gets people into the theaters, then something right has happened. I really like
the distributors I'm working with, so I want to believe that we've all been
doing the best we can with it. This whole idea of getting a movie out to
&quot;the people,&quot; and not just to an art-house crowd, it's painful,
because there's this assumption that the general mass of consumers are a bunch
of lambs being led to the slaughter. But then there's this other conception,
that there's a lack of choices in films. And then there's the public itself,
which doesn't seem to educate itself or seek out new work, and does depend on
media to get them into the theaters. I genuinely believe that audiences want and
deserve better movies, but then the new dumb huge movie ends up garnering
exactly as huge a weekend gross as you expect. <o:p>

<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>KK:
</i></b>Exactly. And, that we live in such a competitive environment, that even
that measure of success is just the icing on the cake. The cake itself is that
you have to spend so much money to get a movie out to the public. You have to
spend money on tv, newspapers, the internet. That stuff costs money. It's
blowing my mind. I surely must sound a little disoriented. <o:p>

<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>KK:

filmmakers who work with any kind of consistent integrity. It's great to learn
from him. <o:p>

<hr size="1">
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CF:
</i></b>I was impressed with <i>Girlfight</i>'s structure, beginning with the
opening scene in the high school girls' room, since it sets up her situation --
her anger and lack of options -- so deftly and so economically: that lingering
shot on her &quot;Jack Nicholson&quot; glare is so effective. Can you talk a bit
about the structure as you conceived it? <o:p>
</o:p>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>KK:
</i></b>At first, if it's possible, the structure was even more blunt and crude.
[Diana] had an unexamined self and an unexamined rage, and she just sort of
barreled through this storyline without particularly transforming: it was a
pretty boring story. Over several drafts, it became clear to me that the opening
five minutes had to set up her war with self-control, her inability to hold back
or verbalize anything. At first I thought I was spending too much time setting
her up, and establishing her personal threshold, and the crossroads she was at.
But it became clear to me that what Hollywood movies often do -- which can work
well, but wasn't going to work well for me -- is like, two minutes of set up and
then bam, the story starts. I had to start differently, to set up that the story
is already in motion when we meet her. We could only sympathize with her need to
be aggressive and to find a teacher to channel that aggression with ten or
twenty minutes of set up. So, though it's not particularly conventional, the
love interest is planted at the beginning but does not really show up until the
second half of the movie. <o:p>

<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CF:

romantic interest, Adrian] is so pretty, it's hard to not recognize him. <o:p>

</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>KK:
</i></b>Right! But, I think I could have made it come together and make it feel
like a much more ordered universe. But when you tell conventional narratives,
it's already too ordered. <o:p>

point where the choices they make are important. And while it's like this
everywhere, there's something about the starkness of urban life that can
illustrate that point even more quickly and effectively. You have to take an
active part in your own destiny at some point, and if you don't make that
choice, you can't grow or change in the long term. And it's in teenagers that
you see that cliff most dramatically. <o:p>

<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>KK:
</i></b>It all depended on who I cast as Diana, and once I cast Michelle
[Rodriguez], who had no experience acting at all, I felt sure that I needed to
get a pretty professional crowd in there to support her. So Paul Calderon, who
plays her father, and Jaime Tirelli, who plays her trainer, and even Santiago
Douglas, they were all trained actors, compared to her. What I also wanted to do
was create a sense of authenticity, so that meant getting boxers and real
trainers in there, and some kids who weren't exactly actors. The most important
thing was keeping things fresh, not making the predictable decision. And I
thought it would be good to see faces that had that spark of realness. <o:p>

to have looked a little bit different, but with the limited shooting time and
two actors I had -- their sizes, the way they looked in the shots together --
there was nothing I could do. So I had to work with what I had. And I decided
that the best way to do that was not to root it so much in reality, but in some
operatic, emotional context. It's something that some audiences aren't going to
buy and some will fall for hook, line, and sinker. It was the decision that
worked best with the footage I had, to give a sense of something happening that
was bigger than what we call reality. <o:p>

<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>KK:

slow motion, you're deciding to create an expressive space, but not show an
interest in real time. The two characters are in that final round together, and
I knew the only way to handle that material I had was to make it like a love
scene. <o:p>
