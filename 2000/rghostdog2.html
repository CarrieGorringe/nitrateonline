Jarmusch's new feature, <i>Ghost Dog: The Way of the Samurai, </i>is much like
other Jim Jarmusch films: the pace is slightly slow, the characters slightly
alien and alienated, the dialogue slightly offbeat, part poetry and part
trash-talk. Forest Whitaker plays Ghost Dog, samurai disciple, carrier pigeon
keeper, and for ten years the devoted retainer to an aging mafia foot soldier
named Louie (John Tormey). When one of Ghost Dog's contract murders goes wrong
-- the don's daughter Louise (Tricia Vessey) is a witness -- her father, Vargo
(Henry Silva), decides that to save face, he must have the killer
&quot;neutralized.'' The rest of the film follows Ghost Dog's calculated efforts
to survive, as he takes out the gang members while attempting to maintain his
ceremonious, mutually respectful relationship with Louie. </font><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Ghost
Dog's dilemma is both profound and ridiculous, produced by cultures colliding
and coinciding. One of the film's repeated jokes is his exquisite (and quite
funny) samurai hit-style: he flips and spins his huge handguns so they whoosh
with the impossible speed of a kung fu movie fighter, a device that manifests
the movie's heady hybrid sensibility, combining images from Hong Kong action,
samurai, gangster, and hood movies. Caught between eras and genres, Ghost Dog is
radically displaced and infinitely adaptable, as skilled with ancient warrior
swordplay as with laser gun sights and electronic eavesdropping devices. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Living
on a Jersey City rooftop in a makeshift shack with his carrier pigeons (his only
means of communication with Louie), he practices martial arts and studies the <i>Hagakure,
</i>an 18th-century samurai code book, from which he reads periodically in voice
over. &quot;The way of the samurai,&quot; he intones, &quot;is found in death.
Every day when one's mind and body are at peace, one should meditate on being
ripped apart by arrows, rifles, spears, and swords, being carried away by
surging waves, being thrown into the midst of a great fire, being struck by
lightning, being shaken to death by a great earthquake, falling from thousand
foot cliffs, dying of disease, committing seppuku at the death of one's master.
And every day without fail, one should consider himself as dead.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
overkill in this list of possibilities makes sense for Ghost Dog, a
simultaneously representative and exceptional &quot;young black urban
male.&quot; To &quot;consider oneself as dead&quot; on a daily basis is, of
course, a fact of life for him, a fact that, for all its deadpan humor, <i>Ghost
Dog </i>treats with a deferential and pointed irony. The character's melancholy
and sense of kismet reflect those of his peers, the young men he sees
freestyling on a park bench (not incidentally, rapping about him, exalting his
local legend), or the Bloods chilling on the sidewalk, who nod with respect as
he passes them on the sidewalk. Shot by frequent Jarmusch collaborator Robby
Muller in long-take, deep-focus imagery, these scenes reveal street culture's
strata of intricacy and intimacy, at least as intricate as those of ancient
civilizations. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Perhaps
even more striking is the film's lush, brooding hiphop soundtrack. Composed and
compiled by the RZA, the Wutang Clan's brilliant producer, the music is at once
somber and celebratory, drawing deep connections among Method Man's lyrics,
reggae, and free jazz, as well as the sounds of traffic, weather, or even
woodpeckers. Ghost Dog's sense of life rhythm is exemplified at a moment when,
upon tracking his prey to their country &quot;palace,&quot; he's momentarily
distracted and also brought back to himself by a hardworking bird's rhythmic
rat-a-tats: Ghost Dog checks his gunsight, smiles with wonder, and then, after a
heartbeat, sets back to his task, which --as he reads in voice-over from the <i>Hagakure
</i>-- must be undertaken with speed and without too much thought. The humor at
such junctures: the advised rush can be an indication of typical macho instinct,
but it's also a giving over of oneself to years of intense training and
preparation. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Such
thickness -- sounds layered on images layered on ideas -- resonates throughout
the film. The soundtrack's only previously released song is Raekwon's &quot;Ice
Cream Man,'' which plays almost as an introductory theme for Ghost Dog's best
friend, the French-speaking Raymond (Isaach De Bankole), a Haitian immigrant ice
cream vendor with whom he converses regularly even though neither understands a
word the other says. With this relationship, the film underlines a typically
Jarmuschian interest in spiritual and moral communication, people bound together
in shared quests, beliefs, and rituals, whether these be propitious or
destructive. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As
Ghost Dog struggles to &quot;make sense&quot; of his impossible situation -- in
order to preserve himself and his master Louie, he is forced to murder Louie's
masters, which in turn forces Louie to take vengeance on him -- the film shows
the ways that the codes governing his life and those of the gangsters are
simultaneously principled and absurd. In other words, they are matters of faith,
a means to define oneself amidst chaos. And so, while the contract on Ghost Dog
is specific, it also exemplifies the routine violence in the big city, the
murders that are unsurprising functions of power and racism. Instructed to take
out a &quot;big black guy&quot; on a rooftop, two of Vargo's henchmen,
breathless after ascending a walk-up, accidentally come on another pigeon
handler, a Kayuga Indian (deemed &quot;Nobody&quot; in the credits and played by
Gary Farmer, who was Nobody in Jarmusch's canny, deconstructed Western, <i>Dead
Man</i>), who calls them out when they shoot his birds: &quot;Stupid fuckin'
white man!&quot; Holding their huge weapons, the assassins are stunned by his
outrage. Even as they retreat, however, they see their worldview vindicated in
his apparent lunacy: &quot;Puerto Rican, Indian, nigger, same thing!&quot;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">With
this and other brief exchanges, <i>Ghost Dog, </i>like <i>Dead Man,</i>
deconstructs myths and conventions, those longstanding cultural investments in
prejudice, machismo, imperialism, and self-righteousness. The film catches
characters (Louise, Vargo, various mobsters) absorbing cartoons that appear on
TVS intermittently to comment on the action, escalating in violence and
explicitness, from Betty Boop to Felix the Cat to Woody Woodpecker to, as the
climax, Itchy and Scratchy (who blow up the planet in order to destroy each
other). Though no one in the film learns from these lessons, the audience can
appreciate their resonance. Such brutality is hardly an urban, black, samurai,
or gangster problem:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>it's global
and perpetual, cosmic and commercial. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">For
all its grim commentary on the state of the world, <i>Ghost Dog </i>does offer
hopefulness, embodied by its protagonist's unexpected young disciple, a
neighborhood girl named Pearline (the engaging Camille Winbush). They meet as
Ghost Dog sits on a park bench, engaged in a staring contest with a small dog
(intense in the vaguely disturbing way that small dogs can be). Intrigued,
Pearline asks whether it's true that he (Ghost Dog) speaks to no one. They soon
learn that they share a passion for reading, in particular, <i>The Wind in the
Willows, Frankenstein, </i>and <i>The Souls of Black Folk. </i>He offers her a
book Louise gave to him on the night of the shooting, <i>Rashomon </i>(which
suggests something about Louise, but it's never clear what); Pearline agrees to
read it and tell him what she thinks of it. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Pearline
and Ghost Dog's friendship develops alongside the rest of his adventures, but it
serves as a kind of heartbeat for the movie, a reference to its filmic sources
(including Kurosawa's many samurai films and Jean-Pierre Melville's 1967 <i>Le
Samurai</i>), in which the young student is a familiar trope, a means for Ghost
Dog to pass on his knowledge and legacy. But there's something more immediate at
work here as well, which makes the film less a kitschy fable than a keen
contemplation on contemporary experience, the obligation and contrition you
likely feel every day. This something else is in part the movie's manifest
respect for hiphop and samurai cultures, and a considered deference to
old-school gangsterism, but more than that, it's a respect for tradition and
change, together. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
fact that <i>Ghost Dog </i>is so wry about mixing old and new into this wondrous
strange pastiche makes it unusual, even among so-called independent films. It's
not smug or hipster, but reverent and smart. Its emphasis on communication
that's beyond language, or on books that speak across generations, might seem
like standard big-idea mongering. But what makes <i>Ghost Dog </i>singular --
funny but not scornful, wise but not imperious -- is its ability to understand
and really, appreciate, the myths of all kinds of cultures, from ancient to
postmodern, from <i>Rashomon </i>to Itchy and Scratchy, that demented cartoon
within a cartoon. The film attends to the nuances of fable: it's filled with
tiny, complexly reverberating moments, as when Ghost Dog paces down the street,
passing the RZA, as &quot;the Camouflage Samurai.'' They pause to acknowledge
one another: RZA says, &quot;Always see everything.'' And in return, Ghost Dog
nods, &quot;Positive embrace.'' Like the film, their exchange is arcane, absurd,
and fundamental. <o:p>
