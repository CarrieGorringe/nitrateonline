            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>After a night out at the local
            dance club -- &quot;When did Seventies Night become Eighties
            Night?&quot; asks one character -- Brian (Gale Harold) catches the
            gaze of Justin (Randy Harrison), a blond, strapping young example of
            American youth who looks like he could have just stepped forth from
            a box of Kellogg's Corn Flakes. Brian and Justin retire to Brian's
            place, whereupon a telephone call comes through: a female friend has
            just given birth. Brian, Mike (Hal Sparks), and Justin all race,
            somewhat gleefully, down to the hospital, where Lindsay (Thea Gil)
            is shown holding her newborn son, and Melanie (Michelle Clunie),
            Lindsay's companion, has a look at Justin. &quot;So,&quot; she tells
            Brian, &quot;you and Lindsay each had an infant tonight!&quot;</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And that's not all, folks: On the
            drive back, Mike asks Justin if he would like a lift home, it being
            well into the early morning hours. Justin has a look at Brian and
            replies, &quot;I'm goin' with him.&quot; Nope, this ain't your
            grandmother's television. Lock the doors, bolt the windows, and send
            the grandparents, the kids -- and the parents -- to their rooms. The
            American version of <i>Queer as Folk</i>, starting December 2, has
            landed amongst us.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is apropos that the cable
            channel <i>Showtime</i>, whose current slogan is &quot;No
            Limits,&quot; is broadcasting this adaptation of the controversial,
            then hugely popular (in that turn), 1999 U.K. series created and
            written by Russell T. Davis. Davis set his story in Manchester, and
            followed three characters whose lives intersect. Stuart (Aidan
            Gillen), a P.R. agency man, makes the acquaintance of Ethan (Charlie
            Hunnann), who becomes genuinely smitten with Stuart despite the fact
            that Stuart regards him as another passing encounter. This causes
            Stuart's friend Vince (Craig Kelly), a supermarket manager, to
            seethe, partly because Ethan, who's not old enough to know better
            (he's fifteen, and still in school), keeps following Stuart around
            the club scene at night, and partly because, unspoken, Vince and
            Stuart are longtime friends who for some reason have never become
            lovers. Meanwhile, Ethan finds newfound confidence and decides, to
            hell with it, he doesn't care if his schoolmates know whether he's
            gay or not: let 'em. (Hunnann's performance in this series quickly
            garnered him an enormous fan following.)</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The U.K. series gained initial
            notoriety because it not only depicted gay men as having active,
            healthy sex lives, just like everyone else (who's straight), but
            also enjoying it, just like everyone else (who's straight). After a
            while, the series also showed its main characters as guys who were
            -- just blokes: they had the same general needs, wants, and
            concerns, and have to run through the same day-to-day minefield of
            living. The title derives from a Yorkshire saying that can be
            interpreted as &quot;people are funny&quot; or &quot;there's nothing
            more stranger than people.&quot;</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The U.K. series is also funny, and
            sometimes wincingly dramatic (particularly the scene where Ethan
            breaks with his father after the father makes only one, yet
            undismissible, ill-considered remark).That it also, in some ways,
            perpetrates the negative stereotype that gay men's lives are a whirl
            of sex and drugs, I will leave to the Michelangelo Signorellis of
            the world to hash out. What bothered me more was its stand-offish,
            even acerbic, attitude towards its female characters (what happened
            to all that talk about &quot;our gay and Lesbian brothers and
            sisters&quot;?), which perpetrates another stereotype that gay men
            are also women-haters -- something which the people behind the U.S.
            version of the series have taken pains to correct.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The U.S. series' two-hour-plus
            pilot episode, written by the show's executive producers Ron Cowen
            and Daniel Lipman, neatly condenses the action of the U.K. series'
            first three episodes into one. The setting has been relocated to
            Pittsburgh, but it's surprising at how closely it follows the plot
            of the U.K. series, scene for scene and sometimes line for line.
            &quot;What does he say to 'em?&quot; one character asks Vince, in
            the U.K. series, when Stuart whispers something into first one, then
            a second, guy's ears so that they start dancing with him, together,
            on the floor of Babylon, the dance club the characters frequent.
            With a big smile on his face -- part admiring, part chagrined --
            Vince replies, &quot;If we knew that, if we knew the magic words --
            but he says them for all of us.&quot;</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In Pittsburgh, where the characters
            also frequent a dance club named Babylon, Emmett (Peter Paige) asks
            the same question of Mike when they see Brian doing the exact same
            thing on the dance floor. Mike's answer is considerably more
            wistful: &quot;We'll never know.... But whatever it is, he says it
            for all of us.&quot;</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It also serves as a presage for two
            things. Justin, deciding, at the urging of his friend Daphne (Makye
            Smith), that he can do as well as the more older Brian, hits the
            dance floor and starts drawing all the attractive guys from Brian to
            him. And when Brian cuts-in on Justin, he casts his glance back
            towards Mike, who's not dancing but watching, yet indicating that
            things may be taking a turn in another direction between the two of
            them.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While the show may not entirely
            evoke the same bubbly, intoxicating highs that the U.K. series
            achieved, the director of the U.S. pilot episode, Russell Mulcahy
            (yep, the same guy who directed the film <i>Highlander</i>), does a
            perfectly fine job handling the multiple plotlines and the many
            different types of characters, from straight to queenly. While the
            opening line of the show may be, &quot;The thing you need to know
            is, it's all about sex....,&quot; it's of course actually about how
            the characters treat the other characters decently. The story
            touches upon such aspects as the emotional reactions that occur
            during sex along with just the physical ones; how gay men tend to
            categorize and band themselves together into groups; how they see
            themselves as living in a sometimes near-hostile coexistence with
            straight people, where slurs and homophobia are regarded as being
            expected rather than the exception; and how some men retreat into
            the world of porn tapes and, now, cybersex rather than go through
            the trouble, the hassle the awkward tentativeness, and the possible
            disappointment involved with going out and meeting people, even if a
            flesh-and-blood person can provide more benefits in the long run
            than an electronic or virtual one.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As Mike, Hal Sparks has something
            of a New York sitcom sound to his line readings, but he has a great,
            munificent smile and look. He also gets us right on his side
            immediately during his first shot, when he does this great little
            bit where he acknowledges the camera (and us) with just a little
            raise of one eyebrow, and it's not a bit showy or upstaging (and
            that's very hard to pull off as an actor) while telling us
            everything about his character. His is the one who always seems
            destined to be the &quot;reliable&quot; one in the group, the one
            who provides reassurance, who frets, who gives his friends a
            fraternal nudge, who lets people stay at his place after their
            apartment building burned down (and, two years later, they're still
            staying there). He may not be entirely forthcoming about himself --
            to his co-workers, or to the people who call him up suddenly and
            expect him to drop everything, even if he's in the middle of a date
            with someone after months and months of inactivity. But he fiercely
            stands up for his friends, even when they behave less than
            honorably. The show wouldn't have entirely worked if Sparks'
            portrayal of Mike showed him as being, for instance, too much of a
            doormat for other people, or didn't have the right combination of
            elements that made you want to see him emerge from being always the
            underdog for a change. Sparks' performance has that combination, and
            it works well enough that it gets better in your recollection of it.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I suspect that he may be the one
            who may click most with viewers, although that is not to
            underestimate the performances by Gale Harold, who's swarthy and has
            a glittery look in his eye that makes one understand why he can draw
            practically anyone to him (they want to see what's behind that
            glittery look), but who never turns into a run-of-the-mill,
            two-dimensional &quot;predatory&quot; character; and Randy Harrison,
            who brings the right, appealing, erstwhile quality to Justin, but
            when he steps out onto the dance floor at Babylon for the first
            time, there's a powerful, and sexy, charge to his character's sudden
            emergence that's almost breathtaking. In the role of Deb, Mike's
            mother and a waitress at a diner in the Pittsburgh gay district,
            Sharon Gless bustles on and off, cheerfully blowzy, wearing a load
            of buttons from PFLAG and other organizations and shooting out
            wisecracks like, &quot;I never forget a butt. Especially a cute
            one.&quot; At the moment, she's somewhat terrifying, but hopefully
            she'll emerge more as a character as the series progresses.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Will the series, to borrow a phrase
            from the impish Kuchar brothers, turn into a &quot;soul-staining
            experience&quot; for Americans? I seriously doubt it. Will it prove
            to be as popular as the U.K. series, which has already continued
            into the equivalent of a second season? Quite possibly.</font>
