            was hitching a ride,&quot; intones the weary voice-over,
            &quot;looking for my girlfriend Michelle.&quot; The road is gray,
            the sky grim, the speaker scraggly. Wrapped in a sleeping bag, his
            thumb out and his face unshaven, this guy looks for all the world
            like he's on his way to that infamous nowhere, the one that passes
            as social commentary in a lot of small, arty movies. It's true: this
            opening scene in <i>Jesus' Son</i> makes it look like one of those
            movies, setting up a quirky journey of self-discovery for a
            restless, hard luck soul, stubborn and melancholy, lonely to the
            end. </b><o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Alison
            Maclean's new movie does all this, throwing in some heavy-handed
            religious iconography and trendy cameos (by, among others,
            too-cool-for-school Jack Black and <i>Ally McBeal's </i>Greg Germann),
            to boot. But the movie renders these standard themes and devices in
            a fragmented, untidy way that makes its rather pedestrian plot --
            based on an acclaimed, semi-autobiographical short story collection
            by Denis Johnson -- considerably more interesting, or maybe just
            more perverse, than might seem at first. Take, for example, the fact
            of that scruffy narrator-protagonist's name, F*ckhead (played by the
            ever-adventurous Billy Crudup). Or the fact that he never seems
            quite in control of the story he's telling (attributable in part to
            his rapid descent into full-blown heroin addiction), that his
            relationship with fellow junkie Michelle (Samantha Morton) remains
            disturbing throughout, or even that the film takes no apparent
            interest in making sense of its protagonists' self-destructive
            behaviors. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            isn't to say that <i>Jesus' Son</i> ignores the self-delusion and
            selfishness of its charismatic addicts. To the contrary, like other
            intelligent junkie movies -- meaning, the appropriately complex ones
            like Gus Van Sant's <i>Drugstore Cowboy</i> and <i>My Own Private
            Idaho</i> or Danny Boyle and John Hodge's <i>Trainspotting</i> --
            this one has a certain respect for the very real and occasionally
            euphoric hell experienced by most addicts. It doesn't treat them as
            titillating objects so much as subjects in their own right, screwed
            up, produced by and within a time typically rendered through a
            nostalgic haze. The fact that F*ckhead is an asshole most of the
            time doesn't make him unlikable so much as it makes him
            representative, of an era-bound idealism and sensitivity, a sense of
            privilege born of his race, class, and gender.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>F*ckhead is early on established as an unreliable and
            irresponsible narrator. Soon after you first spot him on the gray
            rainy road, he's picked up, by a station wagon no less, complete
            with parents and children. As he gets into the car, F*ckhead intuits
            or recalls -- his sense of time appears to work in several
            directions at once, forward and back and across -- the wreck that
            soon besets them. &quot;I knew we'd have an accident in the
            storm,&quot; he sighs. &quot;I didn't care.&quot; Slipping into the
            shadows of the backseat, wasted, he's hardly touched by the chaos
            rendered through artful shadows and a quick zip to the hospital,
            where the mother shrieks on learning that her children are dead.
            Marveling at her capacity for self-expression, the laconic F*ckhead
            absorbs her pain as if it's his own: &quot;I've been looking for
            that feeling everywhere,&quot; he sighs, before shifting the
            narrative track to a kind of faux origin story, that is, how and
            when he met his missing girlfriend Michelle. And with that, F*ckhead
            falls deeply into yet another fragment from his past. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's
            not surprising that this wayward character would appear in an Alison
            Maclean movie, as a means to explore breakdowns of communication and
            subjectivity. Since making several shorts and a brilliant first
            feature, 1992's <i>Crush</i>, the New Zealand native has busied
            herself with directing reputable television (a popular video for
            Natalie Imbruglia, a piece of HBO's <i>Subway Stories</i>, an
            episode of <i>Homicide: Life on the Street</i>, a couple of <i>Sex
            and the City's</i>). Much like <i>Crush</i>, <i>Jesus' Son</i>
            doesn't give you a character with whom to identify easily. F*ckhead's
            romantic reconstruction of his first encounter with the vivacious
            Michelle is structured so that all you see is his half-embarrassed,
            half-titillated face in a fuzzy foreground, while her torso dances
            in and out of the frame. A few seconds later, they're locked in a
            stand-up F*ck behind her boyfriend's house, where they've just met. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">F*ckhead
            doesn't stand much on propriety, or on conscience or even on
            sentiment, for that matter. And later, when a tangle among
            dealer-junkie friends leads to Michelle's boyfriend's rather nasty
            death (bleeding to death after being shot), F*ckhead finds himself
            commended for being the only acquaintance who tries to save the
            guy's pathetic life. It's not that anyone makes a moral judgment, to
            help or not to help; it's more that no one is able to feel or do
            much of anything, so that F*ckhead's half-assed effort becomes the
            single outstanding act, for which he's eventually rewarded with
            attention from Michelle. She introduces him to heroin and from then
            on, their relationship becomes long and painful, a sometimes
            sensuous and often agitated ordeal, bouncing between sexual,
            emotional, and chemical highs. <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Almost
            as respites from his bouts with Michelle, whom he clearly sees as
            the love of his life (though she occupies only a small section of
            Johnson's book), F*ckhead has adventures with other characters,
            structured as part of his journey, both internal and on the road, as
            he travels from Iowa City to Arizona, where he ends up working as
            aide in a retirement home. Along this muddled route, he spends time
            with the energetic addict Georgie (Black); they work in a hospital
            emergency room where they have access to too many drugs and one
            especially bizarre experience with a man who has a knife in his
            head. Other memorable incidents involve F*ckhead's buddy Wayne
            (Denis Leary), who rips out the wiring in his own house to sell for
            scrap, and a bit of hardcore survival story-sharing with an aging,
            hospitalized addict played by Dennis Hopper (who, of course, brings
            his own aging addict baggage to the role). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For
            me, however, F*ckhead's most disturbing episodes have to do with
            Michelle's (inevitable) overdose and a Mennonite couple. The former
            is staged as a kind of ritual cleansing scene for him (she pays a
            high price for his self-knowledge), unsurprisingly ironically, as
            she has saved him during his own overdose earlier in the film. The
            latter is perhaps the most extreme illustration of F*ckhead's
            remarkable and relentless self-absorption, as he becomes entranced
            with her singing in the shower (which is, admittedly, quite lovely
            and soothing), and so assumes the thoughtless kind of privilege
            imaginable only to those who don't deal with boundaries and
            oppressions on a daily basis. He peeps through the couple's window
            while they eat dinner and argue, and finally wanders inside one day,
            while she's home alone, singing in the shower. The husband comes
            through the door just at that moment, and F*ckhead makes his way
            back out the door, not so much apologizing as suddenly coming back
            to himself, realizing what he's doing and where his body is.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's
            this lack of self-consciousness, or more precisely, an incapacity to
            recognize other people as anything other than objects affording him
            pleasure or pain, that best describes F*ckhead's erratic life (and,
            if you think about it, movie watching). The elegance of Maclean's
            film, however, lies in its refusal to judge F*ckhead for his many
            moral and emotional failings, or to grant him a clear redemption or
            new direction, both tactics that a more regular movie might take.
            That <i>Jesus' Son</i> doesn't offer such standard resolution makes
            it frustrating but also provocative, as it asks you to rethink your
            own expectations of character, narrative, and what passes for moral
            principal. </font></span>
