            don't need any help.&quot; Called into her high-school counselor's
            office for fighting in the girls' room, Diana Guzman (Michelle
            Rodriguez) is resolute, surly and stoic. And why should she trust
            this lady anyway, even if she is nice and says she's concerned?
            Diana lives in Brooklyn's Red Hook projects, in a small apartment
            with her father Sandro (Paul Calderon) and brother Tiny (Ray
            Santiago). This environment is bleak: the apartment is cramped, the
            walls dirty, and the atmosphere oppressive. Angry and frustrated
            himself, Sandro is abusive -- more specifically, he abused Diana and
            Tiny's late mother. Growing up with this violence in the apartment,
            the kids have responded in radically different ways: Tiny rejects
            violence in favor of academic pursuits, and Diana has embraced
            violence, in an incoherent and unconsidered way. When you meet her
            in that girls' room, it's clear that she has no understanding of how
            to put her instincts to use in effective or even self-protective
            ways. Rather, she tends to flail and rage, landing punches and
            threatening her classmates. The threat she poses is not so
            frightening, however, as the other girls are moving on to boys and
            make-up concerns, and tend to exclude her altogether rather than
            take her seriously. In high school, girls are not so worried about
            turf or fighting skills as they might have been back when they were
            kids. This means that Diana is classified -- by father, counselor,
            and peers -- as deviant, even pathological. Life at her inner city
            school involves dealing with teachers who have long ago become bored
            and disillusioned with their work, and students who see no
            possibility for change in their futures, and so, scrabble for small
            stakes, their immediate reputations and abilities to sneer at
            others.</b> <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Blazing
            with passion, anger, and desire, without obvious options or outlets,
            Diana is drifting -- or more accurately, slamming up against locker
            doors and bathroom walls -- until one night Sancho sends her to
            retrieve Tiny from the gym. Here, in this dimly lit and sweat-smelly
            space, Diana, whose emotional complexities are stunningly embodied
            by newcomer Rodriguez, finds structure and focus. Here, she finds a
            way to express her fury and, eventually, be rewarded and admired for
            it. As you might imagine, the road to this respect is hardly easy
            for a girl. And this is the strength of Karyn Kusama's debut
            feature, that it takes you along this road with Diana slowly and
            carefully, showing you her body -- her inarticulate excellence, her
            recovered hope, her rough faith in herself -- as she builds it, with
            bruises and setbacks along the way. <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">One
            early supporter in this process is Tiny's trainer Hector (Jaime
            Tirelli), who agrees to train Diana, as long as she pays the regular
            fees (which she does by stealing from her father, and then by using
            Tiny's fee money, as he's glad to give up boxing) and dedicates
            herself to the art. Hector is a second father for Diana, one who is
            not opprobrious but encouraging. <i>Girlfight</i> juxtaposes scenes
            at home where Diana faces off with Sandro (one of these is
            especially alarming, as she beats him back for the first time) and
            scenes at the gym, where Hector intently cultivates her talent and
            drive. If this were a more standard boy's story, the images showing
            Diana's development as a boxer might not seem so powerful: you've
            seen any number of male boxers training, hurling punches at heavy
            bags, jumping rope, putting in their mouth-guards before launching
            themselves from their corners. And you've seen male boxers in actual
            matches, lurching forward or dancing back in slow motion, blood
            spurting and perspiration spraying, light glinting off their damp
            arms and casting shadows across their swelling eyes. But all these
            familiar images look different when you see a girl &quot;in
            action.&quot; Initially tentative, as everyone has always told her
            not to fight, Diana evolves into a hard-bodied fighter, practicing
            on the punching bag, running and doing push-ups, and eventually
            taking on her sparring partners with real eagerness. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Diana's
            primary partner -- in multiple senses -- is Adrian (Santiago
            Douglas), a gifted boxer and very pretty young man who catches her
            eye early in the film. She watches from across the gym as Adrian
            trains, and then again as his beautiful girlfriend comes by to kiss
            him across the ropes. Ping! This romantic plotline complicates
            Diana's development, and for the most part, works well enough.
            Without a woman in her life save for the high school counselor who
            shows up only for that early &quot;you have to behave&quot; scene,
            Diana takes older men as her only models: her father, Hector, and
            her teacher (John Sayles) all offer her prescriptions by way of
            counterexamples (as compassionate and strong as Hector is, he tells
            her straight-up, that he's working in this dingy gym because he did
            what most fighters do: he lost). Adrian is a new wrinkle in her
            understanding of men, someone for whom she feels sexual desire but
            also someone with whom she competes, someone she wants to have and
            someone she wants to be. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Though
            such complex desires often come up in boxing movies (or most other
            male homosocial community movies), they can rarely be voiced or
            acted on. With a girl fighting a boy, the representation of the
            innate intimacy of boxing is less anxious-making. And <i>Girlfight</i>
            makes the most of this opportunity, eventually to its detriment. The
            early scenes where Diana and Adrian spar create a smart mix of
            violence and romance, agitation and longing: pressed up against him
            in the ring, Diana says what she's unable to say outside it, &quot;I
            love you. I really do.&quot; Such expression of sentiment is
            entirely inappropriate, of course, and it underlines Diana's out-of-placeness
            in this new culture (boxing) and also her near-instinctual
            understanding of what's at stake in it. Boxing is about intimacy and
            love, at some level. Certainly, the sport's familiar f*ck-you
            posturing has to do with maintaining a victor's aggression and
            survivalist drive, but it also obscures (at least on the surface)
            the necessary mutual admiration, desire, eroticism, and a love of
            bodies that undergirds boxing, as a concept, a social order, and a
            culturally condoned manifestation of masculine violence. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still,
            the climactic plot point that depends on Diana and Adrian's
            competition is plainly weak: because some fighters have too
            conveniently dropped out of a championship bout, Diana must box
            Adrian. Even aside from the trumped-upness of the romantic partners
            punching each other, the question of how she's progressed so quickly
            to be on his level is not answered. But if this circumstance makes
            no narrative sense, it does make visual, metaphorical, and emotional
            sense. The last fight scene -- shot in conventional slow motion --
            makes clear what is going on here: it is, as Kusama describes it, a
            &quot;love scene.&quot; And because of that, it is remarkably honest
            about boxing, its mediations of class and race in a racist and
            classist culture, its celebration of violence in a culture that
            pretends to abhor it, and perhaps most importantly, its
            possibilities for making and comprehending identities in a culture
            that would deny them to exactly these characters.</font></span></p>
