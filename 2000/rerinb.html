is it about a picture of Julia Roberts with a baby on her hip that seems so
irresistible? This would be, of course, one of the images that's become so
instantly familiar through its heavy use to promote her new movie, <i>Erin
Brockovich. </i>Consider, just for a minute, the implications of such a
campaign, what it suggests about the U.S. culture's changing attitudes toward
single working-class moms, or more likely, what it suggests about unchanging
attitudes toward fave-fantasy girl Julia Roberts. </font><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">In
the film, Roberts plays the titular, true-story-based Erin, single mother of
three precious children (the eight- and six-year-olds played by Scotty
Leavenworth and Gemmenne De la Pena), barely scraping by at something like
subsistence level (unpaid bills are primary features in the film's set design).
Some ten minutes pass before she starts living with her smalltown California
neighbor, an extremely pleasant Harley Davidson biker named George (Aaron
Eckhart). He has a rather cavalier outlook on work, preferring to do so just
long enough to make the cash necessary to live comfortably for a while. Soon,
he's staying home with the kids while Erin is working at her new job, Xeroxing
and filing for a local attorney, Ed Masry (Albert Finney). As she angrily
proclaims at one point, Erin has &quot;no brains or legal expertise,&quot; but
rather, as the movie makes clear in repeated scenes where she butts up against
someone's prejudice, a rural version of street-smarts and a lot of nerve, not to
mention Julia Roberts' extraordinary smile and body. The movie spends a lot of
time looking at and asking you to look at this body, as she wears tight,
short-skirted, cleavage-enhancing costumes that are supposed to indicate her
bold, crass, low-class taste (Masry chastises her that her outfits make
&quot;the girls&quot; in the office &quot;uncomfortable&quot;), but end up
making most all the men who share scenes with her look silly and/or lascivious. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Then
again, maybe these are the same effects after all. For <i>Erin Brockovich </i>does
have a certain class consciousness and politics, however rudimentary and
filtered through gender politics. Erin has to earn her right to pursue a civil
case involving some 600 locals (whose chief spokespeople, at least in relation
to Erin, are women) afflicted by toxins (a gene-damaging form of chromium)
knowingly loosed on the environment by the Evil Billion Dollar Utility Company,
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric. And pursue it she does, pulling together evidence
from badly concealed records, gathering signatures from diseased and distrustful
victims, and all the while sassing her boss and any other fellow who sees fit to
give her a hard time for being a &quot;bimbo.&quot;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Screenwriter
Susannah Grant (<i>Pocahontas </i>and <i>Ever After</i>) clearly has an affinity
for stories about strong women, no matter how convoluted the route to anyone
else recognizing -- much less appreciating -- this strength. Like Grant's
previous scripts, <i>Erin Brockovich </i>(which underwent reported but
uncredited touch-ups by Richard [<i>Bridges of Madison County</i>] LaGravenese)
appears to respect its spunky protagonist but does not omit how unnerving and
imperfect she can be. This imperfection is registered in predictable ways: Erin
is occasionally overzealous about her job; in particular, she misses the baby's
first word but is duly punished when George tells her about it over the
cellphone and she cries alone in her car on the way home from a long day
&quot;getting signatures.&quot; She can also be thoughtless, as when, angry at
George, she calls him out for not having a job; he responds by losing his
until-then incessant patience. She can also be sloppy, silly, cute, annoying,
all shaping Erin as the Hollywood incarnation of the Admirable Underclass. She's
never so dreadful or &quot;other&quot; that middle-class audience members
wouldn't recognize themselves in her. Remember Michelle Pfeiffer in <i>Frankie
and Johnny, </i>how ridiculously unresilient she looked in her waitress uniform?
Erin is no more believable, despite the fact that she allows for what is,
probably, Julia Roberts' most nuanced performance as Julia Roberts (she always
plays Julia Roberts, which is fine: that's what she's paid for). The problem
with all this difficult-Erinness is that it tends to be framed as Drama or
Comedy, all-important, all the time (and at nearly two-and-a-half hours, there's
a lot of time). The film, which is, in its way, efficient, never really has
downtime. Every scene tells you something special about the irascible, adorable,
always fabulous Erin.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Meanwhile,
the secondary characters all serve as props for developing Erin. Even that great
scene-chewer Finney has to get out of her way, playing fatigued straight man to
her quips about boobs and awkward obstacle to her teary protests or moralistic
speeches. George is the unusual male character, certainly, in that the initially
happy couple share her bed, then he watches as she acts out her former
beauty-queen activities and even dons her tiara for a little androgyny humor.
He's such a nice guy, and so visibly &quot;better&quot; with her kids than she
is (at least in the scenes that the film chooses to show, which privilege his
smoothing over and her rushing and worrying, that you might be tempted to wonder
what the movie poster would look like if Aaron Eckhart were holding that baby on
his hip. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
line up of damaged women include a tearful Donna (Marg Helgenberger, looking
slightly less guilty than she did as Patsy Ramsey in CBS's execrable <i>Perfect
Murder, Perfect Town</i>), Mandy (Meredith Zinner), and Laura (Mimi Kennedy).
They rally round Erin pretty much on cue, with the expected hold-outs to keep
some tension in the repetitive business of gathering signatures. The
other-than-Ed-and-George speaking males in the film are PG&amp;E employee
Charles Embry (Tracey Walter), creepy in his mousiness, if not exactly
threatening (which is, after all, what Tracey Walter -- <i>Repo Man's </i>&quot;plate
of shrimp&quot; mystic -- does best), and Kurt Potter (Peter Coyote), the
arrogant corporate lawyer whom Masry brings in late in the deal, afraid that he
and Erin don't have what it takes to go head to head with the expensively-suited
PG&amp;E legal staff.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Potter
and Theresa Dallavale (Veanne Cox), his snooty lady lawyer associate (Erin's
opposite in every possible way) provide the film's most visibly embodied
resistance to Erin, and as such, they represent an interesting tack. Because
this case never actually went to court, but settled for some $333 million for
the plaintiffs, the film doesn't go the way of John Travolta's bloated and
deeply shadowed courtroom drama, <i>A Civil Action. </i>Instead, <i>Erin
Brockovich </i>stays focused on its supposed class antagonism, no matter which
side the lawyers seem to be on. The only time any of the lawyers get too upscale
for the clients to comprehend them, is when Potter takes over the case,
temporarily alienates the &quot;people,&quot; and Erin has to regain their trust
by visiting each and every one of them (this leads to more repetition of the
&quot;Erin driving to see folks&quot; images). The PG&amp;E lawyers barely
register, only showing up to huff and puff as they're outsmarted by this podunk
ambulance-chasing firm -- and particularly by Erin's crude wit -- repeatedly.
This class-gender distinction is the movie's most self-righteous point, but it's
too unsubtle to be convincing: Erin is Julia Roberts, she can't help it.
Unfortunately, the film also sets up what seems to be a rather unthinking
class-race axis of distinction, between Erin and the black and Latina women who
work in Ed's office with her: they clearly think she's full of herself (and her
much-mentioned boobs) and the movie uses their disapproval as a kind of low-key
comedy, generally at their expense, since Erin is so, you know, fabulous.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Everyone
knows that everyone loves Julia Roberts, so this movie's veneration hardly seems
unusual or unexpected. There are two changes in the successful Julia Roberts
formula here: first, it's directed by an infamously independent filmmaker Steven
Soderbergh, who seems here to have mastered the straight-ahead mainstream
narrative, and second, it makes Roberts a mother. Soderbergh's previous work is
notably provocative and offbeat -- <i>sex lies and videotape, Kafka, </i>and <i>The
Limey </i>might be considered somewhat perverse by Hollywood standards, and even
the George Clooney-Jennifer Lopez caper, <i>Out of Sight, </i>his biggest
moneymaker to date, has a somewhat nonlinear structure. With <i>Erin Brockovich </i>the
writer-director appears to go for the most orthodox format, a reductive,
crowd-rousing little-guy-against-the-big-bad-system story that leaves out
complications and anything resembling perversity. The route is strictly
standard, from its pretty movie star to its heartwarming storyline, and
Soderbergh's handling of it is appropriately straight-ahead (despite its
apparent theme song, Sheryl Crow's &quot;Every Day is a Winding Road&quot;).<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Which
brings us back to the Julia Roberts as mom gimmick. Surely, if Cindy Crawford
and Madonna can do it in real life, Julia can manage it on screen. But there's
something a little precious about the $20 million woman posing with babies as a
sign of her character's working-class realness. Of course, the promotions folks
have made sure that Julia fans aren't overdosed on such &quot;gritty&quot;
imagery, but instead appeased with follow-up glam portraits gracing the covers
of <i>Bazaar, People, Vanity Fair, </i>and <i>Redbook </i>(how brilliant is her
agent, getting these quality, high exposure mags, not even so pedestrian as
Madonna on <i>Good Housekeeping?</i>). Julia Roberts -- with and without
baby-on-her-hip -- can do no wrong this month.<o:p>
