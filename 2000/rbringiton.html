            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In
            case you didn’t get a bodacious fill of summer cheerleaders and
            bare midriffs in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Replacements</i>, here’s a spunky, empty-headed Southern
            California teen-angst rah-rah competition comedy. Nothing ventured,
            nothing gained after you’ve put ninety-eight minutes of your time
            on the back-burner watching some pretty young thangs strut their
            brightly-lit, PG-13 wares. Basically devoid of any parental units
            (dorks all anyway; no cheerleader-murdering, hitman-hiring moms from
            Texas), the film stars eighteen-year-old Kirsten Dunst as
            bright-eyed senior Torrance Shipman, the eternally optimistic leader
            of a nationally renown post-pubescent pom pom squad at Rancho Carne
            High School. (Homework: do the Spanish-to-English translation.) The
            fresh-faced Dunst is a good fit as the overly ambitious captain of
            mostly determined and some duplicitous cads and cadettes, balancing
            her championship stunt team as it hurdles toward a sixth straight
            U.S. amateur championship. She never drops the baton rallying her
            troops, but the role doesn’t hold a torch to her darker and more
            enjoyable characterizations as the Washington, DC, nitwit that
            brought down the Nixon administration (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Dick)</i>
            or the Midwestern dairy queen caught up in a murderously funny
            beauty contest (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Drop Dead
            Gorgeous</i>). The film’s weak script, the first by Jessica
            Bendinger, formerly a hip hop reporter for <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Spin</i>
            <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Magazine</i>, fumbles as much
            as the school’s dreadfully bad football team does in a
            victory-less season. Seems the fans couldn’t care less that the
            jocks are at the bad end of a 42-0 routing; they’re out to see
            some serious cheerleading!<o:p>

            tarnished when their former leader’s prize-winning routines are
            revealed as less than original. The unit’s glamorous pom poms wilt
            into a big ugly wrench. Only some quick thinking and
            less-than-honorable intentions gets the youngsters a trip to
            Daytona, Florida for the ESPN2 televised nationals, only to further
            embarrass themselves against a previously-snuffed group of energetic
            cheerleaders from the black L.A. suburb of East Compton. As
            expected, Torrance gives a rehashed Pattonesque Knute Rockne
            half-time speech. Miraculously her flustered group wipes the egg of
            its collective face and paints a rainbow-fresh ending that’s
            supposed to make up for the mess they’ve made. Gee, we’re sorry.
            Gosh, thanks.<o:p>

normal">Bring It On</i>, his minor-league theatrical feature debut, will be
            forgotten as soon as the school year begins. The grade school
            flashbacks, pompous urban legends, and bikini carwash and barf
            sequences don’t cut it. There’s a heapful of slo-mo shtick about
            dropped spirit sticks and other dreamlike fantasies that supposedly
            reveals the demands and pressures of the sport. For the most part,
            the humor just isn’t there. The cast tries to make up for the
            deficiencies of the writer and director. Eliza Dushku, who stars as
            Faith in the WB series <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Buffy
            the Vampire Slayer</i> and was featured as the resourceful daughter
            of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jamie Lee Curtis in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">True
            Lies</i>, has blossomed into a fine actress. Her Missy Pantone is an
            ugly duckling Los Angeles transfer anti-student making a last minute
            tryout as a replacement for an injured “player.” When she
            impresses smiley face Torrance with her gymnastic abilities, the
            &quot;cheertator&quot; (not my invention) takes on the challenge of
            changing the new recruit’s scraggy wet hair look into the
            perfectly preppy perky teen dream. Jesse Bradford is Missy’s retro
            reject brother Cliff, a vintage dude immersed in 1970s British punk
            bands. He’s more interested in reading <i>The Naked Ape</i>—in
            the bleachers during the football game—until his attentions become
            much more earnest. Yup, those serious cheerleading gals. He’s got
            a crush on Torrance.<o:p>

            Union scores well in her few appearances as Isis, Torrance’s
            counterpart for the The East Compton Clovers, the rival squad that
            has a hard time accepting the olive branch extended by the San Diego
            cheer thieves. The trio of Natina Reed, Shamari Fears, and Brandi
            Williams, who comprise the music group Blaque, hold their defiant
            heads high in their feature debut supporting Union.<o:p>

            flatulent and hilarious contribution as Torrance’s little brother
            from Hell, Justin. Flipping the coin, Richard Hillman makes no
