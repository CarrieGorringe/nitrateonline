            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 15 September 2000</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>It's definite: Keanu Reeves
            gives the worst performance of the year in <i>The Watcher</i>.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Not that I have anything in
            particular against Reeves (who can be fine when he's in the right
            part) or change-of-pace roles (Robert Walker did fine playing
            against-type in <i>Strangers on a Train</i>). Here, one of the most
            recognizable movie stars in the world is cast as a notorious serial
            killer whom everyone is looking for but nobody has a description of.
            Thus he is able to saunter right past the investigator (James Spader)
            whose life he has destroyed but who continues to search for him
            anyway, then call him up at home and taunt him about what latest bit
            of mayhem he is about to dish out. Unfortunately, devilish cantering
            and irony are not in Reeves' repertoire, and the words fall leadenly
            from his lips, as if he were in an enunciation class. I can't think
            of any other performance coming close to being this grossly
            unconvincing, but there's still room for doubt.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The rest of the movie isn't so hot,
            either. We're back poking around in the same dark, dank,
            lifelessly-colored rooms and alleyways that appeared in <i>Seven</i>
            and, subsequently, <i>8 mm</i>. and <i>The Bone Collector</i>, and
            the movie doesn't so much let its story unfold as slowly grind it
            out. Information is deliberately, and pointlessly, withheld from us
            (we don't even find out that Spader's character is an F.B.I. agent
            until over two-thirds of the way in), and the movie fidgets
            back-and-forth between various visual styles in a way that becomes
            tiresome rather than edifying. When the hero and villain finally
            meet face-to-face, the film doesn't know what to do, so it stalls
            some more until it can finally come up with some whammo-blammo (It
            would have been better if the two had a passing, but meaningful,
            encounter at the end).</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As the investigator driven to save
            people over and over again in order to make up for one big mistake,
            James Spader gives more insight and nuance to his character than
            most actors would probably dream of coming up with. When he tells
            his psychiatrist (Marisa Tomei) what he has to take and inject each
            day in order to get his body to work the way it's supposed to, he
            seems to carry the weight of the world in his eyes, but he does so
            in a way which makes us able to look at it and comprehend. His
            performance deserves to be in a better movie.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
