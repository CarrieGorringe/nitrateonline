</font><i><font face="Verdana" size="1">By <a href="../eddie.html" target="_top">Eddie
Cockrell</a>, 14 July 2000</font></i></p>


<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The Brazilian drama <i>Me You Them</i> (<i>Eu
tu eles</i>) walked away with the newly-designed Grand Prix Crystal Globe this
evening (15 July), as the 35<sup>th</sup> edition of the revamped and
re-energized Karlovy Vary International Film Festival (<a href="http://www.iffkv.cv/" target="_top">http://www.iffkv.cv</a>)
drew to a close in this picturesque Bohemian spa town (home of the exquisite
herbal liqueur Becherovka) nestled in the rolling hills some two hours west of
Prague. The festival opened on a note of lusty provocation 05 July, as a quintet
of neon-wigged nude women took to the stage of the main theater to act out the
theme of the fest, which seems to involve inspiration and guidance from above
via swooping globes of light (as fest-goers were constantly reminded in a
trailer that preceded each and every presentation). Subsequent to this, however,
the vast majority of participants appeared to remain clothed for most festival
events.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Framed on either side of the charming downtown
by the festival center Hotel Thermal, where most of the major screenings took
place, and the ornate, infinitely more plush Grand Hotel Pupp, the main drag
features the twelve life-giving springs that have drawn patients and tourists
for six centuries (it is customary to drink from the hot tap prescribed to you
by a doctor from specially-designed porcelain cups which are favorite souvenirs,
along with pancakes, stone roses and, of course, Becherovka -- the so-called "thirteenth
spring"). For the ten days of the festival, expanded from eight for the very
first time, the town is overrun by guests, journalists and especially students
(9,100 participants total, up some fifty per cent from 1999), who throng here by
the literal thousands and camp out where they drop when they’re not lining up
for cherished tickets or hanging out between the Thermal and the Tepla river
listening to the diverse procession of bands who plug in and fire up every
afternoon. Although chilly and rainy for most of its duration, the 2000 edition
of the festival maintained a propulsive energy that extends far into the night,
as the very first spa in town, long empty, was refitted as the Villa Premiere
and hosted massive multi-floor parties that rarely broke up before dawn.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s that easy to be distracted from the
business at hand.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Back to the films for a moment: led by
internationally revered Iranian director Abbas Kiarostami, the international
jury (see below) bestowed a joint Special Jury prize on Polish
actor/writer/director Jerzy Stuhr’s charmer <i>The Big Animal</i> (Duze
zwierze) and Lee Chang-Dong’s Korean entry <i>Peppermint Candy</i> (Bakha
sating). The Best Director award went to Croat filmmaker Vinko Bresan for <i>Marshal
Tito’s Spirit</i> (<i>Marsal</i>), with Special Jury Mentions handed to
Bernard Rapp’s French entry <i>A Matter of Taste</i> (<i>Une affaire de gout</i>)
and Fridrik Thor Fridriksson’s <i>Angels of the Universe</i> (<i>Englar
alheimsins</i>), a co-production of Iceland, Norway, Sweden, Germany and
Denmark.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Regina Case won the Best Actress prize for <i>Me
You Them</i>, while the Best Actor award was split by two supporting
performances, Ian Hart for the Norwegian-British opening night drama <i>Aberdeen</i>,
and Hamid Farokhnezad for the Iranian entry <i>The Bride of Fire</i> (<i>Arous-E
Atash</i>). The audience favorite was Alan Parker’s <i>Angela’s Ashes</i>,
and special career awards were handed out to Spain’s Carlos Saura (who was on
hand to present his newest work, <i>Goya in Bordeaux</i>), Hungary’s Karoly
Makk, and hometown favorite Vera Chytilova.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Of the numerous other special and jury awards,
a standout was the Philip Morris Freedom Award, chaired by the American Cinema
Foundation’s Executive Director, Gary McVey. This year, the jury awarded
US$5,000 to director Yaver Rzayev’s poetic Azerbaijan film <i>Yellow Bride</i>
(<i>Sari gyalin</i>).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yet as with most competitive festivals, the
awards may soak up most of the light, but there’s a lot of heat elsewhere on
any given day. This year, the festival was divided into the following sections
beyond the competition: Horizons (weighted with higher profile but older
American titles), the more internationally-themed Horizons-- Award Winning
Films, the edgier Another View, East of the West, Forum of Independents, Variety
Critics’ Choice (sponsored and curated by the trade paper) and Czech Films
1999-2000. In all, there were 535 separate showings of some 293 films, with a
torrid sell-out pace of 305 shows through the first eight days. Only the venues
leave something to be desired, as conference halls and meeting rooms with no
business hosting screenings are pressed into service alongside more conventional
spaces (this and parking are the town’s two major problems, the avuncular
mayor said over Becherovka -- what else? -- during one particularly crowded
reception).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The president and dashing authority figure of
the festival is acclaimed Czech actor Jiri Bartoska, while programming chores
have been managed once again by Eva Zaoralova. While the public face of the
festival comes across as a bit arrogant at times (the opening night assertion
that they’re on par with Berlin remains a bit of a stretch), there’s no
question that on their watch the program has taken steps towards the
international savvy, influence and edginess to which they aspire.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Freed of previous attempts at a business
component such as a market or producers’ sidebar, the festival could
concentrate on enticing actors and actresses to fly in for a few days (usually
from a set close by) to introduce their work and preside over the de rigeur
post-screening press conference. International stars who did make the trek
mingled virtually unnoticed with other moviegoers. Thus, Julian Sands
(presenting Mike Figgis’ <i>The Loss of Sexual Innocence</i>) could be seen
chatting with backpacking students (a practice he encouraged), competitive entry
<i>Nora </i>co-star Susan Lynch was a regular at Hell, the low-ceilinged
Socialist-era nightclub underneath the Thermal, and such living legends of Czech
film as Ivan Passer (whose landmark 1965 drama <i>Intimate Lighting</i> is due
to be reissued on videocassette in the United States this summer) or
cinematographer Miroslav Ondricek (<i>Amadeus</i>) were more than likely to be
impromptu dinner companions at one reception or another.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Other notable attendees included the immensely
popular Woody Harrelson (for the second year in a row, this time to introduce a
Canadian documentary on smoking materials he narrated called <i>Grass</i>), Eli
Wallach, Alicia Silverstone, Franco Nero, Edward Norton, Albert and Allen Hughes
(in Prague making that Jack the Ripper movie <i>From Hell</i> with Johnny Depp,
who was a no-show) and Dan Hedaya, who presented that new print of the Coen
Brothers’ <i>Blood Simple</i> and commented on how pleased he was to be in "Czechoslovakia."</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That identity problem is something the
festival’s working hard to overcome, as Karlovy Vary as it stands today is the
best foot forward in the international film world the Czech Republic could ask
for.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
