How did you put together Homeboy's Production &amp; Advertising? <o:p>

<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>OJ:

To be honest, I just didn't want to say, &quot;Thank you,&quot;
&quot;Please,&quot; and &quot;Come again&quot; for the rest of my life. I felt
like if I wanted to do this -- films and TV -- I didn't have the expectation
that someone else would write for me. So I started writing for myself. And for
the most part, I lied. I went to every ad agency I could find in North Carolina,
South Carolina, and Georgia, no appointment. I had a rough reel of commercials
and other stuff I had done, and said, &quot;I want to do your comedy
commercials: just give me a shot.&quot; Finally, somebody did. That's how I
found myself in the advertising world, with my partner. I was trying to get a
tape of me doing something that I thought was funny. <o:p>
</o:p>

You always knew you wanted to do comedy? <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>OJ:
</i></b>
I knew that [comedy] was what people seemed to respond to. Drama wasn't really a
road I considered going down. I did do some plays -- <i>Othello</i>, <i>A
Midsummer Night's Dream</i>, a Samm-Art Williams play called <i>Home</i>, and <i>Museum</i>.
But even if someone would say, &quot;Oh, you were great!&quot; doing <i>Othello</i>
never gave anyone an indication that I could do a contemporary lead. Still, the
irony that Amos and Andy were Shakespearean trained actors wasn't lost on me.
Comedy just seemed like the way in. Someone I met years ago explained to me the
difference between a personality and an actor, a personality being Eddie Murphy
or Roseanne Barr, and an actor being Morgan Freeman and Alfre Woodard or Marlon
Brando. And in the shrinking world of sound bites, the internet, and other mass
media, there were going to be fewer actors and more personalities. When he said
that to me when I was twenty years old, and I don't think I fully understood
what he meant. But I've never forgotten that conversation, and understand it
more and more. <o:p>

It's not an unusual route. I think of Charles Stone's &quot;whassup&quot;
commercial, getting him all kinds of notice, and now he's directing a feature. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>OJ:
</i></b>
Right, and ironically, that commercial was originally a short film, <i>True</i>.
Now the transition from the commercial world to the directing world seems like a
cleaner transition than I previously knew. There are so many guys who started in
commercials and get a shot at features. But you have to be careful there too. If
he does a feature and it's not successful, he'll be struggling to get another
gig. In this world, you need to do something that's artistically interesting <i>and</i>
commercially viable. <o:p>

That sounds like the lesson of Hype Williams, who's so obviously brilliant, but <i>Belly</i>
-- which I actually liked -- did so poorly. <o:p>
</o:p></font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>OJ:

<i>Belly</i> was not a bad movie. It was visually very interesting. And I'm a
fan of Hype's, I want to work with him. But he needed a strong producer. People
can forget what an incredibly important part the business plays in [relation to]
the creative side. You can't pretend that the business is something you can't be
bothered with. They kind of threw Hype to the wolves. I think he was done a
disservice. And that situation is something I'm <i>extremely</i> aware of. <o:p>

I'll be honest with you: I think the movie came out well. People like it. But,
after four-and-a- half years of writing and producing television shows, two
years on <i>Mad TV</i>, then a series of small and independent films -- <i>Sour
Grapes</i>, <i>Waterproof</i>, <i>The Hangman's Daughter</i>, <i>New Jersey
Turnpike</i>, <i>Office Space</i>, <i>Liberty Heights</i>, <i>Magnolia</i>, <i>Chain
of Fools</i> -- now, <i>The Replacements</i>, and I'm an overnight success. The
other ten movies before I got to this one are not at all lost on me. And
stranger still, in the middle of all that, 7-Up, something I really didn't want
to do at all. I walked in thinking, &quot;I have ten movies under my belt and
now they want me to go back to making commercials?&quot; I said, &quot;If I do
that, I want it to be funny&quot;. Quite honestly, I didn't think the deal was
going to make, because I wanted part of the creative control. I was impressed
that they were making an offer to a non-athletic young black male to be a
spokesperson for two-and-a-half years. To their credit, they said,
&quot;Absolutely, yes&quot;. They never questioned anything I wanted to do. It
was a blessed experience for me. <o:p>

That was a chance to work Gene Hackman and Keanu, in his next movie after <i>The
Matrix</i>. I didn't know what kind of impact the 7-Up campaign was going to
have. And really, with <i>The Replacements</i>, I was not making just a
feel-good movie. I did <i>not</i> want to be the Funny Black Dude, and I was
very vocal about that. You need to buy that I'm Clifford Franklin. You need to
believe that I'm this black kid who just got into the NFL and is completely
enamored with it. I was very concerned about being too broad, and that &quot;I
Will Survive&quot; thing. No one in the cast wanted to do that. We all thought,
&quot;We're football players: why are we in jail singing a Gloria Gaynor
song?&quot; I understood that resistance but I also understood that it was the
bonding scene. I thought the only that could work is if I was willing to lampoon
myself and then people join into the ridiculousness of the moment. In the end, I
love the movie, and I appreciate that there are five black men in a movie who
don't kill anybody. This is something for my nine- and ten-year-old nieces to
see. <o:p>

How did your television experience shape your perspective on the business? <o:p>

<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>OJ:

I was the guy who had to deal with some nightmare situations, where people's
perspectives were twisted. I had to realize, &quot;This has nothing to do with
you.&quot; It also became clear to me that no matter if the toilet in my
bathroom was broken, or if I had the flu the day before, I had to get the job
done. At the end of the day, I was supposed to be funny in a comedic role.
People aren't going to say, &quot;Oh, he was probably sick.&quot; They're going
to say, &quot;He ain't funny.&quot; And that's what they should say, because
they pay money to see me. I also learned how to pick scripts. I have the long
term in mind. I want to have a Bob Hope Seventy-Fifth Anniversary Special, and I
don't know a lot of black guys who do that. Bill Cosby may be the first. For me,
this is a career. I'm not trying to do this for two or three or seven or eight
years. <o:p>

Why do you think it's so hard for some performers to move between comedy and
drama?<o:p>

Comedy is acting. If Eddie Murphy wanted to work with Martin Scorsese, they
could put that together. It may not be in Eddie's interest to do it, but
something like that would be in <i>my</i> interest. What we're ultimately doing
is telling stories, be they comedic or dramatic. My grandfather was telling me
stories about his life growing up, and I was fascinated. But I'd also be
cracking up at the stories of him and his buddies. To tell a great story, that's
really what I want to do. That's why I'm not a stand-up, more a comedic actor.<o:p>

What do you make of the NAACP's actions on racism on TV?<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>OJ:
</i></b>
I'm of two minds about the NAACP, I'll be brutally honest. When I was writing
for <i>Sinbad</i> and <i>Roc Live</i>, I remember the pilot for <i>Martin</i>
coming on, and a year later, the NAACP giving him an Image Award. A few years
later, Martin was under fire for being &quot;coonish&quot; or whatever the word
was people were using. And I thought that was the most ridiculous thing I'd ever
heard. You give the guy an Image Award three years in a row and then turn on him
like that? If that's the role they want to fulfill, they need to send a clearer
message. I want balance. I want to see as many black professionals as possible.
I don't care if a guy plays a wild, broad, completely downtrodden character, but
I also want to see an average Joe; the middle class has been completely
underrepresented. And it's not just about minorities. What about balance in
representing women? Where's the girl who looks average, or the not so funny
girl? Asians, Latinos, whoever: people are just looking for images of
themselves. I'm from South Carolina, and it was always preached to me, there
ain't nothing wrong with being a car mechanic. People need them. I think the
role model message is lost on deaf ears. Find someone in your community who is
accessible to you. There's only one Eddie Murphy, only one Michael Jordan. So
unless you're poised to be that other <i>one</i>, there's not a lot of advice he
can give you. A multimillionaire superstar is not a useful role model for
someone who wants to be a chef. Look up to him, but find someone closer for a
model. <o:p>

There's so much pressure, for anyone who's not a straight white guy, to
represent.<o:p>

We're damn near in 2001, and it's one of the more subtle racist things that
persists. Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, Colin Powell are not in any way, shape, or
form my leaders. They speak for themselves. We are not a monolithic culture.
Black leadership exists in the home, in a nuclear family or in your mom. I know
on some level, I'm still going to have to be responsible for it, but I know what
it is. I knew the price of the ticket when I got in.</font></font></span></p>
