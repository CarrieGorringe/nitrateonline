            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            her description of the state of the planet circa 2019 suggests, the
            protagonist of Fox's <i>Dark Angel</i> has attitude to spare. But
            judging by the $10 million, two-hour premiere of James Cameron's
            much-advertised teen-SF-thriller series, the girl is entitled.
            Living in the post-apocalyptic future, Max Guevera (Jessica Alba) is
            a nineteen-year-old, genetically engineered warrior-child with a bar
            code on the back of her neck. She escaped from the company that made
            her -- a company named Manticore -- back in 2009, when she was nine
            years old (and played by big-eyed, crew-cut Geneva Locke). At the
            time you meet her, the independent-minded, &quot;totally down-ass
            female&quot; Seattle bicycle courier is looking for the other eleven
            kids with whom she fled, that long-ago wintry night. In order to lay
            out all this info and jumpstart your sympathy for Max, the show
            breaks it down in frequent, icy-blue-lit flashbacks with music
            pounding and fast-cuts to convey, you know, the pain and the
            tension. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Pain
            and tension come up again and again on <i>Dark Angel</i>, not to
            indicate Max's strangeness or deviance, But, instead, her fairly
            typical adolescence. Cynical, resentful, and hyper-self-aware, she's
            the urban rendition of Buffy the vampire slayer, a bit less focused
            (there are no ancient rules, missions, or Watchers for &quot;transgenics&quot;)
            and less worried about parental disapproval or chem exams (she has
            neither) than paying off the neighborhood crooked cop, so he'll
            overlook her squatting in an abandoned building. Max extols her
            concerns in repeated voice-overs, usually uttered as she's riding
            her bike through the city streets (under a hiphop-beating
            soundtrack) or gazing from a rooftop over a city that looks spooky
            and dark. As the wind gently blows her hair, she looks, well,
            angelic. It's at one of these moments that Max observes, so
            bitterly, &quot;Hopes are for losers,&quot; then waits a beat before
            adding, so poignantly, that she has some, namely, that some of her
            fellow transgenics -- technically, &quot;chimeras&quot; -- are alive
            somewhere. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">No
            surprise that this gorgeous, Benetton-beige-ish <i>Maxim</i> cover
            girl has a tender heart and deep passion. Like all the hard girls in
            Cameron's universe, Max has a drive to survive born of terrible
            loss. She's also teen-TV-genic, too young to be Linda-Hamilton
            sinewy and always done up in perfectly applied lipstick and
            carefully tousled hair. Where Ripley and Sarah Conner were very
            motivated moms/mom-figures, Max is still a kid. She's a pre-fab
            Sarah Connerette, a gene-spliced cross of soldier-kids Sarah's John
            and Ripley's Newt, by way of <i>Aliens'</i> bug-hunting Vasquez
            (Jeanette Goldstein), <i>Point Break's</i> ferocious Tyler (Lori
            Petty), and <i>Strange Days'</i> world-saving Mace (Angela Bassett)
            -- these last two being films Cameron wrote with director Kathryn
            Bigelow. Of course, Max has <b><i>many</i></b> other obvious
            precursors (Cameron is, as ever, a superb scavenger, of his own and
            other materials): Buffy Summers, Jaime Sommers, Mad Max, the hero
            (named Hiro) who delivers pizzas in Neal Stephenson's amazing novel <i>Snowcrash</i>,
            the Fugitive (pick your incarnation), Max Headroom, M.A.N.T.I.S.
            (from the short-lived, ambitious 1994 TV series in which Carl Lumbly
            was a superhero who'd been paralyzed by a cop's bullet during the
            1992 LA uprising), any version of the Femme Nikitas, Cat People, the
            traumatized-as-a-child Pretender, the teen-aliens in the WB's <i>Roswell</i>,
            even a little <i>Ghost Dog</i>. But Mace is especially relevant
            here, for her particularity in history -- a single black mother
            living in a near-future LA, carrying history on her capable and
            well-muscled single mom shoulders, and -- not incidentally --
            instructing poor love-sucked white guy Lenny Nero in the importance
            of respecting people and distrusting cops, and most crucially, in
            the significance of hiphop as a means to communicate and even create
            history. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Max
            is a stripped-down descendent of Mace, fiercely loyal to her friends
            but even fiercer about defending her principles. She has a
            sensitivity to media, respect for communication and agency, not to
            mention a series theme song by Chuck D. Her beige-ish-ness is
            relevant here as well: Alba is on record as being
            Spanish-Mexican-French-Danish, but more to the point, Max Guevera is
            a non-white-girl starring in a world where the people in power are
            still overwhelmingly Caucasian (in particular, the primary
            villain/chimeras-hunter is Lydecker, played by the increasingly
            nefarious-looking John Savage). And so, by definition, she's always
            working a number of tensions at any given moment, evidenced not only
            in her voice-over reveries, but also, more violently, in her
            repeated epileptic episodes, where she sweats and contorts and
            flashbacks to her childhood traumas, for example, training with
            other crew-cut kids -- still in that icy light -- as the words
            &quot;Duty&quot; and &quot;Discipline&quot; flash on screen: after a
            few of these awful Clockwork-Orangeish scenes, you're inclined to
            root for Max the resilient underdog. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            addition to this brutal backstory, Max is surrounded by
            appropriately swarmy and intertwining narrative elements: the pilot
            drops you pretty much in the middle, but politely expends much
            energy on 1) explaining stuff like her quick temper, and 2) setting
            up stuff for later episodes: her array of &quot;quirky&quot;
            sidekicks -- a Rasta bike courier; a blond roommate; a black
            single-mom neighbor, and Sketchy, a Xanderish-looking guy at work
            who's cheating on his sweet cookie-baking girlfriend -- indicates
            that she's in for lots of supporting-character-developing plotlines.

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's
            also good to see a teen show in a city, no doubt. Max traverses
            post-pulse Seattle (read: Microsoft = toast) with refreshing
            confidence, whether she's biking, riding her sleek black Kawasaki
            Ninja 350 (like a mini-Arnold, sans shotgun) or scaling buildings
            and leaping from rooftop to rooftop in order to practice her
            lucrative avocation, cat-burgling (apparently literally, she has
            feline genes spliced into her make-up). After demonstrating her deep
            interest in an expensive cat statuette (&quot;It's the Egyptian
            goddess Bast, the goddess who comprehends all goddesses, eye of Ra,
            protector, avenger, destroyer, giver of life who lives
            forever&quot;), she explains her interest to a new acquaintance:
            &quot;I steal things in order to sell them for money -- it's called
            commerce.&quot; And indeed, objects and information are sold and
            traded easily and quickly in a post-cyberworld, despite the
            &quot;nuclear airburst&quot; that wiped out all records of all kinds
            east of the Rockies.&quot; For Max, money is a practical issue, a
            means to survival only, certainly not to claim identity (local,
            national, or we-are-the-worldal) or power; though she certainly has
            her own clear-eyed understanding of the now-f*cked-up class system,
            where rich people spent money redecorating their homes to match
            their cats and poor people starved (now, there are food riots on the
            news, suggesting that lots more people are starving, or at least,
            more people are acting on their outrage). As Max delivers a package
            to an office in the super-slick financial district, she muses,
            &quot;America really though they had it dialed in, money hangin' out
            the butt. But it was all just a bunch of ones and zeroes in a
            computer someplace. So when that bomb went kablooey and turned all
            those ones and zeroes into plain old zeroes, everyone's like, no
            way! America's just another broke ex-super-power looking for a
            handout and wondering why.&quot; She knows what time it is.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There
            will be critics who worry about Max's appeal. Fox already caught
            flack for running the <i>Dark Angel</i> premiere and pre-empting the
            3 October Gore-Bush Debate (the network ran it tape-delayed, at 11pm
            EST). Still, the numbers suggest it was a sound economic decision: <i>Dark
            Angel</i> averaged 17.4 million viewers and a huge 8.3 rating/22
            share in its target demographic, adults 18-34, and a 8.5/30 with
            teens. Whether these fabulous stats will continue, depends in part
            on how Max delivers, as point of youth-identification, as well as
            ideal youth-product. Already, the show is betraying its tendency to
            be &quot;regular,&quot; though it may well be setting up standard
            plot-points in order to undermine them. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Max's
            cool distrust and distance are inevitably rocked by a &quot;famous
            underground para-cyber-journalist&quot; named Eyes Only, a.k.a.
            Logan Cale (Michael Weatherby). Established in the premiere as Max's
            combination nemesis/romantic interest, Logan resembles a young
            Michael Biehn (Hicks in <i>Aliens</i>, Reese in <i>T1</i>), complete
            with a not-quite-mean but annoying-all-the-same cockiness. Logan's
            daily &quot;streaming freedom video&quot; show reports the
            resistance-type news to the masses, which he ferrets out by
            urban-guerilla means. In this first episode, he enlists (or rather,
            coerces) Max to protect an important witness (a woman with a child:
            how very Cameronian). Max has one bad moment when she melts for a
            corny line (Logan says hers is &quot;probably the most singularly
            beautiful face I've ever seen&quot;) and another one where she poses
            as a slinky-red-dressed prostitute in order to complete the job
            (this sexy-girl undercover business: way tired). Granted, she's a
            teenager and she <b><i>is</i></b> singularly beautiful. But Max is
            potentially cooler than such regular plotting allows, a youthful
            protagonist with something to offer besides crop tops. Logan knows
            as much: he seduces her for her warrior skills, recognizing her bar
            code (and the clues to her physical prowess, when she attempts to
            burgle his high-rise apartment, cold-cocks his beefy security guard,
            and back flips out the window). Offering to help her find her
            long-lost &quot;siblings,&quot; and threatening to turn her in to
            authorities, Logan blackmails Max into working for him. She says she
            doesn't want to get involved, and he counters, &quot;By being alive,
            you're involved.&quot; And here you have the series' version of
            dystopic dating. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">With
            any luck and foresight, though, this emerging romance will take a
            backseat to Max's more interesting and immediate dilemmas: who is
            she? who was that nice lady nurse who saved her back when she was
            nine years old and shivering in the snow? where are her fellow
            Chimeras? why did the Manticore folks -- or more precisely, Cameron
            and company -- design her to be vaguely Latina? and what possessed
            them to make their most out-there-for-network-TV character, speak
            with such a lame imitation of street slang? &quot;True that,&quot;
            says Original Cindy (Valarie Rae Miller) when you first see her.
            (Someone on the writing staff needs to tap a real kid for dialogue
            tips.) Still, as a best buddy, Original Cindy is promising: she's
            the fellow courier/pool shark/black lesbian/Xena fan/co-con-artist
            to whom Max can confide her love-life woes and snark, &quot;I feel
            sorry for guys. They're prisoners of their genes.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Lines
            like that are okay for Max to say, for, even if she wears black
            leather and boots, rides a bike, and hangs out with a lesbian, she's
            manifestly straight (sigh). This is evidenced by her bad
            guy-history, laid out early in a <i>Melrose Place</i>-esque bar
            scene, where Max and Original Cindy exchange words with Max's wanna-come-back
            ex, who does that thing where he blames her for his cheating with a
            friend of hers: she's remote and solitary, she's preoccupied and
            single-minded: she's not a good girlfriend. Yes. As cozy as the show
            might want you to feel with Max, she's most compelling and exciting
            when she's not doing what you want or expect. &quot;Now he figures
            that I'm going to go out there and do the right thing, because I owe
            him,&quot; she says of Logan after he's revealed he will continue to
            blackmail her. &quot;Like I even care.&quot; What a way to introduce
            your protagonist: so insolent and pissed off and righteous. We can
            only hope that the show hangs onto this unusual respect for Max's
            adolescent rage, her inarticulate resistance, her frustration with
            the way the world is.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
