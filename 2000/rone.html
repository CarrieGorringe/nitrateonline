            review by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 20 October 2000</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>At first, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">One</i>
            plays like a lot of other movies. Because it deals with the
            relationship between two working class men who have been on the
            wrong side of the law, memories of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Mean
            Streets</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Pope of
            Greenwich Village</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Federal
            Hill</i> and others start to emerge. First time-director Tony
            Barbieri went to his roots for this one, and they appear pretty
            similar to those of the people who make the previous movies.
            Fortunately, Barbieri approaches the material with some fresh
            touches. His restraint in handling violence and sex may eventually
            set him apart from the field.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">One begins with Charlie (Jason
            Cairns, who wrote the script with Barbieri) leaving prison. With no
            family of his own, he’s happy that his buddy Nick (Kane Picoy) has
            invited him to say at Nick’s parents’ house. Nick even helps
            Charlie find a job working in the sanitation department with him.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s not a fun existence. Nick
            and his father Ted (Paul Herman) argue constantly. Nick also derides
            Charlie’s desire to go to college and take a hand at teaching.
            Nick, resigned to being a garbage man, doesn’t hope to make it any
            further and hopes that Charlie will get a clue. Charlie’s rosy
            view of life may have even landed him in jail in the first place. He
            killed his grandfather because the man was suffering from Lou
            Gehrig’s disease.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In truth, Nick is as unrealistic as
            his friend. A once promising baseball player, he got kicked out of
            minor league ball for punching a manager. When he gets the chance to
            return to the pros, Nick’s ego begins to swell. Charlie starts a
            relationship with his former boss Sara (Autumn Macintosh). Educated
            and professional, she arouses Nick’s mistrust and seems out of
            Charlie’s league.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Because neither of these fellows
            seems to have his act together, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">One</i>
            develops into a much smarter movie as it progresses. One can admire
            these fellows’ ambitions, even if they are never likely to achieve
            them. Barbieri’s cast of relative unknowns show some real promise,
            and the director himself has a flair for making mundane scenes play
            in a fresh intriguing manner. For example, when Charlie and Sara
            have their first love scene, Barbieri shoots the entire sequence
            with a single long lens shot. Instead of focusing on the couple, an
            ashtray is clearly presented while Charlie and Sara are blurs. With
            only their voices and outlines to tell us the story, the director
            and the camera crew have actually put us closer to the emotions of
            the characters. We’re not distracted by their appearances or by
            the background. While we never see Charlie and Sara’s clothes fly
            off they way they would in a typical film of this genre, Barbieri
            uses our imagination to fill in the story. It’s a tool more
            filmmakers should use. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">One</i>
            also features a refreshingly different type of score. Instead of a
            full orchestra or a collection of old or current popular favorites,
            composer Todd Boekelheide uses sparse instrumentation (including
            what sounds like hammer dulcimers) and gives the movie a ghostly
            mood.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There’s still a feeling of déjà
            vu when the ending comes, but Barbieri’s off-handed storytelling
            may serve him and his audience well in his subsequent films.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
