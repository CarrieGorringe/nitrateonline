            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In <i>Forever Mine</i>, Paul
            Schrader's latest film, Joseph Fiennes plays Alan, who, in 1973, is
            a university student working as a cabana boy at a posh Miami
            beachfront hotel. There, he meets Ella (Gretchen Mol), the beautiful
            wife of Mark (Ray Liotta), an aspiring politician, and he becomes
            immediately and totally besotted with her. They were fated to meet.
            After the inevitable Steamy Encounter or two, Alan confronts Mark
            with the news: not only are he and Ella meant to be together, it is
            their &quot;purpose&quot;. Mark, the outraged husband, doesn't see
            it that way, and puts a stop to things.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jump forward fourteen years, and
            Alan reemerges with a new face (reconstructed, after a horrible
            mishap), a new identity (a wealthy entrepreneur with contacts in
            both Central America and the U.S.), and a request to help the
            unwitting Mark, now a New York City councilman, avert political
            scandal.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The picture (which was completed in
            1999, and is having its U.S. premiere on the &quot;Starz&quot;
            channel this month) has been likened to having antecedents in film <b><i>noir</i></b>,
            but it's actually closer to Frederich Durrenmatt's dark, European
            story, &quot;The Visit&quot;, where a wealthy woman returns to the
            village that cast her out when she was young in order to use her
            money and power to settle some scores. The second part of <i>Forever
            Mine</i> starts out promisingly, but it would have been better if
            the first half worked. Fiennes and Mol have no chemistry together
            on-screen, and they don't fare so well on their own, either. Fiennes
            gives one of the most amorphous lead performances I can recall
            seeing in any recent film, and that's when you can understand what
            he's saying. He affects a Latino accent for his new identity, but
            he's so soft-spoken beforehand that you can't tell where his
            character comes from or how he sounded to begin with. Mol is
            sweet-looking, but she falls way short of coming across as either a
            four-alarm object of desire (no matter how much the filmmakers make
            her up or light her to look like Lana Turner), or as a woman who's
            sinking into boredom and desperation because of an ill-suited
            marriage.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Schrader has written and staged
            many of the scenes---particularly the ones depicting the reunion of
            Alan and Ella---very well, with a great feeling towards particular
            detail and nuance. But he's working with the wrong actors in two of
            the lead roles, and the film doesn't so much come to an end as
            simply deflate. Perhaps Schrader himself realized that this film had
            turned into a write-off, but, considering that he's previously given
            us two very fine films, <i>Light Sleeper</i> and <i>Affliction</i>
            (both of which also had trouble finding theatrical distribution),
            everyone's entitled to make a mistake now and then.</font>
