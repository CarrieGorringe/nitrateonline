            review by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 15 December 2000</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In many ways, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Emperor’s New Groove</i> is the &quot;low-calorie
            alternative&quot; to the usual Disney offering. Several Mouse House
            trademarks are absent here, and like the calories in diet foods,
            they are not missed. There are only two songs on the soundtrack, and
            there’s only one anthropomorphic animal. While there are no
            jaw-dropping sequences like the avalanche in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Mulan</i> or the stampede in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Lion King</i>, there is enough vitality in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Emperor’s New Groove</i> to compensate. By emphasizing story and
            character and removing some of the less potent elements from the
            Disney formula, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Emperor’s New Groove</i> has a freshness that’s been missing
            from some of its predecessors.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The new cartoon is not adapted from
            a fairy tale, history or a literary classic. True, the script
            (primarily credited to David Reynolds, Chris Williams and director
            Mark Dindal) borrows elements from <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Beauty
            and the Beast</i> and other Disney flicks. Nonetheless, the lack of
            a direct source in another medium is the first of many wise
            decisions. One does not watch <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Emperor’s New Groove</i> and groan over what the screenwriters
            have done with the original. The story is set in a mythical kingdom
            with South American terrain and Aztec architecture. It is also
            curiously replete with 21<sup>st</sup>-century slang (there is talk
            of &quot;downsizing&quot;). The realm appears prosperous despite the
            fact that its leader, Kuzco (voiced by David Spade at his caustic
            best) is a 24-carat megalomaniac. The young Emperor is fond of
            naming things after himself (he wants to name his proposed summer
            home &quot;Kuzcotopia&quot;) and orders a disabled old man to be
            thrown out a window because he threw off the sovereign’s dance
            steps.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kuzco’s behavior doesn’t endear
            him to the palace staff. When he fires his top advisor Yzma (Eartha
            Kitt) for sitting on his throne, it proves to be a nearly fatal
            mistake. Yzma is as devious as the Emperor is egotistical. She and
            her muscular assistant Kronk (Patrick Warburton) try to poison
            Kuzco’s birthday dinner so they can take power for themselves. The
            plan falls apart because Kronk misreads the vials and instead pours
            the Emperor potion that turns him into a talking llama. Yzma demands
            that Kronk kill the poor beast, but Kronk (who’s better at cookery
            than skullduggery) bungles that task as well. In the process, Kuzco
            falls into the cart of a peasant named Pacha (John Goodman).<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When he discovers that what he’s
            brought home is no ordinary llama, Pacha agrees to help Kuzco get
            back to the palace and return to human form. This is a generous move
            on the part of the peasant. In his only previous encounter with
            Kuzco, the Emperor proudly stated that he would destroy Pacha’s
            village to create &quot;Kuzcotopia.&quot; The two also face a myriad
            of obstacles, including waterfalls, jaguars, scorpions, and greasy
            spoon diners. The biggest hindrance, however, is the fact that Yzma
            has no desire to break her spell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">All of these factors help keep <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Emperor’s New Groove</i> moving at a quick pace. Another component
            is the inclusion of Kronk. Kronk steals just about every scene
            he’s in. His fondness for cooking and mingling with forest animals
            makes him lovable. Warburton, who starred in the underrated <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Woman Chaser</i>, has a beautiful deadpan delivery that makes every
            remark that emerges from his mouth hilarious. Don’t be surprised
            if Kronk gets a TV-show of his own after this movie hits the screens<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The other voice actors are also
            solid, and the hipster attitude usually works. Every now and then
            the writers overdo the jokes about unemployment and fast food.
            Still, the filmmaker’s willingness to tweak the Disney formula
            helps keep it from growing stagnant.</font>
