            pretty high school student, knowing the killer is close to breaking
            through her bedroom door, calls 911 on her PC. Her eyes wide and her
            heart pounding, she types in her message: &quot;White woman in
            trouble!&quot; In an instant, her suburban driveway is crowded with
            cruisers, sirens shrieking and lights flashing, and her wouldabeen
            slayer is beating a hasty retreat.</b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Most
            everyone watching this scene in <i>Scary Movie</i> will recognize it
            as a riff on <i>Scream</i>, Wes Craven's 1996 slasher flick that
            riffed on previous slasher flicks, including Craven's own <i>Nightmare
            on Elm Street</i> (1984), which itself riffed on proto-slasher
            flicks like Hitchcock's <i>Psycho</i>. The lineage of <i>Scary
            Movie's</i> Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris) is built into her farcical
            existence. The &quot;Last Girl&quot; character – the one who
            survives the slasher's horrific rampaging – is typically a good
            girl, smart, self-conscious, not necessarily asexual (like <i>Halloween's
            </i>Jamie Lee Curtis) but at least virtuous, and somewhat
            &quot;masculine&quot; in her fight-back abilities. Cindy is all
            this, but she has to contend with more than just the monster. She
            also has to be the straight woman to a crew of rakish pranksters: I
            can't imagine what it was like to work with these guys. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">On
            its surface, the film consists of a regular slasher plot. But it's
            full of shifts and messes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Cindy's
            escape from the black-robed, death-masked, generally silly monster
            involves the usual dodging and outsmarting, plus the fact that she's
            running through scenes borrowed from all kinds of movies. Cindy
            performs and comments on the familiar role, the girl in trouble.
            According to formula, the role is simultaneously titillating,
            frightening, and moneymaking. All of the above is multiplied
            exponentially, of course, if said girl is wearing very little, say a
            bath-towel or wet underwear, like Carmen Electra does while playing
            in &quot;Drew&quot; (as in Barrymore) in<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span><i>Scary Movie's </i>introductory homage. She gets the phone
            call, pops the corn, cries and screams, runs through the lawn
            sprinkler, and is, inevitably, brutally slashed. In slow motion.<o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">By
            turns brainy and banal, <i>Scary Movie</i> culls from the sources
            you'd expect, including the <i>Screams</i>, the <i>I Still Know What
            You Did Last Summers</i>, and <i>Halloween: H20</i>, and a few you
            might not anticipate, like &quot;feminine odor&quot; and &quot;whassup&quot;
            commercials, Mel Brooks, <i>The Usual Suspects</i>, <i>The Matrix</i>,
            <i>The Exorcist</i>, <i>The Sixth Sense</i>, and <i>Dawson's Creek</i>
            (James Van Der Beek makes one particularly apposite appearance,
            crawling in through a window to the tune of Paula Cole's
            by-now-royally-irritating &quot;I Don't Want To Wait&quot;). While
            the attractive-white-teens-obsessing-about-sex phenomenon has
            already come in for its share of drubbing, the Wayans brothers --
            Keenen directing, Marlon and Shawn co-writing and performing –
            bring something else to the table. First and most obviously, they
            mix their typically upbeat parodies with a certain signature
            yuckiness, previously and often brilliantly demonstrated in their TV
            series <i>In Living Color</i> (which famously hatched Jim Carrey),
            and the popular spoof-movies <i>I'm Gonna Get You Sucka</i> and <i>Don't
            Be a Menace to South Central While Drinking Your Juice in the Hood</i>.
            Moreover, the Wayans, having some attitude concerning the world they
            live in, also inject occasional social commentary, as for instance,
            in the &quot;white woman in trouble&quot; scene. Or the scene drawn
            from <i>Scream 2</i> in which Omar Epps gets a knife in the head, as
            a terrible punishment for trying to listen in on what sounds like a
            sex act in a movie theater bathroom stall. In the <i>Scary Movie</i>
            version, the knife is turned into a huge black penis, which goes
            straight through an unfortunately curious character's skull. In a
            word, nasty. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still,
            the film's main interest lies in the yuckiness sweepstakes, which
            continue to escalate in scope and imagination. If the grand
            effrontery of <i>American Pie</i>, Tom Green, and now <i>Survivor</i>,
            has taught us anything, it's that the Farrelly brothers are not
            unique, only leading a pack. <i>Scary Movie</i>, for all its <i>Airplane!</i>-derived
            goofball humor, also delivers a requisite and near-daunting
            raucousness. So, where some jokes are easy (the monster gets stoned
            with some of the boys), others are off the scale. Keenen and company
            (including co-writers Phil Beauman and Jason Friedberg) take gags
            that have long since been done to death into some other dimension. I
            mean, Squiggy -- <i>the</i> Squiggy, from <i>Laverne and Shirley</i>
            -- is the high school principal. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Moreover,
            the movie offers every flavor of disgusto joke: phys-ed teacher Miss
            Mann's (Jane Trcka) saggy testicles hang out from under her little
            pleated skirt (much to sweet Cindy's discomfort); Drew's parents
            fail to save her because they're too busy with a front-seat blowjob;
            and ruthless reporter Gail Hailstorm (who has written a book called <i>You're
            Dead, I'm Rich</i> and is played by the indefatigable Cheri Oteri)
            comes in for an awful Blair-Witchy comeuppance, following her
            repeated abuses of easy mark special-ed student Doofy (Dave
            Sheridan). Or again, Buffy (<i>American Pie's </i>Shannon Elizabeth)
            takes part in a <i>Titanic-</i>themed teen beauty pageant where
            contestants wear sashes proclaiming them &quot;Miss Thing&quot; and
            &quot;Miss Fellatio.&quot; Not to mention star footballer Ray (Shawn
            Wayans, and yes, he and everyone else are too old to be in high
            school) is effusively, &quot;Men-on-Film&quot;-ishly gay, neatly
            revising (by not sidestepping) the violent homoerotics in <i>Scream</i>,
            or the murder of a talky filmgoer by the entire audience, whose
            members have grown impatient with her incessant sass. It's some kind
            of bizarre icing on this cake that the scene takes place in front of
            a screen showing <i>Amistad 2</i>, in which Keenen Wayans makes a
            cameo appearance as a slave who briefly announces himself as
            &quot;The King of the World.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Because
            the movie doesn't really have a plot or characters per se and adopts
            an explicit assault-on-all-icons approach, it might appear to be as
            mindless as its targets. And it would be easy to dismiss it as such.
            But this would sell both <i>Scary Movie</i> and its targets short.
            Wes Craven has famously observed that scary movies reveal and
            explore deep cultural concerns, such as tensions between
            generations, races, classes, and genders. It's clear that slasher
            flicks especially appeal to young viewers not only because they
            showcase nubile, anonymous, almost-always white teen bodies being
            stalked and skewered, but because they act out – in comedic and
            self-admittedly titillating terms – their real feelings of
            disenfranchisement and alienation. <i>Scary Movie</i> does all this
            and more, extremely. <o:p>
