            review by <a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 1 September 2000</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Spike Lee may have a reputation
            as a militant filmmaker, but in many ways he’s a chameleon.
            Switching from Nike commercials, to music videos, to documentaries,
            to his feature films, Lee seems willing to try anything. His latest
            movie is a live comedy club flick similar to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Bill
            Cosby: Himself</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Richard
            Pryor: Here and Now</i>. Lee imbues his new flick <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Original Kings of Comedy</i> with little of his trademark rage or
            technical trickery. There are no extreme close ups of reflections of
            people in eyeballs here. Lee and his crew shot this one on video,
            and the sound sometimes seems muddy. But to be fair, Lee’s
            unusually hands-off approach may have been the one to take. Lee
            seems well aware that the reason to catch the flick is to catch the
            comics.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The &quot;Kings of Comedy&quot;
            tour drew legions of fans and reportedly outgrossed a tour by teen
            idols The Backstreet Boys. From the evening captured in the film,
            the appeal is obvious. Steve Harvey, D.L. Hughley, Cedric the
            Entertainer and Bernie Mac are a quartet of able comics.
            Furthermore, their act is remarkably interactive for the large
            arenas where they play (in this case, The Charlotte Coliseum in
            Charlotte, North Carolina). Harvey and Hughley, in particular, play
            well off the crowd and frequently work them into the act.
            Hughley’s routine is intermittently inspired but becomes
            hysterical when he randomly starts teasing the crowd. Lee constantly
            cuts to the spectators and gives movie audiences a sense of the fun
            that crowd must have had.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As with just about any comedy
            special that runs on HBO or Showtime, the monologues are intricately
            laced with expletives and deal with sex and other body functions.
            These guys can get away with it, but their strongest moments come
            when they poke fun at other subjects. Harvey has a field day
            demonstrating why old school tunes are preferable to rap. After
            whining about how rappers place too many instructions on their fans,
            he adds, “I just paid you $38.50. I don’t want to help you
            out!” Similarly, Hughley digs into xenophobic baseball player John
            Rocker. “If you can count the number of black people you’ve had
            over at your house, you’re still a racist,” he quips.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If Harvey’s low key charm and
            Hughley’s spontaneous outbursts get them a lot of mileage, Cedric
            seems to get his ideas from everywhere. During one of the backstage
            sequences, he hears an echo in the bathroom and instantly breaks
            into a Gregorian chant. His topics range from reggae (he performs a
            tune about the agony of having no jam for his peanut butter) to golf
            announcers. Sporting a fedora and speaking in an almost scholarly
            tone, Cedric is the most creative and distinctive comic in the
            quartet. His portly frame belies a remarkable agility. In a rare
            technical flourish, Lee offers some <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Matrix</i>-style
            slow motion shots to augment some of Cedric’s karate moves.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Bernie Mac’s set, which concludes
            the film, is disappointing. His material is uninspired and often
            redundant. He repeatedly harps on keeping bratty kids in their
            place, and his only memorable sequence is one where he demonstrates
            all of the conceivable uses for a popular synonym for incest.
            Mac’s verbal skills pale next to the other members of the quartet,
            but his body language is a riot. Bristling with a nervous anger, Mac
            paces across the stage so quickly that Lee’s camera crew has to
            hustle to keep half a step behind him. Mac’s bug-eyed stare is
            worth the price of admission. At times, the comic seems so frantic
            that his eyes appear to leap from his skull.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">All four of these comics have had
            TV and movie gigs (Hughley has the dubious distinction of providing
            the voice of the talking car in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Inspector
            Gadget</i>), but <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Original
            Kings of Comedy</i> provides a better showcase for their talents.
            Lee does not offer anything earth shattering, but it’s unfair to
            dismiss <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Original Kings of
            Comedy</i> because there are plenty of sturdy laughs. The
            photography and jokes may be crude, but, for the most part, each
            tends to play off the other to good effect.</font>
