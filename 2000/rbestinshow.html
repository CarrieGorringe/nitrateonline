            upper limits of droll wit in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Best

            the time the winner parades before the appreciative crowd, on screen
            and off. Guest and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">American
            Pie</i>’s Eugene Levy are credited as writers, although this
            hilarious, hand-held send up of the competitive canine crowd is
            squarely in the hands of the actors, who ham it up with brilliant
            pretense, rarely missing a comic beat. As with Guest’s previous
            ensemble mockumentary <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Waiting for Guffman</i> (which he also created with Levy) and the Rob
            Reiner-directed <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">This Is Spinal
            Tap</i> (which Guest co-wrote and co-starred with Michael McKean --
            back here as a middle-aged hair salon proprietor), the film segments
            into a variety of eccentric characters that chain-react as it trots
            on its merry and well-paced way. It’s a cinematic chemistry
            experiment gone haywire, and what’s left after the smoke rises is
            destined to become another cult favorite.<o:p>

            alumni, bump their outrageous identities off each other and the
            camera with well-timed and well-chosen quips and retorts, often
            compressed in little snippets of screen time (and usually ending
            with a deadpan clincher) as they and their pets are initially
            introduced on their home turf and their dog stories subsequently
            rotated over the course of a brisk ninety minutes. As canine-show
            aficionados and their tangentially-affiliated partners, they step
            about in search of top prize during the last half of the film, at
            the prim and proper 125th edition of the &quot;Mayflower Dog
            Show&quot; in Philadelphia. There, in the heat of competition, late
            night regular Fred Willard bites into the contenders as Buck
            Laughlin, an off-color television commentator whose red bow tie is
            as appropriately out of place as his running stream of
            semi-irreverent jokes. His duty-bound British partner Trevor
            Beckwith (Jim Piddick) puts up a brave and ever serious face as foil
            to his partner’s school yard innocence. No doubt in his afterlife,
            Buck would be a poker-playing mutt on velvet.<o:p>

            previously satisfied male "patrons" pop out of the woodwork and
            recall some provocative one-night-stands from her past. Gerry, her
            buck-toothed, buttoned-up husband (Levy) is haunted by the bevy of
            men who pick his wife out of the crowd, or by her occasional
            dalliance with an "old friend." He’s also got two left feet.
