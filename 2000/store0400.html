not bad, but strangely unfocused film version of Mona Simpson's novel, with
Natalie Portman as the long-suffering daughter of a mother (Susan Sarandon) who
continually uproots their existence to start things anew. Sarandon seems
tentative, even uncertain, at times, as if she weren't too sure how to get this
very contrary character to come across in a way that makes sense. However,
Portman's performance confirms that she is an actress who is someone to watch in
films to come.</span><i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2">

Fincher's film suggests that modern American males have become voids who can
only again experience real living by pummeling each other into bloody messes.
Visually dazzling, and with a lead performance by Edward Norton that sometimes
touches upon genius, but overall is disconcerting, to say the least. Brad Pitt
puts in an occasionally amusing appearance as the guy who leads Norton's
character down the garden path; Helena Bonham Carter gives a self-consciously
flamboyant performance as a woman who shows up at lung cancer support meetings
deliberately smoking like a chimney. The DVD edition of this title is now
scheduled for a June 6 release.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2"><i>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">In
a world of shallow emotions and easy answers, Kevin Costner makes deliberate,
earnest, fusty films that are meticulous, self-serving and sometimes very hard
to sit through (much less defend). After the triumph of <i>Dances With Wolves</i>
and the twin economic disasters of <i>Waterworld</i> (not a bad movie at all)
and <i>The Postman</i> (an example of wretched excess and narcissism gone
amuck), <i>For Love of the Game</i> highlights the best and worst of Costner’s
jingoistic, Capra-esque impulses in its story of aging baseball pitcher Billy
Chapel and the mental walk down memory lane he takes while pitching a perfect
game in the last outing of his illustrious nineteen-year career (all for the
same team, the Detroit Tigers). You don’t have to love baseball to appreciate
Costner’s third big-screen foray into the sport, but those without a love of
the game will fidget at the overripe melodrama on display. Director Sam Raimi (<i>A
Simple Plan</i>) does a superb job with the game itself, employing subtle
special effects and a rational approach to the sport that makes the scenes on
the field riveting and authentic (John C. Reilly and J.K. Simmons are fine but
underutilized as his catcher and coach). Unique among his highly-paid peers,
Costner is building a career on a stodgy sincerity that is as admirable as it is
out of synch with the times. As such, it is possible to admire his work without
necessarily embracing it -- which may be the best way to approach <i>For Love of
the Game</i>. There is a Spanish-subtitled tape available, and the DVD features
production notes, trailers, a production featurette, deleted scenes and two
interactive games.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2"><i>

to Happy,” barks character vet Paul Dooley shortly into <i>Happy, Texas</i>,
immediately betraying the deceptively pleasant burg’s motto as “The Town
Without a Frown.” And it is from this tension that much of the humor in this
caper comedy arises, as fleeing convicts Steve Zahn and Jeremy Northam (bringing
a tangibly Baldwinesque spin to his American accent) bamboozle their way through
a beauty pageant when the boost the original organizers mobile home. Seen by
some as a courageously anti-PC comedy and others as a gratingly off-color
diatribe against gays and an exaggeratedly clichéd gay lifestyle, individual
tolerances for the film will fall somewhere between the two extremes. Clearly,
the filmmakers must wonder what all the fuss is about, as everyone attacks their
roles with gusto. The dream cast includes William H. Macy (who deftly steals the
film as a small-town sheriff with a secret of his own), Ileanna Douglas, Ally
Walker, Ron Perlman and Mo Gaffney. The special edition DVD features multiple
commentaries/interviews, production notes, deleted scenes, a making-of
documentary and a music video.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2"><i>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">From
the opening credits’ odd blend of Jan Svankmajer stop-motion and <i>Seven</i>-ish
sensibility to the casting of horror movie icon Jeffrey Combs (<i>Reanimator</i>)
to the very idea of remaking William Castle’s 1958 camp classic, <i>House on
Haunted Hill</i> is defiantly proud of its cheesy roots while at the same time
making the most of technology to amp up the fright factor. Summoned to the
now-abandoned former mental institution by impresario Steven H. Price
(Oscar-winner Geoffrey Rush in the Vincent Price role, sporting a pencil-thin
moustache and a James Woods-ish American accent to match), a gaggle of seemingly
unrelated folks are promised a million dollars each (it was a hundred grand in
the original) if they survive the night. Some do, some don’t. Director William
Malone counts among his sparse credits the cable “Tales From the Crypt”
revival, and the presence of two of that show’s executive producers, director
Robert Zemeckis and action film producer Joel Silver, indicate that the picture
was aiming higher than mere multiplex fodder. And, to a certain degree, the
movie delivers, offering some vivid and genuinely unexpected scares amidst the
sly and cheerfully profane performances of Famke Janssen, SNL vet Chris Kattan,
Peter Gallagher, Taye Diggs and especially Rush. “Sure is a funky ol’
house… Ain’t it,” he leers early in the show, and the movie proceeds with
that spirit in mind.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2"><i>

of the best films of 1999, Michael Mann's picture of how one man's attempt to
act upon his conscience and bring to light some ulterior practices going on
inside the U.S. cigarette industry gradually but surely seizes hold of one's
attention and turns into one of the most suspenseful film dramas in years. Great
spatial use of widescreen cinematography by Dante Spinotti (which will probably
suffer on video), and with impeccable performances all the way around, from
Russell Crowe and Al Pacino, as a T.V. news producer, to Diane Venora,
Christopher Plummer as &quot;60 Minutes&quot; news anchor Mike Wallace, and
Bruce McGill as an attorney who becomes very, very irked during a courtroom
hearing. The elegantly-designed DVD edition includes a brief featurette on the
film’s making and the fascinating dissection of a single scene that offers a
glimpse into Mann’s meticulous creative process.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2"><i>

makes you so popular? What’s your secret?” someone asks the eponymous
small-town shrink shortly into this box-office underachiever from <i>Body Heat</i>
director Lawrence Kasdan, and in the answering of those questions <i>Mumford</i>
proves to be a deceptively charming character study that requires a good deal
more concentration and good will from a viewer than your average Hollywood
movie. Having moved to the bucolic town of Mumford to escape his past “back
east,” Mumford (Loren Dean) specializes in helping his patients through a
combination of palpable empathy and sensible straight talk -- until the audience
learns that he’s a fraud in a dazzlingly constructed confessional. Under the
deceptively simple exterior, Kasdan once again draws the kind of deep and
fully-rounded characters that made <i>The Big Chill</i> (1983) and <i>Grand
Canyon </i>(1991) such bellwethers of their time (perhaps this is why so many of
the actors in <i>Mumford</i> have worked with him before and the first-timers
seem so comfortable). Whether the cumulative effect is satisfying depends
largely on the inquisitive nature of the person watching it: if you’ve ever
wondered whether the diplomas on the walls of your doctor are real, and you
enjoy the telling more than the tale, then Mumford may just be the thing for
you. The DVD includes a trailer and making-of featurette.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2"><i>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Franchising
is the name of the game in Hollywood these days, which is why the well-tooled
yet distractingly antiseptic <i>Stuart Little </i>bears about as much relation
to the E.B. White book on which it’s based (<i>The Sixth Sense</i>
writer-director M. Night Shyamalan is one of the adaptors) as fast food does to
a gourmet meal. That’s not to say the film isn’t a satisfying entertainment
for children and an interesting spin on family values, just that whatever whimsy
is on display results more from cold calculation than the magic generated by the
admittedly super special effects. “He’s very clean,” says family doc
Dabney Coleman to the Littles (Geena Davis and Hugh Laurie) of the glib mouse
(glibly voiced by Michael J. Fox) they’ve just adopted to the astonishment of
their existing son George (Jonathan Lipnicki) and cat Snowbell (voiced by Nathan
Lane). And the same could be said for the film itself: once the novelty of the
special effects begins to wear off and the predictability of the story begins to
settle in, <i>Stuart Little</i> begins to resemble nothing so much as a
provocative cross of the stylized polish of <i>American Beauty</i> and <i>Beetlejuice</i>’s
skewed, slightly otherworldly family vibe (this last may be triggered by the
presence of both Davis and Jeffrey Jones, who co-starred in Tim Burton’s
surrealistic classic, as well as the miniature train set in the Little’s

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Arguably
the funniest and certainly the most focused of the recent crop of <i>Saturday
Night Live</i> Players, Molly Shannon’s transferal of her disaster-prone Mary
Katherine Gallagher character from skit to feature-length protagonist (under the
tutelage of SNL producer Lorne Michaels) has the same determined, absurdist vibe
as the Norm Macdonald vehicle <i>Dirty Work </i>and <i>A Night at the Roxbury</i>
(in which she also appeared), making <i>Superstar</i> the month’s outstanding
guilty pleasure. Ohioan Shannon, who will next be seen as Betty Lou Who in the
live action version of the Dr. Seuss chestnut <i>How the Grinch Stole Christmas</i>,
surrounds herself with former <i>Kids in the Hall</i> sketch artists Mark
McKinney and Bruce McCulloch (who directed), resulting in that almost patented
Canadian atmosphere of neat-as-a-pin surrealism. The story, such as it is,
follows the nerdy Catholic schoolgirl’s yearning for stardom and acceptance,
but the real fun of the piece comes from the spot-on observances of religious
rigidity shot through with aggressive physical humor and a muted shrewdness that
never draws attention to the anarchy. As he’s done in both <i>Austin Powers</i>
movies, Will Ferrell neatly steals every scene he’s in, here appearing in the
dual roles of school BMOC Sky Corrigan and Mary Katherine’s imagined hipster
Jesus -- who, upon hearing Norman Greenbaum’s “Spirit in the Sky,”
proclaims to the youngster “that song’s about me.” Silly, to be sure, but
also inspired. Paramount’s bare-bones DVD edition includes the theatrical
trailer.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2"><i> --

for the Persian Gulf War what <i>Catch-22</i> did for World War Two and <i>M*A*S*H</i>
did for Korea, this irreverent and kinetic anti-war movie -- improbably
reminiscent, above all, of the giddy clash of greed and glory in the cult 1970
Clint Eastwood movie <i>Kelly’s Heroes</i> -- spreads its cynicism thicker
than most entries in the genre but tempers it with a cheerful streak of
absurdist panache that keeps the irony from overwhelming the drama. Little in
director David O. Russell’s previous two features (<i>Spanking the Monkey</i>
and <i>Flirting With</i> <i>Disaster</i>) indicated his leanings towards this
kind of epic sweep, yet the picture struts along for three-quarters of its
conventional 105 minutes on the sheer brio of its conceit: with a map plucked
from the ass of a dead Iraqi soldier, four unlikely compatriots chase down a
cache of gold ingots and discover the flaws of the military action and strengths
of their individual characters in the process. George Clooney finally seems on
track to get the kind of roles he excels in, while Mark Wahlberg, Ice Cube and
Spike Jonze are precise in support. Special mention to cinematographer Newton
Thomas Sigel for one of the year’s most unorthodox visual styles and composer
Carter Burwell (<i>Fargo</i>) for a memorable score. The feature-laden DVD
edition includes Louis Pepe &amp; Keith Fulton’s irreverent twenty-one-minute
production featurette <i>Under the Bunker</i>, deleted scenes with or without
Russell’s commentary, an interview with Sigel, and, believe it or not, <i>An
Intimate Look Inside the Acting Process with Ice Cube</i> and an “Enhanced

in many ways everything that &quot;Anywhere But Here&quot; should have been.
Rowdy, sometimes howlingly funny, and with dramatic moments that sometimes make
you sit up and wince, the picture has a superb performance by Janet McTeer
(who's British, but, telling from her performance here, you wouldn't notice it),
along with excellent work by Kimberly J. Brown, as McTeer's daughter, Jay O.

nearly fifteen subsequent years of Dennis Hopper’s shenanigans, <i>Twin Peaks</i>
and all the various movies and TV shows influenced by <i>Blue Velvet</i> have
blunted its impact somewhat (particularly for first-time viewers, who may wonder
what the fuss is all about), the film was groundbreaking in its day and remains
unique and startling, a fact reconfirmed early in this first-ever DVD transfer
from MGM. When young Jeffrey Beaumont (Kyle MacLachlan) discovers a severed ear
in a field, it leads him to the seamy underworld that lurks just beneath the
bucolic surface of his hometown, Lumberton (the film was shot in Wilmington,
North Carolina). As he digs deeper, he becomes torn between torch singer Dorothy
(Isabella Rossellini) and his partner in crime Sandy (Laura Dern), the wholesome
daughter of the town’s chief detective. The odd juxtaposition of normalcy and
violence remain jarring (<i>The Hardy Boys Get Naked?</i>), particularly in the
cryptic, vein-popping, altogether mesmerizing performance of Hopper as mad
inhaler Frank Booth and the lulling discord of Angelo Badalamenti’s music,
Alan Splet’s sound mix and Frederick Elmes’ crisp photography. The menu
interface is particularly clever, using the concept of the blue velvet curtain
to separate the available items -- which include no special extras (wouldn’t a
commentary by Lynch be just the thing?) and a disappointingly sparse
“Collectible Booklet.” “One day when it’s all sewed up I’ll let you
know the details,” someone says, referring to the stray ear. The genius of <i>Blue
Velvet</i> is that is that the strange and sinister events in Lumberton will
never be sewn up, and it’s doubtful that Lynch will ever reveal the details of
his bizarre, unsettling and dreamlike world.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2"><i>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Adapted
from the novel by James Ellroy, <i>Brown’s Requiem</i> is a satisfyingly
low-key hardboiled private eye film that marks an auspicious feature debut for
writer-director Jason Freeland. Michael Rooker (<i>Henry: Portrait of a Serial
Killer</i>) stars as former LAPD cop and current recovering alcoholic Fritz
Brown, whose gig moonlighting as a sleuth while not repossessing cars leads him
to follow the sister of filthy racist caddie Frederick “Fat Dog” Baker (<i>Mad
TV's</i> Will Sasso, who has since dropped a lot of the weight he sports here).
The investigation leads Brown through a grimy yet oddly chaste Los Angeles
underworld more in keeping with the 1950s spirit of Ellroy’s work -- part
pulp, part passion -- than more contemporary and heavy-handed spins on the genre
(Cynthia Millar’s brooding, elegant score helps). And Freeland’s got a fine
eye for the City of Angels, from the stained glass bar of the Rustic Inn to
rain-soaked Venice. Winner of the best premiere Jury Award at the 1998 Ft.
Lauderdale Film Festival, <i>Brown’s Requiem</i> sports the stellar supporting
cast of Kevin Corrigan, Brad Dourif, Harold Gould, Barry Newman, Valerie
Perrine, Christopher Meloni (<i>Law and Order: Special Victims Unit</i>) and the
late Brion James (who made no fewer than 13 films between this and his death in
August 1999). It’s a modest surprise among the relative wasteland of
contemporary B pictures and thus worth a look when the high-profile fare just
won’t do. There’s a Spanish subtitled tape available, as well as a DVD
edition featuring commentary by Freeland and Rooker, deleted scenes, a “making
of” documentary and production notes.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2"><i>

iconic types -- pawns, really -- seem driven by a particularly cruel fate, a
sensation heightened by &quot;Boris, the esoteric cabaret artist&quot; who opens

it should be), Paskaljevic's point is that just beneath the confusion and
hair-trigger mayhem, these honest, good-hearted people remain defiantly human (a
self-confessed &quot;shameless optimist,&quot; the director affirms &quot;it is

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt">Alone
in the annals of uncompromisingly personal filmmaking, there’s nothing quite
like Milton Moses Ginsberg’s <i>Coming Apart</i>, a tightly scripted and
ferociously acted black and white inquiry into the mental disintegration of
Manhattan shrink Joe Glazer/Glassman (Rip Torn) via a procession of visiting
women (including Viveca Lindfors and, in a career-making performance, Sally
Kirkland) he bullies, seduces and otherwise impacts over an unspecified course
of time. Filmed with a single, mostly static camera that looks primarily at a
sofa with the skyline reflected in a huge mirror above it, <i>Coming Apart</i>
opened to mixed reviews in 1969 and promptly dropped from sight, only to be
rediscovered by the Museum of Modern Art and Kino International, which
re-released the film to great critical acclaim in 1999. The DVD includes <i>Cominga
Part 2</i>, a forty-one-minute assemblage of video footage documenting the
film’s recent festival screenings in Los Angeles, New York, Boston and
Washington, as well as Ginsberg’s 1999 short video “The City Below the
Line.” Remarkably fresh in spite of its period trappings (two of the doc’s
visitors are canvassing for Eugene McCarthy), <i>Coming Apart</i> may stimulate
further inquiry into this type of filmmaking; if so, Ginsberg points to Kon
Ichikawa’s <i>Odd Obsession</i> (<i>Kagi</i>, aka <i>The Key</i>, 1959), Luis
Buñuel’s <i>Belle du Jour</i> (1967), Alain Resnais’ <i>Last Year at
Marienbad</i> (1961), Michelangelo Antonioni’s <i>L’Avventura</i> (1960),
Jean Eustache’s <i>The Mother and the Whore</i> (1973), John Cassavetes’ <i>The
Killing of a Chinese Bookie</i> (1976) and, of course, the L.M. “Kit”
Carson/Jim McBride collaboration <i>David Holzman’s</i> <i>Diary </i>(1968) as
influential inspirations. “If oblivion is what you crave…follow me!”
Ginsberg says in the essay included on the DVD, and it’s an invitation worthy
of response.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2"><i>

writer-actor Don McKellar comes into his own as a filmmaker with <i>Last Night</i>,
a dryly funny genre exercise about a group of interrelated people facing the

Keith Rennie as a priapic childhood chum of the protagonist, the great Arsinée
Khanjian (the wife of Atom Egoyan, for whom McKellar acted in <i>Exotica</i>) as
a mysterious woman on a bus, Geneviève Bujold as a schoolteacher, Jackie
Burroughs as sort of a doomsday jogger and blink-and-you’ll-miss-‘em
walk-ons by Girard and director Bruce McDonald as rowdies. Among the film’s
funniest gags is the ubiquitous radio countdown of all-time great hits (heavily
skewed to the Canadian), which includes appropriately thematic tunes by The
Fifth Dimension, Looking Glass, Parliament, The Defranco Family, Edward Bear,
Randy Bachman, Pete Seeger and, of course, The Guess Who. A charming and
provocative antidote to the other two high-profile 1998 end-of-the-world movies
(<i>Armageddon</i> and <i>Deep Impact</i>), <i>Last Night</i> signals the
beginning of a promising new directorial career.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2"><i>

<p>Making a long-awaited appearance on DVD courtesy of the Criterion Collection,
British theater director Peter Brook’s low-budget, highly absorbing 1963
adaptation of William Golding’s 1950s novel about a group of 30 English
choirboys and their descent into savagery after crash landing on a deserted
tropical island carries echoes of contemporary films from <i>The Blair Witch
Project</i> to <i>The Beach</i> but endures as a unique and masterful triumph of
emotion over style. Criterion’s transfer is, in a word, flawless, and even the
airless looping of dialogue (“the beast is us”) and the abrupt jump cuts
serve to heighten the surrealism of the allegorical story. Accompanying the film
is commentary from the principals (Brook, producer Lewis Allen, cinematographer
Tom Hollyman, and cameraman/editor Gerald Feil), excerpts from the novel read by
Golding, a deleted scene accessible with or without commentary, the theatrical
trailer, excerpts from Feil’s 1972 documentary on Brooks’ theatrical process
and a generous selection of production stills, home movies (many charting the
film’s Cannes festival premiere) and outtakes. Yet another example from
Criterion of how DVD restoration, presentation and packaging should be done,
this edition of <i>Lord of the Flies</i> is definitive, and thus, priceless.</p>

birthday, she learned her husband Jeff had been killed in Vietnam. Twenty-four
years later, the established photographer and visual artist traveled there to
confront her past, accompanied by a film crew and Xuan Ngoc Evans, herself a
South Vietnamese war widow who immigrated to America in the 1970s. Made in part
to neutralize the “social invisibility” suffered by widows of that war, <i>Regret
to Inform</i> profiles the lives and experiences of numerous women on both sides
of the conflict (called “The American War” in Vietnam). These remembrances
are visualized with over 150 archival clips, creating a you-are-there feel to
these previously untold stories. Winner of the Documentary Director’s Award at
the 1999 Sundance Film Festival, the Video Source Award from the International
Documentary Association, and one of the Final Five in the Documentary Feature
category of this year’s Oscar race, <i>Regret to Inform</i> -- nine years in
the making -- is a powerful, valuable document of war and the unforeseen
devastation it wreaks on those who survive, robbed of their loved ones.</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2"><i>

proprietress Rozalie (Ida Kaminska), the listless but inadvertently principled
Tono Brtko (Josef Kroner) forms a friendship with the woman that is threatened
by current events. The direction of Ján Kadár and Elmar Klos renders the film
remarkably fresh today, emphasizing the absurdities inherent in the situations
without sacrificing any of the dramatic impact of the choices made by average
people in extraordinary circumstances. Kaminska, then-star of Poland’s Warsaw
Yiddish Theater, was nominated for a Best Actress Oscar for her moving
performance, winning the acting award from the Cannes festival that year
alongside Kroner as the petty little man who shields her from harm as long as he
can. At the moment, this release appears to be exclusive to VHS -- a pity, since
the new transfer is spotless.&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2"><i>

five years of the 1920s before abruptly dying of severe peritonitis in 1926. The

Stanley Kubrick’s <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i>) and D.W. Griffith’s jazz age comedy
