<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>&quot;Alright,
let's do some good.&quot; It is very early in the morning, but, after having
already done two hours of study, Elder Marcus Dalton (Richard Dutcher) is right
and raring to embark on another day of work, going from door to door and asking
complete strangers if they have already, or would like to, hear something about
the L.D.S. Church which might help their lives for the better. Working in
relative anonymity, less for himself than for a greater good, Dalton, at age
twenty-nine, has devoted almost the entirety of his adult life, foregoing the
experience of being a husband and father, to this effort. The five young men who
share a house with him, in a Los Angeles suburb, while devoting their selves to
several years of missionary work, and to whom Dalton is a friend, a colleague, a
mentor and, sometimes, a supervisor, call him &quot;Pops.&quot; <o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">God's
Army</span></i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"> --
the most compassionate film about religion to come out in years -- primarily
concerns Elder Brandon Allen (Matthew Brown), who, at the beginning of the film,
is shown tumbling out of Kansas and into L.A. International Airport and a
waiting Volkswagen van, where the two missionaries who meet him look at him
askance and with knowing complicity, as if Allen hasn't any idea what he's
letting himself in for. Allen has been assigned Dalton as his companion in
missionary work, and no sooner does he disembark from the van than he finds out
that he and Dalton are to walk the rest of the way to his new home. &quot;We're
going home,&quot; Dalton assures Allen, &quot;one door at a time.&quot; (Just
like in John Cheever's <i>The Swimmer</i>, I thought.) You can practically feel
Allen's growing horror at the realization that he's going to have to start to
&quot;work&quot; right here and now, without any time to catch his breath, and
that he'll probably bungle it, which will only make it worse. (although, as with
anything, one can only learn through trying.) <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="2" face="Verdana">With
a slender, sparrow-like face and round-rimmed glasses, Dutcher's character,
Dalton, beams with a beautiful sense of benevolent piety and friendliness. He
strives to stay on pleasant, open terms with everyone, whether they're fellow
L.D.S. members or two girls who are working the streets (they flirt with him
gently, and he always responds to their testing his armor for flaws by asking if
they read &quot;that book&quot; that he gave them, yet). The picture never
condescends to taking us on a tour of the iniquities of Los Angeles -- &quot;Oh,
look at all this awful stuff these guys have to put up with!&quot; On the other
hand, it shows that Dalton is not an ever-flowing spring of patience and virtue
-- he issues reprimands which go unheeded, loses his temper, puts hard demands
on himself. The result is that he emerges as one of the most fully-realized, and
moving, characterizations of a man of faith since Robert Duvall's <i>The Apostle</i>.
Even from a completely objective point-of-view, Dalton's trials and efforts are
affecting. <o:p>

<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Initially,
Allen's character seems a little underwritten -- there are many instances when
we would like to learn more about his reactions to certain situations, and we
don't. This turns out to be intentional: Allen gradually fills-up within after
he is faced with having to find his own reasons for being a missionary, or
ultimately end up failing in the attempt. How far can get simply by being
competent in one's church activities, doing everything that is expected of you,
by rote, and simply being content in coasting along? When does the Word stop
being just a set of instructions and becomes something more? At such moments as
when Allen must find his own, intrinsically personal, reason for believing, <i>God's
Army</i> achieves something extraordinary and touches the strata of films, such
as <i>Diary of a Country Priest</i>, that are also fine documents about faith.<o:p>
