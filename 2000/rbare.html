            review by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 29 September 2000</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>A few minutes into <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Barenaked
            in America</i>, singer-guitarist Eric Robertson of the Canadian band
            Barenaked Ladies greets the audience perched on top of a toilet.
            Despite the title and the provocative opening, this rockumentary
            winds up being not nearly as revealing as promised.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Director Jason Priestley (best
            known for starring on <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Beverly
            Hills 90210) </i>follows the band during their 1998 tour for the
            album <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Stunt</i>. The year was
            especially eventful for Barenaked Ladies because they scored their
            first number one hit in the U.S. with the single <i>One Week</i>.
            Considering the fact that they literally started off on playing on
            street corners in the early 'ninties, this is no small achievement.
            Priestly even includes a bizarre clip that’s apparently their
            video debut. <i>Be My Yoko Ono</i> feature the band crouched to fit
            a closeup of all of the members into a single shot. Somehow the
            group managers to play well despite the claustrophobic environment.
            They also project a kind of goofy charm that makes the static clip
            strangely entertaining.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Since that time, Barenaked Ladies
            have gone from a Canadian Cult band to a presence on the American
            charts. They and their music would hardly seem the type to make such
            a crossover appeal. Their blending of rap, country, rock and catchy
            pop hooks falls into no easily classifiable genre. The band members
            themselves are not handsome enough to be teen idols, and while their
            behavior on stage is often outrageous (bassist Jim Creeggan
            performed on an Anne Murray Christmas special sporting an
            interesting shade of lipstick), it is hardly shocking. The group
            devote large portions of their shows to long jams where Robertson
            and Steven Page deliver surprisingly tight improvised vocals. In
            this post-Woodstock age when many bands merely perform mechanical,
            lip synced rehashes of their hits, the Ladies devotion to
            spontaneity is refreshing.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Curiously, the musical offerings in
            <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Barenaked in America</i> seem a bit scant. Priestley, who is Canadian,
            devotes too much of the film to the band’s conquest of their
            neighbors to the south. Much of the talking head commentary about
            the music scene in the Great White North is dull and not terribly
            insightful. One particularly needless scene, involves the band
            members wandering through Washington D.C. asking if the locals have
            heard of them. While the Ladies seem to find it amusing, the
            sequence makes them come off as smug jerks. Priestly includes some
            comments by celebrities like Jeff Goldblum and Jon Stewart, who have
            little to say about the group. Priestly’s lack of selectivity is
            especially glaring when the band members excitedly talk about how
            success has allowed them to incorporate elaborate stage shows. The
            film shows none of these fancy lighting tricks. For a visual medium
            like film, this is a wasted opportunity.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Fortunately there are plenty of
            moments that make this worth a peek, even for the group’s casual
            fans. One fascinating segment consists of Page arguing with the
            director of the video for <i>It’s All Been Done</i>. It’s the
            sort of behind-the-scenes sequence that horrifies most managers and
            publicists. There’s also a moving side story about keyboardist
            Kevin Hearn’s battle with leukemia. He leaves the tour to
            convalesce at the height of the group’s success. The movie ends
            with him rejoining the group after the successful recovery. The
            group’s songs during this segment take on a bittersweet edge that
            thankfully remains genuine. The sight of Hearn jamming with his
            partners makes up for some drivel that proceeded it.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
