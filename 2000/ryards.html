            have an inexplicable soft place in my heart for Marky Mark -- who
            has famously overcome stints in prison, the Funky Bunch, Calvin
            Klein underwear, and his own screwed-up head. Most of the time, I
            feel that my affection has been rewarded. He's made some very good
            movies (<i>Boogie Nights</i> and <i>Three Kings</i>) and performed
            very well in others (<i>The Basketball Diaries</i>, <i>The Corruptor</i>,
            <i>The Perfect Storm</i>). Granted, he's not an actor of tremendous
            range, and I realize that he does tend to play the same character --
            that emotionally damaged young tough -- repeatedly. But he makes
            this character complicated, a little goofy, and repeatedly watchable.
            In fact, one of my favorite versions of this character appears in <i>Fear</i>,
            where he plays an emotionally damaged young tough who terrorizes his
            perfect blond girlfriend (Reese Witherspoon), her sorta-sexy, sorta-goody-goody
            stepmother (Amy Brenneman), and her unbearably sanctimonious father
            (William Petersen), all with a desperation that made him -- Marky
            Mark, the punky terrorist -- seem almost sympathetic. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            his new movie, James Gray's <i>The Yards</i>, Mark Wahlberg again
            plays an emotionally damaged young tough, but this time his entire
            environment is orchestrated to reflect that character, dark, sad,
            and heavy with non-options; Gray says that he had in mind an
            operatic weightiness (Puccini and other early twentieth century
            artists in particular, working in the opera <i>verisimo</i>
            tradition). This tone is immediately established during the credits,
            when the camera travels through such deep darkness -- a train tunnel
            -- that the lights flying by look almost like stars; the mundane
            experience and the heroic ambition juxtaposed. When you first see
            Wahlberg's Leo Handler, he's survived the most terrible mundane
            experience, eighteen months in prison for grand theft auto. And now
            he's on the train headed home, soon arriving at his mother Val's
            (Ellen Burstyn) apartment in Queens, where she's arranged a
            &quot;Welcome Home&quot; party for her dear boy. Leo looks out of
            place, subtly on edge, not quite knowing how to behave among these
            people used to comfort and deciding on their own what to eat for
            dinner. Within minutes, it's clear -- through some cryptic
            boy-bonding rituals, grunting and thumping backs and such -- that
            Leo's time in prison was the result of his taking the rap for
            trouble that involved other fellows, and that they're grateful to
            him for being a standup guy. But now he's got to deal with having a
            record and not being able to get work so easily, which means that
            despite his good intentions, Leo's headed deep into an old-school
            moral quandary. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            party scene is one of the grimmest I've seen in a movie: the
            lighting is gloomy, the characters look vaguely uncomfortable in
            their own skins, and the space around them is small and dreary, like
            they're living inside an experiment in light deprivation. Through
            all this, the sole metaphorical light is Leo's obvious affection for
            his Ma and his visible distress at having caused her so much pain.
            &quot;He's a good kid,&quot; she says, but you can tell that he
            feels like a bad one. Val displays that kind of stoic posture and
            barely stifled frailty that mothers in old Jimmy Cagney movies have,
            and you know right off the bat that she's probably not long for this
            world, and worse, that her illness and/or death will bring lasting
            agony for her only-wanna-do-right son. <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Leo
            isn't even through the door when he's greeted by his parole officer,
            who takes him aside for a chat about his plans. Leo mumbles, as if
            he believes it, &quot;I just wanna become a productive person again,
            you know, in society.&quot; Right. The PO leaves, and you meet this
            society into which Leo's dumped, that is, his &quot;friends&quot;
            and the complicated interrelationships that make up his family. His
            best friend since childhood is Willie Guttierrez (Joachin Phoenix),
            a slightly too-smooth character who flashes lots of cash -- seems
            that while Leo's been away Willie's found a gig working for Leo's
            uncle by marriage, Frank (Jimmy Caan, who, after <i>Bottle Rocket</i>,
            <i>The Way of the Gun</i>, and this film, is established as <i>the</i>
            go-to guy for poignantly crotchety, aging thugs). Frank's business
            grants the film its title: his company manufactures subway train
            parts, and so there's call for periodic trips to the train yards.
            Willie and his crew of scufflers make these trips at night, when
            they ruin the train parts made by a Latino-owned competing company
            (the competition is acute, since the city is legally bound to give
            ten per cent of its business to a minority-owned company). Willie
            ensures that Frank wins the contracts by sabotaging the other
            company's machinery and by paying off the men who make the decisions
            (including a Borough President played with perfect scumminess by
            Steve Lawrence), most often with tickets to sporting events, fine
            food and jewelry, and wads of money. <o:p>

            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Though
            Leo knows that he can't get involved with illegal shenanigans,
            Willie assures him that he'll look after him (&quot;I won't let you
            get into trouble&quot;), but in making this promise, he's got to
            ignore his own shaky position in the organization and city politics
            more generally, based on his own non-whiteness. This makes Willie a
            more complex, even intriguing, character than his thuggish behaviors
            suggest: repeatedly, you see one of the competing company's head
            guys reminding him that he'll never <i>really</i> be part of the
            club he wants so badly to join. (This layering of motive makes it
            that much more tragic that Willie descends quickly and violently
            into a doozy of a grand finale, which is the film's unarguable low
            point.) <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Leo's
            willing to let Willie guide him because, he says quite truthfully,
            &quot;I'm not too good with words.&quot; That he's stepping into a
            nest of nastiness will be abundantly clear to you, but then, you've
            probably seen at least one other Jimmy Caan movie. Besides, Willie's
            nice suits are impressive, as is his romance with Leo's beautiful
            cousin-for-whom-he-has-a-thing, Kitty's daughter Erica (played by
            Charlize Theron wearing punkish black leather ornamentation and blue
            nailpolish, and affecting a broadly New Yawk accent). Erica's mother
            is Val's very dramatic and somewhat desperately ambitious sister
            Kitty (Faye Dunaway), married to Frank -- and well, it's all a
            little much, isn't it? The rest of the story is straight-up gangland
            melodrama, wherein Leo is betrayed by Frank and Willie, and must
            figure out how to be his own man. There are a few scenes that mark
            this development well, as elegant visual set-pieces, where
            Wahlberg's furrowed brow or a shadow on a wall reveals more than any
            &quot;words&quot; might. For instance, Leo's second wrong decision
            (after throwing in with Willie) comes in the yards, as their
            banality turns stunningly nightmarish in an instant. Tagging along
            on one of Willie-and-company's sabotaging excursions, Leo suddenly
            finds himself caught between his decidedly feckless companions (who
            scamper off without him as soon as the alarm sounds) and a cop's
            threatening flashlight beam. The lines of the tracks seem to lay out
            Leo's unhappy fate, and he looks across them to see Willie
            committing a crime for which he -- Leo -- will be unjustly accused.
            And then it's clear: Leo is not out of place, as he's imagined
            himself, but inevitably a part of the world that has produced and
            continues to confine him. Ensuing events only build on the emotional
            and moral ground laid out in this moment. These events are
            increasingly overwrought and eventually exhausting. But the fact
            that they are set against such a relentlessly bleak backdrop helps
            to mediate what would otherwise be a full-on train wreck of
            emotional hyperbole. And Marky Mark, he does just fine. <o:p>
