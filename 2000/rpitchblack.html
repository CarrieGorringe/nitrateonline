<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="5"><b>T</b></font><font size="4">he
scene is grim and very familiar: a hulk of a space ship crawls through the
starry darkness, then runs into unexpected trouble, such that its crew is
awakened from travel-slumber ahead of schedule. The camera ricochets around the
chamber, dark and hard to read, save for the standard emergency beeper lights.
The narrative voice over offers a context: &quot;They say that most of your
brain shuts down in cryosleep, all but the primitive side, the animal
side.&quot; Unidentified as yet, the speaker identifies his fellow travelers, a
&quot;hoodoo man,&quot; &quot;some kinda woman,&quot; and, as he puts it,
&quot;my real problem, Mr. Johns,&quot; while you see the usual fast-cut, skewed
frame pod-shots. Then you see who's talking -- or perhaps, thinking -- this
introduction, an imposing musclehead wearing chains, jaw-lock, and blindfold, in
the only pod labeled &quot;Lockout Protocol.&quot; For all the regular visual
and narrative cues attending his preamble, this single shot suggests that this
guy is not your average narrator. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Damaged
by something &quot;unknown,&quot; the ship crashes onto a planet surface, hunks
of it burning and breaking off as it accelerates through the atmosphere. During
this terrifying descent, you witness a conflict between the pilot, Fry (Radha
Mitchell) and that problem fellow, Johns (Cole Hauser): she wants to save at
least the front part of the ship by ejecting the &quot;passengers,&quot; he
wants to try to save everyone. Her attempt is thwarted, not by his entreaties to
her humanity, but by the fact that the mechanism doesn't work. And so, everyone
crash-lands together, excepting the Captain, who's still in his pod when he's
pierced through by whatever it was that assaulted the ship. The survivors are
understandably afraid and angry to be stuck on a desert planet, but they take a
few moments to thank Fry for her excellent piloting, for saving their lives.
Unsurprisingly, she's a little uneasy with this display. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">With
this opening sequence, <i>Pitch Black </i>-- co-written by brothers Jim and Ken
Wheat with director David Twohy -- asserts outright its derivative sources,
quoting from the <i>Alien</i>, <i>Mad Max</i>, and <i>Terminator</i> series, <i>Blade
Runner</i>, <i>Fearless</i>, <i>Con Air</i>, and <i>The Fugitive</i>, even <i>Stagecoach,
</i>in the outlaw traveling with a group of &quot;civilized&quot; folks. Fry,
the reluctant hero, recalls Ripley and Sarah Conner of course, but also most
hard-ass guy-protagonists in recent SF-action movies, motivated less by morality
than self-interest. Mitchell, the Australian actor last seen playing a callow
New York photo editor in <i>High Art, </i>imbues Fry with contradictions: she's
girlish and stony, ambitious and careful, vulnerable and cruel. Resentful and
confused, she finally accepts the role of &quot;leader&quot; out of desperation,
defeated by her ostensible teammates' repeated ineptitude, carelessness, or
myopia. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">In
other words, <i>Pitch Black </i>is not about a motley crew that pulls itself
together in order to triumph over common adversaries. Rather, it's a study of
illogic, frustration, and disharmony, the stuff that's not supposed to happen in
standard action pictures. Further, it examines community fractures arising from
distrust, know-it-all-ness, and prejudice, all familiar territory for Twohy,
whose <i>The Arrival, </i>while burdened by goony horse-hocked aliens and
Charlie Sheen's earnestness, made a strong and often thoughtful
(SF-metaphorical) case against U.S. imperialism in South America. In <i>Pitch
Black, </i>even those characters who survive long enough to converse with one
another have no opportunity to bond in that mystical movie way. Their deaths are
fast and ripping, and take place at distances and in the dark, so there's no
opportunity for intimacy or amends-making (the one up-close death is indeed, the
film's single instant of direct and personal communication between two
characters, and that lasts twenty seconds, tops). To be sure, there are examples
of individuals making valiant or intelligent decisions, but most of what happens
in the film is accidental, horrific, and irredeemable. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As
soon as the ship crashes, it's clear that the situation is dire: looking out on
the blasted expanse of nothingness, Fry is moved to ask, &quot;Is this whole
planet dead?&quot; The answer is, yes and no. The planet has three suns, which
means it's real hot (the visuals are composed of grainy video and film stocks,
bleached out by cinematographer David Eggby, who also shot George Miller's <i>Mad
Max </i>on the same location twenty years ago, Australia's desolate Coober Pedy).
It also means there's no night; or rather, there's no night until there's an
eclipse, for which these twelve humans have arrived just in time. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">During
this extended period of pitch blackness (which, you're informed for no reason,
occurs every twenty-two years or so), the planet surface is swarmed by the
monsters who otherwise live below, winged, slam-headed shredders that resemble
H.R. Giger's designs for the <i>Alien</i> aliens, altered by creature designer
Patrick (<i>Godzilla</i>) Tatopolous and special effects supervisor Peter Chiang
(whose special effects for Tim Burton's <i>Batman </i>gave him useful experience
working in the dark) peter to accommodate <i>Pitch Black</i>'s plot premises.
For one thing, these creatures pick up on David Fincher's idea in <i>Alien 3, </i>in
that they are granted a visual point of view (with scampering night-visionish
camerawork). For another, they move very, very quickly (like the digital
creations they really are), undeterred by physical rules of conduct. And for a
third, they have an overt and specific human corollary (not <i>Alien</i>'s
Company, not <i>Terminator</i>'s Skynet), who is, it turns out, your narrator. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Riddick
(Vin Diesel) is the film's best example of irremediableness. Even less
sympathetic than his self-introduction would suggest, he's also increasingly
interesting: here's a Hicks who never comes around, a Terminator who holds out
as long as formula will allow, as his initial sick-fuck self. Surly and brutal,
Riddick is a convicted killer who's spent so much time in solitary black holes
that he's had his eyes surgically modified in order to see sans light: hence,
he's an important asset for the crew (like Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer), at
the same time that he's odiously and obviously a lot like their enemies, those
awful night-predators. At the time of the crash, Riddick is on his way to some
terrible &quot;slam,&quot; courtesy of the mercenary Johns. He escapes,
threatens the other humans, then realizes there are other, uglier, more
efficient stalkers around: &quot;Finally found something worse than me,
huh?&quot; he sneers, watching the others discover a crew member's tattered
remnants. He sees before anyone else, perhaps, the group's dysfunction,
predicting that, &quot;When the dying starts, this little psycho-fuck family of
ours is going to tear itself apart.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Riddick
and Johns, no surprise, share a ferocious mutual contempt, displayed in several
dick-swinging contests, which are easily the film's least interesting points,
except that they take to an extreme the kind of masculinity meltdown that's
insinuated in <i>Aliens. </i>These scenes -- in which Riddick and Johns hit and
kick, or shoot at and knife, each other, with no small amount of swaggery
self-importance -- tend to bring the rest of the action to dead halts. These
interruptions are so conspicuous as to draw attention to their use as devices,
the way that such scenes are typically used to reveal the greater man,
physically or morally. In <i>Pitch Black, </i>these fights tend to serve as
still more evidence that the guys are missing the point, that their focus on
their petty competition decreases everyone's chances to escape. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
film explores this macho dynamic explicitly, not only in the Johns-Riddick
relationship, but more interestingly, in two other characters. The first is the
&quot;hoodoo man,&quot; so summarily dismissed by Riddick at the film's
beginning. A Muslim cleric (Keith David) is shepherding three young boys, all
turbaned, fearful, and seeking spiritual understanding. Confronted by the
flesh-eating hordes, the group is hard pressed to fit their predicament into
anything resembling &quot;God's plan,&quot; and big meanie Riddick never lets
them forget it, hammering repeatedly at the uselessness of ethics and religious
faith: &quot;I absolutely believe in God,&quot; he tells the imam. &quot;And I
absolutely hate the fucker.&quot; The movie has some difficulty making the
imam's perspective clear, which David embodies more than he articulates, as the
film's stock dialogue affords few persuasive insights. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
other character who throws a wrench into generic gendering is the teenage-ish
Jack (Rhiana Griffith), who looks up to Riddick, wants his cool eyes and admires
his considerable skills. Of course, as the film goes on, Jack realizes a few
things, and begins to waver, thinking perhaps that the elusive, anxious Fry is a
worthy role model, much as the pilot repeatedly rejects the responsibility. It's
in Jack's perspective (which, admittedly, doesn't get much play) that <i>Pitch
Black </i>offers some shrewd meta-commentary on the relations between celebrity
and gender expectations, and adults and kids, as well as the hard-to-come-by
faith that allows any of these cultural strands to come together, ever. Flawed
and ambitious, <i>Pitch Black</i>'s murky challenge to SF-action heroic
conventions is its most redeeming feature.<o:p>
