            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 3 November 2000</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In <i>Relative Values</i>, Julie
            Andrews plays Felicity, Countess of Marshwood, whose son, the young
            Earl of Marshwood (the blandly handsome Edward Atterton), is about
            to return home and introduce her to the woman he is about to marry,
            a Hollywood movie star named Miranda Frayle (Jeanne Tripplehorn),
            whose previous and abruptly-terminated romance with the cowboy star
            Don Lucas (William Baldwin) has been plastered across the pages and
            covers of every movie magazine in creation. As if that weren't bad
            enough, it is also discovered that the Duchess' personal assistant,
            Moxie (Sophie Thompson) -- a member of the household staff -- is the
            movie star's real-life sister. In case you were wondering, the story
            is set in 1953, when there was still such a thing as &quot;class
            distinctions&quot; and whether or not one came from
            &quot;common&quot; origins.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Considering that this is Julie
            Andrews' first performance since her departure from the Broadway
            production <i>Victor/Victoria</i> and that it is based on a Noel
            Coward play, it would be nice to say that the film (which is having
            its U.S. premiere on the Starz channel this month, after playing
            theatrically in Europe) is a triumph. Unfortunately, it is not. The
            filmmakers -- director Eric Styles and screenwriters Paul Rattigan
            and Michael Walker -- stage the material as if it were a
            steeplechase. Whether this is a misguided attempt to create an
            antic, bubbly atmosphere (although there is a difference between
            &quot;speed&quot; and &quot;verve&quot;) or to keep the running time
            under ninety minutes is uncertain. What is certain is that Coward
            requires a certain amount of subtly, and the filmmakers have pretty
            much quashed that out of the material. And with the jumpiness of the
            actors and the multiple cuts imposed on many of the scenes, one
            could say that this is the Miracle-Slicer version of Noel Coward.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jeanne Tripplehorn's performance is
            fine -- she has the auburn Fifties glamour look down just right --
            but Sophie Thompson flounders badly in her performance, and the
            moment William Baldwin gallops onto the screen, you may feel like
            abruptly leaping under your chair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>On the other hand, Andrews brings grace and presence to her
            part, and one wishes that she had more screen time with Stephanie
            Beacham, whom I haven't seen in years but who still looks and acts
            gorgeous. The two actresses, who appear in an early scene set at a
            country house soiree amid a whirl of evening clothes and the clink
            of glasses, play wonderfully together. And Colin Firth, as the
            Duchess' nephew (and Coward's de-facto spokesperson in the story),
            shows an unexpected aptitude for delivering his lines with just the
            right, crisp, deftly-turned amount of style and poise -- which, if
            you're going to do Noel Coward at all, is what's definitely needed.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"></o:p>
