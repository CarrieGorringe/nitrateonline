            Ryder's kohl- and shadow-blackened eyes are the most stunning
            special effect in <i>Lost Souls</i>. Her eyes are always large and
            gorgeous, of course, which means that accentuating them like this
            might seem like overkill. But in context, I must say that the effect
            is quite splendid, that context being yet <i>another</i> tedious hoo-boy-the-devil's-among-us
            movie. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            isn't to say that everything around her doesn't <b><i>look</i></b>
            fabulous. Directed by the great Polish-born cinematographer Janusz
            Kaminski (whose momentous work includes <i>Schindler's List</i>, <i>Saving
            Private Ryan</i>, <i>Amistad</i>, <i>Lost World</i> -- basically all
            the recent super-Spielberg films -- and oh yeah, <i>Jerry Maguire</i>),
            <i>Lost Souls</i> makes the most of its requisite locations. The
            church interiors, the rectories, the tiny cell-like apartments, the
            mental hospital wards, the city streets -- they all look like
            they've been dreamed up by a hugely derivative but very tasteful set
            designer who's working with a decent budget. The light is golden
            and/or filtered gray (the kind where the dust particles become
            visible in shafts of light across plain wood floors), but most often
            just dark and squirmy, and when someone gets hold of a flashlight,
            well, stand back: Mulder and Scully have nothing on these guys. The
            architecture is also grandly creepy, not quite on the scale of
            Frankenstein's castle and bat-filled belfries, but still working its
            urban milieu to a shadowy and harrowing perfection, which is
            enhanced by what look to be buckets of rain dumped on characters at
            every crucial-decision moment (and by the end of the film, these
            moments are coming fast and hard). And, it goes without saying, the
            rain tends to make Ryder's pale and haunted countenance look even
            more pale and haunted, framed as it is by her dark, long, wet hair.
            And her eyes.. well, I've already extolled their virtues. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            you know what they say about judging books by their covers. For all
            these great surfaces, <i>Lost Souls</i> is pretty much a flat-liner.
            Industry gossip has it that it was on the shelf for more than a
            year, which means someone had serious doubts about it, and for a
            long time. It's a grim irony that New Line decided to go ahead and
            release it, finally, right on the heels of the re-release of <i>The
            Exorcist</i>, which has everyone chatting nostalgically about how
            scared they were when they first saw it, and comparing it to all its
            many, many, variously enfeebled descendants, most recently, Arnold's
            earnest <i>End of Days</i> (the Terminator and the Devil,
            mano-a-mano), Polanski and Depps' silly <i>The Ninth Gate</i> (at
            least Frank Langella looked like he was having a good time), and Kim
            Basinger's woeful <i>Bless the Child</i> (and frankly, there's no
            telling what possesses her when she makes script choices). The
            release of <i>Lost Souls</i> (which lists Meg Ryan as a producer)
            has done nothing to stem this decline. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Winona
            plays Maya Larkin, a former Satanic-possession case (you see her
            apparently quite painful exorcism in a few economical flashbacks),
            who has since dedicated herself to fighting Evil, the kind with a
            capital E. At the start of the film, she and her comrades --
            including Father Lareaux (John Hurt) and a rather intense deacon
            (Elias Koteas, who should have a handle on this fiendish tomfoolery
            by now, having appeared in last year's similarly-themed and
            underappreciated <i>Fallen</i>) -- are making it their business to
            rid good bodies of their internal demons. To this end, they run an
            exorcism on a guy named Henry (John Diel), currently incarcerated in
            a hospital for the criminally insane for murdering his entire
            family, under the auspices of a doctor (Alfre Woodard) who doesn't
            believe in this spiritual mumbo-jumbo but for some reason allows the
            crusaders (and they do march in like superheroes, their robes
            billowing in slow motion, captured in a series of low-angle
            aren't-they-formidable shots) to proceed. Though the exorcism is
            mostly disastrous, the intrepid crew learns that Satan is about to
            come to earth in human form. And no, he's not showing up as
            Elizabeth Hurley. Rather, he's going to inhabit a human male body --
            one that has been carefully raised and will be ready at age
            thirty-three, and one that's arguably as pretty as Hurley's. This
            man-about-to-be-&quot;transformed&quot; (this would be the repeated,
            technical term) is one Peter Kelson (Ben Chaplin, who also has
            unusually large dark eyes: if he were a girl, he'd be Winona Ryder).

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kelson
            is a best-selling author, specifically, a biographer-analyst of
            serial and mass killers, as well as a popular television talk show
            guest (and you know the Dark Prince is always looking for access to
            media!). This last point is very convenient, as it allows Maya to
            hear his name announced one day while she's working in her cell-like
            room where she lives at Father Lareaux's church. She also hears him
            say that he has a well-defined notion of what makes bad people bad,
            which is, in a nutshell, that there is no such thing as &quot;Evil
            with a capital E.&quot; You see where this is headed: he's destined
            to hook up with our lovely sour girl Maya, who has a deep and
            abiding belief in just that sort of Evil. Still, when she comes with
            the bad news that he is about to become the Satanic Possession Case
            to beat all, the Anti-Christ Himself, Peter is, understandably,
            skeptical. So he sends her packing. But then, after about a minute,
            he starts a-wondering... hmmm, just what does it mean that my Uncle
            James (Philip Baker Hall), a priest, has been behaving so strangely?
            That his parishioners wear black all the time? That my brother (W.
            Earlman Brown) looks like Mark David Chapman and can't seem to stop
            eating even just after there's just been an attempt on my life and
            the cops are interviewing us? Or that my pretty blond girlfriend
            (Sarah Wynter) has drawn a huge pentagram on the ceiling of the
            apartment right below our bedroom? And why, oh why, is it always
            raining? <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            movie is clearly invested in Peter's struggle, with the possibility
            or even the necessity of faith. It's imperative for the Big Plan
            that he does not properly believe in anything -- God or the Devil.
            It just wouldn't be appropriate for Satan's vessel. And there are
            other measures Peter has to make, for instance, he has to have been
            born of incest, never been baptized, and have dreams of the numbers
            666, stuff like that (perhaps the weirdest &quot;personal data&quot;
            point revealed about Peter -- by a police psychic, of all people --
            is that his male research assistant has a crush on him, but the film
            rushes by that revelation, like it just can't quite deal with it).
            But as interesting as all this Peter-info is, Maya is really the
            film's focus. Partly that's because she's Winona, and partly because
            Maya is our point of entry, which means we spend most of your time
            -- and it does feel like you're watching all this unfold for a long,
            long time -- with her. The camera loves to make long slow passes
            over her beautifully furrowed brow, to contemplate her slight,
            overburdened figure as she studies Father Lareaux's books. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And
            for those hoping for a little action, there are a couple of scenes
            which take you inside Maya's head. On the up side, this allows for
            some impressive digitized effects, as when a public bathroom turns
            all alive and creepy-crawly like rooms in <i>The Shining's</i>
            Overlook Hotel. But instead of floods of blood, the
            already-puke-green bathroom gets all throbbing and loud, then gushy
            and replete with overflowing sewage, crumbling walls, and a stalker
            coming at her with a big shiny knife. Eww. Maya knows enough not to
            believe Beelzebub's scams, and basically blows him off during this
            horrific display, but not until you get a good idea of how ripe it
            must be in that bathroom in her mind. Eventually, it is precisely
            her strength of mind -- her faith but also, more importantly, her
            will -- that is of greatest consequence in this battle for the
            future of the planet. That none of it feels of much consequence to
            us, well, that's a problem. <o:p>
