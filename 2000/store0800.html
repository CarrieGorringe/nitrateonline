<meta name="description" content="Film history is literally being rewritten with the advent of DVD, and nowhere is this more true than in the horror genre. After last year’s list, which one wag called “horror’s greatest hits,” this year’s edition of the Fright Film Festival mixes a healthier dose of eclecticism into the roster. This is possible because of the restoration and refurbishment of numerous classic and cult titles.  While the majority of these films are available in the DVD format, many also exist in tape versions and some are even still available on laserdisc. All year of release notations refer to 2000 unless otherwise indicated.">

Maguire, who gave a wonderful performance as the doleful but brilliant young
author in <i>Wonder Boys</i>, did a complete one-sixty here and gives a
performance that lights up <i>The Cider House Rules</i>, based on the John
Irving novel, about people who go about the potentially grim job of tending
after unwanted children, and unwanted pregnancies, at a Maine orphanage in the
1930s and 40s. Homer (played by Maguire) assists the orphanage's physician, Dr.
Larch (Michael Caine, who, despite a strained New England accent, picked up an
Oscar for his performance), picks up a crash course in obstetrics, acts as
friend and paternal figure to the orphanage's other children, and meets the
beautiful Candy (Charlize Theron, in her best performance to date), causing him
to be drawn to making his way for the first time in the outside world. The film
is more about how people make the decisions, good or bad, that affect the rest
of their lives, and director Lasse Hallström, who has successfully handled
challenging dramatic material in the past, creates an enriching film, here.
Delroy Lindo also gives an astonishing performance as one of a group of seasonal
fruit pickers with whom Homer works for a time. Viewers may also want to take
into consideration that the film makes use of some exceptional widescreen
cinematography (by Oliver Stapleton). The DVD release features audio commentary,
deleted footage and a featurette on the production.</span></font></p>

Spacey in a minor key, <i>The Big Kahuna</i> marks the two-time Oscar winner’s
debut as producer (via the Trigger Street imprint) and is adapted by Roger Rueff
from his play, <i>Hospitality Suite</i>. Essentially a three-hander, the film
stars Spacey as Larry, the alpha male in a group of Lodestar Laboratories
employees (industrial lubricant division) waiting for the start of a convention
mixer in a top floor hospitality suite in Wichita, Kansas. During the course of
the ninety-minute film, as they pursue the title bigwig they’re trying to
pitch their product to during and after the party, each man’s defenses are
peeled away to reveal what really makes them tick. Danny DeVito gives a subdued
and world-weary turn as Larry, while Peter Facinelli (also in <i>Supernova</i>,
below) as the idealistic young Bob brings God into the equation, representing
youthful idealism, or something. <i>Glengarry Glen Ross</i> this talkfest
ain’t, but it does showcase another one of those smarmy, hail-fellow-well-met
Spacey performances that seem to tap into some sort of current social gestalt --
call it millennial corporate irony, the son (or even grandson) of the type of
big-business cad Jack Lemmon used to essay so gratingly well in the 1950s.
Currently available as a rental-only tape, the DVD edition is a stripped-down
affair featuring production notes and the theatrical trailer.</span></font></p>

Soderbergh continues his remarkable run of unconventionally conventional genre
exercises (<i>Out of</i> <i>Sight</i>, <i>The Limey</i>) with perhaps his
neatest trick of all: in <i>Erin Brockovich</i>, Julia Roberts undergoes a
remarkable and long-overdue transformation from fetishized movie star to actual
actress. The crusading title character was a floozie-ish single mom who, with
the help of her befuddled boss Ed (Albert Finney), brought the mighty Pacific
Gas &amp; Electric power company to its knees over a ghastly case of polluted
groundwater in a remote desert town (marvelously photographed by veteran
cameraman Ed Lachman, whose extensive resume includes both <i>The Limey</i> and
Werner Herzog’s <i>Stroszek</i>). As with <i>Out of Sight</i>, the film was
produced by Danny DeVito’s Jersey Films banner, and although there were
reports of discord on the set the finished product is vital, shrewd and
relatively free of the mannered Roberts style that people seem to love but often
makes her look like she wandered in from a second-rate soap opera. In fact, that
Oscar talk that began circulating almost as soon as the movie was released
isn’t too far off the mark. The generous DVD edition includes a remarkably
candid commentary by Soderbergh during a large number of deleted scenes, where
he avows that his best strategy while filming the admittedly long script was to
&quot;shoot it all and figure it out in the editing room.&quot; In fact, the
original cut of the film ran well over three hours, and it is a fascinating
exercise to watch and listen as the director relates the reasons behind the
obviously difficult, yet judicious cuts. <o:p>

Whitaker, in a brilliant performance, as an independent hitman who has recreated
himself by way of the ancient philosophical tenants of the Japanese samurai,
right down to devoting himself to serving one &quot;master&quot;, in this case a
member of a group of aging, near sedentary gangsters. Jim Jarmusch's film starts
out intriguingly, remains intriguing, but it never entirely rises above the
level of the unusual, taking on more dramatic significance at the end than what
it had when it first starts out (a recurring problem, I found, with many of
Jarmusch's films). Henry Silva is particularly memorable as one of the gangster
bosses; the scenes between Whitaker and Issach de Bankole, as an ice cream
vendor who is the hitman's best friend even though he only speaks French (and
the hitman does not), are quite good; and there's a superb original music score
by R.Z.A., mixing and combining hip-hop and rap music beat with Asian music
motifs. The DVD edition features the thirty-minute &quot;The Odyssey: Journey
Into the Life of a Samurai,&quot; deleted footage, a music video and an isolated
music track.</span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">If the
movie's flawed, it's not Kim Basinger's fault. Her performance enables us to
understand the otherwise bewildering motivations of the main character, who,
with her young son, follows her second husband (Vincent Perez) into the African
bush to live on his remote cattle ranch, and then must contend with a series of
crises ranging from her husband's long periods of absence to the weather,
poachers, and an encounter with an extremely lethal puff-adder snake. (The
picture is based on the experiences of an actual woman, Kuki Tallmann, who would
later write about them.) The film's director, Hugh Hudson, has directed one good
picture (<i>Chariots of Fire</i>) and several bad ones after that (<i>Greystoke</i>,
<i>Lost Angels</i>, <i>My Life So Far</i>), and this picture doesn't appear so
much made as pieced together, with a lot of voiceovers to try and explain just
what the audience is supposed to be looking at. The film also features the first
music score in years by Maurice Jarre, who previously wrote music for <i>Laurence
of Arabia</i> and <i>Doctor Zhivago</i>, among others. Not a terrible picture
altogether, but it should have been a better one. The DVD features production
notes, a trailer and a &quot;Making Of&quot; featurette.</span></font></p>

parts majesty and mystery, P.T. Anderson’s much-anticipated follow-up to
1997’s <i>Boogie Nights</i> is nothing less than a <i>Nashville</i> (see
below) for the late 1990s, complete with two major players from that landmark
film in minor roles. The action is shifted to Anderson’s stomping grounds,
SoCal’s San Fernando Valley, and the style is amped up to reflect the
cacophony of modern living. And while much will be written of the labrynthine
relationships among the characters, the across-the-board emotionally accuracy of
the cast (not coincidentally, Tom Cruise has never been better) and the
extraordinary use of Aimee Mann’s music, perhaps the most talked-about element
of the film will be that out-of-nowhere climax, predicted throughout the film by
references, both veiled and overt, to a single bible verse, Exodus 8:2. <i>Magnolia</i>
may not have smitten the box office, but it confirms Anderson’s status as
among the most promising young filmmakers in the world. Disc one of the two-disc
DVD edition features the film itself. Disc two has a generous assortment of TV
spots and trailers, as well as Mann’s &quot;Save Me&quot; video. But the
centerpiece of the package is Mark Rance’s &quot;That Moment,&quot; a
72-minute video documentary made during the film’s gargantuan 100-day shooting
schedule (up from an already ambitious 79) that includes a few tantalizing
glimpses of the plot strand featuring Orlando Jones as the mysterious killer
that was left on the cutting room floor. And on a related note, those of you who
snapped up the first pressing of Anderson’s magnificent <i>Boogie Nights</i>
will be dismayed to learn there’s a newer edition that promises additional
extras. Note to filmmakers: let’s not make this a habit, OK? Get your DVD’s
right the first time and avoid disgruntled consumers.&nbsp;</font></span></p>

technically accomplished yet dramatically manipulative imitation of the already
clichéd Steven Spielberg-helmed big lizard movies on which many of its key
personnel toiled (and for which special effects-whiz-turned director Michael
Lantieri won an Oscar), <i>Komodo</i> is a good example of the modern B picture,
a good-looking yet cheaply produced and relatively humorless <i>Jurassic Park</i>
knockoff for the undiscriminating video (or DVD) hound. Jill Hennessey stars as
a psychologist who accompanies a traumatized young man (Kevin Zegers) back to
the island where the title dragons ate his family, only to find a whole mess of
‘em ravenous from the lack of food due to a rapacious oil company. Shot in
Australia, the film’s general level of concentration can be summed up by the
lack of accuracy in the story: the DVD case says it takes place off the coast of
Florida, a title card on the print says North Carolina, and one of the producers
in the production featurette says South Carolina. No matter, for the real stars
of the picture are the dragons themselves, a cross between Phil Tippett
animatronic creations and computer imagery that slither and drool and are
lightning-fast when the story calls for it and slow as molasses when a principal
cast member is endangered. As glossy as the finished product is, at some point
the astute viewer will wonder, &quot;she left <i>Law and Order</i> for
this?&quot;</span>

feature as is likely to be made for awhile (one hopes), <i>Simpatico</i> is the
debut directorial effort (uh-oh) of Matthew Warchus, from Sam Shepard’s play
(hmmm), and stars Nick Nolte, Jeff Bridges, Sharon Stone, Catherine Keener and
Albert Finney (wow!) as a group of people variously involved in a long-time scam
to cheat at the track by switching horses (one of which is named Simpatico).
Unfortunately, the wattage of that cast can’t overcome the seemingly
deliberate murkiness of the proceedings: Warchus and co-adaptor David Nicholls
seem so determined to obfuscate an already tangled narrative at every turn that
all one is left to hang on to are the performances, which often seem as lost as
the plot. The spartan DVD edition highlights the luminous cinematography of <i>Almost
Famous</i> DP John Toll (winner of back-to-back Oscars for <i>Legends of the
Fall</i> and <i>Braveheart</i>), but that’s about it.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Deep in space, the crew of a medical vessel
becomes entangled with a sinister force that can either rejuvenate life or
destroy it completely. The name Walter Hill (director of <i>The Warriors</i>, <i>48
Hrs.</i>;<i> </i>script doctor extraordinaire) doesn’t appear anywhere on the
packaging of either the tape or DVD editions of this stylish and substantive
sci-fi film, which bears a 1999 copyright and the directorial credit of one
&quot;Thomas Lee&quot; (read: Hill) but was ignominiously dumped into theaters
early in 2000 (how poorly was it sold? After you watch the DVD and twenty
minutes or so of deleted scenes, check out the profoundly stupid trailer). Back
to Hill: there’s a story there, detailed in an illuminating article by Gregory
Solman in the July/August issue of &quot;Film Comment.&quot; Suffice it to say,
Hill had his final cut taken away from him and severely chopped up. Thus,
MGM’s sparkling DVD edition of the film serves as a cautionary primer for just
how severely a filmmaker’s vision can be compromised -- and, in point of fact,
the <i>Supernova</i> that was released is markedly inferior to the one Hill
envisioned. If the beleaguered-crew-in-space theme is familiar, well, Hill was
instrumental in the development and writing of the <i>Alien</i> franchise,
making his poor treatment at the hands of the studio even more mystifying. James
Spader is terrific as a typically taciturn Hill hero, while Peter Facinelli is
light years removed from the naïve bible-thumper he plays in <i>The Big Kahuna</i>
(see above) and fine turns are delivered by Angela Bassett, Lou Diamond
Phillips, Robert Forster, Robin Tunney and Wilson Cruz (<i>Rent</i>). As
mentioned, the DVD features that awful trailer, as well as Hill’s deleted
scenes. Maybe one day the cuts will be restored to the print itself, finally
preserving the vision of a director who deserves far better treatment than this.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Long considered the most heavy-handed of
Shakespeare’s tragedies (of which it was the first), &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot;
is here given a prodigiously imaginative treatment by theater director Julie
Taymor that despite its surreal and modernist trappings gives a good argument
for justifying the play’s initial popularity with audiences in the late
sixteenth century. Anthony Hopkins essays the title role, a Roman officer
returning from a triumphant war with the Goths and finding himself swept up in a
byzantine domestic power struggle punctuated by stylized, pulpy gore (limbs are
cut off, competitors are baked into pies - that sort of thing). The major
players include Alan Cumming as reptilian emperor Saturnius, James Frain (<i>Reindeer
Games</i>) as Saturnius’ brother Bassianus, Laura Fraser as Lavinia, Titus’
daughter and the woman they fight over, and, in the film’s most sustained
revelation, Jessica Lange as the devious and lusty Tamora, the Goth queen
captured by Titus during his campaign. The DVD edition features a costume
gallery, both commentary and a question-and-answer session with Taymor, a
&quot;Making Of&quot; featurette, trailers, and scene-specific commentary from
Hopkins and Harry J. Lennix, who is superb as Tamora’s doomed moor lover. <i>Titus</i>
was produced by Paul Allen’s Clear Blue Sky production entity, and the lavish
attention to detail and unbridled imagination of the costume and production
design highlight the distinctive yet familiar landscapes and urban canyons of
Pula and Rome, where the film was shot.</font></p>

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Japanese
director Hirokazu Kore-eda’s follow-up to the exquisite <i>Maborosi</i>
(itself available in a sell-through tape edition and DVD in October), <i>After
Life</i> begins with a haunting premise: if Heaven was only a single memory from
your life, which memory would it be? To answer that question, the film supposes
a way-station on the way to the Final Reward in which counselors work with the
newly-deceased to help them choose that single memory with which they’ll spend
eternity. One man wants to remember a gentle breeze felt in his youth, while a
woman wants to remember dancing with her brother in a red dress. Then, the film
charts the progress of creating these tableaux, utilizing the same production
methods used to film a movie: stories are decided on, sets are built, sound
effects are recorded and the memories are brought to, uh, life. A movie full of
dignity and no little mischief, <i>After Life</i> marks its maker as a film
humanist in the same vein as Ingmar Bergman. Priced at the moment for the rental
market (read: expensive), the VHS tape of <i>After Life</i> will be followed
September 25 by a DVD said to include production notes and at least one
theatrical trailer. Here’s a suggestion: try and see these films in the order
they were made -- <i>Maboros</i>i first, followed by <i>After Life</i> -- so you
too can say you’re charting the progress of a new auteur in the making.&nbsp;</font></span></p>

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Perhaps
more than any other film comedian in the early days of movies, W.C. Fields is an
acquired taste. His absurdist brand of humor, at once dry and surreal, endures
for the simple reason that the movies bear up under repeated viewings; in fact,
it’s almost a necessity to watch them over and over, if only to figure out why
they’re so funny. In his second-to-last feature, <i>The Bank Dick</i> (which
he wrote under the moniker &quot;Mahatma Kane Jeeves&quot;), Fields as
unemployed layabout Egbert Souse -- Soosay, if you don’t mind -- replaces
drunk movie director A. Pismo Clam on a location shoot in his hometown of
Lompoc, California before chance lands him in the job of bank detective -- after
which the movie becomes a riff on the comic possibilities of his new-found
notoriety. The stellar comic supporting cast includes future Stooge Shemp Howard
as the bartender at Fields’ regular haunt, The Black Pussy, and Preston
Sturges regular Franklin Pangborn as bank examiner J. Pinkerton Snoopington. The
digital transfer overseen by the Criterion Collection utilized a 35mm fine-grain
master print and optical track, making for a pristine disc in the original 1:33
(full-screen) ratio. <i>W.C. Fields: 6 Short Films</i> features his first ever
appearance, exhibiting his billiards skill in the silent 1915 <i>Pool Sharks</i>,
as well as all five of the talking shorts he made between 1930 and 1933.
They’re all good, but the gem of the bunch is the surreal 1933 masterpiece <i>Fatal
Glass of Beer</i>, among the most inexplicably funny shorts ever made. As is
usual for the Criterion Collection, the quality is excellent, especially given
the disparate source material the technical crew had to work with. Over the
years the critical and commercial fortunes of the pioneers of film comedy have
dipped and risen; the work on these discs may not lift Fields higher in the
pantheon, but they’re a persuasive argument for his distinct and subversive
brand of comedy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span></p>

Video offers DVD editions of the collected works of the Brothers Quay, first
released on tape in late 1999. Complex, often impenetrable and utterly
fascinating, these meticulously created stop-motion flights of fancy were
created by Timothy and Stephen Quay, reclusive identical twins who draw upon the
strong Eastern European influences of their rural Pennsylvania upbringing to
lure the viewer into bizarre and unforgettable works composed entirely in
Koninck, their London studio. The collection DVD includes their most famous
works, <i>The Cabinet of Jan Svankmajer </i>(the Czech animator is perhaps their
most important influence) and the astonishing <i>Street of Crocodiles</i>, as
well as two music video collaborations with His Name is Alive (the Quays
apprenticed in advertising and contributed to Peter Gabriel’s legendary
&quot;Sledgehammer&quot; video). Expanding upon the video edition, the disc also
features their first short work, the 21-minute 1979 film <i>Nocturna
Artificialia</i>, as well as a four-minute interview with the brothers and a
trailer for <i>Institute Benjamenta</i>. No less fascinating but a good deal
more challenging is their 1995 feature <i>Institute Benjamenta</i>, an
atmospheric meditation on servitude and fairytales with the quite logical
secondary title &quot;This Dream People Call Human Life.&quot; The disc edition
also includes a 15-minute assemblage of behind-the-scenes footage from the set,
as well as the same trailer and interview. Once experienced, the work of the
Brothers Quay can never be forgotten -- or explained.</span></font><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With each passing year, Joel and Ethan Coen’s
<i>Fargo</i> looks better and better, a multifaceted yet concentrated blast of
satirical Americana supposedly based on the true story of a kidnapping and
multiple murder in Minnesota. When morose car salesman Jerry Lundegaard (William
H. Macy) gets in trouble pulling a scam at the dealership, he hires two laconic
and inept thugs (Steve Buscemi, Peter Stormare) to kidnap his wife so he can
bail himself out with the ransom. Instead, just about everyone ends up either in
prison or dead -- except for the intrepid and very pregnant cop who breaks the
case, Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand, who won an Oscar for her perfectly
calibrated performance -- as did the Coens for their script). Finally available
on DVD from MGM, the disc starts a little rough with some dirt evident on the
source print during the snowbound opening credits but soon settles down to a
clear, satisfactory image. Although there are no extras on the disc save the
original theatrical trailer, the four-page booklet has some interesting
background into the gestation and casting of the film, including Macy’s
immortal threat &quot;I’m not leaving until I get the role. If I have to kill
your pets, I’ll do it.&quot; Also, this is one of those discs that has a
full-frame version on one side and a widescreen transfer on the other; viewers
who opt for the former deprive themselves of cinematographer Roger A. Deakin’s
subtly funny compositions.</font></p>

in contemporary Japan. At once among his best and most atypical films, <i>Good
Morning</i> (essentially a Technicolor update of his silent film <i>I Was Born,
But…</i>)<i> </i>is quite a bit more upbeat and spry than the majority of his
other works. In a small subdivision outside Japan, two youngsters attempt to
persuade their father to buy a newfangled television set. He resists, claiming
&quot;TV will produce one hundred million idiots.&quot; The prescience of that
statement aside, the film finds the family wrestling with the clash of older,
more leisurely customs with a fast-paced middle-class and entirely new norm. The
kids protest the lack of TV by refusing to use such &quot;pointless&quot;
phrases as the title greeting, a stance which brings about misunderstanding and
confusion among the adults over some missing womens’ club dues. Thus is the
importance of tradition underscored. This Criterion Collection DVD release
offers a fine Technicolor transfer (from a print, not the negative) and no
additional material; for Ozu’s fans, the existence of this disc is quite
enough.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">What’s
the big deal about a thirty-year-old Clint Eastwood World War II actioner?
Moviegoers surprised by the easy banter between his Clintness and Donald
Sutherland in the late summer hit <i>Space Cowboys</i> will be even more shocked
at their first co-starring vehicle three decades ago: making a very belated
debut in any kind of widescreen format whatsoever, the 1970 comedic World War II
drama <i>Kelly’s Heroes</i> reveals itself on DVD to be the missing link
between <i>Three Kings</i> and<i> Saving Private Ryan</i>. On his way inland
from the Normandy invasion, Clint’s steely Lieutenant Kelly learns of a huge
cache of gold behind enemy lines. Enlisting the services of a ragtag group of
hustlers and misfits from his and the surrounding units (including
Sutherland’s proto-hippie tank commander, Animal), he eludes the Nazis and
gets the gold with the help of an opportunistic German officer. Future TV stars
Telly Savalas (<i>Kojak</i>), Carroll O’Connor (<i>All in the Family</i>, the
TV version of <i>In the Heat of the Night</i>), Gavin McLeod (<i>The Mary Tyler
Moore Show</i>) and Stuart Margolin (<i>The Rockford Files</i>) share screen
time with Eastwood, Sutherland, Don Rickles (occasionally lapsing into schtick)
and (briefly) Harry Dean Stanton -- without the &quot;Harry&quot; -- in director
Brian G. Hutton’s much funnier follow-up to <i>Where Eagles Dare</i>. Long
unavailable in its original letterboxed format, the DVD features Dolby Digital
5.1 remastering, a trailer, and those rugged Yugoslav locations.&nbsp;</span></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="6"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt">When
this adaptation of Ursula K. LeGuin's novel aired, for only a few times, around
1979 - 80, word-of-mouth rapidly spread and it soon came to be regarded as one
of the best science-fiction films ever made. I would not go quite so far in
categorizing it in those terms (I think the unavailability of the film, after it
was broadcast, had more than something to do with its building a mystique), but
it is rather good and it effectively uses the science-fiction genre to explore
ideas about existence and reality in ways that could not be dramatized just as
well in other genres (the film's popularity also probably had something to do
with the <i>Star Wars</i> phenomenon, at the time). Bruce Davison plays a menial
worker in a devastated-looking Portland, Oregon of the near-future who is deeply
troubled by the possibilities that his nightly dreams are, in spite of himself,
altering daily reality; Kevin Conway is the psychiatrist who initially tries to
straighten him out, then sees the potentiality of exploiting his ability;
Margaret Avery (who would later appear in <i>The</i> <i>Color Purple</i>) plays
a social worker who tries to intervene on Davison's behalf. Directed by Fred
Barzyk and David E. Lonton, from a screenplay by Robert E. Swayhill and Diane
English, and they pull off some wonderful surprises by the time the story's
conclusion arrives. The DVD includes a Bill Moyers interview with LeGuin.<o:p>

Vision Cinema is to be applauded for the pristine new VHS tape transfers of
these two early, pivotal films by Czech director Milos Forman, the dean of the
1960s New Wave movement there. A shrewd observer of human foibles and an
extraordinary director of actors, Forman has stumbled recently with <i>The
People vs, Larry Flynt</i> and <i>Man in the Moon</i> but came to modest
prominence in the west with <i>Blonde</i> and <i>Ball </i>at a time when Czech
society was obscured behind the Iron Curtain. In the former, a lonely young
woman who works in a shoe factory has a fling with an itinerant piano player.
During the latter (Forman’s last film before coming to America and a career
that has included <i>One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest</i> and <i>Amadeus</i>),
the middle class is lampooned via a celebration ineptly organized by a local
fire brigade during which everything goes wrong. Each of these films features
Forman’s unique blend of sarcasm and compassion, in which institutions are
ruthlessly criticized while the people who make them up are seen as appealing
eccentrics. Also available as part of this release and highly recommended is
Ivan Passer’s 1965 drama <i>Intimate Lighting</i> (<i>Intimni osvetleni</i>);
Passer co-wrote both Forman films and went on to a Hollywood career that to date
includes the excellent <i>Born to Win</i>, <i>Cutter’s Way</i> (a.k.a. <i>Cutter
and Bone</i>) and that startlingly good cable biopic <i>Stalin</i> (1992, with
Robert Duvall as the dictator). As happened with the migration of German film
artists and technicians during the 1930s, Europe’s loss was once again
Hollywood’s gain.</span></font></p>

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Although
nearly forgotten by a generation of young cineastes due to its recent
unavailability in any format, Robert Altman’s collaborative, kaleidoscopic,
magnificent <i>Nashville</i>, coming as it does to DVD on the eve of the
presidential election, reveals itself to be not only the inspiration for Paul
Thomas Anderson’s <i>Boogie Nights</i> and <i>Magnolia</i> (see the latter,
above), but an incisive, benevolent and ultimately inspiring slice of mid-1970s
Americana as well. Strung together by the connective tissue of Replacement Party
candidate Hal Phillip Walker’s traveling campaign van (in which the unseen
politician exorts the populace via loudspeaker to abolish the National Anthem,
tax churches and remove lawyers from Congress) and the silent motorcycle
meanderings of Tricycle Man (Jeff Goldblum), the film follows two dozen
characters from all walks of life as they move through the traffic jams, clubs,
bars and churches of the town dubbed &quot;the Athens of the south,&quot;
culminating in an outdoor political rally that provides a cautionary epiphany to
the film’s events. <i>Nashville</i> is about a lot of things, not the least of
which is the complicity between social classes and the tragic consequences of
misunderstanding that imperative. Two of the film’s stars also appear in
Anderson’s <i>Magnolia</i>, the most prominent of which is barfly Henry
Gibson, whose performance as country music popinjay Haven Hamilton may be the
best thing about the film. The DVD’s extras include an interview with Altman
where he reveals some early casting preferences (Robert Duvall for Gibson,
Louise Fletcher for Lily Tomlin) and a commentary that isn’t so much constant
as appropriately pithy. Also worth seeking out is the film’s soundtrack,
featuring the songs written by the cast and performed by them in the film. Long
out of print, the new CD features all 13 of the tracks on the original LP
(despite web postings to the contrary).</font></span></p>

Fellini’s feature debut, <i>Variety Lights</i> bears established Neorealist
filmmaker Alberto Lattuada’s name as co-director, but there’s little doubt
into which man’s filmography this work belongs (Fellini professed to not
remembering &quot;which scenes were directed by Lattuada and which by me,&quot;
but he inevitably hastened to add &quot;I regard the film as one of
mine.&quot;). No argument from the scholars, who see in the story of a tawdry
touring theatrical troupe the germ of ideas that would populate Fellini’s
entire oeuvre. In truth the film is a family affair, as Lattuada (with whom
Fellini had previously collaborated on a handful of scripts) was married to
leading lady Carla Del Poggia, and the young female co-star Giulietta Masina,
soon to be known to the world for her roles in <i>La Strada</i> (1954), <i>Nights
of Cabiria</i> (1957) and <i>Juliet of the Spirits</i> (1957), was even then
married to Fellini. Three years later, Fellini embarked on his bonafide solo
career with the satirical romantic comedy <i>The White Sheik </i>(<i>Lo sceicco
bianco</i>), and the rest, as they say, is film history. Criterion’s DVD
edition of <i>Variety Lights</i> has little in the way of extras, but Andrew
Sarris’ brief essay in the accompanying fold-out brochure is illuminating, and
the transfer itself is generally spotless, restoring some black and white luster
to a film that heretofore existed in notoriously poor prints. Special kudos to
Michael W. Wiese for the fine audio restoration.<o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">At its
world premiere screening during the 1997 Toronto film festival, audience members
knew they’d found something special: Argentine
cinematographer-turned-first-time-director Carlos Marcovich’s <i>Who the Hell
is Juliette?</i> , initially financed with $5000 he’d saved shooting
commercials, is an unclassifiable dramatic documentary (or documentary drama)
about two young women, Cuban Juliette (Yuliet Ortega) and Mexican Fabiola (Fabiola
Quiroz), brought together in a mutual search for their respective fathers, by no
less than the filmmaker himself. Marcovich has said he was looking for a
&quot;day to day reality,&quot; and the film reflects that struggle, shot as it
was over a three-year period with a crew of only two. The director’s
enthusiasm for the project is reflected in the notes printed on the inner sleeve
of the Kino Video DVD release, and the transfer itself preserves the beauty that
first attracted Marcovich to Cuba.</span></font></p>
