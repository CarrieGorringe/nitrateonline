            begins with a crime in progress. Harry (Jared Leto) is taking his
            mom's TV set in order to sell it for drug money. It so happens that
            Mom -- Sara (Ellen Burstyn) -- is in the apartment, and she can't
            help but complain just a little bit, even though it's obvious that
            she's afraid of Harry when he gets into this &quot;mood,&quot; this
            desperate need for a hit. And so she locks herself in her bedroom,
            while he paces and frets in the den, and the screen splits to show
            both, in intensive, anxious close-ups. Pressed up against the door,
            Sara hears what we see: about to wheel the TV out on its cart, Harry
            discovers that it's chained to the wall and he explodes. Sara
            cringes and sighs, mumbling through the door, &quot;It's not for
            you, it's for the robber!&quot; Then, defeated, she slips her key
            under the door: you see it from both angles, hers and his.
            &quot;Ma!&quot; Harry yells, &quot;Why you gotta make me feel so
            guilty?&quot; She apologizes some more, the screen turns wide again,
            and whoosh -- Harry's gone, pushing the set down the burned-out
            daylight of the street with his buddy Tyrone (Marlon Wayans). As the
            credits run, a close fish-eye lens distorts them terrifically,
            simultaneously compressing and elongating their glinty-eyed
            expressions and about-to-be-happy grins. Everything around them is
            weird and hot and throbbing, as if the screen itself is announcing,
            &quot;We're gonna get high! We're gonna get high!&quot; </span></font></b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Requiem
            for a Dream</font></span></i><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
            is all about what it takes to get high -- to purchase a high,
            maintain it, and survive it, and to deal with its consequences. The
            dream of the title -- taken from the Hubert Selby Jr. novel on which
            director Darren Aronofsky based his screenplay, co-written with
            Selby -- is monumental, irresistible, and unattainable, in other
            words, dead from jump. It's a dream of consuming -- consuming drugs,
            TV, sex, food -- anything that will allow you, even for a second, to
            be someone else. It's a dream of consuming yourself. And it's
            addictive. Sara needs her TV (and will go down to the pawn shop to
            retrieve it just hours after Harry leaves it there) not because it
            provides her some passing distraction from the tedium of her lonely
            widow's existence, but because it provides her with a spectacularly
            mobile surface onto which she projects her preferred self, her
            unknown, unreachable, and completely unafraid self. But as she
            discovers, this self -- so fictional and so demanding -- is very
            scary. </span></font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Requiem

            shows this surface as the most nightmarish, most horrific and
            mean-spirited, of game shows, a monstrosity emceed by Tappy Tibbons
            (the fearless Christopher McDonald, looking lechier than ever, shot
            in harsh and grainy video). <i>Requiem</i>'s superb website -- more
            an interactive extension of the film's themes than an information
            source -- makes this nightmare remarkably immediate and provocative.
            The movie takes it in a few directions at once -- as intimated by
            that early split screen, a device that is simultaneously
            diversionary and imperative, confusing and compelling -- each
            concerning addiction. One part of the film follows Sara, others her
            son and his fellow junkies, Tyrone and Harry's girlfriend Marion
            (Jennifer Connelly). Almost immediately, it's clear that Sara is
            quite addicted to <i>The Tappy Tibbons Show</i>: again and again,
            she sits with her remote in hand, swallowing boxed chocolates, a
            ritual that has left her frumpy and out of sorts for years. When she
            gets a phone call saying she's &quot;already won!&quot; a place on
            the show, she panics: she hardly knows how to be a &quot;winner!'
            Then, ever the survivor, she gears herself up, believing that she
            has to get back to the dress size she was when her husband was still
            alive and her high-school-aged son was not an addict. </span></font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Desperate
            for a reason &quot;to get up in the morning,&quot; Sara makes a
            fateful decision: she gets a prescription for diet pills. From here,
            her relationships to her TV set and her refrigerator -- the two
            largest and most insistent appliances in her small Coney Island
            apartment -- shift gradually but drastically. These changes in her
            emotional life are indicated by increasingly subjective and
            hallucinatory camera work. At first she feels empowered by her
            willful weight loss, her ability to refuse the refrigerator's
            surrealistic thudding and throbbing -- and she moves in time-lapsed
            fast motion, scrubbing down the apartment, grinding her teeth until
            they hurt, popping pills two at a time. Eventually and inevitably,
            she finds herself &quot;acclimated&quot; to the pills, and again
            she's bored and restless, only this time, with a grisly
            speedy-vengeance. At this point the television -- which Harry has
            replaced with a wide-screen stereo version -- is no longer her
            source of comfort and diversion, but a derisive reminder that she's
            still stuck in her apartment, alone. </font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Loneliness
            works a different nerve for Harry, Marion, and Tyrone, who begin the
            film in the full flush of hope, imagining that they'll sell drugs
            just long enough to stake Marion's potential career as a
            fashion-designer -- you don't see much of her work, though you do
            see her working, messing about with papers and pencils on the floor
            of the place she shares with Harry, for now paid for by her wealthy,
            upset, and unseen parents. Harry and Tyrone map out their future,
            then begin stuffing money away in a hole in the wall, allowing
            repeated shots of their faces pressed up to the camera-posing-as-the
            hole, as their hands feel inside, grabbing for the shoe box that
            holds their wads of bills. Business is good, and soon, the box is
            stuffed full, allowing the three young friends a moment of
            satisfaction and sense of well-being in the world that almost
            matches what they feel when they're high. Almost. But it's the
            unsatisfied part that gets the better of them all, one by one.
            Inevitably, they start to use their product rather than sell it,
            then to distrust one another, and then to distrust themselves. </font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">While
            the four central characters in <i>Requiem</i> may have different
            addictions, they share a similar basic need: they seek sensation and
            escape, a palpable connection to something other than themselves, a
            thrill. <i>Requiem</i>'s junkies-on-the-low-road-to-hell is not
            news. But Aronofsky -- who made the remarkable <i>Pi</i> a couple of
            years ago, has here concocted a spectacular and grueling experience
            that gets at the simultaneous joy and panic of addiction, showing
            the pleasures of getting high, what's at stake in maintaining that
            kind of paradoxical remove from and immersion in the sensory
            stimulation your body can afford. <i>Requiem</i> captures the thrill
            of ritual (cooking, shooting, inhaling, and an added set of images
            -- blood whooshing and arteries pulsing) through <i>Drugstore Cowboy</i>-like
            flash-close-ups, and it also shows the insanity of the buy -- on
            hearing that a &quot;new shipment&quot; has hit town, Harry and
            Tyrone (and seemingly hundreds of other skinny, raggedy dopers)
            literally go to a Waldbaums to make the buy, clamoring and anxious
            at the back loading dock as the door roars up to reveal a truck full
            of product and a shady fellow who holds way too much control over
            who gets what and when. </font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hysterical
            and unreal, this scene is actually one of the film's more restrained
            metaphors: in externalizing the addicts' internal pain, craving, and
            self-consumption, some scenes become truly difficult to watch, which
            is to the film's credit. Early moments showing glee and a kind of
            singular rapture contrast with later ones, when Harry's needle-arm
            becomes blackly infected and Marion agrees to perform in a horrific
            sex show in exchange for drugs (a deal arranged by the distressingly
            seductive Keith David). At first, Harry and Marion inhabit a
            conventionally pleasant outdoors -- they stroll on the boardwalk,
            they smile in the sunshine. As their habit gets the better of them,
            they slip into dark interiors, unable to reach one another. When
            Harry and Tyrone leave on a run to Florida (their New York
            connections having dried up), Marion excruciating sense of
            abandonment, by her lover and by her fix. </font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For
            all the horror effectively evoked in scenes showing Marion and Sara
            alone, the descent shared by Harry and Tyrone is dreamlike and
            frightening, insidiously inviting. All four protagonists end up the
            victims of systems -- Sara by television (she goes to the NY offices
            for the show that sent her the letter, and the receptionist and
            staff can hardly know what to do with her -- ravaged and incoherent)
            and doctors (who stick her with needles and commit her to electric
            shock therapy); Marion by her moneyed background (the folks with
            whom she most debases herself are reminiscent of this background,
            hypocritical and careless); and Harry and Tyrone by cops and prison
            guards, when they're picked up on their way &quot;down,&quot;
            literally (to Florida) and figuratively. </font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Throughout
            the film, their friendship is related by small, physical details
            rather than more typical guy posturing, by &quot;soft&quot;
            exchanges, shared glances and brief smiles that are lost to them
            once they're separated and behind bars. Frail and pale (he lost much
            weight for the role), Leto nonetheless has a kind of steel in his
            performance, and Marlon Wayans reveals in <i>Requiem</i> an
            intensity and skilled restraint that you might not expect from him.
            Both Tyrone and Harry are haunted by visions of their mothers
            (they're the only two troubled by embodied representations of their
            emotional pasts, as Marion's parents and Sara's dead husband never
            appear), and both succumb to melancholy and self-hatred at their
            inabilities to live up to expectations and hopes. That this sense of
            sadness and failure pervades <i>Requiem</i> is somewhat ironic, for
            it is a highly accomplished, quite brilliant movie, one that will
            likely leave you feeling devastated and exhilarated at the same
            time. <o:p>
