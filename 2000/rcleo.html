            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><b>Taking
            a branch off the Neil LaBute (pre-<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Nurse
            Betty</i>) tree of filmmaking, writer-director-co-producer Jon Reis
            has planted a fashionably disturbing offshoot, fertilized with heavy
            doses of &quot;Rod-Serlingesque&quot; irony, that would be better
            received if the title wasn’t so amorphous. The rationale for this
            moniker, available in the press material but not to the general
            public (consider this a public service announcement), is that Reis
            realized the similarities in the relational dynamics between his
            darkly dysfunctional lead characters and the disastrous sublimation
            of Marc Anthony to Cleopatra, at least through the tainted eyes of
            the 1963 Hollywood epic. As viewers, you’ll be pleased to know
            that the results in this two-year-old effort (earlier screened at
            the 1998 </b></span><b>Los Angeles Independent Film Festival)</b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><b>,
            finally positioned for release by Indican Pictures, are not as
            historically devastating. It’s a caliginously satisfying modern
            morality tale saluting the pathologically inclined and a handful of
            diseased minds invading the LA suburbs.</b><o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Reis
            favors dark, claustrophobic close-ups, eventually condensing the
            film to a harrowing two character study. For someone with a music
            video background, he thankfully doesn’t resort to special effects
            or quick edits. Not that this is a big budget effort, even if he did
            opt to shoot in 35mm (instead of 16mm or digital video), helped by a
            lot of free stock and a &quot;great lab deal through Deluxe.&quot;
            The end credits reveal some family support through &quot;extra
            special thanks&quot; from numerous relatives. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Medicinally
            obliged Robert Marrs (Paul Hipp) is a clinically depressed and meek
            individual, stuck in a marriage (he was too weak to say no) to the
            overbearing Hallie (Bitty Schram), a barren thirty-five-year-old
            shrill of a bitch (&quot;Well I’m really thirty-two, but that’s
            close.&quot;) content to requisition their disinterested lovemaking
            to the demands of her ovulation cycle and biological clock. Any
            passion outside of her schedule is viewed as a waste of perfectly
            good sperm. Rob’s more interested in watching his tropical fish
            than trying to salvage or opt out of his failed relationship. His
            wife is too self-absorbed to care about his weak-willed problems or
            almost famous career path as a self-employed photographer. Things
            move from bad to worse when the couple, off to a regimented
            copulation vacation in upstate New York, leave their home to friends
            of a friend of a friend. Left to defend the Marrs’ homestead, a
            dog (that seems to disappear for long stretches of the action), and
            the aquarium are House-Sitters from Hell Zack Tyler (Boyd Kestner)
            and his sexually-promiscuous Australian girl friend Sophie (Radha
            Mitchell), who immediately let their pretenses down -- an ominous
            door slam signals doom -- and play house as two irresponsible
            children. Most of the time they’d rather play doctor.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">When
            the homeowners return from their own short-circuited rustic respite,
            their residence is a shambles. And despite the personal loss of his
            underwater family (the fish don’t survive Act One), a reluctant
            Robert gets coerced by his forgiving wife to allow the houseguests a
            second chance and extended welcome. Big mistake. More serious ones
            follow. Zack gets to further bait the hook and reel in his
            subservient host with a little extra-marital assistance and nipple
            clamps from the seductive Sophie, who manages some unscheduled
            chemical developments in Robert’s dark room. The release of his
            sexual repression is discovered by the already scornful Hallie.
            Tongue-tied and lacking any excuses for his behavior, the wimpish
            adulterer leaves her the perfect escape route out of their
            emotionally troubled life. Hell hath no fury like a housewife
            spurned.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            manipulation and emasculation of the milksop continue; the visiting
            Svengali mesmerizes his apt pupil into vacating the comfort of his
            master bedroom for the cramped guest quarters. The film spirals down
            into a psychologically depressing variation of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Odd
            Couple</i>. Whenever Robert’s milquetoast Felix Unger cleans up
            and cooks up a culinary storm to make peace with his torturers,
            Zack’s domineering Oscar Madison manages to cut his adversary off
            at the knees. Sometimes with excruciating force (male rape), and
            sometimes with a deceptive, underhanded gesture, such as when Zack
            buys his housemate a &quot;gift&quot; that further exemplifies the
            domestication of his generally-absent manhood.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            stronger of the male species gets single-handedly sadistic, leeching
            off Robert’s sad excuse for a human being. Zack pilfers Robert’s
            credit, his limited good name, installs his own phone line (not at
            his expense, of course), and invites numerous high priced hookers in
            to salvage through Hallie’s designer rags (as long as he gets half
            of whatever they can get for them). Somehow the sissified coach
            potato with nerves of soggy cardboard sucks up his depression and
            salvages the slim respect his deserves. Ah, sweet revenge.<o:p>
