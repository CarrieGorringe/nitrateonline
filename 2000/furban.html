<p><i><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Question:</font></b></i><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span></i>Joseph, how did your Hollywood experience influence your portrayal of
a film brat in this film?</font></p>
<p><i><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Joseph
Lawrence: </font></b></i><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></i>Well,
my Hollywood experience was sort of an unorthodox one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I came from a really great family that gave me a lot support, was around
me at all times.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And, you know, I
never fell into the traps and the pitfalls that unfortunately a lot of people
fall into.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But it was kind of fun
to play the antithesis of that in the Graham character.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I think it was 'cause this guy kind of got caught up in it and was really
affected by it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And it altered his
personality growing up in it, so it was fun to jump into that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But our experiences as individuals were different.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">Q:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span></i>Jennifer, you starred in last year's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Stir
of Echoes</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Was that experience
different or similar in any respect to your experience in this film?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p><i><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jennifer
Morrison:</font></b></i><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span></i>Oh, very different.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In
this film, I was, like, the person having to deal with everything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In that film, I was this thing scaring everyone. [laughs]<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>So in that film, it was a lot of very, very tedious technical filming,
and lots of time in hair and makeup, and dealing with trying to create a very
abstract character.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And in this
film, I was dealing with a really solid human being, dealing with all of these
things, that was actually alive, which was different than being dead. [laughs]<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And so in that sense, you know, it was kind of a total flip side.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">Q:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span></i>Joseph, you've had a lot more experience than most of your fellow
cast members here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How did it feel
being the veteran?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Did you give any
advice to your fellow actors?</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>

<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">JL:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span></i>You know, I think they really knew what they were doing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Yeah, I've been doing this a lot longer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But, you know, no, I mean, not really.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I didn't go out as much as some of them did.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But we kind of stayed at the hotel and hung out and stuff.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But, you know, when I work, I love to go up there and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">work</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And then by the end of the day, I'm kind of tired, so I just go home and
crash.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But that was the only thing
that really, you know, I kind of did that was different.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But everything else, everyone kind of knew what they were
doing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And I think it shows.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><i><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Q:</font></b></i><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span></i>So Jennifer, what was it like starring in your first Hollywood
feature?</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">JM:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span></i>It was really exciting and really scary at the same time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I'm one of those people who just dives into everything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I'm like, yes, OK, I can do this, and this is my job.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I just kind of take everything as it comes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And it didn't really hit me until I got to the hotel in Toronto and we
went to the table to read and everything, and I was like, "Oh, my God, I have to
be the reason people want to see the next scene!"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>'Cause I'm in, like, every scene.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And
I was like, realizing that pressure, you know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And I mean, I was really serious about my character in the first place.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But there's an added pressure to really making sure that, you
know, every specific detail of her life and everything was understood in my
head, so that when I was presenting something in a scene, it was really right
on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There's no leeway for not
knowing something at that point.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So
it was definitely both the pressure and really exciting and fun at that same
time.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><i><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Q: </font></b></i><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></i>This
would be for both of you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Culturally,
people seem to enjoy scary movies in the same way that we enjoy urban legends.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Why do you think it is that we love to be scared?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And is that something you thought about while you were working on the
film?</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">JM:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span></i>I think it's interesting, because I always shied away from scary
movies when I was younger until I started working on a lot of, you know, doing <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Stir
of Echoes</i> and stuff.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I started
having different interests in it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There's
that adrenaline thrill, I think.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It's
almost like riding a roller coaster, you know, when you're watching a movie and
you get that same kind of excited thrill of the anticipation of something.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I mean, even watching this movie, knowing what's coming next, 'cause I'd
read the script a million times.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
was sitting there with my agent going, "Oh, my God, what's happening next?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It's like, "Jennie, you know the script!"<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But there's something that we love about that little feeling
you get inside when you get excited.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There's
that total terror tension going on.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>So I think that it's kind of a rush.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">JL:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span></i>Yeah, I just think so many times, people in real life, we are scared
of real things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And I think that
you go to a film and you know it's not real, and I think that's the whole point
of it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So we can go in there and
enjoy ourselves and enjoy being scared, whereas so many times in life when we're
scared, we can't enjoy it.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Because it's <b><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">really</i></b>
scary, you know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So I think that's
the fun of it for me, is that you go in there and scream and get nervous, and at
the end of it, you walk out, and for that hour and thirty-five minutes, life
just kind of stopped.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And then, you
know, it'll kind of start up again, so, yeah.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">JL:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span></i>Well, for me, it was coming back off, like, three years of not
working, and being away, and kind of stepping out of the limelight there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was an opportunity to kind of come back and just play a part that
people wouldn't necessarily associate with me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Because they all think that I walk [around] with ripped jeans and
whatever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So, yeah, it was, you
know, this guy is kind of a dark character with a lot of problems.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And I think it was a good first role for people to see me in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And it was good for me as an actor to kind of just be able to play
something a little bit different, 'cause that's kind of what I'm looking to do
right now is just play different roles in different things and experience
situations with different characters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You
know, I'm trying to flex my wings a little bit.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

</o:p>
</font></b></p>
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">JL:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></i>When you're an actor, it just
lends itself to directing, I think.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">JM:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span></i>Yeah, when you're around on set, and especially for me with this
film, having been on set as much as I was and really getting along with
[director and editor] John Ottman so well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And his mind working as an editor really helped me understand how things
piece together in a film, and it really helped me develop my character, getting
along with him so well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Because I
was able to kind of pick up things and understand the way he looked at things,
and understood things, and pieced them all together.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And so I've definitely got a really strong grasp on that and would like
to pursue that eventually, yeah, definitely.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">JL:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

</span></i>Well, this was a totally different kind of woman protagonist, though.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I mean, she's intelligent, and she's with it, and she's creating
something.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And that was what really
drew me to the character in the first place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>You know, a lot of the women who are in these kind of films are, like,
running around in wet T-shirts and screaming…</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">JM: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></i>I
had a couple of pretty crazy little incidences.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We were filming in a forest for a while.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I was walking back from lunch, and there was no one walking back with me,
which was really odd, because the ADs [assistant directors] are usually like
suctions to us, you know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And I don't
know how I managed to sneak away - I didn't mean to.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But I was walking back alone from this forest, and I was absolutely
scared out of my mind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Because it
was like everything that can possibly happen in a horror movie was going through
my head as I was walking through.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And then the only other thing that was funny
was, I was in bed one night, and I was living by myself, filming a horror film,
so I was always kind of like subconsciously on edge about things.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And it was, like, one in the morning, and it sounded like someone was
opening my door.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And I get freaked
out in hotels, because so many people have keys…</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>JL [deadpans]:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

didn't know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was trying to…
[both laugh]</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>JM:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span></i></b>But, you know, all the maintenance people, all the cleaning
people, they all have keys, so you kind of get freaked out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>So I fly up in my bed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm
like, "Don't come in! Don't come in!" and I'm screaming.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And then I wait, and I don't here anything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And it's like, God, what happened?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So
I get out of my bed, and I'm really scared to walk over there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And someone had slipped my call sheet through the mail slot instead of
under the door, so it had made extra noise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And I was just imagining the poor hotel guy who put the thing under the
door, and here's this girl screaming at the top of her lungs, "Don't come in!".
So I had a couple - I think it was totally affecting me a little bit more
subconsciously than I realized.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

</span></i>Right now, actually, I'm working on an independent film in Chicago,
called <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Design</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Davidson Cole is directing it, and Daniel J. Travanti is playing my
father.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And Edward Cunningham's
playing a very important character in my scenes as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It's been a really great, great experience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It's interesting to work on an independent film compared with a big
studio film.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But I've absolutely been loving my experience in that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>So I'm in the middle of working on that right now.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

</span></i>I just wrapped an indie down in Florida, which is kind of a dark
movie.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It's called <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Abe's
Secret</i>, which is…I don't know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You
never know how they're gonna turn out, but it was a lot of fun to do.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">JM:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span></i>No matter how they turn out, they're always a great experience.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">JL:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span></i>I think that for me right now, it's more about the experience as an
actor.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And then hopefully you'll be
able to get to that point one day where you have enough success, where you
really have to start worrying about how the whole project comes out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Because as actors, it's great to do great work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And I think on the other side of it is, you want to try to be in those
movies that everyone can't wait to see, you know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>So, man, I hope I get there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
for right now, I think it was a great experience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And I'm looking forward to seeing how it'll turn out.<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"></o:p>
