            review by <a href="../joe.html" target="_top">Joe Barlow</a>, 1 December 2000</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Interviewer: &quot;Do you often
            see your father?&quot;</b></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Paul:
            &quot;No, actually, we're just good friends.&quot;</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">By the time Paul McCartney utters
            this famous response to a particularly banal interviewer during one
            of the many press conferences contained in <i>A Hard Day's Night</i>,
            we can understand his frustration. We've just watched him -- and the
            other three Beatles -- suffer through a mind-numbingly tedious
            barrage of questions from an insufferable pack of journalists. It's
            an understated response from McCartney, indicative of a young man
            who's bored with the incredible monotony of being a member of the
            world's biggest band. And for heaven's sake, why <i>shouldn't</i> he
            be? Just look at the day he's had:</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">First, he and his companions were
            forced to share a train compartment with a stuffy, belligerent
            passenger who could have served as the blueprint for <i>Are You
            Being Served?</i>'s gruff Captain Peacock. Next, he's had all of his
            leisure activities curtailed by an overprotective manager (Norman
            Rossington), who seems to think that the Beatles' idea of fun is
            sitting in their motel room, answering the thousands of fan letters
            they receive every hour. (&quot;I want this lot answered
            tonight,&quot; their clueless manager informs the group, gesturing
            to a staggeringly large pile of correspondence.) The final
            indignity, however, is the fact that Paul is stuck
            &quot;babysitting&quot; his crotchety grandfather (Wilfrid Brambell),
            a cantankerous troublemaker who'd make Dennis the Menace look like a
            choirboy.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Nor are the other Beatles faring
            well. Lead guitarist George Harrison finds himself forced to provide
            commentary on teenage fashion for a megalomaniac designer; overly
            sensitive drummer Ringo Starr walks out on his bandmates after they
            inadvertently snub him; and rhythm guitarist John Lennon finds
            himself unable to get all the way through a simple bath without
            being disturbed, with hilarious consequences.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Richard Lester's <i>A Hard Day's
            Night</i> was intended to be nothing more than an (exaggerated) day
            in the life of what was then the world's biggest rock band. It has
            little in the way of plot or storyline; there are no major conflicts
            to be resolved, no central villain to be defeated (as in the cute
            but undeniably inferior sequel, <i>Help!</i>), and no real sense of
            drama. Thank goodness, then, that it wasn't <i>supposed</i> to have
            any of these things. As charming as it may be, <i>A Hard Day's Night</i>
            was created to be a quick, disposable rock-and-roll flick, a
            harmless piece of fluff that United Artists could rush into theaters
            to capitalize on the astonishing popularity of a band most critics
            (and studio executives) thought would be gone in a few months.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">No one knew, certainly, that <i>A
            Hard Day's Night</i> would go on to become the <i>Citizen Kane</i>
            of rock and roll films, single-handedly inventing the music video
            and, by reason of its success, eventually leading to the creation of
            the popular <i>Monkees</i> television series. Nonetheless, the
            appeal of the movie is unmistakable, even to a generation that grew
            up after the Liverpool mop-tops went their separate ways. There's a
            feeling of warmth that permeates every frame, and, thirty-six years
            after its initial theatrical release, <i>A Hard Day's Night</i> has
            not aged in any discernable way. Like the music featured on the
            soundtrack, the film remains timeless -- a snapshot of a simpler
            era, when rock and roll existed for no other reason than to be
            danced to.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To what does the film owe its
            spectacular success? The wittiness of Alun Owen's script and the
            catchiness of the songs certainly didn't hurt. But the single most
            important factor, the one without which the movie would never have
            gotten off the ground, is the considerable natural charisma of the
            Beatles themselves. All four of the band members are clearly having
            a good time, rattling off their dialogue with such mechanical
            precision that the fact that they aren't professional actors barely
            has time to register. You can't teach the kind of screen presence
            seen here. Lennon and Starr are particularly well-suited to the
            task, bringing a certain brash confidence to their portrayals of
            themselves (though Starr has gone on record to say that he barely
            remembers making the film, due to the amount of time he spent
            hung-over during the shoot). And McCartney shines in his
            interactions with Brambell, his cinematic grandfather, whose
            excellent personal hygiene is the film's most entertaining running
            gag.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>A Hard Day's Night</i>'s
            mischievous sense of humor is another point in its favor. Here the
            Beatles emerge as fun-loving young men, full of cheeky irreverence.
            Notice, however, that they're never actually <i>rude</i> to anyone,
            preferring to get their revenge on the world's buffoons with
            hilarious asides to each other. It's contagious fun; with their
            cinematic actions, the Beatles bring out the rascal in all of us,
            and that's a precious gift indeed for those of us tired of stress
            and responsibility. <i>A Hard Day's Night</i> is the most fun you're
            likely to have in a movie theater this year, and its theatrical
            re-release should not be missed by anyone who loves to smile, laugh,
            and tap their foot to some of the greatest pop tunes ever recorded.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And with a love
            like that, you know you should be glad.</font>
