            review by <a href="../joe.html" target="_top">Joe Barlow</a>, 22 September 2000</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>William Friedkin's <i>The
            Exorcist</i> owes much of its renown to the era in which it was
            created. When the film was unleashed on an unsuspecting public in
            1973, it generated an international debate that, surprisingly, still
            rages today: is it art or garbage? Both sides of the argument had
            its followers -- in New York, picketers protested the movie upon its
            release, calling it blasphemous and obscene, despite the fact that
            the Roman Catholic Church participated in its making. Religious
            organizations demanded that the film be pulled from theaters and all
            prints burned. Thousands of weak- stomached viewers fled midway
            through the movie. At most cinemas, the line for admittance
            stretched several city blocks. Viewers loved it. Viewers hated it.
            Critics raved. Critics bemoaned. As the year wore on, the debate
            (and the resulting media attention) caused theater attendance to
            skyrocket; even today, <i>The Exorcist</i> remains one of the
            highest-grossing horror films of all time.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Part of the reason the film
            inspired such division was its aversion to playing by the
            established rules of horror. Although there had been a few
            exceptions (<i>Rosemary's Baby</i>, for instance), most pre-<i>Exorcist</i>
            horror movies hadn't tried very hard to tell a worthwhile story. The
            cheesy &quot;monster flicks&quot; of the 'fifties and 'sixties had
            set a standard that audiences had come to know and expect. <i>The
            Exorcist</i> caught everyone off guard by utilizing psychological
            terror for its chills, instead of the typical &quot;creature jumps
            out from behind a tree and says BOO!&quot;-type of scenes. It made
            history by doing so.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Despite the movie's supernatural
            elements, the story itself revolves largely around inner turmoil.
            Father Damien Karras (an excellent performance by Jason Miller) is a
            priest in the middle of a crisis of faith. &quot;There's not a day
            in my life that I don't feel like a fraud,&quot; he laments to a
            colleague. Wallowing in grief after the recent death of his mother,
            Karras is on the verge of renouncing the deity to whom he has
            devoted his life.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The priest's life becomes
            increasingly complex, however, after he meets actress Chris MacNeil
            (Ellen Bursten). MacNeil believes her beloved daughter Regan (Linda
            Blair) has been possessed by Satan. The skeptical Karras initially
            disbelieves her claim, but as a favor to the clearly distraught
            mother, he agrees to evaluate Regan's condition. Much to his horror,
            Karras realizes that there may be some truth to MacNeil's claims,
            and he calls in Father Lankester Merrin (Max von Sydow), an
            experienced exorcist, to drive the spirit from the body of this
            innocent child. From this point on, the movie performs double-duty
            as both a suspense/horror story of the highest caliber, and as the
            tale of Father Karras's spiritual redemption.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>The Exorcist</i> isn't a
            sprightly moving picture. The film's prologue is deliberately slow,
            but not because of a lack of skill on Friedkin's behalf. The
            director possesses an innate mastery of the art of storytelling, and
            he unleashes the plot at a restrained pace, thereby allowing <i>The
            Exorcist</i> to weave its web so stealthily that the audience
            doesn't even realize that it's being ensnared. Once things get
            moving, however, look out!</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Warner Brothers released an
            excellent DVD edition of <i>The Exorcist</i> a couple of years ago.
            The disc is packed with a generous bounty of special features,
            including two audio commentary tracks (one with Friedkin, the other
            with writer/producer William Peter Blatty), and a ninety-minute BBC
            documentary on the making of this classic film. Now Warner Brothers
            has done itself one better, theatrically reissuing a new director's
            cut of the movie that adds eleven minutes of previously unreleased
            footage and boasts a mesmerizing new surround sound mix to boot.
            Those viewers who have memorized every frame of the original film
            will find many new surprises here, including Regan's legendary
            &quot;spider walk&quot; sequence, which was cut from the original
            release.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The new audio mix is a vast
            improvement over the original soundtrack, which is no small praise:
            the film won the 1973 Oscar for Best Sound in a Feature Film.
            (&quot;Tubular Bells,&quot; the story's much-celebrated theme music,
            has never sounded better.) And yes, digital die-hards: a new DVD of
            the director's cut is expected once the film completes its current
            theatrical run.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Time can be a cruel mistress, but <i>The
            Exorcist</i> hasn't aged in any discernible way since its initial
            release twenty-seven years ago. It continues to captivate (and
            terrify) new viewers with each passing year, and no wonder: in terms
            of story and execution, few films have ever surpassed it. If a great
            horror movie is like a fine wine, then <i>The Exorcist</i>'s bouquet
            becomes more refined with each passing year.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
