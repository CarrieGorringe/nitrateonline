            1997 <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Star Maps</i>). A
            Sundance favorite earlier this year (his debut feature also was
            screened there in 1997 as part of the American Spectrum sidebar),
            this is one of the summer’s better indie efforts. I was wondering
            if the distributor might re-title it <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Artisan’s
            The Kid</i> as a edgy, goofy nod to the latest Bruce Willis ego bomb
            (both deal with similar deficiencies, tackled differently), but the
            last thing you want are Disney's legal thugs breathing down your
            neck.&nbsp;</b><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Geeky, gangly Buck O’Brien does
            plenty enough to make you squirm/laugh anyway as a pale-skinned
            Peter Pan, a freckled, red-haired mama’s boy who won’t grow up
            until he can find middle ground with Chuck, his once and only
            childhood friend who moved away to Neverland fifteen years earlier
            and cut off all contact with his former best bud. Flipping the coin,
            we realize that moving or running away to La-La Land hasn’t made
            the handsome, driven Chuck the better man. Sure he looks normal,
            rechristened as Charlie Sitter, but he’s hiding his own
            hang-ups—locked away in repressed memories and covered like a
            frayed bear rug with a fiancée, BMW, and martini fast life as a big
            shot record executive. When the pair are first reunited at Buck’s
            mother’s funeral, the floodgates of denial start to crack. The
            emotional dam eventual breaks when the newly orphaned, vexatious
            man-child latches on to an offhand remark by Charlie’s sweetheart
            and packs up his cherished smiley pencils, vinyl records, and toy
            soldiers before heading west to fixate up close on you know who.<o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Shot on digital video, the picture
            has a home movie style that adds to the realistic feel of the story
            by Mike White, generally known as a former producer and writer for <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Dawson’s
            Creek</i> and the critically acclaimed but axed by NBC series <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Freaks
            and Geeks</i> (Ah, now this is starting to make sense!). Although
            White had a small part in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Star
            Maps</i>, Arteta’s decision that he take on the demanding role of
            Buck (and actually imbue it with the strange, creepy sensitivity
            with which he created it), is truly inspired. It’s a wacky
            character that reminded me, obliquely, of the owlish Bud Cort
            character in Robert Altman’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Brewster
            McCloud</i> some thirty years ago. Indeed, the fascinating thing
            about the whole project is the production talent that appears <b><i>in
            front</i></b> of the camera, fresh faces and cautious
            &quot;actors&quot; that make their characters seem as
            psychologically scary/afraid as they apparently are before the
            camcorder. The role of Chuck/Charlie was given to Chris Weitz,
            co-director with brother Paul of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">American
            Pie</i>. Paul also appears as Sam, an obviously sub-standard actor,
            but chosen by Buck because of his passing similarity to Chuck for a
            lead in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Hank and Frank</i>,
            Buck’s autobiographical, childish play-within-the-movie that has
            more than a passing resemblance to his failed fairytale
            relationship. The misogynist allegory deepens when Buck’s
            after-rehearsal advances on Sam are rebuffed. Charlie’s comely
            girl friend Carlyn is Beth Colt, a film producer and talent manager.
            Oh, yes, there are real actors in the cast, too. Best of the lot is
            poignant Lupe Onteveros (the nosy neighbor in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">As Good As It Gets</i>) as a weary theater manager given her big break
            and a honest-felt dose of self confidence directing Buck’s play.<o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When the one-night-only amateur
            theatrical begins on a stage across the street from Charlie’s
            office (it also offers our &quot;hero&quot; an convenient
            surveillance post to plot his entrance back into Chuck’s life),
            Buck only cares how Charlie and Carlyn react (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Hamlet</i> anyone?). The full-blown obsession ultimately ends with an
            uneasy late-night truce and a retreat into childhood memories and
            the possibility that both men finally will get on with their lives
            -- one hopes.<o:p>
