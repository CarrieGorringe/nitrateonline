            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="4">The
World Made No Sense!</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Poor
Lucky. The cute little colt is born en route to South Africa, on a ship bearing
his mother and many other horses destined for hard labor in the desert, just
before the start of World War I. As he describes the experience, by way of
introducing his indefatigable voice-over (read by Lucas Haas throughout the
film), &quot;In this strange and unsteady place, I taught myself to stand. That
is how I started my life.&quot; And meanwhile you're watching the wobbly foal
stagger to his baby hooves, pitched about by the ocean, or more precisely, the
ocean-effect concocted on a dank and clammy-looking sound stage. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</b></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I
was born to run free and wild,&quot; Lucky informs us. Which means, I gather,
that this initial situation is a problem. And indeed, he spends the rest of the
movie -- which covers several years of his life -- looking to cut loose from the
humans who maltreat, betray, and generally dog him out. Jeanne Rosenberg, who
co-wrote the comparatively minimalist <i>The Black Stallion </i>(magnificently
directed by cinematographer Carroll Ballard in 1979) has written a script that's
all over the map, target- audience-wise. While the story is probably a bit
brutal for wee tots, it does pack enough generalized action to appeal to a <i>Lion
King</i>-like demographic, and yet, the narration is so fatuous and distracting
that preteens will likely feel as insulted by it as their adult escorts. And
while, as the movie's title announces, the opposition between freedom and
non-freedom is a major theme, hit hard and often, it's rather less than
compelling, intellectually or emotionally. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
asking viewers to identify with a baby horse, the movie most often takes the
easy route, pounding away with scenes showing Lucky in various states of
bedragglement, as he describes what you're seeing: &quot;I was too weak to
stand; I found myself moving in and out of dreams&quot;; &quot;I couldn't answer
my mother!&quot; The film makes its case for identification most effectively
when the voice-over eases up, when cinematographer Dan Laustsen's frankly
stunning images of red Namibian desert sands and piercing blue skies, horses
thundering and lions dashing, can speak for themselves. I mean, it's just not
necessary to explain what's going on when the colt is poking his tiny nose up
over the wooden slats of his trailer, whinnying frantically for his mommy, who
in response, engages in some impressive nostril-flaring and all-around gallant
(if doomed) attempts to break loose in order to return to him. These are heart-
wrenching pictures, only flattened by accompanying verbiage like, &quot;I was
hungry and thirsty! The world made no sense!&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">All
this overkill leads to a standard childhood fantasy/trauma, abandonment. On
landing in Africa, the big meanie humans, who don't care much about his feelings
and see him as so much excess weight, separate Lucky from his mother. None of
the men minds much when an orphaned boy named Richard (Chase Moore) arrives on
the scene to save Lucky. Since Richard cleans the stables for a local mine's
mucky-muck, he has a place where Lucky can stay. To be sure, there are moments
when Richard's unnamed &quot;Boss Man&quot; (Jan Decleir) seems about to put the
kebosh on the boy's burgeoning friendship with the horse -- especially when
goaded by his also unnamed and preternaturally hostile son (Daniel J. Robbertse),
who looks a lot like one of the Children of the Corn, blond and scary- faced,
and inexplicably determined to torture little commoner Richard. But for the most
part, Lucky's relationship with Richard is uninhibited by the usual human abuses
(say, the kind that plagued poor Black Beauty back in the day). &quot;This
boy,&quot; says Lucky, &quot;had a gentle touch.&quot; And indeed, we see the
boy gently touching Lucky. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Strangely,
Lucky's principal run-ins come not with the humans, who are after all
preoccupied with the imminent hostilities that will inevitably decimate their
lifestyles. No, Lucky's primary adversary is a horse. And not just any horse,
but a gigantic huffing and puffing and hoof-stomping black stallion named Cesar,
who's so concerned that his own daughter (a filly named Beauty) might hook up
with Lucky, a plebe, that he (Cesar) goes out of his way to put the beat down on
Lucky's mom. Of the many absurd notions that <i>Running Free</i> proffers, the
suggestion that this horse has class consciousness and worse, a ferocious
contempt for the underclass, is probably the most offensive. That, and the fact
that he is a black stallion, well, it's all just a bit much, metaphorically
speaking. Well, okay, maybe Cesar's the classic colonial subject, internalizing
his master's doctrines as his own. Still, there's a translation problem (as
Lucky seems to be the only horse who actually speaks English): how Cesar gets
his info on who has a pedigree and how pedigrees might matter to him, or how
such a stud would rather murder a mating-age mare than mount her... Suffice to
say that an understanding of &quot;nature&quot;'s rhythms is not <i>Running Free</i>'s
strong suit. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It
takes Lucky a few attempts at running away from the Boss Man's estate before
he's able to make it stick. Well, a few attempts and the intervention of World
War I, which involves some planes swooping in to shoot up the mining town. At
one point, stumbling through the desert with a wounded leg, Lucky and his boy
are discovered by a young bushman girl named Nyka (Maria Geelbooi). Fortunately,
she knows a little something about survival in the desert, as well as some roots
remedies for wounded legs, and so, she teaches them how to get by. Eventually,
Richard and Lucky are separated, and Lucky makes friends, temporarily, with
various desert creatures (lion cubs until their mom comes home looking for
dinner, an oryx until he finds a girlfriend and leaves Lucky in the dust). Lucky
is determined, though, to find a fabled paradise in the mountains, where grass
grows and water runs freely. It's no surprise that he finds this Valhalla,
though it's probably best not to go into detail on how he makes it <i>the </i>perfect
place for a boy horse, that is, by assembling his own herd of loyal and
submissive girl horses. <o:p>

</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
film itself has an excellent sort of pedigree, as it's directed by Sergei Bodrov
(<i>Prisoner of the Mountains</i>) and produced by Jean- Jacques Annaud (who
directed <i>The Name of the Rose</i>, <i>The Bear</i> and, alas, <i>Seven Years
in Tibet</i>). But all these skilled hands are unable to rescue Running Free,
which becomes more and more preposterous as it goes on. And on.</font>
