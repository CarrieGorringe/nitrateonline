      review by <a href="../joe.html" target="_top">Joe Barlow</a>, 16 June 2000</i></font>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">One of the most
amazing things about Don Bluth's <i>Titan A.E.</i> -- and there is no shortage
of them -- is the simple fact that the actions of its characters have
consequences. The heroes of this tale aren't invincible, <i>Rambo</i>-like
creatures, unconcerned with the dangers that surround them on every side; they
often get hurt. They experience fear under stress. They behave, in short, like
real people would under the same conditions. It may seem like a small touch, but
the very fact that <i>Titan A.E.</i> bothers to paint its protagonists in a
vulnerable light makes it much easier for the audience to admire -- and become
concerned for -- the heroes; they are &quot;real&quot; to us. That's an
impressive achievement in its own right, but it's especially noteworthy given
the fact that <i>Titan A.E.</i> is completely animated.</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Director Don Bluth is no stranger to science-fiction: one of his earliest
animated hits was <i>Space Ace</i>, the laserdisc-based video game he co-created
in 1983, along with its more popular cousin, <i>Dragon's Lair</i>. With <i>Titan
A.E.</i>, Bluth has taken a significant leap forward in the field of quality
animation, matching an intriguing premise with some of the most spellbinding
visuals ever to grace the silver screen. <i>Titan A.E.</i> is a monumental
feather in Bluth's cap, a tour-de-force of glitz and graphics that will no doubt
become the centerpiece of his career, which has already seen its share of both
smash hits (<i>An American Tail</i>, <i>All Dogs Go to Heaven</i>) and
box-office disasters (the oft-maligned <i>The Secret of Nimh</i>, a film this
reviewer loved). But Bluth has come a tremendous distance since these earlier
offerings: comparing the animation in <i>Titan A.E.</i> to, say, <i>Space Ace</i>,
is a bit like comparing The Beatles' &quot;Love Me Do&quot; to the finely-honed
melodies of the band's &quot;Abbey Road&quot; album -- yes, it's still
recognizably the same group, but their growing mastery of craft and willingness
to experiment makes the later material sound light years ahead of their previous
work.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The story: All his life, young Cale (voiced by Matt Damon) has been an
outcast. A refugee who escaped mere moments before the Earth was destroyed by an
alien race known as the Dredge, the young pilot has developed an intense streak
of self-preservation as a way of dealing with the loneliness he feels after the
untimely death of his father. Cale has found it difficult to adjust to living in
an alien culture (&quot;I do an honest day's work. All I want is for them to
kill my food before they serve it to me,&quot; he complains), but he hangs on;
quite simply, he has no alternative. One day, a stranger appears. This fellow
human (voiced by Bill Pullman) was working with Cale's father on a top secret
project called Titan, an immense machine with the power to create planets...
including a replacement Earth! But Titan also has immense destructive potential
(shades of <i>Wrath of Khan</i>), and soon Cale finds himself -- quite against
his wishes -- the focal point in the struggle to locate and resurrect the
project before all is lost.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Titan A.E.</i> is proud of its roots, and contains numerous winks to
established sci-fi classics, including the obligatory <i>Star Wars</i> homage
(&quot;Should I get out and push?&quot; asks the lovely Akima -- voiced by Drew
Barrymore -- when Cale has difficulty getting his spaceship's engines to
ignite). Kubrick is also a major influence on the filmmakers, for in many ways <i>Titan
A.E.</i> recalls the majesty of <i>2001: A Space Odyssey</i>: in both films, the
main thing is the <i>spectacle</i>, not the story. How fortunate for us, then,
that <i>Titan A.E.</i> actually provides an intelligent plot. Unlike a certain
recent George Lucas sci-fi blockbuster, <i>Titan A.E.</i> has the narrative
muscle to match its astounding eye-candy. The film is one of the most kinetic
works of art I have ever seen: Bluth directs the animation with a tenacity that
John Woo himself would envy, paying such attention to pace and rhythm that you
could almost tap your foot in time to the editing of the action sequences. This
film seems to be an intentional attempt to mimic a more Japanese style of
animation in both execution and tone; not only are the colors simultaneously
richer in hue yet drenched in shadow, but the storyline and execution are both
far darker than anything you'd ever expect to find in, say, a Disney flick.
Unfortunately, innovation is rarely rewarded by American audiences. Case in
point: <i>The Iron Giant</i>, which is widely considered to be one of the
greatest animated films in motion-picture history, was a box- office disaster,
despite receiving nearly universal rave reviews. The fact that <i>Titan A.E.</i>
dares to try something different in the field of feature-length animation will
probably make it an odd-man- out at the box office. The film's innovations may
disappoint parents, who are not used to cartoons which -- gasp -- have violence
and (implied) sexuality as part of their makeup.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The bottom line: <i>Titan A.E.</i> is one of the finest
examples of American animation that has ever been created. But since it didn't
come from Disney, it will naturally be a box-office disaster. And it's a damned
shame, too -- better see it while you can.<span style="mso-fareast-font-family: 'MS Mincho'"></O:P>
