            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Oh, for the joys of formula,
            where nothing is so complicated that it can't be resolved by the end
            of the story in as neatly, simply, and in as non-disconcertingly a
            way as possible! <i>Remember the Titans</i> takes the story of a
            real-life South Carolina football coach (played in the film by
            Denzel Washington), who is assigned to coach the team for an
            all-white Virginia high school that is being integrated for the
            first time, and puts it right through the wringer. Authoritarian and
            uncompromising, the new coach runs the team ragged and forces them
            to get to know each another, all while proving his worth and working
            things out with the school's former coach (Will Patton), who has
            been demeaned though being knocked down to the position of assistant
            coach. The results are that the team members, barely speaking to one
            another when they go off to summer training camp, come back on the
            bus singing r-&amp;-b songs together and unable to comprehend what
            the problem is with their family, friends and community. If only
            things were that simple! (They weren't: I lived in Virginia during
            the 'sixties.)</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While the action is set in 1970-71,
            it looks as if it's taking place five years earlier. (There is
            absolutely no mention of Nixon or Vietnam -- very unusual,
            considering the draft was still in effect.) Washington does some
            stirring work, and Patton is equally good playing a quiet, basically
            decent churchgoing man who seems taken aback when he has to back up
            his words calling for fairness and tolerance with action. But the
            film flattens everything out as it gets progressively more and more
            caught up in the action on the playing field. And while director
            Boaz Yakim does his best to give the material ingenuousness and
            momentum, even he seems mortified at how the film suddenly rakes it
            focus away from its main subject and onto something else entirely in
            order to provide an ending that smothers everything with a thick,
            chloroform-like layer of sentimentality. (It feels as if a couple of
            scenes are missing that would have provided end notes for the main
            characters.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There's one thing I've noticed over
            the years, and it's that there are two kinds of looks that Denzel
            Washington tends to get in his eyes while working in a movie. One is
            when he is thoroughly involved in a character, such as in <i>Malcolm
            X</i> and <i>The Hurricane</i>. The other is a more detached look
            which, as in <i>The Pelican Brief</i>, seems to be saying that he's
            resigned himself to the fact that the only thing he's going to get
            out of this movie is a paycheck. That's the look that's in his eye
            by the time this movie is over with.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><o:p>
