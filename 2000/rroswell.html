            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top"> Dan Lybarger</a>, 14 July 2000</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Legions of documentaries have
            asked if an extraterrestrial spacecraft really crashed outside of
            Roswell, NM on July 4, 1947. Freshman feature director Timothy B.
            Johnson manages to make a potentially moldy subject fresh by asking
            the previously unuttered question, &quot;How has Roswell reacted to
            its status as the UFO capital of the world?&quot;</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">According to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Six
            Days in Roswell</i>, the answer is with great pride<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">. </i>The town is full of signs illustrated with little green men. A
            billboard for a local church even features a bald alien kneeling
            before the Lord. Exploring this spaceman-obsessed world is Richard
            Kronfeld, who briefly appeared in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Trekkies</i>.
            Kronfeld is a man with unusual tastes (he owns a bizarre collection
            of educational filmstrips) and a simple ambition: he wants to be
            abducted by space aliens. To act on his desire, he boards a bus with
            fellow alien enthusiasts and heads from Minneapolis to Roswell to
            Roswell for the fiftieth anniversary of the famous crash. While
            there, Kronfeld samples everything from Alien Pale Ale to a UFO
            haircut. He also quizzes alleged abductees to discover why he and
            his fellow Minnesotans never seem to get captured. He even checks
            out <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Roswell, The Musical</i>.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Several of the people he encounters
            appear to be mere hucksters. One merchant flatly admits that,
            &quot;Anything with ‘alien’ in it sells.&quot; Some of the
            people, however, appear lucid and sincere when they recall meeting
            the otherworldly visitors. Others, like a man who claims that aliens
            wanted his feces, appear just plain nuts.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Much of what happens in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Six
            Days in Roswell</i> would seem an easy target for ridicule. For
            example, how else would one treat a local commercial where aliens
            land on this planet to score some beef jerky? Fortunately, Kronfeld
            and Johnson have an affection for the subject matter. Kronfeld’s
            bizarre home life is exaggerated for the movie, but his fondness for
            all things alien is genuine. Like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Trekkies</i>, which <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Six Days in
            Roswell</i> producer-editor Roger Nygard directed, the new film
            indicates there’s a deeper significance to the fascination many of
            us have toward the subject. Having a close encounter gives a person
            a sense of identity or at least an interesting story to tell. The
            thought of other intelligent beings out there also makes life in
            this world seem less lonely and absurd. It also eerily reflects
            people’s attitudes about more earthbound subjects. Some use the
            Roswell incident to further their already smoldering suspicions of
            the U.S. government, and the owner of an alien art gallery is
            concerned that children see extraterrestrials in a positive, less
            fearful light. Even the Roswell churches get into the act. One group
            refers to Jesus as the &quot;Head Alien&quot; while others dismiss
            the aliens as demonic.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kronfeld and Johnson give the
            subject of aliens and our reaction to them a good deal more wit and
            insight than it usually receives. At times, however, it would have
            been nice if they had put a stronger faith in their subject. Some of
            the &quot;dramatized&quot; humor works, like Kronfeld’s run in
            with shotgun fanatics. Other bits do not. Having Kronfeld playing a
            sullen loner who lives with his worrywart mother seems a little too
            hackneyed to be funny.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still, Kronfeld’s hosting
            approach is often refreshing. Instead of holding himself up as an
            authority or as a neutral observer, he makes a dufus of himself and
            has a great time doing so. Because he’s willing to poke fun at
            himself, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Six Days in Roswell</i>
            never feels like a cheap joke. Even if the thought of watching yet
            another documentary on life on other worlds makes you cringe,
            Kronfeld and Johnson also know how to make you appreciate the
            occasionally strange beliefs of others and laugh with them instead
            of at them.</font></p>
