            review by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 18 August 2000</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>For over thirty years,
            Baltimore’s favorite son John Waters has made a career with films
            that gleefully flout morality and good taste. His latest work of
            delightfully unrepentant trash, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Cecil B. Demented</i>, is one of his lesser works. Nonetheless, it
            demonstrates that he has a lot to teach the current generation of
            gross-out artists.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A lot of recent comedies like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Ready to Rumble</i> ridicule their misfit protagonists. Waters, however,
            always gives viewers the feeling that he’s one of the outcasts
            he’s filming. For example, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Hairspray</i>
            proved once and for all that overweight people can be beautiful and
            roused its audience against the more conventional-looking
            antagonists. Similarly, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Cecil
            B. Demented</i> clearly sides with its protagonists and their cause.
            The title character (Stephen Dorff) is an aspiring director who has
            recruited a variety of disillusioned movie lovers to literally
            declare war on Hollywood. He and his crew, known as the Sprocket
            Holes, are willing to kill and die for better flicks. From the
            opening frames, it’s obvious they have a lot to be militant about.
            The only offerings their cineplexes have are the new installments of
            <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Star Wars</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Star
            Trek</i> and a Pauly Shore film festival.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But even guerilla filmmakers need a
            star. To obtain one, the Sprocket Holes kidnap the spoiled,
            over-the-hill starlet Honey Whitlock (a typecast but effective
            Melanie Griffith) during a gala premiere in (where else but?)
            Baltimore, a kidnapping that allows Waters to dish out dozens of
            vintage wisecracks (&quot;MPAA. How many films did you censor
            today?&quot;). He also does the inconceivable: he features a
            disturbing and often sidesplitting series of gags involving a
            disabled child. Waters gets away with this cruel series by targeting
            the exploitative &quot;poster-child&quot; mentality of some
            charities.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After successfully abducting Honey
            and inadvertently giving the smug matriarch of a Baltimore charity a
            heart attack. Cecil and the Sprocket Holes find themselves well on
            their way into producing their first film and toward jail. At first,
            Honey, who normally verbally abuses her entourage, tries to resist
            her captors. This is a wise move on her part because they film
            themselves raiding movie theaters showing inferior product (one
            frighteningly believable selection is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Patch
            Adams: The Director’s Cut</i>). As her captivity progresses,
            however, Honey finds her giving a better performance than she’s
            given in years and becoming a cult hero for taking on bad movies and
            the executives who make them. When she attacks a producer who has
            just made yet another film based on a video game, he lamely retorts,
            &quot;Don’t blame me! I don’t even watch movies.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Waters can stand on firm ground
            when he attacks studios for reading more ledgers than scripts.
            It’s obvious that he loves movies and wants the best from them. In
            some ways, the biggest problem with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Cecil B. Demented</i> is that Waters preaches to the choir a little too
            much. His potshots lose their impact as the film wears on, and some
            of the side gags fall flat (a Sprocket Hole laments that she has
            recovered memory syndrome). The film is still worth catching because
            Waters’ sincerity is never in doubt, and the Sprocket Holes
            themselves are a scream. Cecil’s perpetually stoned leading man
            Lyle (Adrian Grenier) makes an interesting argument for drug
            addiction. &quot;I used to have a lot of problems. Now, I have just
            one,&quot; he states. There’s also a priceless sequence where
            action movie fans beat up pro-censorship or &quot;family&quot; movie
            forces.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Waters may never reach the
            tasteless glory of the ending to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Pink
            Flamingos</i> again. Perhaps it’s just as well. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Cecil
            B. Demented</i> features no one eating dog feces, but it does offer
            disgruntled filmgoers a frequently entertaining outlet.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
