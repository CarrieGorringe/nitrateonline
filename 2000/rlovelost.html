            review by <a href="../_private/review_template.htm" target="_top"> Elias Savada</a>,
            16 June 2000</i></font>
<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">For more than
a decade Kenneth Branagh has hoisted Shakespeare on the film-going masses and
shown that even an under-educated patron of the seventh art can enjoy the
timeless verbal invention that the bard of Avon wrote 400 years ago. The
director (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Love’s Labour’s Lost</i> is
his eighth feature), is still best remembered for his debut film, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Henry
V</i> (1989), which won widespread acclaim (with best director and actor
nominations) for the fiery portrayal of the warrior-king. Now, following his
popular <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Much Ado About Nothing</i> (1993), the lukewarm yet diverting <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">A
Midwinter’s Tale</i> (1995), and the unexpurgated <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Hamlet</i>
(1996), he returns to lighter fare and amusing and mostly satisfying stuff. Both
a paean to lyric poetry and Hollywood’s fondly remembered theatrically-set
musical burlesques, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">LLL</i> is quite
audacious for its bubbly lightheadedness, even if it compresses most of the
original at the expense of too many reaction shots. But young love (even if
thirty-nine-year-old Branagh pushes the envelope as a college student) and lust
wait over the near horizon, hanging just above the dockside Japanese lanterns
and nearly as high as the full (paper) moon.</font></b></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As a public domain source, there’s always a handful of
Shakespeare adaptations released every year including the recent <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Hamlet</i>
with Ethan Hawke and the forthcoming <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">O</i>
featuring Mekhi Phifer as Othello. The summer release of this short and sweetly
love-sick version of a lesser-known work, the first for the big screen, is
subtitled “A Romantic Musical Comedy,” reflecting more on Branagh’s
infatuation with the classic Hollywood musical than on being a straightforward
rendering of the play. And yes, that is Stanley Donen, the man (often with Gene
Kelly) behind <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">On the Town</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Singin’ in the Rain</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Royal
Wedding</i>, and a host of other memorable 1950s musicals, who is co-presenting
(with Martin Scorsese) Branagh’s all-singing, all-dancing (well a good part at
least) escape to Technicolor dreams and bygone days before Fred Astaire was dead
and dancing with a vacuum cleaner.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Running a brisk ninety-three minutes, much of the
verbiage of Shakespeare’s original is tossed away out of necessity and scenes
are re-arranged (some authorities will scream mutilation; I won’t); the
missing elements are replaced with ten consummate songs (think glorious Gershwin,
popular Porter, brilliant Berlin, etc.), all sung by the cast (for better or not
so better). Everyone sings at least adequately and always enthusiastically,
reminiscent of Woody Allen’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Everyone
Says I Love You</i>. The dance numbers should make anyone who doesn’t remember
Busby Berkeley head to their favorite search engine then rent some of the
legendary choreographer-director’s better contributions to medium (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">42nd
Street</i> and<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal"> Footlight Parade</i> are but two of a dozen standouts). At least they
didn’t shamelessly re-title it <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Bard
in Sixty Seconds</i>. Jerry Bruckheimer is nowhere in sight. The Shakespearian
sophistication remains (it’s hard to mess that up) and the slapstick elements
highlighted (many characters are overplayed to buffoonish glee). Kudos to
Branagh’s veteran creative staff (Designer Tim Harvey, Director of Photography
Alex Thomson, and Choreographer Stuart Hopps) for an amazing triumph of blocking
the cast without having them trip over each other. Shot almost entirely on
British sound stages, the confined quarters don’t hamper the fun (it didn’t
with Stanley Tucci’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Impostors</i>),
and Costume Designer Anna Buruma dresses the stars to shine brightly (blue,
green, orange, and red for the four sets of lovers) against the sets’ muted
autumn colors.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The action is updated to 1939, just prior to World War
II, and the introduction of the cast is intelligently relayed to the audience in
that forgotten film journal of current events, the newsreel. Complete with
black-and-white grain, dust speckles, and jerky action, Branagh makes
extravagant use of the technique to relate his story—of the King of Navarre
(Alessandro Nivola) and his three best friends, Berowne (Branagh), Longaville
(Matthew Lillard), and Dumaine (Adrian Lester) as they enroll in the higher
study of philosophy. They publicly declare women non gratis so as not to
influence their thought-filled intentions, but the fog-enshrouded arrival of the
beautiful Princess of France (Alicia Silverstone) and her three stunning maids
in waiting: Rosaline (Natascha McElhone), Maria (Carmen Ejogo), and Katherine
(Emily Mortimer) thwart the men’s best laid emotional plans. As expected, the
innocently-dictated strategy often goes awry as the ladies and gents develop
attractions for each other.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">While Europe mobilizes for the impending war, subplots
erupt in town. Don Armado, an oafish, mustachioed Spanish nobleman (Timothy
Spall) frets over Jaquenetta (Stefania Rocca), a hot-blooded, red-headed wench,
starting off the “I Get a Kick Out of You” production number that
incorporates synchronized swimming a la Esther Williams. The dimwitted
vaudeville clown Costard (Nathan Lane), evoking the memory of the great Señor
Wences, a regular of the old <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Ed Sullivan
Show</i>, misdelivers some love letters, a male miscarriage unraveled by the
king’s elderly tutors at the Royal College of Philosophy, Holofernia
(Geraldine McEwan) and Nathaniel (Richard Briers). Wires get crossed but the
actors’ feet don’t. Global combat begins and ends in the blink of a newsreel
frame; the men return heroes and, of course, all’s well that ends well.
You’ll find yourself humming any of the soundtrack standards long after
you’ve left the theater.</font></p>
