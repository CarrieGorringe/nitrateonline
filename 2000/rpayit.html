            Trevor McKinney (Haley Joel Osment). He's only in seventh grade and
            already his life is chucky-full of worries. His mom, Arlene (Helen
            Hunt) works in a Las Vegas casino, is an alcoholic, and has terrible
            bleached blond hair. His dad, Ricky (Jon Bon Jovi) is a classic
            deadbeat, showing up occasionally and staying just long enough to
            present some promise of reform and then beat up Arlene and terrify
            Trevor. His grandmother, Grace (Angie Dickinson), lives in her
            station wagon. His best friend Adam is repeatedly the victim of a
            school bully, which big-hearted Trevor is finding increasingly
            difficult to tolerate. Living in the not-quite wide open,
            underclass-housing spaces of Nevada, Trevor looks out his little
            bedroom window and sees a bleak horizon. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And
            then, Trevor's life changes. His social studies teacher for the new
            school year -- Eugene Simonet (Kevin Spacey) -- gives the class a
            project: do something to change the world. The camera pans the faces
            of the expectant youngsters, some mystified, some beginning to be
            bored, some rolling their eyes. When the camera gets to Trevor, you
            can see that his little mind is percolating. As Mr. Simonet's
            lilting but insistent voice lays out his premise and expectations,
            Trevor is visibly moved. A few days and daily-life montage sequences
            later, he's come up with an idea: he decides to do &quot;something
            big&quot; for three people who &quot;really need it,&quot; with the
            understanding that each will do the same for three more. Soon, the
            whole world will be populated by do-gooders. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If
            this all sounds a little too contrived and striving-to-be-uplifting,
            well, it is. Unfortunately, however, the premise of <i>Pay It
            Forward</i> -- that this sad and fretful little boy is inspired to
            reach out and touch a few someones, most especially his cranky mom
            and lonely teacher, both desperately in need of sex -- is actually
            its least annoying aspect. Much worse is its carefully orchestrated
            alternations between episodes that are heart-warming and
            heart-wrenching. After a while, the whole thing made <b><i>me</i></b>
            feel worried, and I had walked into the theater feeling pretty fine.
            Doubly unfortunately, these tonal shifts are accompanied by Thomas
            Newman's quirky piano-tablas-dulcimer-like score, sounding much the
            same as the one he composed for last year's multi-Oscar-winning
            movie, <i>American Beauty</i>, in which Spacey played another
            frustrated, over-disciplined mid-life crisis candidate. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And
            as soon as you notice these minor similarities, you're doomed,
            because there are others, which are increasingly distracting. Though
            <i>American Beauty</i> takes place in wealthy white suburbs and <i>Pay
            It Forward</i> in the working-class nowhere of the desert, both
            movies feature a wise and martyred soul, recovering abuse victims,
            and touching climaxes that let everyone walk out of the theater
            thinking they're better people for understanding their transparent
            and supposedly profound &quot;meanings.&quot; <i>American Beauty</i>
            had a slightly more snarky edge to its presentation of these
            meanings, not to mention the Dreamworks heavy-hitting promotions
            team behind it, and <i>Pay It Forward</i> is more content to wallow
            in soap opera, so its meanings have less immediately apparent
            resonance. Then again, the simpering tedium of <i>Pay It Forward</i>
            hardly depends on its superficial relation to <i>American Beauty</i>.
            No, <i>Pay It Forward</i>, in fact, comes up with its insipidness
            and condescension toward its characters all on its own. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Let's
            begin with the plot. <i>Pay It Forward</i> rigs its profound
            meanings through a series of devices that manage to be both amazing
            and banal. Perhaps forgivably, since he is so young, Trevor makes
            his first do-gooding target a homeless man (though Preston Sturges
            managed this trick in <i>Sullivan's Travels</i>, here, the
            &quot;use&quot; of the homeless as a means to move its audience is
            affected and patronizing). On his way home from school one day,
            Trevor stops by the local homeless camping spot -- apparently they
            all hang out by the burning trash barrels together, down by the
            &quot;tracks&quot; or some other such fantastical place, where they
            eat cupcakes and smoke cigarettes and drink whatever booze they can
            find. Here Trevor finds a junkie named Jerry (James Caviezel), whom
            he brings home for a dinner of Cap'n' Crunch and Pepsi, while mom is
            off at work. On coming home, Arlene is understandably upset to learn
            that the grimy stranger sleeping in her garage is a homework
            assignment, and so she promptly huffs off to the school to chastise
            Eugene. Conveniently, this encounter initiates the next step in
            Trevor's plan, which is to get his mom and his favorite teacher
            together, initially made difficult by the facts that Eugene is a
            badly scarred burn victim and a self-conscious virgin, and Arlene
            is, despite the advice of her AA mentor, still willing to give Ricky
            another go. She does this despite the fact that she promises Trevor
            that she'll never hurt him again, and of course, disappointment
            helps grease the wheels for audience expectations. Lesson to be
            learned: &quot;pay it forward&quot; is a great idea, but it depends
            on people keeping promises, which most find very hard to do. <o:p>

            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still,
            to make sure that you know it really is a great idea, the movie
            folds in another plot layer that emphasizes its
            phenomenon-&quot;ness&quot;. This involves media participation:
            reporter Chris Chandler (Jay Mohr) is tracking the story some months
            after the idea has started. This means that most of the movie is
            technically a flashback (brief background: Chris is the recipient of
            one magnanimous gesture, and pursues the story to further his
            career, but he soon learns the meaning of generosity, and becomes a
            convert, etc.). Chris' not exactly parallel storyline looks like it
            might approximate narrative complexity, but more importantly, it's a
            way for the film to grant significance to domestic crises: the
            traumas Arlene and Ricky and Eugene endure (and the range of
            characters here is very narrow) are meaningful because they
            &quot;reveal&quot; working-class interior lives to the mainstream
            movie audience who goes to Kevin Spacey and Helen Hunt movies. The
            movie pretends to be sympathetic to them, but the tragedies keep on
            coming, in a way that is so overkill that you can't help but drop
            your jaw in wonder. This kid has reason to worry. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            other words, <i>Pay It Forward</i> pushes very standard emotional
            buttons, particularly through Osment, apparently a born
            button-pusher, with his always-a-little-damp eyes, seeming frailty,
            and memorably breathy voice. His co-stars are less successful,
            relying on melodramatic conventions and make-up (this for Spacey's
            part -- and his face is cornily hidden from your view for the first
            few minutes you see him -- while he's ironing [!], he's so lonely
            and domestic and nice). The first melodramatic turn is mostly
            Arlene's department: at one point, when she's had a really bad time
            of if, she rushes to the garage to glug a hidden bottle of booze.
            Here, Hunt is looking too much like Courtney Thorne-Smith's Alison
            looked during the couple of weeks she was an alcoholic on <i>Melrose
            Place</i>, that is, working very hard to appear desperate. Surely,
            Arlene has much to mourn (not least being her Erin Brockovich-style
            &quot;low-class&quot; midriff blouses and tacky pumps), but you
            can't help feeling that the film is only setting her up for upcoming
            developments, namely, her recovery and redemption. The second turn
            is Eugene's, when he must reveal the cause of his burns, and an
            awful tale it is. Too bad he has to deliver it in a scene that needs
            a rewrite. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Such
            heavy-handed plot designing and telegraphing makes the film more
            tedious than rousing, despite its major effort at the finale to make
            you feel terrible and grateful at the same time. Directed by the
            obviously skilled Mimi Leder and written by Leslie Dixon, based on
            Catherine Ryan Hyde's 1999 novel (in which Eugene is a black veteran
            -- apparently an interracial relationship is too much to
            contemplate, even between working class characters...), <i>Pay It
            Forward</i> is at its meager best in those short moments when images
            overwhelm the trite plot. So, when Chris is hot on the trail of a
            lead -- getting ever closer to the moment when he will put little
            Trevor on television and turn the boy's saga into public
            &quot;history&quot; -- his car appears small in an overhead shot,
            surrounded by an expansive desert landscape: it's pretty.
            Frustratingly, as soon as you realize where he's headed -- to what
            may or may not be his own destiny, but what is definitely Las Vegas
            -- the shot loses its grandeur. The saddening contrast between image
            and &quot;message&quot; is probably best illustrated when Eugene
            describes for his students the ways that their limited,
            eleven-year-old perspectives might or might not have anything to do
            with a &quot;global&quot; network, and the huge classroom window
            behind him reveals the incredible Nevada vista, mountains and blue
            sky. More often, though, the movie loses perspective. And then your
            worries mostly have to do with when it will all be over. </font><o:p>
