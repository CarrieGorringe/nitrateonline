            <p style="tab-stops:121.5pt"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">When someone as self-centered and darkly
            cynical as Illinois-bred Mona Hibbard (Minnie Driver) decides to
            make it her sole ambition in life to win the Miss American Miss
            contest at nearly any devious cost, she alienates her blue collar
            mother, an unemployed, beer-gut of a stepfather, an unforgiving
            audience, and all her friends except one (and she ends up in jail).
            Actually she has just the one friend. No surprise there. As a
            twelve-year-old, played by Colleen Rennison (and looking like a
            young Anna Paquin), Mona disposes of one prissy rival (who later
            stages a mean spirited revenge scheme) in a talent segment by
            smearing instant glue on a baton set aflame and stuck in the
            contestant’s grasp. The ne’er-do-well further serves up a dose
            of faux heroics by dousing the startled competitor with a handy fire
            extinguisher. Seems Mona can’t win anyway, other than a
            “participant” medal during one contest officiated by Kathleen
            Turner as a Southern-fried stage mother. And, although the various
            pageant officials can’t prove it, when Mona’s nearby a scandal
            isn’t far behind.<o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p style="tab-stops:121.5pt"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Then comes the big whooper. She’s
            promiscuous. She has a kid, Vanessa (Hallie Kate Eisenberg). Out of
            wedlock. As that’s a no-no in the Roberts Rule of Beauty
            Pageantry, Mona somehow persuades her best friend Ruby (Joey Lauren
            Adams), a caring but mentally diminutive nurse to raise the girl as
            her own. Skip ahead and the twenty-six-year-old can finally taste
            her dream after seven years of back-stabbing and duplicity, when as
            Miss Illinois Miss America Miss (Say that ten times quickly. Go on.)
            she’s two months away from national victory. As the contest
            approaches, there’s a silly sidebar story at the assisted living
            center where Ruby works that throws the candy striper in jail on a
            bogus “angel of mercy” murder rap (never properly cleared up).
            Don’t you just hate when that happens? God forbid Mona should get
            a life, take the soccer-devoted girl to one of her school matches,
            actually fess up to her daughter, and get her friend out of jail.
            Hey someone has to have priorities. Alas, the two-faced conniver is
            busy prancing about the runways in her bathing suit. Am I missing
            something? What’s to like here? <o:p>

Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Certainly not the script by co-producer Jon
            Bernstein. The press material mysteriously omits his bio, but he’s
            the hack responsible for the forgettable <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Ringmaster</i>,
            his only other feature credit. Maybe Sally Field saw that title as
            his freshman effort and thought it was a circus picture.<o:p>

            the also-ran-cola spokeschild and now-illegitimate offspring.
            She’s grown out of this fiasco, one hopes. The soft-drink company
            should be credited as a co-producer, as it blatantly plants abundant
            product placements on screen for the “P” drink and its potato
            chip subsidiary. The tot gets one of the better insipid lines, and
            you’ll find it in the trailer. When Mona, fitfully searching for a
            phony cause, asks “Do you know any handicapped people?” To which
            Vanessa quickly responds, “Only you.” Download it, play it,
            erase it. Don’t spend the money taking your kids to see this at
            the theater. They won’t speak to you again. Especially after
            seeing Mona and Ruby drive off in a car without buckling their seat
            belts. What kind of example are these mothers setting?<o:p>
