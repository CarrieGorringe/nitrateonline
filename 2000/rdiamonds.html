Douglas’ eighty-third feature won’t be his last, but it certainly will not
be among the more memorable of a lengthy career spanning more than fifty years.
It’s a male-bonding road movie that veers off a weary course filled with
dreary clichés on the way to a possible treasure in diamonds. The trip is
barely worth it. Using a technique similar to last year’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
Limey</i>, in which Terence Stamp’s character from the 1967 <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Poor
Cow</i> pops up anew, there are flashing snippets from Douglas’ classic 1949
effort <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Champion</i>. Although the
character isn’t the same, the black-and-white clips are used to flesh out the
pugnacious references to Harry Agensky (Douglas), a.k.a. “The Polish
Prince”, a former welterweight champion turned semi-depressed widower
recuperating from a speech-debilitating stroke. As a victim of a seizure
himself, Douglas obviously wanted <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Diamonds</i>
to show his fans that he can still act and jab (art imitating life), even if the
setting appears to be no more than a made-for-television,
rebound-from-the-disease-of-the-month movie. Sure, it’s honorable and
heartfelt, but the script, riddled with a few too many coincidences, is a mess,
especially when cantankerous grandfather (Douglas), milksop, old fashioned son
and supposed writer Lance (Dan Aykroyd), and virginal eighteen-year-old grandson
Michael (Corbin Allred), hit a speed bump of a brothel outside Reno.</font><o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The story begins in wintry Western Canada, where the
potentially senile Harry is overstaying his reluctant welcome with frustrated
son Moses (Kurt Fuller) and his wife at their lakeside cabin (cinematographer
Paul Elliott pleasantly captures the pristine water and snow-capped mountains).
The family patriarch, widowed several years, is a restless sort, his only
companion being Bev (Karen Mal), a punky, puckered-up speech therapist existing
only on videotape and later gifted to his coming-of-age grandson. Enter the
divorced Lance and his estranged son in an old red convertible (its broken top
always down—Harry supposedly saved from the elements by a hunter’s cap!) and
before long they whimsically hijack Harry to the states in search of the titular
gems, supposedly hidden in the wall of a gangster’s house in Nevada. It would
have been nice to play the film more as a comedy caper picture after offering
the audience such an inclination, but director John Asher and newbie
screenwriter Allan Aaron Katz (who has a bit part) push any such possibility
aside for all but a fraction of the last few minutes, and as such there’s not
much to applaud in this tepid story of three generations in search of filial
chemistry.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">If the film has a noble core, it’s the brief, queenly
presence of Lauren Bacall as Sin-Dee, a brothel madam who offers earthy advice
and semi-clad, goodhearted, and intelligent-beyond-their-occupation prostitutes
to the wayward men. The whorehouse concept is sanitized to the point of inanity,
portraying women as love objects at the same time they are showcased as
intelligent windows to the soul. Yipes, it’s a dopey retread of the old
hooker-with-the-heart-of-gold routine. You’d think the script could have found
a better way to service the three leads than through this cleaned-up
titillation. For all the gorgeous gals (MTV’s Jenny McCarthy among them),
where are all the other patrons? Guess they’re out gambling. It’s a
nonsensical sequence dealing with each man’s common inability to perform.
Goodness, what a creaky plotline. The only saving grace being Bacall’s deep
voice as she soothes the distracted Harry, his lecherous bravado dissipated by
his love for his late wife. Bacall and Douglas, who last co-starred together in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Young Man With a Horn</i> a half-century ago, both offer up
semi-precious performances that are better than the material they are given.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The screenplay is terribly calculated toward a
sentimental, up-with-people ending, with a “magical” twist that’s all too
obvious a reel earlier. In a way the film bears a close similarity to Diane
Keaton’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Hanging Up</i>, as both deal
with how families deal with an aging father figure, one from the male point of
view, the other from the ladies’ side. Both films misfire in the
“where-were-you-when-I-needed-you” department. Both will be quickly
forgotten.</p>
