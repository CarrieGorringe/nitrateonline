            review by <a href="../kj.html" target="_top">KJ Doughton</a>, 4 August 2000</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Paul Verhoeven’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Hollow
            Man</i> is so bad, its cast and crew might consider making
            themselves invisible when the opening-day reviews are fired from
            critics’ cruel pens. The one-liners are sure to be fast and
            furious: "I wish <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Hollow Man</i>
            would disappear," one disgruntled scribe will complain about this
            lame invisible-man-goes-bad turkey. "It’s a hollow movie," another
            will surely write, before zeroing in on such obvious targets as a
            stillborn script and career-low acting by its slumming cast.
            However, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Hollow Man</i>’s worst sin is its reluctance to take risks. And for a
            Paul Verhoeven film to have cold feet is a sin, indeed.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Dutch director has failed
            before, with such lurid, glossy duds as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Starship
            Troopers</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Showgirls</i>.
            The former showcased some of the most spectacular sets and post-<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Star
            Wars</i> special effects ever designed, and put them at the service
            of a story concerning… intergalactic bug warfare. The latter took
            on <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Golden Turkey</i> infamy as one of the worst films of all time, with its
            Joe Esterhaus-penned script boasting the most unintentionally
            hilarious dialogue this side of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Plan
            Nine From Outer Space</i>. Yet, in both cases, these movies were <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">spectacular</i> failures. Neither was boring: instead, they splattered
            the screen with enough wild-ass, garish excess that one couldn’t
            possibly look away. Meanwhile, when this Dutch director hits a
            bull’s-eye, as with the 1987 action classic <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">RoboCop</i>,
            his lurid, unflinching sensibilities make the routine seem exotic
            and unsettling.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Hollow
            Man</i>, Verhoeven’s penchant for going to extremes is replaced by
            a neutered, paint-by-numbers approach that is purely by the book.
            Let’s sit back and play "count the clichés" game as I quote from
            the Columbia Pictures press release: The film is set in a "top
            secret military lab". A group of "brilliant young scientists" have
            discovered the secret of invisibility. The group’s leader is "arrogant".
            He "ignores the risks" and attempts to test the invisibility
            procedure on himself. After his comrades are unable to reverse the
            effect, the leader’s "intoxication with his newfound power is
            growing, and he’s come to believe his colleagues may be a threat
            to his very existence."</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">So there you have it. That’s <i>Hollow
            Man</i> in a nutshell. Scientist goes crazy. No surprises, no
            twists, nothing more than this bare-bones outline with some
            admittedly cool special effects thrown in.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kevin Bacon plays Sebastian Caine, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Hollow Man</i>’s mastermind scientist whose invisibility research on
            dogs, rats, and apes has claimed the lives of more furry critters
            than a Ted Nugent safari. His faceless crew consists of ex-flame
            Linda Foster (Elisabeth Shue); Matt Kensington (Josh Brolin),
            Foster’s new romantic interest; and Sarah (Kim Dickens), whose
            concern for the lab’s experimental animals is at odds with
            Caine’s "end-justifies-the-means" approach. There are also a
            couple of completely expendable techno-experts thrown in: they
            inhabit an elevated control station and holler scientific jargon
            back and forth in an effort to make these superficial stiffs seem
            more credible as genius-level professionals.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">On the drab, metallic
            experimentation station below them, Caine straps a sedated gorilla
            onto a steel table, and pumps colorful fluids into the animal’s
            veins. But there’s something perversely wrong here. The ape, you
            see, is invisible. Caine’s attempts to "crack reversion" with his
            potion, and successfully re-organize the body’s structure in a way
            that makes the holding cell invisible, have succeeded.
            Unfortunately, past attempts to bring such animals <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">back</i>
            from transparency have resulted in agonizing death for the unknowing
            candidates. This time around, however, things look promising. In the
            film’s best scene, one sees the injected fluid fill the
            gorilla’s veins, enter its heart, and push out to peripheral
            arteries. Then, the ape’s skeletal structure peeks out from
            beneath fast-forming muscles and vital organs. Layer by layer, flesh
            and fur materialize until this impressive beast is completely
            intact. It’s a brilliant example of new millenium special effects
            that transcends earlier examples of body-morphing included in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Altered
            States</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Fly</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Thing</i>, and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Terminator 2:
            Judgment Day</i>.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Soon enough, Caine is itching to
            try the invisibility serum on himself, and lies to his boss at the
            Pentagon, Dr. Kramer (William Devane, recently resurrected from
            obscurity and popping up everywhere as a character actor), about his
            need for additional time to perfect the process. Caine, the ultimate
            anal-retentive, fears that the military will take over his project
            without allowing him to become the procedure’s first human
            subject. While it’s entirely unlikely that this unsympathetic
            egomaniac’s support team would go along with the deception, Foster
            and Kensington support their boss and his dishonest scheme.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s here that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Hollow
            Man</i> plays it safe when it should be detouring into daring
            directions. Caine does indeed repeat the process on himself –
            successfully. Yet, instead of exploring the lure of voyeuristic
            kicks that invisibility invites, Verhoeven jettisons this angle
            early on. When Caine sneaks into the apartment of a shapely female
            neighbor, the movie implies that his basest instincts take over and
            he assaults the woman. But the whole sequence ends abruptly, as if
            the filmmakers were scared to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">really</i>
            examine the ugliness of such undisciplined power. Would a somewhat
            unstable man such as Caine resort to rape if given the key to
            invisibility? As the scene stands, we’re not sure: it’s a cheap
            tease that makes one feel short-changed and manipulated.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Soon afterwards, however, the
            filmmakers have no misgivings about turning Caine into a mad slasher.
            When an attempt to bring Caine back to "visible mode" is
            unsuccessful, the unseen wacko begins snuffing out his crewmates.
            Devane’s military higher-up is alerted that Caine has gone around
            the bend, and he’s drowned in a swimming pool before the word gets
            any further. Then, Bacon’s vengeful psychopath goes after his
            ex-girlfriend Foster and other science cronies like Jason, Freddy,
            or any number of generic horror villains. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Hollow
            Man</i> ends in a torrent of downright embarrassing mayhem, as
            survivors stumble upon slain comrades, spend a few seconds
            mournfully weeping, and are jolted back to action while mouthing
            such lines as, "Come on! I heard an explosion!" When Brolin’s
            character sustains a wicked cut that would finish off an elephant,
            Shue’s clinical brainiac reaches for a role of duct tape and slaps
            a piece across the gaping wound. Problem solved! The two are soon
            saving the world from their invisible assailant like a couple of
            Olympic gymnasts, leaping like gazelles into elevator shafts and
            surviving exploding nitroglycerin.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hollow
            Man</font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2"> is one of the worst
            films to surface in years, primarily because of its complete and
            utter predictability. Like last year’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Deep
            Blue Sea</i>, which took a high-tech premise and reduced it to
            familiar action-movies cliches and autopilot dialogue, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Hollow Man</i> is the latest example of a film completely dependent on
            its technical elements. Perhaps Verhoeven was pressured by the
            studio to keep things safe, convinced that the great effects
            sequences would be enough to guarantee an audience. But there’s no
            pushing the outer envelope, no personal touch. And for all of its
            flirtations with sex and violence, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Hollow
            Man</i>’s impersonal soul keeps it from being truly disturbing.
            Once upon a time, the director of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Basic
            Instinct</i> was known for taking things too far. This time, he
            hasn’t gone nearly far enough.</font><o:p>
