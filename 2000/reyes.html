            American goddess says goodbye to daytime television, an older, and

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Goodbye Kathie Lee. Welcome back
            Tammy Faye.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While not cut from the same cloth,
            both strong-willed women have their pedestals, admirers, detractors,
            better than decent singing voices, and men who strayed. They are
            definitely survivors. But the lady that put up with Regis for
            fifteen years has moved on. This is Tammy’s cockeyed optimist
            story -- sad and true.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The creepy thing about the former
            televangelist (that’s Tammy Faye for any of you living in a fish
            bowl) is that she’s still capable of giving you goosebumps. The
            puffed-up hair, the round, veneer-smeared face, and those EYES™!
            Like some overdressed vamp, I always felt there was something
            fearful about this icon of Christian entertainment. Whether Tammy
            self-destructed on her own terms or with the “help” of the media
            (<i>The Charlotte Observer </i>won a Pulitzer Prize for reporting on
            the PTL Network fiasco, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">or</i>
            David Letterman’s Top Ten Reasons Exxon Is Leaving Alaska: No. 6:
            Just got contract to take makeup off Tammy Faye Bakker.) is the
            basis for this new documentary by award-winning producer-directors
            Fenton Bailey and Randy Barbato<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal"> </i>(<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Party Monster</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Real Ellen Story</i>, and creators of numerous television series
            including <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Adam and Joe
            Show</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Hollywood Fashion
            Machine</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Manhattan Cable</i>,
            and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The RuPaul Show</i> [who
            narrates this film]). I always felt Mrs. Bakker was a glorified,
            spoiled, prima donna who got her proper comeuppance.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">These days I’m not so sure. The
            late night laughter as the butt of endless jokes has faded; could it
            be time to heal? Finally you get a glimpse behind her makeup while
            she continues to lacquer it on. Of course it’s ALL PERMANENT!
            Didn’t know that? Those eyebrows are tattooed on; her lips forever
            lined. Don’t touch those eye lashes either! Yow! The film goes
            behind it all, chronicling her rise and multiple falls through a
            series of chapters heralded by two sock puppets, a la <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Babe</i>’s
            three little mice. It’s and amateurish touch, mildly amusing,
            inspired by the hand dolls that were part of the Bakker’s
            children’s act (Susie Moppet and Allie the Alligator I think were
            two of the names I heard mentioned). Pat Robertson gave them this
            start at his single station network, but Jim and Tammy corralled
            their talent into a six-year stint with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The 700 Club</i>, a local Christian newsmagazine talk show that made
            them stars. Robertson, ever resentful of their success, pulled them
            from the show and showed them the door.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Next stop? California and their
            friends Paul and Jan Crouch (who, like Robertson, declined to be
            interviewed for this film. The filmmakers make sure you know this;
            they shove the rejection letters in your face.) There, Jim and Tammy
            help create Trinity Broadcasting Network and grow TBN to a huge
            success, only to be shown the door.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Final stop (before jail,
            embarrassment, and the Betty Ford Clinic): PTL in Charlotte. Jim’s
            ambitions overwhelm the family (their two children grew up in front
            of the cameras, and suffered for it -- both reflect on camera) as
            the network becomes the first to launch its own satellite and air
            24/7. Jim becomes a non-stop shill raising money for Heritage
            U.S.A., a now defunct Disney-style theme park that rivaled Mickey
            Mouse for the religious masses. Late in the film Tammy returns to
            the weed-covered retreat, abandoned in the aftermath of the PTL
            bankruptcy. There’s a distinct sadness in her voice as she recalls
            the dashed hopes of her former husband and his anal-retentive
            attention to detail. A touch of melancholy overcomes her as she
            symmetrically pushes some rusty deck chairs under a table. Jim would
            have liked that.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Recalling the headlines of more
            than a decade ago, you have to wonder now: was she a witless twit, a
            clueless witch, some amalgam of devil and saint? The first lady of
            religious television talks straight to the camera, obviously
            believing her decision to proceed with this project was by divine
            intervention. Like it or not, there’s a stain of sympathy coloring
            your former preconceptions as Tammy Faye challenges her audience at
            film’s end: “Come on people, don’t you dare give up!”</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">She’s also a terribly forgiving
            soul. Nothing wrong with that, actually. Sure, she lives in virtual
            seclusion in a gated community these days, pitching her ideas and
            starring down USA Network’s Steven Chao, who has no intention of
            putting her on the air. The real villains are unmasked as the
            cunningly nasty S.O.B. Jerry Falwell (by on-screen accusations and
            confirmations) and Jessica Hahn, who turned a one-nighter with Jim
            Bakker into a Playboy tell-all video and a tawdry made-for-TV
            feature (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Fall From Grace</i>) featuring Kevin Spacey and Bernadette Peters.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Filmmakers Bailey and Barbato cover
            all the bases and Tammy tells you true in a brisk seventy-nine
            minutes. She makes all us doubting Thomases feel a little less sure
            how to judge this American classic. Do not judge this book by its
            cover.</font></p>
