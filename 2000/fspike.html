Times"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s been a few years since my last
feature-length animation compilation and finding one playing here in Washington,
DC, brings world class entertainment to those who can’t find it in the White
House or on Capitol Hill. Arriving for a two-week stay at Visions Cinema, a
refreshing new art house twin/bistro/lounge with a mission statement that begs
to answer &quot;</font></b></span><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Why, on a
normal Friday, are six films are reviewed in the <i>New York Times</i> but only
2 make it to DC?&quot; with a slew of previously unseen indie and foreign
features in this part of the world. If you’re in the Dupont Circle
neighborhood (slumming or otherwise), check out this delightful alternative (<a href="http://www.visionsdc.com)/" target="_top">www.visionsdc.com)</a>.</font></b></p>
<p style="tab-stops:121.5pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As for the anthology
at hand, brought to you by ifilm.com (which cybercasts several of the shorts at
their website), among the highlights are three films nominated for the 1999 Best
Animated Short Film Academy Award. Those share time with more than eleven other
titles, ranging from a few minutes (the German <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Bsss</i>, a CGI effort by Felix Gönnert, taking an amiable slap at a
fly enamored of a picture book), to the nearly thirteen-minute National Film
Board of Canada’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Village of Idiots</i>.
This award-winning pen-and-ink subject is the first-person doppelganger tale of
Schmendrik, a Sholom Aleichem character with a chuckleheaded view of life and
Talmudic mysticism in the small <b><i>shtetl</i></b> that bears an uncanny
resemblance to his home town of Chelm.</font></p>
<p style="tab-stops:121.5pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">One of my favorite
discoveries is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Angry Kid</i>, actually a
series of four minute-and-a-half length items by Aardman Animation, who
unleashed <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Wallace and Gromit</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Chicken
Run</i> on the world. They all feature a carrot-top clay animation monster, a
nasty child usually stuck in the back seat of his dad’s car and causing all
sorts of commotion. Another has him and his younger, orange-haired sister
wide-eyed as they watch (off-screen) a sex education program. Apparently the
action becomes too graphic for them, but switching channels just gets a show
about liposuction with a vacuum cleaner!</font></p>
<p style="tab-stops:121.5pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The show begins with
the capricious puppet cartoon <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Graveyard
Jamboree with Mysterious Moose</i>, a four-minute ode to stop-motion,
silhouette, and puppetry, not to mention road-kill cemetery syncopation. A
perfect Halloween treat by Mark Caballero and Seamus Walsh</font></p>
<p style="tab-stops:121.5pt"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Fishing</font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">
is a whimsical daydream by American David Gainey, a line drawn fisherman who,
like Mickey Mouse in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Fantasia</i>, gets
more than he wishes for, even if it might be a wet dream. Expect a kicker and
you’ll get two.</font></p>
<p style="tab-stops:121.5pt"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At
the Ends of the World</font></span></i><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times">
is a seven-minute French short by Russian Konstantin Bronzit that feels like a
European short of years ago. It’s a tilted view of a house teetering atop a
mountain peak (visions of an old Charlie Chaplin film echo in my brain as I
watched). It’s a hilariously precipitous life for the family, more than
stuffed in their wooden box with a cow, dog, cat, and a sports car.<o:p>
 </o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p style="tab-stops:121.5pt"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Among the several entries with a Tim Burton
feel is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Slim Pickings</i>, a two character Australian parable about man’s
inability to choose between his friends and his stomach. This morality play
offers &quot;many thanks to the people upstairs&quot; as one of its credits.<o:p>
 </o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p style="tab-stops:121.5pt"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:

their pluses:<o:p>
 </o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p style="tab-stops:121.5pt"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Paul Driessen’s Dutch fractured fairy
tale <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Three Misses</i> overlaps a trio of heroes in animated search of their
damsels, with twists and turns in store for the maiden tied to the train tracks,
the Seven Dwarves, Sleeping Beauty, and cameos by Puss n’ Boots, Red Riding
Hood, and a host of other grim and Grimm characters.<o:p>
 </o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p style="tab-stops:121.5pt"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hum
Drum</font></span></i><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times">,
also from Aardman Animation, is a reflective bit of shadow puppetry, with two
English blokes, bored of the too many Musak variations of La Cucaracha that the
radio spouts at them, decide to play shadow puppets. &quot;It’ll be fun!&quot;
Boy is it.<o:p>
 </o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p style="tab-stops:121.5pt"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The second NFB short, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">When
the Day Breaks</i>, by Wendy Tilby and Amanda Forbis, is a fate-filled story,
complete with flashbacks and glimpses of memory, that reveals the connective
tissue of the universe when a stranger in the neighborhood dies.<o:p>
 </o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p style="tab-stops:121.5pt"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Panther</font></span></i><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times">,
my least favorite of the batch, is a impressionist German look of a Greek
sculpture inspired by R.M. Rilke’s poem <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Der
Panther</i>. It’s a think piece for those who need a break from the laughter.<o:p>
 </o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p style="tab-stops:121.5pt"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Will Vinton Studios (TV’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
PJs</i>) contributes Kirby Atkins’ <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Mutt</i>,
a stand-up comic bit featuring a computer-generated Jerry Mutt doing Jerry
Steinfeld doggy laughs for a smoke-filled comedy club peopled with dogs. It’s
more satisfying as a technical victory (particularly the illusion of using a
hand-held camera) than for the humor.<o:p>

<p style="tab-stops:121.5pt"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ghost
of Stephen Foster</font></span></i><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times">
is the winner of the spirit award for honoring Max and David Fleischer’s old
style 1930s short with a dizzying pace set to the music of the Squirrel Nut
Zippers. It hops and jumps like an animated MTV video. A knockout by Raymond S.
Persi and Matthew Nastuk (a director on <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
Simpsons</i>).<o:p>
 </o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p style="tab-stops:121.5pt"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">From Norway comes a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Huset
på kampen (One Day a Man Bought a House)</i>, Pjotr Sapegin’s funny and
tender clay animation tale of a man, his house, and a big rat. It’s about near
extinction (by a Malaysian pit bull cat) and found affection (it won’t be a
stylish marriage). Effectively narrated by Odd Børretzen. Love does indeed work
in mysterious ways.<o:p>
 </o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p style="tab-stops:121.5pt"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The closer is the sadistic <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Billy’s
Balloon</i>, a tale of rubbery revenge on stick-figured children from the morbid
mind of Don Hertzfeldt. This fantasy will blatantly deflate those fond memories
some of you harbor for the Oscar-winning 1956 French classic <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
Red Balloon</i>. You’ll leave laughing in spite of your sensibilities.<o:p>
