<p class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Big, broad,
and ballsy, an overstuffed Martin Lawrence looms large in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Big
Momma’s House</i> and appears ready to toss a gross-out shtick at Tom Cruise
and his Mission: Impossible team one week after <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">M:I-2</i>
toppled Memorial Day Weekend records. The actor/comedian (and executive
producer) continues his good guy/bad guy/wise guy obsession with law enforcement
(<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Blue Streak</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Life</i>,
<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Nothing to Lose</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Bad Boys</i>)
and finally appears primed to move up the big league box office ladder toward
that $100 million mark with his latest off-taste comedy. In the post-holiday
aftermath, 20th Century-Fox’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Big Momma</i>
placed first with an opening day tally of $7.65 million, a smidgen above the
Paramount Pictures caper film. Lawrence’s 1999 releases (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Blue Streak</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Life</i>) each
garnered about 6 1/2 million opening day before accumulating US grosses of
between sixty to seventy million. His 1997 action hit <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Bad Boys</i>, with Will Smith, earned similar dollar marks. Despite the
fierce summer competition and without benefit of a strong co-star,
Maryland-native Lawrence seems to have found a strong solo effort to crush the
national competition.</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The
hackneyed, unbelievable script by Darryl Quarles and Don Rhymer is mild on
originality and inspired as a skewered transmutation of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Stakeout</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Kindergarten Cop</i>,
with a pinch of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">MacGyver</i> (a.k.a. 101
uses of duct tape). The storyline is one of the biggest illusions in the film,
centering on the undercover and ultimately romantic shenanigans of hotshot,
semi-insubordinate FBI agent Malcolm Turner (Lawrence) and his ulcer-bound
sidekick John (Paul Giamatti). Only the Lawrence “charm,” hidden under a ton
of rubber makeup makes the film work, with his off-color wide-size quips, padded
physical pratfalls, and share-the-joke-with-the-audience situations. But work it
does.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">After
an introductory bust of a Korean dog-fighting ring establishes Turner’s
ability to disguise himself as a Seoul Man, the action moves from Los Angeles to
a small Georgia hamlet, where the salt and pepper team set up surveillance
across the street from Big Momma’s house. The film lays there for the next 90
minutes, a comic send/set up for the expected lame put down of the nasty-crafty
Lester Vesco (Terrence Howard) an escaped bank robber in pursuit of his ex-girl
friend Sherry Pierce (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Boiler Room</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Best
Man</i> star Nia Long) and two million in stolen loot. The titular fat lady is
explained to be the “long lost” grandmother of the frightened object of the
nasty criminal’s intentions. Genealogically speaking, I’m not sure how you
can lose a grandparent, other than as a poorly scripted excuse to allow for
assorted “Big Momma you sure look different” japes. I’ve found hundreds of
lost cousins in search of my roots. I don’t know anyone who’s lost their
parents’ parents? Estranged yes, but never lost. Perhaps this should be a chat
thread over at ancestry.com.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That
digression aside, when the real Big Momma, Hattie Mae (Ella Mitchell) takes a
powder to be with a friend out of town, the cool-headed Turner hightails it
across the street, puts on some unsightly silicone corpulence, gets <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tootsie</i>-ized,
and barely breaks a sweat just as single-mom Sherry arrives in town with her
young son, Trent (Jascha Washington). As the heavily-disguised Turner welcomes
the long absent grand-daughter, “she” cooks up a disgusting Crisco-smothered
southern storm in Big Momma’s kitchen, turning stomachs in the audience and
heads at Procter &amp; Gamble’s product placement department, maker of the
venerable all-vegetable shortening product. Like most of the humor in this
fat-headed picture, it may be cheap and groan inducing, but it delivers triple
X-sized laughs in a PG-13 framework.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The
generally nosy but apparently slow-thinking locals don’t seem to connect the
dots when their 325-pound friend and neighbor takes to slam-dunking basketballs
against some kids picking on Trent; or, reminiscent of a segment I saw on
television’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Martial Law</i>, putting a
self-interested karate “master” in his place with some choice moves. This is
called suspension of belief for the uninformed. On the other side of the coin,
Turner gets a few lessons in humility (although Lawrence imbues any such
tutorials with hilarious supporting characters and heartfelt comic results),
when unexpectedly forced to deliver a baby or revivalize the congregation at the
local church with a rousing rendition of “Oh Happy Day.”<o:p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Often
homebound but seldom boring, director Raja Gosnell, the editor of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Home

normal">Mrs. Doubtfire</i>, as well as helmer of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Home Alone 3</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Never Been
Kissed</i>, is a comedy director who makes his third feature work with well
executed slapstick episodes of often outrageous timing and expressively reactive
eyework by Lawrence as he hides behind his makeup. He delivers a belly-full of
crowd-pleasing antics, enough to wonder of Lawrence’s friend and sometimes
co-star Eddie Murphy has his work cut out for him when <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Nutty
Professor II: The Klumps</i> arrives later this summer. The world, one hopes, is
big enough for both of them.</font></span></p>
