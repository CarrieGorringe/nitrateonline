            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 10 November 2000</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">You may have already heard about <i>The
            Ring</i>; if you haven't, you're probably going to. This remarkable
            1998 Japanese scare film is only now making its way westward,
            opening in London during the summer; it is scheduled to appear in
            U.S. theaters next year. (For those who can't wait, it can currently
            be seen on import VCD.) In the meantime, the picture became so
            phenomenally successful in Japan that it has spawned a sequel (made
            by the same director), a prequel (not made by the same director), a TV.
            miniseries, a Korean remake, and an interactive video game.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Two teenage girls, Tomoko(Yuko
            Takeuchi) and Masami (Hitomi Sato), are seen discussing the latest
            rumor floating among their schoolmates: a &quot;cursed&quot;
            videotape which, after a person has seen it, will cause them to
            receive a phone call telling them that they will be dead in a week.
            After a week, what was foretold in the phone call becomes a reality.
            What could be causing it? Somebody &quot;stealing&quot; the TV
            airwaves? Masami steps out of the room for a moment; Tomoko stays.
            The phone rings. She answers it, then hears something behind her.
            What Tomoko didn't tell Masami was that she had seen the
            &quot;cursed&quot; videotape with some friends, one week earlier.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Reiko (Nanako Matsushima), a Tokyo TV.
            journalist, starts looking into the rumors about the videotape. She
            has more than a passing interest in them, since Tomoko was her
            niece. So, too, does Ryuji (Hiroyuki Sanada), a university professor
            who was tutoring Tomoko. When Reiko finally finds a copy of the
            videotape and views it -- and then receives a phone call directly
            afterwards -- she and Ryuji team up to find out, during the seven
            days that follow, if there's any way to undo the &quot;curse,&quot;
            since it could have a direct bearing on Yoichi (Rikiya Otaka),
            Reiko's young son, whom she and Ryuji had before they were divorced.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The &quot;curse&quot; turns out to
            involve the unfortunate fate surrounding Shizuko, a woman who could
            &quot;speak to the sea&quot; and had extrasensory powers; Dr. Ikuma,
            who brought Shizuko to the attention of the media who praised, then
            publicly denounced, her; and Sadako, Shizuko's daughter, who was
            regarded as a &quot;monster&quot; because she could kill people with
            just one look. Reiko and Ryuji discover that there is a, possible,
            way to reverse the effects of the video -- by having a second person
            watch the same copy of the tape, within seven days, after the first
            person has seen it. Thus, the only way to &quot;preserve our
            lives&quot; (as one character puts it) is by causing the video to be
            seen exponentially -- the &quot;ring&quot; referred to in the title.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The director Hideo Nakata had only
            directed one other feature film before making <i>The Ring</i>. His
            previous film experience includes writing the lyrics to the <i>Gamera
            March</i> heard in the 1969 film <i>Gamera vs. Guiron</i>, featuring
            everyone's favorite giant flying turtle with a soft spot for kids.
            While credit for <i>The Ring</i> must be shared with screenwriter
            Hiroshi Takahashi and Yoji Suzuki, author of the novel on which it's
            based (Suzuki has been referred to as the Japanese equivalent of
            Stephen King, with regards to his genre output), <i>The Ring</i>
            accomplishes all of its effects entirely through staging and
            atmosphere. Anyone looking for slice-and-dice action must go
            elsewhere. As the story moves inexorably through its seven day
            timeframe, the picture becomes increasingly mesmerizing. There are
            some astonishing effects, such as when the skull of a long-lost
            person seems to well with tears after it has been discovered and is
            lifted towards the light. And the film culminates with a scene that
            is easily one of the most hair-raising moments ever captured on
            film, one that can stand alongside similar scenes in <i>Diabolique</i>,
            <i>The Innocents</i>, and <i>Psycho</i>.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It would have been enormously
            simple to do a knockoff sequel to <i>The Ring</i> that would have
            simply repeated the high points from the first film for an audience
            that was already eagerly appreciative of them. That does not turn
            out to be the case with <i>The Ring 2</i>, which premiered in 1999.
            The filmmakers chose to go in a different direction, one where the
            timeframe, by contrast, was looser, more dreamlike, as if, when the
            colour slowly drained from the picture and turned the last visual in
            the previous film black-and-white, the world had become
            out-of-kilter, and was a stranger, more unreliable place.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mai (Miki Nakatani), a passing
            character in the first film, is front and center in <i>The Ring 2</i>.
            (Almost all of the original cast and crew returned for the second
            film.) A friend of Tomoko and Masami, she is haunted by the fact
            that Masami -- the girl who had stepped out of the room when
            something reached out and took Tomoko -- has wound up in the
            psychiatric ward of a hospital. Okazaki (Masahiko Ono) returns to
            the video interviews he and Reiko made about the &quot;cursed&quot;
            videotape -- Reiko and her son have mysteriously disappeared, and no
            one seems to know what happened. Mai's path takes her to Yoichi, who
            appears to be manifesting the same paranormal powers that Sadako
            had; to an experiment that attempts to conduct psychic energy into
            water, where it &quot;dissolves;&quot; and a face-to-face encounter
            with Sadako herself, who comes right up next to Mai only to softly
            utter, &quot;Why are you the only one saved?&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Characters slide in and out of the
            landscape, like untethered thoughts. In one of the most
            astonishingly unexpected poetic effects I can recall seeing in any
            film of late, blood flows across a street pavement and, when it
            reaches the curbstone, creates a mournful pattern to the observer
            looking down upon it. (This is the ONLY instance where blood appears
            in either of the films.) As in the first <i>Ring</i>, people
            suddenly find themselves experiencing extraordinary powers that they
            never knew they had (not unlike what occurs in the 1968 film <i>Five
            Million Years to Earth</i>): Reiko and Ryuji learn some important
            information about Shizuko and Sadako through a shared psychic
            experience, not from anything they read or are told about (people
            are reticent to talk about Shizuko and her daughter, for good
            cause), and Mai begins to have similar experiences as she learns
            more and more about Sadako. Mysterious forces also seem to reach out
            through modern technology -- such as when someone discovers that an
            image on a video editing machine begins to act in ways that are
            beyond their control -- whether to wreak havoc or seek redemption.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Videos don't kill. Fear
            kills,&quot; says one character in <i>The Ring 2</i>. One of the
            reasons why mutterings about a U.S. remake of <i>The Ring</i> are
            being treated disparagingly is because the Japanese films are so
            heavily shaped by the sensibilities of the people who made them.
            There is so much about <i>The Ring</i> and <i>The Ring 2</i> that
            can be easily coarsened, but not necessarily taken in a direction
            that could be considered to be in any way better.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After <i>The Ring 2</i>, a prequel,
            <i>Ring 0: The Birthday</i>, was made, by another director, and
            released. Rather than just backtracking thirty years to tell the
            story of Shizuko and Sadako all over again, the picture is said to
            go even further, showing the beginnings of the &quot;curse&quot;
            which ended up affecting them.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Nakata, in the meantime, has
            already made two new films -- a romance, <i>Sleeping Bride</i>, and <i>Chaos</i>,
            a thriller involving a detective, a married woman (played by Miki
            Nakatani), her husband, and a third man who kidnaps her. Nakata is
            said to be currently working on a film version of <i>The Glass Brain</i>,
            a story by Osamu Tezuka, the enormously prolific &quot;manga&quot;
            and &quot;anime&quot; creator whose original characters include
            Kimba, the White Lion and Astro Boy. Here's hoping that Nakata's
            work turns out to be the most exciting to emerge in the &quot;cinefantastique&quot;
            field in twenty years.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
