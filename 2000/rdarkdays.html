            <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana"><b>The
            deserving winner of an absolute slew of awards at this year's
            Sundance festival (the Best Documentary and Freedom of Expression
            Award among them), <i>Dark Days</i> is the emotionally rending end
            product of director Marc Singer's two-year residency in the tunnels
            under New York City's Penn Station.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Here, he documents the lives of the homeless and the various
            miseries (crack, dysfunctional families, et al.) that brought them
            to this existence, in what can only be described as something of a
            subterranean Hooverville (indeed, the grainy black-and-white images,
            courtesy of Singer's dependence upon scraped-together film footage
            and free camera loans, evoke nothing so much as the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>photographs of Dorothea Lange and Walker Evans of the
            socio-economic devastation wrought during the 1930s).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Their lives, like Singer's filmmaking, consist of scraping
            together a dignified existence:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>they obtain electricity by tapping into the grids above and
            shower through the auspices of a leaky pipe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>According to a recent interview in <i>The New York Times</i>,
            Singer, a Londoner by birth, came to New York City in hopes of
            becoming a model, and was persuaded by a homeless man's comments to
            document its real underground society.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>His only goal, &quot;crazy as it sounds&quot;, was to improve
            the lives of the people that he encountered and to get them out of
            the tunnel:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>call it
            both a literal and figurative uplifting.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">On balance,
            Singer has succeeded in creating a new and poignant portrait of
            homelessness with his unconventional and spontaneous filmmaking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>But Singer's film is more than a documentation of misery; it
            demonstrates the strength of their interpersonal bonds, their
            desperate attempts to better their life on a daily basis (these
            people are not passive victims, bemoaning their fate), and Singer's
            bravery and integrity as he fought for these new-found, but
            dispossessed friends, despite his protestations to the contrary. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">However, as
            might be expected from a first-time director, the progression from
            darkness to light isn't problem free.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Singer's decision to let his subjects direct themselves -- in
            true <i>cinéma-vérité</i> style, using long takes, and relatively
            minimal editing -- allows their humanity and individuality to emerge
            (not to mention economically advantageous).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>However, within this process of differentiation lies the risk
            of playing upon/to middle- and upper-middle-class attitudes about
            that group of individuals so pityingly described as the
            &quot;deserving poor&quot;.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These
            are the people who just temporarily, as the cliché goes, need a
            helping hand – or, in some cases, a helping shove – to boost
            them back up to and onto the economic ladder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>These are not the intoxicated people urinating on the
            sidewalks as you attempt to add that problem to the rest that
            constitute walking on contemporary city streets, nor are they the
            ones who walk up to you yowling incoherent threats while you hope
            that the &quot;walk&quot; light will flash before something worse
            happens.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In short, the
            homeless who refuse or seem beyond rehabilitation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Even though the film ends on a conventionally happy note (and
            rightfully so, for those involved), the question of what to do
            about/with the most intractable cases is still ineluctable:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>it sits there, demanding an answer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>In <i>Dark Days</i>, Singer avoids the question primarily
            because the parameters of his topic are narrow (thereby making this
            an error of omission, not commission), but it's still a nagging
            subtext that remains for society long after the film leaves the
            post-cinematic glow of a goal fulfilled. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">Some other
            omissions from the narrative of <i>Dark Days</i> seem utterly
            baffling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As Singer
            explained in a post-screening Q&amp;A at the Seattle International
            Film Festival this year, he experienced his own awakening of sorts
            about homeless advocacy groups in NYC while making the film:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>apparently, while Singer was in production with <i>Dark Days</i>,
            both the current and former heads of HUD had toured the tunnels and,
            shocked by what they saw within, promptly issued a fairly generous
            number of extremely precious Section Eight vouchers to be used by
            the tunnel-bound homeless to obtain subsidized housing, but those in
            the homeless advocacy groups that received the vouchers were too
            frightened to go down into the tunnels to issue them. Singer never
            specified exactly why he didn't document this shocking act of
            indifference, other than his desire to maintain neutrality, but
            impartiality doesn't necessarily disappear in the face of truth,
            especially when such indifference inspires questions about the
            motives of some who claim to work for the benefit of the less
            fortunate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
            so-called <i>cui bono</i> Syndrome cannot be dismissed on either
            economic or moral grounds:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>money
            shouldn't be wasted on sinecures while people suffer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">It may be that
            the film suffers to some extent from a certain simplicity of content
            and a naïve approach to its subject matter, but <i>Dark Days</i>,
            for all of its faults, deserves a wider audience;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>even the questions it leaves unanswered linger within its
            frames, forcing discussions on topics and assumptions many of us
            would prefer be left unchallenged.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>As this review is being posted, the film will be released in
            all of six cities:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>it
            deserves a wider release in addition to awards.</span></p>
