<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Born
to wealthy Spanish parents at the turn of the previous century, Surrealist
filmmaker Luis Buñuel, who later rebelled against his upbringing, left a legacy
of shocking and always provocative films behind.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Labeled an anarchist by some and a socialist by himself when it served
his purpose, Buñuel also considered himself to be a devout atheist, often
mocking the rituals of the Catholic Church to its dismay.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>Buñuel’s films also portray his disdain for the wealthy set (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Belle
De Jour</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tristana, The</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Exterminating Angel</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
Discreet Charm of the Bourgeois</i>). While the writer-director’s biting wit
and surrealist images won’t appeal to those individuals with conservative
taste, the art he created proves to be as significant as his former compatriot
Salvador Dali’s paintings or Garcia Lorca’s plays.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>Moody to extremes, Buñuel was to the Spanish film industry what Fellini
was to the Italian film industry despite Buñuel’s sudden exile from his
homeland during Franco’s regime.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>In fact, Buñuel and Fellini had a lot more in common than their mockery
of the Catholic Church and upper classes since both filmmakers evoked images
from their rich dream lives in their works.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Although
Buñuel made an early start on his career when he directed, wrote and produced
the surrealist classic <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Un Chien Andalou</i>
with Salvador Dali in 1928, the Spanish filmmaker suffered many slumps in his
career, produced numerous unsuccessful films during the time he spent in Mexico
(from the late '40s through the '50s) and he suffered from extreme hearing loss.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In 1961, Buñuel returned to Spain to make the film <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Viridian</i>a
despite having to work under the scrutiny of Franco’s tight restrictions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The film was banned in Spain, but it won the <i>Palme d’Or</i> at
Cannes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Following <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Viridiana</i>,
the filmmaker would go on to direct successful films in Mexico (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Exterminating
Angel</i>), France (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Belle Du Jour</i>) and
his last film, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">That Obscure Object of
Desire</i> (1977) would be filmed in both Spain and France.<o:p>

</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Not
always obvious in his work, the filmmaker’s films would some times suffer from
editing problems since the director prioritized staying within a budget rather
than covering all of his shots.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Fortunately,
he worked with some of the best cinematographers in the business including
Gabriel Figueroa (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Exterminating Angel,
Nazarin</i>).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Buñuel also had a
fetish for women’s shoes that he emphasized in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Viridiana
</i>and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tristana.</i><o:p>

many film directors eventually sell out as their careers take off, Luis Buñuel
took more risks, still shocking audiences with his last film in 1977 as he did
with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Un Chien Andalou</i> in 1928.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

his fans are the lucky recipients.<o:p>
