            review by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 15 December 2000</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>To hear a few notes of Amália
            Rodrigues’ music is to become instantly hooked. The late
            Portuguese singer’s downbeat tunes are curiously exhilarating. As
            former <i>Talking Heads</i> frontman David Byrne puts it,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span><span style="color:black">&quot;It was as if she was singing
            in these Fado songs about the sadness of the universe, not only
            about a personal sadness or a tragedy in her own life or in the
            writer's life, but she was expressing the sadness of
            existence.&quot; </span>Throughout Bruno de Almeida’s new
            documentary, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Art of Amália</i>,
            we can see the world loves her for it.</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film, which is actually de
            Almeida’s fourth about Rodrigues, is a generous sampling of her
            performances taken from movie clips, rehearsal footage, concert
            videos and even guest spots on American television (one of which
            features a very young Eddie Fisher introducing her). The director
            also includes testimony from Byrne and other musicians and from
            Rodrigues herself. Taken as a whole, the movie establishes her as a
            vocalist who is as distinctive as Frank Sinatra, as charismatic as
            Madonna and as durable as Ella Fitzgerald.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Just as Bob Dylan did with American
            folk music, Rodrigues expanded the boundaries of Portuguese Fado
            music and popularized it to the world. In her native tongue,
            “Fado” means “sad fate,” and the music has a lonely, gloomy
            quality. Rodrigues sings these tunes in a commanding style that,
            while emotional, never seems forced or histrionic. Her loud voice
            has an astonishing sensitivity. During her interviews, with slight
            fluctuations in her voice, she demonstrates how the Spanish and
            Portuguese folk tunes diverge.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As accomplished as she was behind a
            microphone, singing was not her only gift. Late in her career, she
            stared writing her own lyrics. She also had a successful film acting
            career. She won awards for her performances, and crowds of people in
            France would rush to hear the then-unfamiliar Portuguese singer who
            graced an otherwise mediocre film.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That Rodrigues was an important and
            immense talent is indisputable. De Almeida emphatically (maybe a bit
            too emphatically) states she was great. He tells little about her as
            a person or how she prepared to perform. For many reasons, this is
            wise. Few things are quite as tiresome as a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Behind
            the Music</i>-style biography about a troubadour’s rise and fall.
            Rodrigues was popular throughout her life (she lived to be 79), so
            the “usual” ups-and-downs don’t seem to apply to her. De
            Almeida doesn’t try to psychoanalyze Rodrigues or read anything in
            her music that isn’t there. A viewer can be grateful that there
            are no clichés about substance abuse or tragic love affairs.
            That’s not to say de Almeida doesn’t get personal. In the film,
            Rodrigues admits that during the 1980’s she moved to New York
            intent on killing herself and almost did until she started avidly
            watching Fred Astaire movies on tape. She also admits to having
            always had a sad streak and feeling the happiest when performing.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Despite these revelations, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Art of Amália</i> leaves a viewer with a nagging curiosity. Few of
            her accompanists are interviewed, and little is said about Fado and
            other Portuguese music. We are not introduced to any other Fado
            players or told how Rodrigues differed from her peers other than
            that she was better. The little information that emerges is
            intriguing. Rodrigues readily admits composer Alain Oulman
            contributed to a large portion of her success, and it’s
            interesting to note that once the two started collaborating he never
            again wrote music for anyone else.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Even with these slight sins of
            omission, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Art of Amália</i>
            is a fine primer to her powerful work. Before viewing this
            documentary, I was unaware of her music. Now that I have had a
            taste, it’s as if the greatest crime De Almeida could have
            committed would be to allow her music to be forgotten.</font>
