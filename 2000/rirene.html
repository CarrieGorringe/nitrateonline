            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 23 June 2000</i></font>
            <p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Films can be
            bad for many reasons, but they generally tend to fall into three
            categories: films which are bad because their makers followed some
            particularly loony vision which causes them to fly right off the
            rails, with attendant results (recent example: <i>Battlefield Earth</i>);
            movies which are bad because they end up boring the crap out of you
            (fill in your own title-of-choice, here); or, films which are bad
            yet leave you in a particularly nettlesome, even resentful, mood for
            hours, days, even weeks afterwards. <i>Me, Myself and Irene</i>,
            unfortunately, falls in this latter category.</font></b></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I say
            &quot;unfortunately&quot; because, back when they made <i>Dumb and
            Dumber</i>, in 1994, Peter and Bobby Farrelly reveled in vulgar
            humor but ended up making a comedy that was essentially good-natured
            and harmless: no jokes were made at anyone's expense, and the
            filmmakers knew when not to press their luck.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Now, with the success of <i>There's Something About Mary</i>,
            they have fashioned themselves as shock-provocateurs, and feel
            compelled to top anything seen in their previous movie. And they
            succeed: urine flies, excrement drops, body parts are brazenly
            displayed, and orifices are violated with objects both inanimate and
            animate (Note To Parents: Leave the kiddies home).</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">But we are also
            asked to laugh at a dog taking a copious dump on-camera, a cow being
            shot several times at point-blank range, and a little girl being
            drowned in a fountain. By the time one of the main characters loses
            a thumb, and you get the queasy feeling that we are supposed to
            react to this with uproarious laughter, the film has become a very
            unpleasant experience.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Narrated by Rex
            Allen, Jr, in the same folksy manner he used in the Walt Disney <i>True
            Life Adventures</i> (and exactly why the Farrellys chose to use this
            in the film, I don't know), the story, or what there is of it (the
            filmmakers' narrative skills also seem to be deteriorating),
            concerns Charlie Baileygates (Jim Carrey), a Rhode Island state
            trouper encharged with the duty of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>transporting Irene (Renée Zellweger) to face charges in
            another jurisdiction. What Irene doesn't know is that Charlie, who
            was both thoroughly humiliated and demoralized over the
            circumstances under which his ex-wife left him, has developed a
            second personality that emerges whenever he is faced with
            confrontation -- Hank, who has absolutely no problem settling scores
            with either adults, children, or vending machines.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The only reason
            Zellweger is cast in the film is so that we could be treated to the
            sight of a pretty young actress snarling at everyone and everything
            around her all the time. (Talented as she may<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>be, &quot;withering putdown&quot; and &quot;acid wit&quot;
            are not exactly in her repertory.) She and Chris Cooper, who plays a
            bad guy chasing after Irene, have the most terrible expressions on
            their face throughout the movie, like the huge cooked fish that is
            served to Noel Coward during a scene in the movie <i>Boom</i>
            (Coward took one look at it and said, &quot;What is this horror from
            the deep? It has the most dreadful expression on its face&quot;).</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Jim Carrey, who,
            over the last six years, has turned into one of the most prolific
            and inspired performers working today, has slowed down a bit from
            the manic flights he took in earlier films such as <i>Liar, Liar</i>,
            and when he gets the chance to do something funny, he does so, and
            does so well (One scene indicates that he would have been a perfect
            choice to play Mason Verger in the film version of Thomas Harris' <i>Hannibal</i>).
            But as soon as he starts developing some sort of characterization as
            Charlie, he has to switch to playing Hank, and starts trying to
            develop some sort of characterization for him. The result is two
            performances that don't seem fully realized, either separately or as
            one entity: Charlie comes across as too bland, while Hank, his voice
            register tucked down into a Dirty Harry Callahan-like range, becomes
            monotonous as he levels his gaze and mutters one oh-that's-awful
            piece of dialogue after another.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">But the most
            troubling thing about the film is its pervasive air of
            mean-spiritedness (it's probably why Zellweger and Cooper look so
            distressed). A couple of sympathetic scenes between Charlie and
            Irene have been included, but they come across as monstrously
            insincere, because you know that the characters are simply being set
            up for some new outrage that is lurking just around the corner to
            slap them down; it doesn't matter whether we feel anything towards
            them or not. The end effect is much like what one feels after seeing
            the most assaulting advertisements or music videos, which hit you
            with everything they got in a very short period of time. Perhaps the
            Farrellys have come to believe that audiences are now mistaking
            sadism for humor, or that they've become so insensitive that this is
            the only way they can break through and get a reaction out of
            anyone, anymore. Perhaps, until the audience finally says enough,
            already.</font>
