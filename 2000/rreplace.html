            pretend to be anything more than two hours of simple-minded
            escapism, but it’s still a shame that the movie can’t push its
            message more passionately. And exactly what <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">is</i>
            the message of this second-string gridiron comedy, which continues
            the slapstick, sophomoric tradition of sports humor previously mined
            in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Waterboy</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Major League</i>?
            Smothered beneath <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Replacements’</i> gaggle of puke jokes and dry-humping
            cheerleaders is the opinion that the professional sports arena is a
            stomping ground for overpaid prima donnas who, in the words of coach
            Jimmy McGinty (Gene Hackman), &quot;have no heart.&quot;</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The corruption of the contemporary
            NFL has been tackled before by 1979’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">North
            Dallas Forty, </i>where players were viewed as pawns to be chewed up
            and spit out by an unsympathetic corporate machine far more sinister
            than any hulking linebacker. More recently, Oliver Stone’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Any
            Given Sunday</i> showed how &quot;old school&quot; coaches were
            being taken over by yuppie team owners willing to falsify medical
            records to keep crowd-pleasing players on the field. However, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Replacements</i> abandons the darker, more personal angle of those
            films with a juvenile blend of goofball physical humor that owes
            more to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Police Academy</i> than to Vince Lombardi.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The movie begins in the flurry of
            an NFL players’ strike, and Washington Sentinels coach McGinty is
            struggling to recruit scab players and stitch together a team of
            fill-ins until the strike is resolved. He presents team owner Edward
            O’Neill (Jack Warden) with photos and profiles of his choices, and
            they’re a motley crew of highly excitable SWAT team psychos,
            pistol-packin’, gangsta rappin’ twins, egg-eating sumo
            wrestlers, and hell-raising Irishmen. In other words, the usual
            cluster of asshole buddies that have shown up in every
            &quot;loser-makes-good&quot; raunchfest that’s been green-lighted
            since <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Animal House</i> set the
            standard for this profitable hybrid of film. &quot;If nothing
            else,&quot; says McGinty about this odd assemblage of players,
            &quot;they should be fun to watch.&quot;</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Enter prospective quarterback Shane
            Falco (Keanu Reeves), a one-time NFL contender whose career was
            buried by a brutal loss during the Sugar Bowl. McGinty offers Falco
            a second chance, but the retired player is reluctant. &quot;It’s
            quiet here,&quot; he says of his current gig on the oceanfront,
            where he’s making a living &quot;scraping the crap off the bottom
            of someone else’s toy boats.&quot; The veteran coach is
            persistent, however, eventually wooing Falco onto his team’s new
            but not necessarily improved players roster. When Falco asks McGinty
            why he’s the coach’s chosen one, he sounds like Reeve’s
            reluctant techno-savior Neo from last year’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Matrix.</i> &quot;I look at you and see two men,&quot; replies
            Hackman, who wrestles gamely with a lame script. &quot;The man you
            are, and the man you ought to be.&quot;</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Once he signs on, however, Falco
            has to contend with the angry rivalry and taunts of original
            Sentinels players, who pelt a bus of scab recruits with eggs, and
            overturn the new quarterback’s car when it’s parked in the
            team’s practice lot. &quot;You’re not even a has-been,&quot;
            whines Falco’s on-strike predecessor Eddie Martel (Brett Cullen)
            in one of the film’s many uninspired bursts of familiar dialogue.
            &quot;You’re a never-was!&quot;</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meanwhile, it’s no stretch to
            predict that Falco’s team of misfits will be so incompetent that
            when he throws a practice pass, the would-be receiver will collide
            with a teammate, Jerry Lewis-style, and miss the catch. His
            notorious past is another mark against the young quarterback.
            &quot;I lost a ton of money on that Sugar Bowl disaster,&quot;
            complains a teammate.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This unpromising debut with The
            Sentinels doesn’t bog Falco down so much that he can’t make
            goo-goo eyes at the cheerleader captain, Annabelle Farrell (Brooke
            Langton). When Farrell isn’t going weak in the knees over her
            astro-turf Adonis, she’s forming a ramshackle collection of
            cheerleaders (presumably, the original cluster of Sentinels pom-pom
            wavers is also on the picket line). A cruel montage presents the
            overweight applicants as objects of ridicule, while using the
            cleavage-heavy recruits as sluttish rump-shakers. &quot;So, I
            understand that you appeared in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Cats</i>,&quot; remarks Farrell to one voluptuous sex kitten.
            &quot;Actually, I appeared at the Pussy Cat,&quot; clarifies this
            former lap-dancer. It’s not surprising that when <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Replacements</i> runs out of steam or has no place to go, it focuses
            on the routines of these lusty lasses in an effort to keep male
            viewers from getting bored.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And what is it with reckless
            driving as a metaphor for erotic foreplay? Sharon Stone teased
            Michael Douglas with this dumb ritual in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Basic
            Instinct</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Crash</i> took it to nauseatingly graphic extremes, and the image was
            rekindled in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Mission:
            Impossible 2</i>. This time around, Farrell gives Falco &quot;a
            lift&quot; in her careening jeep, which zigs and zags through heavy
            inner-city traffic while the two lovebirds make small talk. Pretty
            soon, they’re cozying up in the more rustic confines of her late
            father’s bar where Annabelle pours drinks, swapping spit to the
            tune of The Police’s &quot;Every Breath You Take.&quot;</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Replacements</i> runs its familiar course, you can bet that: a.) The
            Sentinels will get into a groove and begin winning games; b.) Falco
            will run into a crisis when his rival Martel crosses the picket line
            and wants to return as quarterback; c.) The one-time pro who blew
            his knee out after one NFL game is given a second chance to make a
            touchdown; d.) The receiver with the fumbling fingers will catch a
            critical pass after his condition is remedied via some
            strategically-placed adhesive (&quot;I look like I just jacked off
            an elephant,&quot; the player complains, his hands dripping with
            glue-goo). It all boils down to the Big Pre-Playoff Game, before the
            strike is called off and the pros are called back to don their
            jerseys. Will the spoiled priss Martel relinquish his title to good
            guy Falco? Will Falco’s flame Annabelle stand by her man? Will the
            scabs beat the regulars into chopped liver during the obligatory bar
            fight? <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Replacements</i>
            projects these outcomes earlier than John Madden predicting Super
            Bowl scores during the first NFL game of the season (both Madden and
            Pat Summerall play themselves, as sportscasters narrating the
            play-by-play action of each successive game).</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Per usual, Reeves struggles through
            the film like a valley guy trying to impersonate Harrison Ford. It
            wasn’t so long ago that Reeves projected an honest, believable
            presence in such films as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">River’s Edge</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Permanent
            Record</i>. More recently, however, this hot commodity from <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Matrix</i> has come across as a guy desperately attempting to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">act</i>.
            There’s a strained quality to his delivery that’s made all the
            more obvious when he’s set alongside Hackman, arguably the best
            American screen actor of the past thirty years. Coach McGinty is no
            original, but Hackman is able to enunciate his lines with a
            surprising level of conviction, even when he’s slogging through
            the most clichéd locker-room pep talks in movie history.<o:p>

            <p><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            Replacements</font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2"> is a prime
            example of what happens during the fall months, after Hollywood has
            unleashed its summer moneymakers, but before it’s offered up
            holiday-season Oscar fare. As leaves cluster on the ground, mediocre
            film fare clutters cineplexes far and wide. There’s another
            serious movie out there waiting to be made about the spoils of
            corporate sports. But <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
