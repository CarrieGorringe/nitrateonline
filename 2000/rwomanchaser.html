            review by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 4 August 2000</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Distributors have balked at
            handling freshman screenwriter-director Robinson Devor’s new film <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Woman Chaser</i> because it’s a quirky black-and-white period
            movie that features no A-list stars. It follows no clear genre and
            is laced with an offbeat gallows humor. With all of its defiant
            eccentricity, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Woman Chaser</i>
            is a hard sell. It’s a wildly entertaining ride for anyone lucky
            to live near a theater playing it.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Working from Charles Willeford’s
            1960 genre-busting pulp novel, Devor creates a cynical but
            consistently entertaining tale of treachery, exploitation, lust and,
            possibly the most feared crime of all, filmmaking. The last of these
            infractions has become an obsession for Richard Hudson (Patrick
            Warburton from <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Seinfeld</i>),
            a shrewdly opportunistic used car salesman. With a few carefully
            selected phrases, Hudson can convince just about anyone to part with
            their money or can lure even the most reserved of women into a
            one-night stand. The film even opens with him successfully luring a
            middle-aged Salvation Army soldier. He has a radar for weaknesses
            that can lead others into doing his bidding. His power over the will
            and common sense of others makes him prosperous. Hudson’s boss has
            just selected him to run an L.A. dealership, and money is rolling
            in. Nonetheless, having sensed that there are no more worlds to
            conquer when it comes to swindling car buyers and bedroom partners,
            Hudson is miserable.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At the height of his despair,
            Hudson decides that by creating a great work of art he can redeem
            himself. Lacking the ability to sculpt or dance like his ballerina
            mother (the two have a hilarious duet in the middle of the film),
            Hudson decides to take up filmmaking. He recruits some help from his
            stepfather Leo (newcomer Paul Malevitz), an out of work director.
            With only a fan’s knowledge of the craft, Hudson feverishly
            concocts <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Man Who Got Away</i>,
            a gloomy yarn about work-weary truck driver turns into a killing
            machine. While his deal making skills get him in the door, his
            uncompromising attitude endangers the film. Worse, his amoral
            attitude, which served him well in his old job, actually starts to
            hurt him now.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Woman Chaser</i> has a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Get
            Shorty</i>-like bemusement at the silliness of the entertainment
            industry. It’s also bolstered by a remarkably effective film noir-ish
            atmosphere. In addition to being presented in black-and-white, the
            movie features an eclectic selection of 50’s-era music that’s
            both eclectic and refreshing. None of these fascinating tunes
            (played by everybody from Dave Brubeck to Tito Puente) ever plays on
            oldies radio stations, and they fit the eerie visuals perfectly. The
            supporting cast also look right at home in the Eisenhower Era
            surroundings. The actors, some of whom are non-professionals, look
            nothing like the ones who usually populate Hollywood flicks. Most
            have a 50s-style paunch that most contemporary filmmakers seem to
            ignore.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In some cases (Malevitz, in
            particular), their lack of on-camera experience shows. Devor
            compensates by cutting quickly and focusing on Warburton. The actor
            carries all the scenes he’s in and projects a benign aura that
            makes his repellent behavior easier to stomach and often hilarious.
            He imbues Hudson with a fanatical enthusiasm that’s weirdly
            contagious. Frequently, we almost want Hudson to succeed with his
            dubious quest because he’s so fun to watch.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Devor, for all of the style he
            demonstrates, wisely leaves most of the film on Warburton’s broad
            shoulders. He also knows the value of good material. His adaptation
            of Willeford’s book is often word-for-word. More importantly, he
            captures Willeford’s irreverent attitude. Both the film and the
            book mock Hudson the way he mocks his customers and sexual
            conquests, although with considerably more flair and subtlety. As a
            result, Warbuton is at his funniest when Hudson starts to believe
            his own hype. There are a lot of cynical films out there, but <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Woman Chaser</i> still manages to be entertaining. It’s smartly
            handled, and it ultimately gives its audience the upper hand over
            its bullying protagonist.</font></p>
