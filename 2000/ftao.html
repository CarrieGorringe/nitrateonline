Rules</i> which kind of laid that stuff down - and this one is that this one is
more like a universal maxim for how to behave in general.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I applied the <i>Tao of Steve</i> to my acting career when I moved out to
Los Angeles, about nine-and-a-half years ago.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I was in debt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I didn’t
have an agent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I came close [to
getting] a cheesy [TV] pilot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was
just drinking too much and living on my friend’s couch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And I was hoping that I would just get some external score like a pilot
or something to change my life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
I quit that, when I said "I don’t care about acting; I don’t care about
agents".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>To have my life be so
petty, in a way, upset me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I got a
really humble job, and I started writing short stories and doing things.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Basically, as soon as I quit for the right reasons, I got
this movie, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Sneakers,</i> out of outer
space.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And I found that when I was
desireless, and I mean desire in the emptiest sense, when I lost that, then good
things started happening to me.<o:p>

 <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; layout-grid-mode: line">So,
it always struck me as a little odd when people thought it was almost a fake
recipe for how to guarantee a score with somebody, because I thought it was a
good maxim for how to live your life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
cool thing about living your life in this excellent fashion is that, if you get
all the external stuff that you’re not chasing anymore, fine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>But if you don’t, you don’t care, because you’ve kind of developed
spiritually to a place where you don’t give a sh*t about the external stuff.<o:p>

monks because they kind of had to, or they do it for six months – there’s,
like, this conscription – and they check out chicks and smoke cigarettes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They’re <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">people</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I think the religion is interesting, but I hate the fact that certain
Americans feel like there’s no spirituality within America.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>And so we have that argument in the movie about why is it always cooler
when it happens in a foreign country.</font></p>

<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Q:</i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">What do you think the audience
for this will be?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I was thinking
about small-towns versus the bigger cities, and I wonder how someone in, say,
New York would react to the film.</font></p>
<p><i><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></b></i><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes"><i>&nbsp;</i>
</span>They seem to like it because it’s different from them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I feel the same way; I feel like it could play in my hometown.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It doesn’t freak you out with how clever or weird it is.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It’s not shot in a kind of super-stylized way.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It’s not alienating.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
what blows me away is that, like, people in my hometown, they kind of like their
entertainment packaged in a way that they understand it coming to them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I think you could make the most poignant tale about someone from El
Centro, California, and people from El Centro, California, would be, like, "Man,
that sucked!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I dug it when you were
the vampire and your hand got cut off!"</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Q:</i></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>What do you think of Greer Goodman?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>What was working with her like?</font></p>
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>DL:</i></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It was interesting, because, to her credit, Greer went through that
weird, like, "Hey, I wrote a part for myself in my movie that we got made, so
f*ck yeah, I’m gonna play this part."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And
then she had, "Who am I to write a part for myself in a movie?"<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Also, when she was going to play Syd, Syd was a much smaller part in the
movie, before it became this romantic comedy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>So I think she suffered a bit of a crisis of confidence at the beginning.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>When Greer just slows down and trusts that she’s a smart person and
starts to roll, she’s really good.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And
I’m like, "All you guys are great".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All
her friends who were in the movie were all really good and deserved to be there.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>It’s interesting, because at first, my reaction was, "I’m doing an
expensive home movie project."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
then I had to A, learn to trust it, and B, I feel like if I wrote a movie right
now, I would probably just populate it with friends of mine who I trusted.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It was really cool at Sundance to see Jenniphr
and Greer and their mom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was
like a family triumph.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Although, in
a way, I would want [Jenniphr] to have the experience of directing a cast of
actors who she didn’t have any personal relationship with whatsoever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>One problem with, like, if I directed a sister or something, they’ll
pull sh*t out from when you were five years old to undermine what you’re
talking about in a scene.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Or friends, you know, it’s hard to work with them
sometimes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It’s good to have this
completely neutral personal relationship, and then it can be all about drama or
whatever.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yeah, it was fun.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Because Greer’s that smart.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Duncan
always says that, as much as Dex is this weird, fat philosopher kind of guy that
you don’t see in movies, you don’t really see a female lead who’s smart,
into art, plays drums, you know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I
mean, if Hollywood made the movie, I’m sure they would cast a swimsuit model
and try to pass her off as [an intellectual].</font></p>
