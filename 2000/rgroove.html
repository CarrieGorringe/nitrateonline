            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>At first, Greg Harrison's film <i>Groove</i>
            flickers and fibrillates and looks like it's barely going to be able
            to stay on the screen for ninety minutes. But stick with it, for it

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Taking place during a
            hastily-organized rave (if it wasn't hastily organized, it wouldn't
            be one) over the course of one late night and early morning in San
            Francisco, the story follows several characters as they attempt to
            follow changing instructions on how to get there, while others try
            to hold the event together and keep the police from snooping around.
            Once everybody gets there, they loosen up, shake themselves and feel
            good. They also hug each other, draw pictures or write words on each
            other with ink that glows under black light, promote love and
            understanding -- gee, this sounds familiar. It may be retro, but the
            characters' promotion of an innocent sort of fun and enjoyment is
            part of the film's ultimate charm.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As is the music (supplied by
            several real-life dance D.J.'s, including Forest Green and John
            Digweed), and the subplot involving David (Hamish Linklater), a
            writer newly arrived in the City, and Leyla (Lola Glaudini), an
            office worker who is a veteran of the rave scene. They meet, they
            fall for each other, and you see the whole arc of their newly formed
            relationship -- from mutual conviviality to trepidation over change
            to realizing they don't want to lose a good thing, and what'll they
            do if they did -- unfold on the screen. It's very satisfying, and
            Harrison, who edited the film along with writing and directing it,
            achieves one extraordinary moment, the equivalent to what one
            character describes as when one shakes off the doldrums of everyday
            existence and becomes aware of being simply &quot;alive&quot; for
            once. The movie never comes close to turning into the <i>Thank God
            It's Friday</i> of rave.</font>
