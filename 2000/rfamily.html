            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 29 December 2000</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>As Jack Campbell, wheeler-dealer
            and president of a New York City financial institution, Nicolas Cage
            struts into his first scenes in <i>The Family Man</i> with just the
            right amount of upturned-nose attitude and an air of hubris born of
            luxe, power, and money. A bachelor and ladies man, he swings into
            his walk-in closet to pick out his clothes for the day while rousing
            himself by singing gusty Italian opera, with or without an
            accompanying recording, pushing his chest out and swinging his arms
            to the music. We have no doubt that this guy is invincible, or at
            least thinks he is.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">On Christmas Eve, he informs his
            staff that they will have to come in to work the next day in order
            to close a deal, but that, for their inconvenience, they will all
            get to share in a part of the profits which will run somewhere in
            the neighborhood of &quot;ten zeros.&quot; Jack then goes home, goes
            to bed, and wakes up the next morning -- in a middle-class suburban
            house, with two kids and a wife, Kate (Tea Leoni), contentedly
            sleeping beside him. Kate is the woman whom Jack would have married,
            thirteen years earlier, had he not gone off on that internship with
            Barclays in London. Wot hoppened?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The previous evening, Jack had an
            encounter with a mysterious stranger (the excellent Don Cheadle, in
            but a fleeting appearance in the film), and told him, &quot;I got
            everything I wanted.&quot; Fine, the stranger replied, but be
            forewarned, whatever happens next, &quot;You brought it on
            yourself.&quot; Then the transformation: doomed to suburbia!</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At first, the film's regard for
            Jack's new milieu, and the accouterments therein, seems to be simply
            a reflection of the character's own horror-struck reactions. He can
            no longer pamper himself by buying new top-line designer suits; he
            must endure the indignities of changing diapers. His next-door
            neighbor and friend (Jeremy Piven) keeps tacky drinking mugs on the
            wall behind his home bar, along with a photo of a bowling trophy
            win. After a while, it seems like the filmmakers feel the same way
            towards these people as Jack does, namely, that they aren't any good
            because they have to live within their means and don't always show
            good taste.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jack also finds out that he no
            longer works on Wall Street, but as a salesman at a tire outlet run
            by his father-in-law, &quot;Big Ed&quot; (Harve Presnell): he finds
            a bottle that the &quot;other&quot; Jack kept hidden in a desk
            drawer at work. But it turns out that the &quot;other&quot; Jack was
            also a good man, a good friend, one who came through for other
            people in times of need, and who has a wife who is deeply in love
            with him. It takes Jack from Christmas to Valentine's Day to figure
            all this out -- after all, the mysterious stranger said that this
            was all only a &quot;glimpse.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is the sort of material that
            you would expect to curdle before your very eyes in a matter of
            minutes, and, indeed, it spells out its handful of simple truths
            rather baldly: don't wreck a good thing once you have it, appreciate
            the fact that you have a wife and family, and money doesn't mean
            everything. But after we've had a chance to revel in Jack's uptown
            lifestyle (exquisitely rendered by production designer Kristi Zea,
            who worked on many of Jonathan Demme's films) and react (smugly) to
            his change in income bracket, we find out that the people in the
            &quot;other&quot; Jack's suburbia are actually more in touch with
            themselves and with their values. (Jack is even counseled against
            having a fling with a woman who practically throws herself at him.)
            The picture doesn't seem to be advising that we embrace mediocrity
            and the type of dead-end life that often results in boredom and
            frustration (and that a lot of people would dream of fleeing from),
            but it seems to come close.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And, sometimes, simple truths can
            be reiterated in a way that makes them hard to dismiss, and that,
            ultimately, is what happens in this movie. The fact that it also has
            Nicolas Cage's best performance in years also helps, a lot. He shows
            how Jack skillfully bluffs his way through situations that he is
            supposed to be familiar with using the same acumen that he would
            have used to get ahead in his financial job, and, in the process of
            picking up on how to act like a husband and father, he gradually
            comes to realize that, not only can he live like this, but that he
            rather enjoys it. Cage's performance shows how something deep and
            inexplicable is touched within Jack's character. And the film also
            takes an unexpected turn, becoming a romance where Jack falls in
            love all over again with a woman who had disappeared from his life,
            and how Kate, after some dismaying blunders and mistakes on Jack's
            part, falls in love with him all over again, as well.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The picture may be comprised of a
            pinch of <i>A Christmas Carol</i> and a good handful of <i>It's a
            Wonderful Life</i>, but Jack's return to his previous life turns out
            to be this film's equivalent of the &quot;nightmare&quot; sequence
            that James Stewart's George Bailey dashed through. And Nicolas Cage,
            working again at the peak of his abilities, is able to put over
            Jack's change of heart and salvation in the end.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
