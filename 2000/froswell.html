<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Like a lot of independent filmmakers, <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal">Timothy B. Johnson</b> is a multitasker. When he was contacted at
Lifetouch Video Creations in Minneapolis, Minnesota last week, Johnson was
working on a program that would air later that evening. During our conversation,
he briefly had to leave the phone to record a short voice-over. Contact him on
any given day, and he may be shooting a music video or an NBA game. With all the
jobs that come his way, Johnson demonstrates a remarkable sense of focus.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In addition to the 12 years he’s put into
Lifetouch, he’s done a variety of jobs on feature films. He was a second-unit
director on Roger Nygard’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Trekkies</i>
and had previously worked as a grip on Nygard’s short film <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Warped</i>.
The two have joined forces again with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Six
Days in Roswell</i>, a comedy-documentary that follows comic and UFO enthusiast
Rich Kronfeld as he attends the fiftieth anniversary of the Roswell incident.
Nygard produced and edited the new film, while Johnson makes his directorial
debut. True to form, both are doing double and triple duty. In addition to
directing, Johnson worked as a grip on location and is now touring with the film
at various festivals (including the USA Film Festival and the AFI Los Angeles
Film Festival) and other engagements. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Six Days in Roswell</i> heads to home video in October and DVD in
November, and Johnson is putting the final touches on his next movie <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Twin
Cities</i>. The movie was shot on High Definition video, even though Johnson is
enamored with film itself.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Dan
Lybarger:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"> Richard Kronfeld wears his
Captain Pike costume from <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Star Trek </i>in both <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Trekkies</i>
and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Six Days in Roswell</i>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">Tim
Johnson:</b> That’s the connection, you see. We spun off <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Roswell
</i>from <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Trekkies</i> like a TV spin-off.
We met Richard Kronfeld and found out he was going to Roswell. We said this
would make another documentary. We found out about this fiftieth anniversary.
Roger [Nygard] and I put our own money into it.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
You don’t bring this out in the film, but Kronfeld is actually an experienced
performer and writer.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">TJ:</b>
He’s done performance art, weird videos, and funny stuff here in Minneapolis.
He was just perfect to follow and let his personality drive the movie. In real
life, he’s so neurotic and dry-witted. He was so open to let me tag along and
be his shadow.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We shot for the fiftieth anniversary. We
started editing the thing and said, &quot;We just don’t have enough punch
here.&quot; We went back for 1998 and shot a few more filler things, so we
actually souped it up by going back a second year. The majority of the film is
the fiftieth anniversary.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That fiftieth anniversary was kind of like a
Woodstock of alien fanaticism. It drew so many different types of people. They
had enough people show up that there were more media than participants in
certain events, like the pancake-eating contest. It was a zoo. There were people
from Japan and England. A lot of the UFOlogists and big scientists were there
like Stan Friedman and Whitley Streiber, writer of the book <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Communion</i>.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
What did you do on <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Trekkies</i>?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">TJ:</b>
I was second unit shooter-director. I shot over twelve minutes of that movie. I
did it all voluntarily. I had no idea it would be sold to Paramount. I could
have wasted my time. I put 10 days into it because it was made independently. It
was made for about $250,000 and sold for an incredible $1.250 million. Neo Arts
and Logic Pictures [who backed the movie] made a good profit. I had no
ownership. I was only a shooter.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Had I not volunteered for <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Trekkies</i> on my own time, I would never be able to put on my résumé,
&quot;second unit director-cinematographer for a Paramount feature released in
the theaters.&quot; I tell young filmmakers today, &quot;Volunteer with the
right people who will treat you well later.&quot; I built this relationship with
Roger Nygard ten years ago as a grip when I was nineteen years old. If I
hadn’t done that, I wouldn’t have known him.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
For <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Six Days in Roswell</i>, didn’t you
put a lot of your income into the movie?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">TJ:</b>
My life savings is tied up in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Roswell</i>,
and luckily at all fourteen festivals I’ve gotten terrific reviews, at least
three out of four stars. I’ve never had negative reviews. What I’m happy
about is that I’ve built a great résumé item. Even if I don’t make a ton
of money, if I break even, I’m happy. That’s my hope. You can put that in
print [laughs]!</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
Instead of the usual angle on the subject on aliens, this movie seems to be more
of a portrait of the town.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">TJ: </b>We
wanted a more whimsical, fun look rather than a serious sci-fi secret cover-up
like you’d see on the Discovery Channel. My inspiration was <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Waiting for Guffman</i>. [It] was a total farce. Had I not seen it, I
never would have done it. Had I never done <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Trekkies</i>,
I never would have done <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Roswell</i>.
It’s truly out of my passion for comedy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There have been plenty of serious documentaries
but never a fun one. It was very clear when we would shoot a scene and we would
set it up again so we could get a second angle. There are plenty of moments
where I manipulated the scene to get more comedy value out of it, especially the
Minnesota scenes. I prefer calling my movie a docu-comedy. I’m not going for a
straight-shooter documentary here. The majority of the stuff from Roswell was
real. A lot of the Minnesota stuff we had fun with. The gun scene, that’s not
real. The electric company that [Kronfeld] works for, that’s a setup. It’s
my transition into actual American filmmaking [laughs].</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Most of the Minnesota stuff was manipulated,
except for the fact that Richard actually collects the A/V equipment and had the
Captain Pike chair long before we shot <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Trekkies</i>.
The [Raspberry] parade is for real. He actually drives [the Captain Pike chair
that covers all of Kronfeld’s body except for his head] in the parade. But to
add more comedic value, we had the Raspberry guy tow him. It’s very Minnesotan.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
You even had [Minnesota Governor] Jesse Ventura.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">TJ:</b>
He was still running. It was before he won. Huge regret. I wanted to shoot more
with him, but he was marching in the parade. I wanted to interview him. I knew
he was famous from the movie <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Predator</i>.
I literally ran up to him with the release form and said &quot;Would you sign
this?&quot; so I could get him yelling, &quot;Hey, Jesse for Governor!&quot; I
regretted not shooting more now that he’s so famous! He’s in it five
seconds. No one knew, but all that marching in parades helped him win.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Roswell, The Musical</i> is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Guffman</i>-esque.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">TJ:</b> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Roswell,
The Musical </i>is so successful now that it <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">two</i>
Web sites. We were there for the premiere showing. It’s a lot better now they
tell me. There’s nothing manipulated [by me] there. It’s 100-percent
documented.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
Even without the aliens, Roswell appears to be an interesting town because of
its proximity to Los Alamos.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">TJ:</b>
It’s ironic that our technology exploded right after the nuclear bomb:
microchips, transistors, everything. These people would theorize we got the
technology from the spaceship crash. There are some people who even say we have
an ambassador [from outer space] right now that nobody but the government knows
about.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Some people theorize they came here because
we’re growing up, we’ve learned how to manipulate atoms. They saw that from
far away. It’s like we were mice growing up to be smart, and the aliens said,
&quot;Hey, what’s up?&quot; I’ve heard it all. It’s a lot of fun.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
How much footage did you shoot?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">TJ:</b>
We shot thirty-seven hours and cut down to eighty-one minutes. We shot it on
film, which is really expensive. I really regret not having two cameras. We
couldn’t afford it. Those super-16 cameras are very expensive to rent.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Our poor camera guy was loading magazines in
100 degrees. It’s not like shooting videotape where you can pop the tape and
go. With film, it’s a little more delicate. Like I said earlier, I ran out
film when I was shooting Jesse Ventura. I was going to ask him more questions
during the parade, and the film ran out.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">[<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Six Days
in Roswell</i>] looks gorgeous projected at 35-mm. It’s real film; it’s not
video. I love film. I’m a fanatical film collector. I have a 35mm projector in
my house. I love movies so much that I put a projector in my living room with a
ten-foot picture and DTS sound. I’m so proud to own a print of my own movie,
that I directed. It’s something to hold it in your hand, fifty pounds of film.
I can stretch it out for two miles and look at every frame.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It was run-and-gun, backbreaking, sweaty
filmmaking like in a war. My crew did it for free. They’re going to get paid
if I ever run a profit.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Even
the churches in Roswell have devoted themselves to the alien theme.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">TJ:</b>
Everybody cashed in on the free publicity and the influx of the population. What
an opportunity to get some alternative views! My favorite section of the movie
is the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Faith</i> section. The billboard
[that depicts a praying spaceman] reads, &quot;Every knee shall bow.&quot; We
were floored as we drove by. We had to film that. The Christians built
conferences around how this is demonic. The movie is about people searching for
something in their lives, whether it’s aliens or whatever they want to
believe. People are filling their lives. There are some <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Star
Trek </i>fans that are so devoted that it’s a modern mythology.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
I loved some of the opposition voices you presented, particularly the
&quot;pro-Government&quot; protesters.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">TJ:</b>
We wanted to get more of that, but it was hard to. Most of the people in the
town were visitors, so it was mostly people who believed versus those who did
not. It’s a balance. We have both. There were some protesters for the
government, not against, whereas everybody else is mad at the government. These
guys just wanted to stir things up.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s ironic that at the same time we were
testing nuclear bombs, the crash happened. The government made a mistake. They
admitted it was a UFO and two days later said it was a crashed weather balloon.
Had they said it was a weather balloon the first time in the press, nothing
would have happened. Why did the government say in its first announcement it was
an actual flying saucer? That’s why the controversy exists, and fifty some
years later, it’s become mythology, a cult.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
How have the people in Roswell reacted to the movie?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">TJ:</b>
Roger just got back from showing it. He got a terrific response. People were
laughing; they were so sick of serious, hard core &quot;In Search of . . .&quot;
documentaries.&quot;</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
Besides UFO enthusiasts, who are some of the other unusual people you’ve
worked with?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">TJ: </b>My
association with Neo Art and Logic [the company behind <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Trekkies</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Prophecy</i>
trilogy] led me to shoot a documentary called <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Sex, Death and Eyeliner</i> about gothic kids and the L.A. scene. That
has shown at a few festivals. It’s not sold, either, but it’s another
phenomenon that I went into, and my job on that was director of photography. I
volunteered my time, not knowing if this would sell.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I was hired by a religious group to go to
Medjugorje two years ago. Medjugorje is in Bosnia. I was hired by a religious
group to photograph an actual Virgin Mary apparition. There’s been a miracle
happening there for nineteen years where these missionaries see the Virgin Mary
every day. I went to interview some and talk to pilgrims. It was just as
fascinating as Roswell because it’s something you can't see, you can’t
touch, but people believe in. That’s my wide range of jobs I’ve had. I’m
going back there in two weeks to teach them how to shoot their own video now. I
respect their beliefs. My camera didn’t see it, but they said they did. I’m
happy for them just like people who said they’ve been abducted. It doesn’t
happen to me, but I’m happy for you.</font></p>
