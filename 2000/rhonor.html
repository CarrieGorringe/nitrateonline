            opens with a scene that sets up many of its themes and interests,
            not the least of which is the introduction of Billy Sunday (Robert
            De Niro) with his face beaten to a bruised and lumpy pulp. At the
            start of the film, Navy Master Chief Sunday limps into a train
            station in Charleston, North Carolina, 1966. This loud-mouthed good
            ol' boy and his skanky-drunk Navy buddies, like him, bloodied and
            pissed off, settle onto a bench to regale each other with memories
            of their recent barroom battle, but Sunday's attention is diverted
            by the television, which shows his old diver-training-school student
            and nemesis, Carl Brashear (Cuba Gooding Jr.), off in the Pacific,
            looking for a lost nuclear device on the ocean floor. When Sunday
            pays attention to Brashear, his associates are startled, to say the
            least. And soon they're wondering aloud if he's a
            &quot;nigger-lover.&quot; </b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></span></font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Because
            most of what follows will take Brashear's point of view -- as he
            struggles from his sharecroppers' son beginnings to his eventual
            triumphs and tragedies as a Navy Diver -- this opening scene, in
            which Sunday observes Brashear, is striking. It's not just that
            Sunday shows that he is simultaneously impressed and dismayed by his
            former pupil's success (a success that Sunday did just about
            everything in his power to prevent); it's also that Sunday's instant
            of recognition makes Brashear something of a spectacle and
            celebrity, a good man doing good work. It's almost as if Sunday
            can't escape this inverse Frankenstein monster he's created, so much
            decency and courage emerging out of so much bad behavior and
            intention on Sunday's part. And in this way, the scene spells out
            the movie's primary concern with the complicated relationship
            between ambivalent racist Sunday and unabated hero Brashear, and the
            ways that their repeated clashes reflect, comment on, and eventually
            shape U.S. military &quot;history,&quot; at least as it's recounted
            here. While Brashear is based on a real-life person and Sunday is a
            fictional character (a composite of various embodied obstacles in
            Brashear's Navy career), in George (<i>Soul Food</i>) Tillman Jr.'s
            film, they come together in a neatly choreographed dance of
            righteous nobility in the face of ignorance and fear. Sunday learns
            his lesson and Brashear endures. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If
            Sunday's redemption is a bit suspect -- as Brashear's superior
            officer during the 1950s, he literally almost kills the young diver,
            under the auspices of keeping the Navy racially &quot;pure&quot; --
            Brashear is definitively heroic from jump. After the train station
            set-up, the film cuts to 1943 rural Kentucky, where a muscular young
            Brashear is plowing fields with his daddy (Carl Lumbly), who
            tearfully implores his son, &quot;Don't end up like me&quot; (the
            line is accompanied by background thunder, as if such emphasis is
            needed). As his mother (Lonetta McKee) looks on in the background,
            Carl leaves town to enlist in the Navy, supposedly already
            desegregated by Harry Truman. But of course, the recruit soon finds
            that he's relegated to kitchen duty. Determined to be a Master Diver
            (and not incidentally, the Navy's first black Master Diver),
            Brashear eventually works his way to a New Jersey training facility,
            where he runs into Billy Sunday, himself a courageous diver who's so
            ornery that he's been repeatedly busted in rank, until he's been
            consigned to training divers rather than being one. <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">On
            their first meeting outside the diving school, Sunday calls Brashear
            &quot;Cooky&quot; and won't let him in the gate, making him stand
            outside at attention, waiting to &quot;report for duty&quot; all day
            long. Such abuse, of course, only makes Brashear more resolute in
            his ambition to become a Navy officer -- in large part because he
            remembers his promise to his father (whose photo he keeps by his
            bunk). This interaction at the gate is actually a short version of
            the rest of the plot, which repeats without much variation: Sunday
            is cruel, Brashear is resilient, again and again. And again.
            Brashear is hampered by a number of impediments in addition to
            Sunday's personal abuses, including his seventh grade education (so
            that he has trouble with written exams and must seek the help of a
            young librarian, Jo [Aunjanue Ellis], who eventually becomes his
            wife), and the training school's commanding officer, Mr. Pappy (Hal
            Holbrooke), who makes it his personal divine mission to keep
            Brashear from passing his Master Diver exams. Pappy spends his time
            with a little dog and never comes down from his lookout tower
            quarters, so that he appears to be especially cartoonish and
            bizarre, like some Southern-born descendent of <i>The Caine Mutiny's</i>
            infamously insane Captain Queeg (Humphrey Bogart). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            Brashear's displays of valiant will are the film's raison d'etre,
            everyone around him tends to showcase his greatness and/or learn by
            his example, from Pappy to Sunday to fellow diving student Snowhill
            (Michael Rapaport), whose life Brashear saves. Others inspired by
            Brashear include the unbelievably loyal Jo (who is initially
            impressed by his stubbornness, then dismayed by his lack of
            commitment to her and their child, and at last, proud of his
            accomplishments, trotted out for a public embrace in a Navy
            courtroom) and Billy Sunday's pretty wife, Gwen (Charlize Theron),
            whose brief appearances reveal precious little about her own boozy
            despair, as their central function appears to be assuring you that
            Sunday must have occasional non-asshole moments, since he's married
            to glamorous and self-assured cover-girl-of-the-moment Charlize
            Theron. So, even when he leaves &quot;Nigger Go Home&quot; notes on
            Brashear's bunk, almost drowns Brashear during a practical exam, and
            then almost drowns himself during a barroom contest in which he and
            Brashear don diving helmets that fill up with water to see who can
            hold his breath the longest, Sunday somehow comes off as an okay guy
            whom you want to see spared eternal damnation. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">When
            he finally decides to help Brashear make his Master Diver rank
            (after Brashear has had a leg amputated following an on-board
            accident and so needs retraining), Sunday recovers from his
            alcoholic haze and turns gallant himself, to fight off a malicious
            bureaucratic whippersnapper (Holt McCallany) who refuses to grant
            Brashear his more-than-deserved promotion. Sunday's salvation makes
            for a remarkable story, almost as remarkable as Brashear's himself,
            as both fight dreadful demons that would fell lesser men. Honor is
            one explanation for what these guys do, honor in a very traditional,
            very inflexible sense. As Sunday puts it in one of those
            scare-you-silly speeches that training officers give their military
            recruits (which is repeated on the film's website), &quot;The navy
            diver is not a fighting man. He is a salvage expert. If it's lost
            underwater, he finds it... If he's lucky, he dies young, two hundred
            feet beneath the waves, 'cause that's the closest he will ever get
            to being a hero. Hell, I don't know why anybody would want to be a
            Navy Diver.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            is the film's underlying question, and Brashear's answer -- the one
            he voices anyway -- is that he wants to be a diver because
            &quot;they said I couldn't have it.&quot; His is a brash, brave, and
            admirable endeavor, to be sure. And it's a good thing, we all know,
            that the military is still working to reduce racism within its ranks
            (as well as sexism and, to a much lesser extent, homophobia). Of
            course, the film's attitude is partly a function of securing the
            Navy's cooperation in the film's production, illustrated by one Navy
            advisor's observation in the press kit that Brashear's &quot;is an
            inspirational story, one that transcends race.&quot; While I have no
            doubt that he believes this fiction (in spirit if not particulars,
            perhaps), Brashear's story -- even in its big-screen dilution -- is
            so manifestly about long-term, institutionalized racism, that such a
            comment appears patently naive, even disingenuous (the movie even
            makes the case, somewhat ironically, that the Navy's greatness is
            proved by the fact that someone so exceptional as Brashear would <b><i>want</i></b>
            to be part of it). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            trick in this film -- and others which take on similar historically
            rehabilitative projects -- is to set this racism in the past and
            attribute it to screwed-up (drunk, self-absorbed, insane)
            individuals, so all viewers who don't identify with those
            individuals can feel reassured that they're not to blame. In this
            way, it repeats moves made by <i>Remember the Titans</i> and <i>Hurricane</i>,
            both apparently assuming that there's nothing quite so moving for
            mainstream (read: &quot;mixed&quot;) audiences as an exemplary,
            incredibly strong and patient black man suffering for the sins and
            at the hands of specifically designated evil characters who don't
            begin to resemble anyone in those audiences. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Clearly,
            the casting of Robert De Niro will draw those audiences, and they
            will no doubt appreciate his story arc. But <i>Men of Honor</i> has
            a more ambitious undertaking in mind than showing this formidable
            white man bearing his own burden. Drawing inspirational juice from
            Brashear's own story, the film also alludes to the tolls his
            decisions take on him, Jo, and their young son. It's honestly too
            bad that the movie is so focused on the men of honor, the men in
            relation to one another, and doesn't show more of these tolls, not
            only because they're compelling, but also because they illustrate
            the most important point about the harm done by any kind of
            oppression, military or racist, or both.</font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
