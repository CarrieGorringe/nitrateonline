            <i>Nutty Professor II: The Klumps</i>, Eddie Murphy gets to have his
            cake and eat it too. And not just literally. In playing six
            characters B the titular Professor Sherman Klump, all of his grown
            relatives, and his not very repressed alter ego Buddy Love -- Murphy
            gets to perform and also critique just about every aspect of his own
            multi-faceted and long-evolving comedic style. This is a remarkable
            achievement, no doubt. Consider that many actors don't even have a
            specific style, much less one with more than one or two angles, much
            less one that lends itself to successful self-examination (or
            something like that). Murphy's fortunate to have such a wealth of
            material close at hand, and he exploits it to the max.</b> <o:p>

            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">From
            start to finish, the film is suffused with Eddie Murphyness, his
            grand sense of himself and his desire -- stated repeatedly in
            interviews about the film -- to do &quot;what no one else has done
            before.&quot; There are other elements involved, of course,
            including Rick Baker's frankly incredible prosthetics effects,
            direction by Peter Segal (whose previous pictures include <i>Tommy
            Boy</i> and <i>My Fellow Americans</i>), and a decent soundtrack, by
            Def Jam's finest and friends (Jay&amp;#64979;Z, Eve, Montell Jordan,
            Redman and Eminem, Sisqo and Foxy Brown's remix of &quot;Thong
            Song&quot;). But while <i>The Klumps</i> is nominally written by two
            sets of writers, including several veterans of previous Murphy
            characters and movies (on <i>SNL</i>, and in <i>Nutty</i>, <i>Coming
            to America</i>, and <i>Boomerang</i>) and Paul and Chris Weitz (<i>American
            Pie</i> and <i>Chuck &amp; Buck</i>), the funny stuff is plainly all
            Murphy, who famously ad-libbed much of Klump character scenes, a
            point illustrated briefly but amusingly by the outtakes at film's
            end. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There
            are at least two ways to think about <i>The Klumps</i>, both
            premised on Hollywood's number one mantra: making money. First, it's
            the inevitable sequel to 1996's <i>Nutty Professor</i>, a remake of
            a Jerry Lewis film whose surprising $270 million profits were
            largely attributed to the two remarkable scenes featuring Murphy as
            all the Klump family members save Ernie Jr. (Jamal Mixon), whose
            primary function in both films is, apparently, to stuff his face.
            This makes it like one of those <i>Saturday Night Live</i> movies, a
            four-minute skit stretched to 100 or so minutes, that is, something
            of a crapshoot. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And
            second, it's the inevitable next Eddie Murphy movie, in type and
            scope and attitude. It's common knowledge that his film career was
            rejuvenated by the first <i>Nutty</i> (as the insiders call it),
            that he was suddenly and surprisingly re-christened as a
            family-movie-remake star, and went on to make <i>Dr. Dolittle</i>.
            The new image mostly expunged his previous rep, which stemmed from
            his mean-spirited stand-up humor (the homophobic stuff was a bit
            strained after his encounter with the transvestite, after all), his
            politically-charged <i>SNL</i> humor (recall the fabulous Buckwheat
            and Mr. Robinson's Neighborhood material), and even his reasonably
            successful anti-player consciousness in <i>Boomerang</i>, and recast
            him as a comedian For the Whole Family. Certainly, this was a
            strange development at the time, but it also paved the way for the
            subsequent developments in &quot;family&quot; comedy. If the genre
            was always leaning toward so-called juvenile jokes B farts and poop
            and peeping-tomfoolery B with Murphy's entry into the game, the
            rules loosened some more, and &quot;nasty&quot; gags and
            below-the-belt observations increased. This isn't to say that Murphy
            is responsible for the shift in family comedy -- Jim Carrey is more
            immediately accountable -- but it is to note Murphy's usually
            overlooked part in the process. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            <i>The Klumps</i>, Murphy gets to be &quot;kind and gentle and
            brilliant,&quot; as Sherman is called by his university science
            department colleague and fiancee Denise Gaines (Janet Jackson). He
            also gets to be lascivious as<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Granny
            Klump, sweet as Mama, gruffly masculine as Dad. Not to mention his
            return as and to Buddy Love, who makes his escape from Sherman's
            body by cloning his goo-self with basset hound DNA, which means he
            gets to act like a dog throughout the film, chasing cats, hanging
            his head out car windows, and peeing on newspaper he's laid out in
            the men's room, all of which is suitably funny and creepy at the
            same time. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            basic situation of the comedy involve Sherman's efforts to marry
            Denise, Buddy's efforts to emerge from and sabotage Sherman, the
            family's use of Sherman's miraculous &quot;youth juice.&quot; But
            all this is mostly irrelevant. What's important and often very funny
            is the family's verbal feuding, as they comment on one another's
            shortcomings in terms of age, sex, appetite, career, appearance,
            intelligence, fashion sense, etc., etc. The family's immediate
            dilemma is the impending wedding, which does provide minimal plot
            structure. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            film's first scene is Sherman's nightmare vision of what will happen
            at the altar when he looks down on Denise's pushed-up cleavage and
            gets the hard-on to beat all hard-ons (leading to Buddy's startling
            first appearance, emerging from Sherman's pants in place of his
            penis), and ensuing comic encounters include those between Sherman
            and Denise's rocket-scientist parents, Buddy and Sherman as two
            separate people (due to some loony tunes DNA extraction business),
            Sherman and his still-greedy college Dean, Richmond (Larry Miller),
            and the Dean and a genetically altered gigantor hamster. One
            observer describes this last as the hamster making the poor man
            &quot;his bitch.&quot; I'm not sure how to read the fact that this
            line provided the one moment when the bulk of the preview audience
            was not wholly and uproariously engaged: it elicited a slight pause,
            as if they didn't know quite what to think. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">During
            a summer filled with all kinds of low humor on movie screens, the
            fact that an image or an idea might be a little over the edge is
            surprising. Is it that furry little animals B unlike, say, chickens
            -- are off-limits as fodder for butt-jokes? Or is it that Murphy is
            so out there, in the midst of his family film career, that his
            comedy might still actually offend someone (especially by returning
            to his old standby, gay-baiting)? In this context, it's worth noting
            that the climax of the film turns on Sherman's effort to recombine
            with Buddy, to &quot;eat&quot; him, as Sherman himself puts it (a
            phrasing that leads his father to pull back in alarm: &quot;You're
            headed down the wrong off-ramp there!&quot;). So, for all the
            heterosexual romance at the center of the film's surface plot, the
            real point is for Sherman to love his inner Buddy, even when --
            especially when -- he's out. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">What
            may be most remarkable about <i>The Klumps</i> is how it can, quite
            like Murphy's FOX-TV series, <i>The PJs</i>, joke about issues and
            attitudes that more mainstream comedy might not touch, and still
            come off like it's unconditionally mainstream, playing on primetime
            network television and in a family movie. Murphy's targets are
            selective, his timing unarguably shrewd. Then again, this seemingly
            edgy tone in <i>The Klumps</i> may not be so different from what's
            worked as mainstream material in the past. And this despite the fact
            that the most unnervingly familiar moments of recognition in the
            movie actually don't involve Murphy per se, but Murphy as the crazy
            Klumps. For as they gripe and grump and sling all kinds of arrows at
            one another, the most lucid and insightful character among them is
            Denise. She shares one especially odd and tender scene with Anna
            (Mama) Klump, as Denise tries on her future in-law's old, huge
            wedding dress while agreeably nibbling on a plate of s'mores pie.
            Even aside from the genderfuck going on here, there's something both
            creepy and touching about seeing Miss Jackson play the
            &quot;normal&quot; one.</font></span>
