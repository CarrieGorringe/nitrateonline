            Taylor Hackford's international hostage-negotiation thriller, turns
            out to be a movie about David Morse's feet. Morse, playing an
            engineer trying to build a dam that would benefit the people of a
            South American company, is not wearing the proper foot apparel when
            he is yanked from his car by gun-toting guerrillas and marched into
            the underbrush. They march up rocky slopes, across snowy peaks,
            through acrid mud and jungle shrubbery. At one point, the engineer
            stops and pulls out a gigantic thorn that has torn its way through
            one shoe and into his foot. By the time he reaches camp, his
            footwear has all but disintegrated, and he has to sit in the mud and
            the cold and the rain. When a Polaroid is taken to send back for
            ransom demands, his swollen, misshapen, bloodied feet -- which have
            been whacked a few times for good measure by his captors before the
            picture is taken -- are as prominent in the photo as his haggard,
            stubbly face.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Morse's portrayal of the engineer,
            as a man whose sense of purpose and humanity are sorely put to the
            test, is actually quite good, as is the supporting work by Pamela
            Reed (excellent as the engineer's sister, whose outrage and
            indignation become tempered by compassion), Gottfried John (one of
            Fassbinder's regular actors, and who still has that marvelous,
            hawk-like face seen in earlier films), and, in some of his scenes,
            David Caruso (who doesn't so much appear in this film as seem flung
            in and out of it much of the time). Otherwise, although the
            filmmakers have worked, and reworked, the material so that a tense,
            tight mood is sustained throughout (with Danny Elfman's music
            thundering away on the soundtrack), there's really not much of
            anything else going on in this picture. Russell Crowe plays a
            professional negotiator who specializes in handling
            kidnap-for-ransom situations for various corporations. When the
            company the engineer works for declines to help get him back, the
            negotiator leaves, then, out of the goodness of his heart, comes
            back to help the engineer's wife (Meg Ryan) rescue her husband and
            not get hoodwinked by unscrupulous people in the process.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Crowe spends a lot of time gently
            leaning over a radio and softly dickering with people on the other
            end of the frequency, or issuing terse instructions. Ryan bravely
            fights back tears. Crowe acts strong and silent. Ryan acts noble yet
            conscience-stricken (her character had a bitter argument with her
            husband the night before his abduction). Although Crowe and Ryan
            struggle to imbue their characters with some sort of active
            cognizance, neither of them seems to have any sort of inner life.
            There's no explanation as to why the negotiator seems to have all
            the time in the world to hang around dawdling over this one
            situation, or why the wife doesn't suddenly flip-out and become
            hysterical over why things are taking so long to be resolved. The
            two leads do cast long, yearning glances at each other from time to
            time, but their relationship is so chaste as to seem practically
            moribund. When the negotiator is accused of falling in love with the
            wife of the man whose life he's trying to save -- now, that would've
            been interesting! -- you figure that, from what we've seen, they
            must have gotten him confused with somebody else.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Somebody did figure out that this
            picture was going to need a slam-bang finish, so that's what we get,
            although it's one of those sequences where you see a lot of weapons
            being fired and a lot of people being hit and things blowing up but
            you otherwise can't figure out what you're supposed to be looking
            at. The film ends on a note of wistfulness, which is not enough to
            cancel out the fact that the grainy, color-desaturated
            cinematography makes all the South American characters in the film
            look grimy and unpleasant. Whatever their grievances are, living in
            a country that's described in the story as being second only to
            Colombia in terms of corruption and lawlessness, they're not utmost
            on this film's agenda.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
