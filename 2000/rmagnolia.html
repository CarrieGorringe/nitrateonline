<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="5"><b>R</b></font><font size="4">iding
in his cruiser, LAPD Officer Jim Kurring (John C. Reilly) talks to himself. Or
rather, he talks to the camera, as if he's in an ongoing episode of <i>Cops</i>,
on TV. Jim describes his daily routine, his concern that violence seems to be
&quot;the way of the world,&quot; and how this excess makes it &quot;our job, to
serve and protect.&quot; Jim sees himself as a good guy. &quot;I wanna help
people,&quot; he says so sincerely. &quot;I correct a wrong, or right a
situation, and I'm a happy cop.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">One
of many characters in Paul Thomas Anderson's amazing new film, <i>Magnolia</i>,
Jim spends much of his onscreen time talking like this, while driving his car,
on the way to or from a call. That Jim can understand himself - and that you can
also understand him - as a cop on <i>Cops</i>, speaks to the pervasiveness of
the series, as concept and cultural condition. That is, you believe that cops on
the show expect to tell you about their duties and worries, just as you expect
to empathize with them. This is the brilliant fiction of <i>Cops</i>, its
ability to create order and reason amid the chaos of life, a cop's life or your
life. And in this way, <i>Cops</i> exemplifies what television does best: it
appears to give structure to mundane confusion. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Television
is at the heart of <i>Magnolia</i>, though, with its stunning, sometimes
acrobatic, cinematic effects and giant screen actors, you might not recognize it
at first. But watch carefully, and you'll see that there is a reference to TV in
almost every scene -- sets playing in the background in apartments, department
stores, and bars (running <i>The Thin Man</i>, hair club commercials, talk
shows, and soaps), Jim's and other characters' repeated acting out as if they're
on TV, a malevolent game show called &quot;What Do Kids Know?&quot; that pits
children against adults in horrific and ludicrous contests of knowledge. On one
level, the film is clearly about adults misunderstanding and abusing children.
On another, it's about this misunderstanding as it is represented in and as
television, the medium that shapes life in the San Fernando Valley, where the
film is set. Even the style of the film makes the point: swooping in and out of
characters and events and settings and times, the film resembles three hours of
channeling surfing, but this familiar activity becomes loaded with passions,
ruminations, and romances. It's TV on hyperdrive. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">One
of the more remarkable effects of surfing is, of course, finding those
connections that otherwise elude you, the causal links between seeming
coincidences and accidents and effects, the ways that <i>South Park</i>
resonates with <i>Law and Order</i> or <i>Jenny Jones</i> with <i>Charlie Rose</i>.
As <i>Magnolia</i> narrates and points out such connections, it often seems
excessive and unpredictable. But what might look out of control to some viewers
is weird cosmic grace to others. This is a film that understands TV -- as an
industry, cultural context, way of seeing, and map for living. Speedy reading
and info-assimilating is normal for TV viewers (and not just those who watch the
much-derided MTV). Everyone else, please keep up. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">For
all the anxieties and zones of comfort it may produce, television is the film's
primary lens for looking at family relationships. Everyone here is a product of
TV, perversely, indirectly or directly. Families here are voids, gaping and
horrific, into which kids and adults seem to freefall. But the film is also
considering the possibilities that not all these falls are free; that is, it
poses a clear - if strange -- relationship between accident and destiny (or more
precisely, judgment passed), in part through its prologue (which considers three
bizarre death-related stories, involving murder, suicide, and accident, as if
they might be structured, fated, or occurring, as the narrator puts it,
&quot;not by chance&quot;), and in part through its repeated references to
weather reports (attempts to control or at least know &quot;fate&quot;) and
repeated images of Valley thoroughfares, where characters pass one another
without knowing while we see everything.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Related
to this notion of non-accidents is the film's other central theme, language and
its many failures, to communicate, allow connections and understandings. Several
characters comment on the ways that language falls short, either by design
(&quot;You know,&quot; says one woman to her careless husband, &quot;but you
can't say&quot;) or by ignorance, selfishness, and lack of effort (&quot;You
need to be nicer to me,&quot; a child tells his father. &quot;Go to bed,&quot;
says Dad). Aimee Mann's soundtrack songs, sad, deliberate, haunting, relate the
pain of these un-connections and unanswered questions, but never explain or
resolve them. It's daring that <i>Magnolia</i> does not explain or resolve
anything. Along with its TV-making-and-watching aesthetics, this resistance to
closure makes for complexity that you don't usually see in movies. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Always,
when language and connections falter, TV intervenes. Change the channel. Maybe
there's something better on. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Much
like Anderson's <i>Boogie Nights</i>, <i>Magnolia</i> introduces a series of
characters, but unlike the earlier film, this one doesn't pull them together
under the auspices of a self-conscious family unit. Rather, in <i>Magnolia</i>
you see characters suffer and hope, their regrets and efforts at redemption. You
see them feeling isolated in their various Valley hells, and the channel-surfing
editing asks you to see their similar fears and desires. Claudia Gator (Melora
Walters) is the coke-addict daughter of self-obsessed TV game-show host Jimmy
Gator (Philip Baker Hall) and enduring wife Rose (Melinda Dillon). Claudia's
extra-loud music-blasting leads to a visit from a police officer who becomes an
unlikely and yet potential suitor, Jim the cop (who is introduced as he finds a
dead body in a black woman's apartment: that this apparent murder is only
explained by her grandson's rap cryptic offering underlines the increasing voids
between whiteness and blackness in everyday existence). <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">At
the same time, Claudia's father - Jimmy- learns that he has terminal cancer and,
focused on his own profound remorse for his life of banal cruelties, is unable
to see, comprehend, or prevent the on-air meltdown of a brilliant child
contestant on his show, &quot;What Do Kids Know?&quot; Young Stanley Spector
(Jeremy Blackman) is pressured by his out-of-work actor father, who wants only
to win the game, which sets up a team of three children against three adults,
answering preposterously arcane questions (for instance, translate an English
line from an opera into its original language). At that moment, a former
game-show prodigy, Donnie Smith (William H. Macy), just fired from his job as a
clerk at an electronics store, finds himself admitting -- at long last -- his
homosexual desire for a young, hunky bartender. However, the bartender is
distracted by a smug, cash-flashing barfly named -- of all things -- Thurston
Howell (Henry Gibson). Donnie insists, &quot;I have love to give, &quot;but he
laments, &quot;I don't know where to put it.&quot; All the while, that
devastating, mesmerizing game show drones on the TV hanging like a religious
icon above the bar. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">All
this narrative seems quite enough for one movie, even one that runs three hours,
but there's another set of characters running parallel to these, also immersed
in and run into the ground by the (entertainment) industry that <i>is</i> the
heartbeat of the Valley. Earl Partridge (Jason Robards) is a TV producer,
bedridden throughout the film, while his wife Linda (Julianne Moore) drives all
over town trying to settle affairs -- her husband's medications, their shared
legal business, and her own upset that, as a proper trophy wife, she cheated,
but now has fallen in love with him -- while Earl's nurse, Phil (Philip Seymour
Hoffman) is trying to mollify his charge's distress by tracking down his
long-lost son, now the media televangelist of a whacked-out program for
alienated men called &quot;Seduce and Destroy.&quot; This horrific culmination
of all fight-clubbing masculinity is the unbeatably named Frank T.J. Mackey (Tom
Cruise), a misanthropic monster with a cause that unfolds slowly: he hates his
father Earl for abandoning him as a child, and what's more, he hates his mother
for abandoning him by dying of cancer. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">That
Frank's carefully repressed life-details are revealed during a TV interview is
only one of many awful ironies in <i>Magnolia</i>. It's ironic because Frank --
who is only one logical step from Tony Robbins and other millionaire
self-helpers -- is the consummate product of TV, its capacity for exploiting
conflict, for convincing consumers to see themselves as warriors in need of a
direction and a purchase. The vaguely raging men in his audience can't help but
suck down his message (&quot;Respect the cock! Tame the cunt!&quot;), because
his package, his excruciating telegenic beauty, is so perfectly made for and by
TV. It's no wonder that Frank's own on-air undoing (which runs simultaneously
with Stanley's) leads him back to his TV-producer father's house. The father-son
meeting only makes for more conflict: Frank has no self-understanding except
that molded by a lifetime of abuse and rancor. There's no compassion in his
universe. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">This
absence seems inevitable in a world that's all about switching channels. But the
film is also rife with moments of warmth and charm: Frank finally sees something
resembling light, Phil works desperately to ease Earl's death, Earl's dog dies
at the same instant he does (suggesting not so much their close attachment as
their horrific misfortunes), the apartment-dweller's rapping grandson (named
Worm) ends up saving Linda's life under freaky circumstances, and a mother and
daughter are reunited just when you think there's no possible hope for it. That
father's fare so badly in the film says something about patriarchy, capitalism,
and self-interest, but it also says something about hope when Jim the cop offers
a final, insightful commentary on the usefulness of knowing when to let someone
go when punishment is not the right answer. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Sometimes,
it turns out, a moral order can best be created out of compassion rather than
rules, out of intuitive kindness rather than fear. And in each instance where
this choice comes up (and often when it doesn't), TV is the backdrop. Television
is everywhere in <i>Magnolia</i>, in the game show, in the commercials that run
incessantly in the backgrounds of scenes, in Jim's self-narrating, in Frank's
sensational bravado. Excessive and alarming as all these allusions might seem,
they are also increasingly inevitable in TV’s wild consolidations of
judgments, spectacles, pseudo-confessions, on <i>Jerry Springer</i>, <i>WWF
Smackdown</i>, <i>America's Most Wanted</i>, CNN, <i>The Blame Game</i>, <i>Forgive
or Forget</i>, and <i>Judge Judy</i>. <i>Magnolia</i> is a movie about excess
that is undeniably excessive. It's about TV, or more precisely, what TV means on
an alarmingly grand scale, with its lust for conflict and surfeit, its pretense
of format and organization. Whatever else it does, <i>Magnolia</i> gets all that
dead right. <o:p>
