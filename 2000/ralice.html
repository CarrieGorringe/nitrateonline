            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Juliette
            Binoche has the most haunted face in movies. And appropriately, it's
            not easy to describe how this phenomenon works. She's achingly
            beautiful, but so are many women who don't bring to the screen
            anything near Binoche's distinctive combination of pain, mystery,
            and appetite, evoking from the rest of us a response that is at once
            ethereal and visceral. Filmmakers tend to accentuate her face,
            framing her hugely, in bleak half-shadows or luminous light. In both
            cases, the effect is the same: you're left pondering what it is that
            has brought this pale and lovely visage to such a state of unrest.
            Perhaps, you think, she's remembering some acute passion, but you're
            only seeing the aftereffects, never the moment itself. Or perhaps
            she's roiling, caught up in some acute emotion at the very instant
            of that close-up. Then again, maybe she's just distracted. Maybe
            she's thinking about what's on her grocery list. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Whatever's
            on Juliette Binoche's mind, gazing at that face can definitely get
            you thinking. Whether she's nursing Jeremy Irons' terrible need for
            control in <i>Damage</i>, Ralph Fiennes' waning spirit in <i>The
            English Patient</i>, or her own survivor's guilt in Krysztof
            Kieslowski's <i>Bleu</i>, Binoche consistently conveys an eerie mix
            of rapture and anguish, desire and detachment. Sometimes it almost
            hurts to look at her, but she's so compelling, you can't look away
            either. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Reuniting
            with her <i>Rendez-vous</i> director Andre Techine for <i>Alice and
            Martin</i>, Binoche again plays an exquisitely troubled survivor --
            Alice -- who, after some initial self-protective detachment, devotes
            herself to rescuing her psychically wounded young lover, Martin
            (Alexis Loret). Her journey from one point to the other is a
            difficult one, and the film doesn't tell you much about Alice at
            all. The plot (co-written by Techine, Gilles Taurand, and Oliver
            Assayas) is twisty and turny in the way that films can be when they
            don't really care if you come to a sense of resolution or not.
            Sometimes this disregard for viewers can be provocative, sometimes
            it can be annoying. The spates of incoherence and McGuffins in <i>Alice
            and Martin</i> are intriguing for a while, and then they slide into
            gimmickry. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            most glaring omission is motivation or background for Alice. She and
            Martin circle round each other, but neither comes fully to light;
            rather, they punctuate each other's stories, each disturbing for its
            own reasons. The movie opens on a child version of Martin (played as
            a ten-year-old by Jeremy Kreikenmayer), sent off by his single
            mother Jeanine (Carmen Maura) to live in the city with his married
            father, Victor (Pierre Maguelon). Martin's new upper crusty family
            -- Victor, his wife Lucie (Marthe Villalonga), and Martin's
            half-brothers Francois (Erik Kreikenmayer), Frederic (Jean-Pierre
            Lorit), and Benjamin (Mathieu Amalric) -- is quite less than happy
            to receive him. Understandably bereft and hoping to be sent back to
            his beauty shop owner mother, the boy feigns illness. Learning of
            the deception, Victor calls Martin into his dark-wooded, foreboding
            office to admonish, &quot;You have to tell the truth.&quot; The
            father points out that Martin's new situation is in fact to his
            advantage, that he is now afforded the chance to &quot;broaden [his]
            horizons.&quot; The boy looks appropriately mortified but takes at
            least part of the lesson to heart, then returns to his bedroom where
            he attempts to become honestly sick, standing naked before an open
            window in midwinter. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Cut
            forward several years, and the grown up Martin is bamming through
            the front gate of Victor's estate, pell-mell into the French
            countryside (which is apparently quite wild when a film demands it
            reflect a character's inner turmoil). He spends some days in a state
            of apparent despair and anxiety, plunging into a river and sleeping
            fitfully during spooky nights, stealing eggs from a local farmer to
            survive. After being picked up, chastised, and cut loose again by
            the police, Martin eventually makes his way to Paris, where he
            locates his brother Benjamin. A struggling actor, Benjamin is
            sharing a small flat with Alice -- aha! -- who is a very serious and
            not particularly successful violinist, performing at small venues
            with a quartet, sometimes auditioning for solo gigs. At first she
            has little patience with their guest. Though he's quite beautiful,
            Martin is also annoyingly cryptic, even unsocialized. At one point
            she tells him he's immature, and Martin starts to pout. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Nonetheless,
            the three characters quickly develop a strange and intense
            friendship, cut short when Martin lands a lucrative high-fashion
            modeling contract and somehow -- by winsome gazing, more pouting,
            and some zinger-wheedling (&quot;If I hadn't met you, I wouldn't
            exist!&quot;) -- he convinces Alice to be &quot;his.&quot; Benjamin
            is hurt and a little jealous: though he has previously informed
            Martin that his relationship with Alice is &quot;not sexual&quot;
            (Benjamin identifies as gay, though he and Alice might have
            occasional sex... it's hard to tell exactly what they do before
            Martin's on the scene). Once Alice starts jetting about with Martin
            to gorgeous European photo-shoot locations (France's Cahors region,
            Spain), and so basically moves out of her apartment, Benjamin drops
            from sight, until a crucial -- or not so crucial -- confrontation
            that comes much later in the film. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Until
            that point, however, Alice and Martin behave as if they are
            entranced with one another, spending dreamy nights together and
            walking through some montagey developing-romance scenes, including a
            few conversations, shot in delicate close-ups and accompanied by
            Philippe Sarde's swooping soundtrack. During such moments, Binoche's
            face does its evocative work, for instance, as Alice remembers her
            sister, dead at age eleven, whom she both adored and envied. When
            she says, &quot;Everyone treated her like an adult,&quot; it might
            be a little clearer why Alice has fallen so hard for Martin, who is
            treated like an adult by his business associates, though he remains
            a child, unformed emotionally, and unable to express himself. Or
            again, she sees in her sister and in Martin a bit of herself,
            refracted in a way that the movie resists showing straight-up.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            tear comes when Alice tells Martin that she is pregnant: suddenly
            the burden of intimacy becomes too much, and he collapses into a
            kind of coma, which the doctors in the film call the result of
            &quot;psychological trauma.&quot; In hospital, Martin looks
            especially fragile and wan while Alice takes on a determined and
            practical demeanor; when the couple vacations (or rather, takes a
            rest cure) on the Spanish coast, he swims for hours each night and
            refuses to speak with Alice, who becomes increasingly distraught.
            What if he's diseased in a way that might affect their child? And
            so, from this point, Alice essentially takes over their life details
            and the narrative, trying to piece together the &quot;trauma&quot;
            that incapacitates her lover and, for a while at least, the film.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It
            will come as no surprise that Martin's suffering stems from his very
            f*cked-up family, whose nasty history Alice proceeds to uncover step
            by step, a process that is undoubtedly yucky for her, but not a
            little tedious for us. The stakes for her dedication remain either
            too obvious (her own maternal stuff) or too subtle (there's
            something in her own past that's behind Alice's need to know but
            you'll never understand it). Equally troubling, the grounds for
            Alice and Martin's relationship are never really clear -- why does
            he want so desperately to possess her? Why does she give up her own
            career to keep him company? Still, you might take Binoche on faith.
            More than a coherent or even a very interesting puzzle, the film is,
            in the end, another occasion for you to work out your own
            relationship to Binoche, who remains, as ever, seductively
            distressed and distressingly seductive. </font><o:p>
