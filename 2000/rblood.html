            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>About
            halfway through <i>Blood Simple</i>, a woman walks into the backroom
            of a bar, sees something she has trouble wrapping her arms around,
            and slowly falls backward … into her bed at home. Without a cut, a
            dissolve, any visible effect, she drops, with the camera locked into
            her face at a fixed angle, into another setting entirely.
            Compressing not just time, but also space, it's a deliciously clever
            shot, boy is it clever, but it also communicates something - the
            inability of the character to stop thinking about what she's
            witnessed.</b> <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And
            that, in a nutshell, is <i>Blood Simple</i>. Because it's a movie
            about characters thinking, more than it is about them feeling, it
            was criticized by some for being too clever by half and detached,
            and praised by others for the way it utilized a delirious visual and
            narrative inventiveness in revving up a noir yarn. But at this stage
            in the game, perhaps the most notable aspect of <i>Blood Simple</i>
            is that so few have seen it, despite its pedigree and its quality.
            Hopefully that will change with its polishing and re-release in
            theaters this month. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Most
            folks know the Coens for <i>Fargo</i>, and <i>Fargo</i> also happens
            to be the filmmaking brothers' most direct descendant of their first
            directorial effort. Both involve the hiring of a criminal by a
            desperate citizen to hurt a loved one, and in both films the job
            goes very, very wrong. <i>Fargo</i> is the more quirky and emotional
            of the two, but <i>Blood Simple</i> wins hands down for sheer
            dramatic ingenuity. <i>Blood Simple</i> is to most thrillers what a
            cube is to a square - its dimensions are expanded. Where in most
            examples of the genre the audience looks over the shoulder of a
            single point of view, <i>Blood Simple</i> asks you to consider four
            differing perspectives, often at once. The greatness of the film
            comes from how gracefully it pulls this off, never once becoming as
            strenuous or gimmicky as it should be. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            Coens are certainly eggheads, brainiacs who, especially in their
            first four works, were obsessed with the workings of the
            intellectual organ. The fact that they explored this interest with
            such funhouse diversity is a testament to their often awesome
            talent. In the zany domestic comedy <i>Raising Arizona</i>, the main
            character, after learning he and his wife couldn't have a child of
            their own and kidnapping one for themselves, experiences such guilt
            and self-loathing that he wills into existence a big, burly, and
            very mean physical manifestation of those feelings. In the
            gorgeously lyrical gangster yarn <i>Miller's Crossing</i>, underboss
            Tom Regan is a man so adept at strategically thinking his way
            through the labyrinth of loyalties and deceit marking a gang war
            that he's lost his heart in the bargain. And, of course, in <i>Barton
            Fink</i>, the title character spends most of the movie living,
            breathing, and fretting directly inside a mind. It just isn't his
            own. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And
            first, but certainly not least, is <i>Blood Simple</i>, in which the
            minds of the four leads are as perpetually and oxymoronically busy
            and static as the ubiquitous ceiling fans hovering over their
            oppressively steamy Texas milieu. <i>Blood Simple</i> is about
            confusion under pressure, without ever, and this is the hard part,
            seeming the least bit confused itself. The Coens have that
            intangible storytelling quality of complete and utter confidence
            that blesses most all of their work (with the exception of bits of <i>The
            Hudsucker Proxy</i> and most of <i>The Big Lebowski</i>). From the
            very start, where M. Emmet Walsh recites a brief, gleefully acidic
            homily to the moral desert of Texas life, <i>Blood Simple</i> is
            utterly assured in its every frame. Such poise and virtuosity puts
            you in the front seat as you observe these characters trying to find
            their way out of a maze they sometimes don't even know they're in. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It
            begins like many a B-movie noir thriller. A quiet, basically decent
            bartender (John Getz) gets involved with a married woman (Frances
            McDormand) whose husband (Dan Hedaya), the owner of the dive, is not
            so decent, and not so quiet. The jilted, angry spouse takes action,
            hiring a sleazy hitman (M. Emmet Walsh) to ice them both.
            Complications ensue, but they are not the complications you'd most
            likely expect, and they certainly aren't staged in any way that
            resembles the familiar. Besides being so elegant in its twists and
            turns while at the same time doling out more than a few delicious
            surprises, <i>Blood Simple's</i> plot is staged with a combination
            of visual ferocity and restraint that yields one bravura sequence
            after another. None of them will be described here. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            acting is pure noir perfection. Frances McDormand, in her first
            screen role, plays the errant wife with a doe-eyed innocence that
            seems too good to be true, while talented character actor John Getz
            (also in Cronenberg's <i>The Fly</i>) is effectively stoic and
            bewildered. Hedaya is the picture of seething menace, and then
            there's the wonderful M. Emmet Walsh in the role of his lifetime,
            all fattened-up smug self-satisfaction in his faded canary yellow
            suit and oversized cowboy hat, playing his thug as a child giddy
            with the freedom of an unformed conscience. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">McDormand,
            who would later become wife to Joel, sister-in-law to Ethan, and
            Oscar winner in their greatest success, made her feature debut in <i>Blood
            Simple</i>. As did composer Carter Burwell, the greatest film
            composer never recognized for his work whose rueful, eerie score in <i>Blood
            Simple</i> marked the beginning of a long, fruitful career with the
            brothers. Add to that list of feature debuts Barry Sonnenfeld, the
            cinematographer turned director who had great fun developing cunning
            jerry-rigged camera effects here in his first job and who shot the
            delicately beautiful <i>Miller's Crossing</i> for his last, before
            becoming the director of mildly entertaining big-effects pictures. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Despite
            all the people who got their start on <i>Blood Simple</i>, the
            directors included, it would be impossible for the unknowing
            audience member to view it as a rookie project. As the Coens would
            certainly agree, and as they show here with this down-and-dirty noir
            masterpiece, being a rookie is nothing more than a state of mind. </font><o:p>
