            opens at a college reunion. Most of the attendees have returned to
            Santa Fe from somewhere else, but Dex (Donal Logue) has stayed put.
            And why should he move on? Living simply and without ambition,
            odd-jobbing since graduation ten years ago, Dex believes he is also
            happy and stress-free. Indeed, he first appears on screen while
            having sex with his married girlfriend (Ayelet Kaznelson) in the
            library stacks, pushing and sighing and grabbing, their passionate
            encounter framed through the shelves and in deep shadow. In the next
            minute, Dex is revealed in the bright fluorescent light of the men's
            room, checking himself in the mirror, adjusting his pink and sweaty
            face. And it's here that you notice the film's essential gimmick,
            which is that Dex is no rock-jawed, studly big-man-on-campus, but
            rather, a rather plain and overweight schlub. And so here it is, the
            film's primary zen-like referent and apparent mystery: the sexual
            appeal of a large body. </b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></span></font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And
            here as well, is the film's point, revealed only a minute or so in
            to the running time: while Dex might <i>look</i> pleased with
            himself, you know -- if for no other reason than the fact that he's
            in a movie that opens at a class reunion -- that he'll soon be doing
            some reevaluation. And in case you need more convincing, Dex
            encounters a former classmate in the bathroom, a fellow who's now a
            priest. Trying to make nice, Dex -- using the stall as a kind of
            confessional -- chatters on about having had some interest in the
            clergy some time ago, and the priest expresses his surprise at such
            interest, given Dex's &quot;moral turpitude.&quot; Ouch. Dex cringes
            and moves on to the outside world, where he can still play like he's
            popular and self-confident, where he can chuckle when a female
            friend recalls his erstwhile beauty and magnetism. &quot;You were a
            king,&quot; she says. &quot;You were Elvis!&quot;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Though
            Dex appears to agree with this estimation, from here the film goes
            on to illustrate how empty and miserable his experience must be, and
            how he really wants to settle down and couple up, to mature like a
            &quot;normal&quot; man. In other words, it retreats from its
            ostensible premise, that the large person is attractive for his own
            reasons, and remakes him into a mundane romantic comedy hero. The
            question might be -- why does an independent film want to make this
            wholly traditional argument, so easily available in the latest and
            slickest Hollywood product? And the answer might be that <i>The Tao
            of Steve</i> -- which won a Special Jury prize at this year's
            Sundance Festival -- imagines itself making one of those
            &quot;post-feminist&quot; cases for reaffirming old-school gender
            roles, the way that, oh, <i>Ally McBeal</i> does. That is, the movie
            contends that men and women really <i>want</i> to play these roles,
            because they are &quot;natural&quot; and &quot;comfortable.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            concept of comfort ends up being very important, more than
            enlightenment or insight or anything else more typically associated
            with a tao. It's the emotional and physical end Dex seeks even if he
            doesn't know it yet, even if he has developed this elaborate guide
            for living he calls the &quot;Tao of Steve,&quot; a kind of
            spiritual structure -- more like a rationale, really -- for his
            self-indulgence and womanizing. In his &quot;Tao,&quot; the goal is
            uncommitted sex, admittedly not a very new idea. But that much is
            plain: the steps to achieving the &quot;Tao&quot; are modeled on a
            mix of Philosophy 101 (namely, Lao-tzu, Heidegger, and Kierkegaard)
            and 70s cool-guy icons -- Steve McQueen, Steven Austin, Steve
            McGarrett. Never mind that none of these guys was especially
            fulfilled by his stoic, lonely &quot;Steveness&quot; (or that bionic
            man Steve Austin was so f*cked up that he was literally rebuilt by a
            bunch of nerdy scientists). The steps are laid out via a convenient
            &quot;student&quot; whom Dex grants a series of lessons: his
            irrepressibly awkward roommate Dave (Kimo Wills). Smitten by a cute
            girl, Dave seeks guidance. While smoking dope and drinking beer or
            playing cards and frisbee golf with their two other roommates, Matt
            (Craig D. Lafayette) and Chris (Selby Craig), Dex unveils the three
            principles of the men's how-to-get-some philosophy: eliminate
            desire, display excellence in her presence, and retreat, in order to
            stoke her desire. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            the midst of Dave's lessons, however, Dex has to learn a few of his
            own, commencing when he re-meets Syd (Greer Goodman, sister of
            co-writer-director Jenniphr), with whom he went to school so long
            ago. Now she's a professional theater set designer and amateur
            drummer (read: competent and self-possessed). And she's completely
            uninterested in Dex. In fact, she's quite specifically antipathetic
            toward his slacker outlook, pointing out his selfishness, unhealthy
            habits, and general disrespect for other people, particularly women.
            Their mutual friends are on the watch as well: &quot;Don't pull a
            Steve on her,&quot; admonishes one. And so, Dex falls for Syd big
            time. It's no surprise that he likes her precisely because she
            doesn't like him -- in a word, she out-&quot;Steves&quot; him -- but
            it is a disappointment that the movie can't come up with a more
            innovative way of dealing with gendered power imbalances than simply
            inverting them. Girls can do it too. And so? <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still,
            Dex's route to domesticity and culturally-approved comfort is not
            exactly bump-free. Though he is momentarily frightened into
            considering that he should quit smoking and go on a diet (after a
            weekend camping trip with Syd and their happily coupled friends,
            during which he collapses and must be rushed to the doctor's), he
            never has to think twice about his very common standards of female
            beauty. Though he feels sensitive enough about his own body that he
            refuses to take his clothes off while swimming or having sex, he
            confesses that he would never date a fat woman: &quot;I'm the worst
            kind of fattist, a fat fattist.&quot; For some reason, the object of
            his affection, Syd, finds this only mildly annoying (perhaps because
            she's thin and blond and tanned), and soon enough, the comment
            appears to be forgotten. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Such
            short-term memory is what allows Dex and his cronies, not to mention
            the rest of the culture, to cook up and subscribe to ideologies like
            the &quot;Tao of Steve.&quot; Rather than grasping or even asking
            questions about what this presumed ethos might represent in a larger
            context, the characters in <i>The Tao of Steve</i> see it as a
            stage, not as part of who they are. Dex renounces Steveness during a
            climactic moment, telling Dave that he shouldn't emulate him or the
            Steves, that he should find himself, or his own values, or something
            equally predictable: &quot;I've been trying to turn you into me, and
            I'm not even sure that I want to be me anymore.&quot; Though the
            movie might have offered some insight into what <i>that</i> means --
            what it means to be Dex, a man struggling to accommodate impossible
            criteria for masculinity and potency -- it opts for what's
            comfortable. Basic expectations of gender remain intact and
            difficult questions about sexuality unasked. And to be Elvis,
            somehow, still looks like a good idea. </font><o:p>
