            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Watching the bustling activity
            during the opening scenes of <i>Dr. T and the Women</i>, I was
            reminded of that particular, fierce energy which women are capable
            of generating. One friend of mine routinely works until 12:30 at
            night, goes home, catches a few hours of sleep, and then is up at
            the crack of dawn so she can see her kids off to school for the day.
            Gentlemen, look to your laurels.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the case of the film's main
            character, Dr. Sully Travers (Richard Gere), his waiting room is
            always packed with many, many women from the more moneyed environs
            of Dallas. Why? The director Robert Altman said that the initial
            concept for this film, written by Anne Rapp (who scripted Altman's
            previous film, <i>Cookie's Fortune</i>), was how a woman would
            respond if she was readied for an exam and found that the doctor who
            would be attending her was Richard Gere. But the women also flock to
            Sully because he's very good at what he does, and he's very good
            with his female patients -- he doesn't scare them, he's attentive,
            considerate, and concerned. As he says in one scene, he respects
            women with an almost sacred devotion, and so the women in the film
            respond in kind.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The story's rum joke, though, is
            that the one woman Sully cares about the most, his wife Kate (Farrah
            Fawcett), is the one he can't help. Sully is told by Kate's doctor
            (Lee Grant, in a performance that channels Viveca Lindfors) that she
            is slipping further and further away from him as a result of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>&quot;Hestig's condition&quot;, a rare psychological
            disorder, named after one of the mythological Greek goddesses (an
            actual one, according to Edith Hamilton), in which women who have
            been pampered and are living in too much comfort -- women who have
            been &quot;loved too much&quot; -- regress into a childlike state.
            Fawcett gives Kate a genuinely unnerving quality, as if she has
            succumbed, rather than voluntarily retreated into, innocence, as if
            she had become its victim, and when she tells Sully not to kiss her
            -- &quot;We don't do that anymore. It's bad.&quot; -- the sting that
            Sully feels, that his greatest asset is what is estranging, even
            destroying, his wife -- is palpable.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sully starts befriending Bree
            (Helen Hunt), the new assistant golf pro at the country club he
            frequents, and who exudes a confidence and easy attitude that he
            finds invigorating amidst the swirl of people and events around him.
            In a remarkable scene, the two of them have dinner at Bree's place,
            after which she takes their wine glasses and, with a movement and a
            look, indicates that she's ready to take things on to the next level
            with him. Gere's character hesitates -- he doesn't want to be
            callous and betray Kate even in his mind, but he also needs
            something that's gone from his day-to-day existence. The sequence
            unfolds with a minimum of dialogue, but it's a beaut, and both Gere
            and Hunt perform it beautifully.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In fact, I asked my great and good
            friend TH, who has been a Helen Hunt fan from way back (not just the
            TV show <i>Mad About You</i>, but also WAY back, to when she
            appeared in <i>Project X</i> in 1987) what he would say if somebody
            asked him to describe why Hunt appealed to him in particular.
            &quot;Well, for me...it's like she's the girl-next-door with
            sex,&quot; TH replied. &quot;Plain enough, but pretty. But, to me,
            she's always had the 'girl-next-door' quality that's sexy, combined
            with intelligence. And it all comes together.&quot; In fact, he
            concluded, what gives her the most appeal is the fact that she comes
            across as &quot;extremely intelligent&quot;. And on this description
            I cannot improve, regarding either Hunt's performance in <i>Dr. T</i>,
            or her increasingly extraordinary ability as an actress.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            ultimately winds up being mid-level Altman, meaning it still has
            more interesting stuff in it than a lot of other films currently
            showing. In <i>Cookie's Fortune</i>, many of the female characters
            were depicted broadly and sometimes cartoonishly, and, in this film,
            a lot of the female characters are barely differentiated. Some of
            this is on-purpose, so that the film can show Sully navigating his
            way through ladies who are all slender, well-dressed, and blond,
            just like the fashion magazines, but the characterizations are still
            slim. Laura Dern appears as Sully's sister, who moves into his house
            and manages three young kids with one hand while holding a flute of
            Cristal with the other. There are Sully's two almost-grown
            daughters, one (Kate Hudson) shuttling between tryouts for the
            school cheerleading squad and preparations for her huge upcoming
            wedding ceremony; the other (Tara Reid), who works as a tour guide
            at Dallas' Conspiracy Museum (is this an actual place?), trying to
            grab ahold of her dad long enough to tell him that her sister's
            impending betrothal is a big mistake. I would have liked to have
            seen a bit more of Liv Tyler's character (Tyler really bloomed as an
            actress in Altman's previous film), but she doesn't show up until
            the film is halfway over. And Shelley Long, who starts out fine as
            Sully's indomitable-in-the-midst-of-total-chaos main receptionist,
            falls back on almost oafish TV comedy antics during her main scene
            with Gere.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Altman and his longtime, ace editor
            Geraldine Peroni keep the multiple plotlines flowing smoothly and in
            sync, yet taking the time to add nuanced <i>soupçons</i> along the
            way: a house servant's reaction when a child hands her a pastry to
            eat during a wedding shower; the way one of Sully's nurses runs her
            hand across her tummy after he has performed an examination; a
            character's reaction to being caught in the sudden crossfire of lawn
            sprinklers; and the way veteran actress Dorothy Deavers deftly trips
            a particularly offensive woman in Sully's waiting room. And Lyle
            Lovett's original music for the film is wonderful.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film also includes one moment
            between Sully and Bree which shows that he hasn't entirely rid
            himself of all old-fashioned ideas about women and men's
            relationship to them. It's something that's a little dark in a film
            that is otherwise generally light in mood, but it's realistic. It's
            also the type of thing that would cause Altman's detractors, who
            have said some pretty mean things about him over the years, to
            reiterate that he is a filmmaker who is a misanthrope, towards his
            characters and his audience. Rather, I feel, Altman is a realist,
            and he has never been at his worse except for when he has made films
            that are phony. He has found -- and continues to work in -- a way of
            making films the way he thinks he should make them, ones that offer
            no easy resolutions and don't jeopardize their own integrity or his.
            A commodity in short supply. So be it.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
