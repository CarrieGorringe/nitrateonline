<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Paul
Thomas Anderson describes his new film, <i>Magnolia</i>, in language that only
seems simple. It's a complicated and large-scale movie, running over three hours
and covering one day in the lives of multiple characters living and dying in
California's San Fernando Valley. But for Anderson, the movie is part of his own
lifelong exploration of what it means to be human, to forgive and endure despite
what seem impossible circumstances. Mostly, though, it sounds as though he's
happy to have it released and to be talking about it, which, he observes, is
part of the process. &quot;I was exhausted when the movie was coming out in New
York and LA, but then I took a couple of weeks off for the holidays and I was
able to kind of get my juice back, and think, okay, I can do phone calls and
talk show things. I try and balance it out. I mean, I don't want to be
blabbermouth-young-white-director-guy, but I gotta help. You just don't want to
get a disgusting sheen on yourself.&quot; <o:p>

</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Anderson
sounds a little rushed, but more than that, he sounds at ease with himself and
with this deranged business of film promotion. Since <i>Magnolia</i> is his
second high-profile film in as many years (after <i>Boogie Nights</i>), he knows
what to expect, how to survive what he calls being &quot;burned out,&quot; how
to squeeze in breathing between phone interviews and sit-downs with Charlie Rose
or Letterman. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">While
his first films -- <i>Hard Eight</i> as well as <i>Boogie Nights</i> -- were
critically acclaimed immediately, Anderson is now coping with a range of
responses: people love it and don't, sometimes in the same review. Anderson
laughs. &quot;More surprising to me than anything is something like <i>The New
York Times</i> review, which says, it's a masterpiece for two hours and then
this fucking singing happens. And I'm thinking, you know, the singing is not
that fucking crazy. For me, once they sing, the movie becomes so much more
traditional, the camera doesn't move as much, people are having conversations,
it's picking up the pieces of the first two hours. But, I'm loving this kind of
critical polarity. It's the first time it's happened to me and I'm actually
getting off on it a little bit.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I
ask him about some of his choices for <i>Magnolia</i>, which is dense with
symbolism and populated by grief-stricken and shell-shocked characters. He was
inspired in part by his close friendship with John C. Reilly, who plays the LA
cop Jim Kurring. &quot;That stuff,&quot; he remembers, &quot;happened about
three or four years ago, during one summer when we were really bored, and he had
grown a mustache and it just made me laugh. He would do this character, this guy
who was on <i>Cops</i>, and I had a video camera and we'd drive around and
improvise, and call up actors who weren't working at the time, so we'd call up
Phil Hoffman and say, go to Moore Park and fuck with the trash cans and we'll
drive by in ten minutes and catch you doing it. Then we got a cop uniform and
improvised all these altercations. And eventually I started writing all that
stuff down. A lot of Jim's dialogue is based on that improvisation, like the
Mike Leigh style. It really is a pretty fucking cool way to work. We've gotta
try that again.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For
the subplot involving black characters -- Marcy and her aspiring MC grandson
Worm -- Anderson notes that originally, &quot;there was more of that, and I took
it out, but here's the thing. I stand by the fact that it does function really
well the way it is now. It is the most truncated and elliptical bit of the
movie, but I thank God that there is something truncated and elliptical in the
movie, which does pretty much hit its points. The movie needs something that has
mystery, and this one is sort of a representation of spending a couple of days
in the Valley: that's how much color would come into your life.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Anderson
is plainly thrilled to work with all his actors -- Julianne Moore, Philip Baker
Hall, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Melora Walters, William H. Macy, Alfred Molina --
many of whom have appeared in one or both of the previous films and are close
friends. He sees them as forming a &quot;family&quot; that helps to insulate
against industry stresses and expectations. He's also not surprised that Tom
Cruise's role, as the outrageous &quot;Seduce and Destroy&quot; pitchman Frank
T.J. Mackey, is garnering the actor all kinds of attention. &quot;Tom's part is
the showcase part, the smorgasbord for an actor. You get to say 'cunt' and you
get to cry at your daddy's bedside, and get redeemed at the end.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
Mackey is only the most sensational aspect of a theme pervading the film,
damaged children. Anderson adds that this is connected to another concept --
fathers nearing the ends of their lives, now suffering for their past sins.
While this general idea may sound familiar, in <i>Magnolia</i>, it doesn't look
quite like anything you've seen before. Anderson asserts, &quot;It feels like
the sort of thing that comes out of men. Don't they seem like the best vehicle
for that kind of fucking regret? I mean, it's all fun and games until someone
gets hurt.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
film shows costs as well as laments. I wonder about the dead dog, for instance
[a dog who dies at the same moment that his owner does, such that the tragedy of
the man's demise is punctuated by a semi-comic and totally surreal event, and
such that the two bodies are carted out simultaneously on matching gurneys].
Anderson says of this episode, &quot;When I wrote it, I thought, what exactly is
this saying? So I decided to leave it alone. And then, ironically enough, <i>Something
About Mary</i> came out and there's all that wacky, funny dead dog shit going on
in that movie, which actually propelled me to not worry about it anymore and
really do it for real. I felt some beautiful dead-dog power touching my
shoulder, saying, 'No, really. Just do it. You have some kind of weird reasons
that are okay.'&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Anderson's
faith in higher powers stretches into a willingness to roll with ideas that come
to him and his many friends and collaborators, no matter how strange these ideas
might seem at first. He recalls that his friendship with Aimee Mann generated
early versions of characters and situations. Anderson calls Mann &quot;kind of
the start of it. By which I mean, I had a lot of ideas floating around in my
head, probably too many ideas, and she's a really good friend of mine, and was
privy to stuff she was working on. It was great to have her music as a thing to
latch on to, to help corral all the stuff that was sort of circling around in my
brain. So I wanted to just adapt Aimee's songs, like you would adapt a book or a
play. It certainly branched off from there and didn't become a direct adaptation
of her songs, but I ended up stealing many lines from her, first and foremost,
&quot;Now that I've met you would you object to never seeing me again?&quot;
That's the first song of Aimee's song, &quot;Deathly.&quot; And the whole story
of Claudia [played by Melora Walters] was born out of that.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Related
to this collaboration is the now legendary story of Mann's troubles with record
labels -- Imago collapsed just as it released her first album, a second was
released two years late, and then Geffen and Interscope (once they merged)
decided not to release her last album when she wouldn't come up with a &quot;hit
single&quot; on demand. Working with producer Jon Brion (who did the other music
for <i>Magnolia</i>), Mann has now released the <i>Magnolia</i> songs on a CD,
some of which were originally recorded for that still-unreleased album, <i>Bachelor
No. 2</i>. Anderson says that he admires Mann's resistance (after the label's
&quot;abuse,&quot; he notes as well &quot;Aimee's kind of abuse back, in a noble
way&quot;). He says that his knowing all that history informed some of the
songs' translations into characters, and he feels lucky that he was able to work
without similar demands from New Line, who backed his project. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;It's
so weird,&quot; he observes, &quot;that it's a contrast like that because movies
cost so much fucking money. But I actually think that's why situations like
Aimee's arise, because it only cost $100,000 to make a record, so they will look
at you and tell you to go fuck yourself so fast, you're like, what just
happened? And they're thinking, $100,000 doesn't mean anything to us, which is
why these corporations won' t take any shit from you. But the funny thing is,
with movies, they cost so much money, that at a certain point, once you start in
production, they're kind of at the mercy of the people making the movie.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still,
Anderson won't be straying too far from the music industry any time soon, given
that his girlfriend is Fiona Apple, who helped with music for the film, and for
whom he has now directed three videos, including last year's &quot;Fast As You
Can,&quot; and the upcoming &quot;Limp.&quot; While they like working together
and obviously benefiting from it, he says that they're aware of the super-couple
stigma. He says they are consciously &quot;trying to keep a slightly low profile
because we realize that <i>we</i> would hate us. We want to stick to the work. I
wanted to direct Fiona Apple videos before I went out with Fiona, so generally
what we do is do cool videos together and keep our mouths shut about them.&quot;
