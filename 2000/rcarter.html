            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Watching the current remake of
            the 1970 British classic <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Get
            Carter</i> is like eating a piece of chocolate-covered broccoli:
            these two &quot;great tastes&quot; do not &quot;taste great&quot;
            together. The remake is nothing more than a grim story about a
            gangster investigating his brother’s death laced with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Touched
            by an Angel</i> sentimentality.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The 2000 version gets off to a bad
            start and, unlike its protagonist, never recovers. The original
            theme music mixes badly with director Stephen Kay’s (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Last Time I Committed Suicide</i>) MTV-indebted visuals.
            Stallone’s muscular physique, shades, tattoos and goatee beard
            might intimidate some, but his brooding attitude seems all wrong.
            Unlike his mushmouthed peer, Arnold Schwartzenegger (who radiates a
            confident charisma that makes up for missing dramatic chops),
            Stallone constantly seems to have to prove his toughness. In the
            process, he comes across like a muscle-bound geek. The acting skills
            he demonstrated in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Copland</i>
            are almost never in evidence here.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s a rare occurrence when a
            movie’s leading man is continually upstaged by entire supporting
            cast, but that’s exactly what happens in the &quot;Millenium
            Edition&quot; of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Get Carter</i>.
            When Jack Carter (Stallone) finds out that his clean-living brother
            has died mysteriously in a messy drunk driving incident, he heads to
            Seattle to pay his respects. The ideal picture Jack envisioned of
            his brother’s life is not matching with the facts. Jack’s
            widowed sister-in-law (a sadly underutilized Miranda Richardson)
            admits to having differences with her husband and is barely on
            speaking terms with her daughter (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">She’s
            All That</i>’s Rachel Leigh Cook). His late brother’s bar is
            co-owned by an evasive fellow (the original Jack Carter, Michael
            Caine), who never gives Jack the details he requests. The gangster
            quickly discovers that Seattle can be just as corrupt as his
            hometown, Las Vegas. There’s a cyber-porn racket run by an
            ex-gangster (Mickey Roarke) and secretly financed by a wimpy
            computer tycoon (Alan Cumming). All of these people are hiding
            something, and Jack finds himself carrying the double burden of
            playing detective and staying alive as both Vegas and Seattle thugs
            try to do him in.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With all of this activity, it’s
            hard to think of another movie where danger has looked more boring.
            The original film had a gritty, realistic feel that made the
            outbursts of violence seem more shocking. When writer-director Mike
            Hodges (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Croupier</i>) adapted
            Ted Lewis’ novel for the 1970 version, he changed the amorphous
            setting to Newcastle, England. As a result, the dense rundown
            atmosphere gave the story an entirely new level of tension. Hodges
            captured the city so well, that a viewer feels like he or she can
            find their way around the town without having to use a map. In the
            new version, screenwriter David McKenna (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">American
            History X</i> and the insufferable <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Body
            Shots</i>) moves the backdrop to the Space Needle City and reveals:</font></p>
            <ul>
              <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">It rains a lot there.</font></li>
              <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">King County residents drink lots of
                lattes.</font></li>
              <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Many cyber geeks call Seattle
                home.</font></li>
              <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">The community’s computer tycoons accumulated their wealth through unseemly means.</font></li>
            </ul>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Because it dwells in a
            stereotypical version of the city (that could have been written by
            anyone who had never set foot in the city), <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Get
            Carter</i> is never believable or involving. Kay edits and shoots
            the movie in a stylized &quot;I want to John Woo when I grow
            up&quot; mode that makes everything seem even more phony. McKenna
            makes things even worse by plagiarizing many of Hodges’ best
            lines. Caine’s bitter unrepentant attitude made the hard lines
            frightening. When Cain describes another man’s eyes as looking
            like &quot;p**s holes in the snow, a viewer recoils in fear. When
            Stallone flatly mumbles, &quot;cat p**s in the snow,&quot; one
            giggles. Casting Caine in the new movie,only reminds us that, even
            after all of these years, he is more intimidating and charming on
            screen than Stallone will ever be.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The new version follows the
            previous storyline closely. This is another mistake because Hodges
            used the early portions of his version to soften up the audience
            before he went in for the kill. Kay attempts to make an action film
            out of this story, but the slow pace, and his sloppy staging blunt
            his efforts. Kay comes up with dozens of gorgeous blue-tinted
            images, but he can’t edit car chases to save his life. Even when
            there are only two vehicles, these scenes are hard to follow.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The executives who backed this
            movie can be understood for wanting to change Hodges’ grim tale
            into a crowd-pleaser. Why back a big-budget movie that will alienate
            squeamish viewers like the 1970-version did? Unfortunately, by
            taking away Jack Carter’s meanness and unquenchable libido (the
            original featured a delightfully ghastly scene where Caine has phone
            sex with one woman as another sits in front of him), the new movie
            reduces him to a boring thug. Without the morbidity, there’s not
            enough action or anything else to hold one’s interest. The
            original film, despite its grit, pleased enough people to have a
            cult following and to be voted by the British Film Institute as the
            sixteenth best British film ever made (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Third Man</i> was number one). The new film pleases no one.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There is a silver lining here.
            Hodge’s original has just come out on a stacked DVD, so that
            viewers can finally see <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Get Carter</i> in its widescreen glory and can even listen to Hodges’
            audio commentary. The new version of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Get
            Carter</i> should get lost.</font>
