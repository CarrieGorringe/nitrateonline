            image of lanky, boyishly handsome Will Smith sauntering through the
            misty dark toward the camera is no doubt a lovely one, but it bodes
            all kinds of ill for director Robert Redford's new movie. Like his <i>A
            River Runs Through It</i> and <i>The Milagro Beanfield War</i>, <i>The
            Legend of Bagger Vance</i> explores the beauties of nature and
            mysteries of human faith, while smoothing over any potential rough
            spots with a romantic, pretty-to-think-so haze (not unlike that
            calculated mist that makes Smith look so good on his entrance into
            the picture). To ensure this transcendent effect, the films tend to
            remove their protagonists from history except in the most general
            sense. That is, they live in a fairy tale dressed up as a kind of
            hopeful social commentary. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            <i>The Legend of Bagger Vance</i>, the cabalistic caddie Bagger
            (Smith) and golfer Rannulph Junuh (Matt Damon) live in an
            exceedingly pleasant (and exceedingly unreal) version of
            Depression-era Savannah, Georgia. Here the town is transformed into
            a prejudice-less paradise, where everyone -- white and black -- gets
            along because everyone <i>loves</i> Savannah and wants to see
            &quot;her people&quot; thriving. While only one of &quot;her
            people&quot; actually talks about this shared vision in the film, it
            does get a lot of visual support, in the form of interracial crowds
            cheering for, of all things, a golf tournament. Who knew? The folks
            in Depression-era Savannah just love golf. The film never actually
            suggests that they can afford to play it, or even that they want to,
            but their devotion to the game is a practical conceit, premised on
            and filtered through the narrator's own devotion to &quot;the
            greatest game there is.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            movie opens as Hardy Greaves (Jack Lemmon) is in mid-coronary on a
            golf course, his voice-over indicates that he's self-conscious about
            his obsession with the game: &quot;As my wife used to ask before she
            passed on, 'Why do I play a game that seems destined to kill
            me?'&quot; He then spends some 127 minutes telling you why. As the
            camera cranes up and out, the shot dissolves from old Hardy
            clutching his chest on the green grass and re-opens on a
            scrappy-looking, ten-year-old Hardy (J. Michael Moncrief), sneaking
            onto a golf course and hitting a ball into a group of paying
            players, who scatter when he calls out, &quot;Four!&quot; One gets
            bopped on the head anyway, as Hardy scrambles back through the fence
            that's intended to keep him out. </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At
            such moments, the film's nostalgia gets a bit dicey. It's clear that
            young Hardy can't afford to be a member (his father has lost his
            business and is now sweeping Savannah's streets, much to the boy's
            embarrassment), and it goes without saying that the club doesn't
            admit minorities. But the film works hard to present its story as a
            thrilling, enchanted moment, which only happens to coincide with
            golf's long history of exclusivity and intolerance. And so, <i>The
            Legend of Bagger Vance</i> will show black workers and working-class
            golf fans, but only as means to make to the game seem
            &quot;universally&quot; accessible and meaningful, a route to
            spiritual enlightenment and harmony with all things. The story that
            Heart-Attacked Hardy tells is a fable structured as his
            recollections of a momentous exhibition match in Savannah. Enhanced
            by Michael Ballhaus' ravishing golden-light-filtered cinematography,
            this match involves three players -- real-life legends Bobby Jones
            (Joel Gretsch, who looks remarkably like Redford playing Gatsby) and
            Walter Hagen (Bruce McGill), and metaphorical zen-of-golf disciple
            Rannulph. As Hardy has it, Rannulph is something of a tragic figure,
            having been a prodigious golf talent and well-liked young fellow,
            who &quot;lost his swing&quot; (as well as his ability to sleep at
            night) on the frontlines during WWI: in a scene that takes about two
            minutes, you see him survive a battle that kills everyone else in
            his company. </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Feeling
            guilty and shell-shocked, Rannulph returns home to Savannah and for
            some ten years, avoids everyone he knew before, including his
            glamorous debutante girlfriend Miss Adele (Charlize Theron). But
            young Hardy, inspired by his daddy's tales of Rannulph's former
            brilliance, keeps track of his idol's whereabouts -- namely, playing
            cards with a bunch of guys, in the old servants' quarters on his
            estate (it's not clear if they work there or not): you may recall a
            similar scene at the start of <i>Tin Cup</i>, which serves the same
            purpose, to align its uncommonly talented hero with the common
            (read: black) folk. When Adele organizes the aforementioned
            exhibition tournament in an effort to salvage her dead daddy's
            dream, the Krewe Island Golf Resort, Hardy pleads with Hardy to
            represent Savannah against Jones and Hagen. The class hierarchy here
            becomes particularly interesting, not to say twisted. Jones comes
            off as the classic Golden Boy, a practicing lawyer and brilliant
            golfer who makes everything look easy, while Hagen is more worldly,
            ambitious, and showy, a self-conscious entrepreneur who plays for
            the money; he smokes cigarettes and arrives at the tournament each
            day in an expensive car with an exotic, be-turbaned caddy. Which
            leaves Rannulph to play the sympathetic, (relatively) underfunded
            underdog, suggested by his wearing long pants instead of fancy
            knickers like the others. </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Most
            importantly for this effect, Rannulph is attended by Bagger Vance,
            always dressed in the same well-worn jacket and hat to mark his
            down-homie goodness. Bagger shows up just in time to inspire
            Rannulph to play -- he just happens to be out strolling on
            Rannulph's property on that fateful misty evening, at the precise
            moment the golfer is despairing over his lost swing. Charismatic,
            slow-talking, and not a little beguiling, Bagger sets himself on his
            raggedy suitcase, watches poor Rannulph hit the ball badly, then
            delivers the first of several sermons on the philosophy of golf:
            &quot;The rhythm of the game is just like the rhythm of life.&quot;
            Hallelujah and amen. The rest of the film essentially comprises a
            series of similar scenes wherein Bagger is advising Rannulph over
            two long days of play – thirty-six holes a day -- and oh yeah,
            carrying Rannulph's bag.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For
            all the magic Smith works -- and he is a tremendously charming and
            increasingly skilled performer -- at this point the film drops right
            off the okay-scale, into that &quot;What were they thinking?&quot;
            void. First, the tournament that supposedly rallies Savannah's
            out-of-work community to cheer on the sidelines is really a scheme
            to recoup the rich white woman's fortune and induce her happy
            marriage to the recovered Rannulph (call it the American Dream --
            and to think, it's only seventy or so years after this film's period
            that Tiger Woods is able to claim a piece of that Dream for
            himself). Second, <i>The Legend of Bagger Vance</i> is a little too
            much like <i>The Green Mile</i> revisited, that is, the saga of a
            white man whose emotional and moral struggle is aided by a
            miraculously-appearing black man who's infinitely patient and wise,
            more angelic than human (apparently, the only way to conceive a
            non-threatening black man these days is as a spirit: see also <i>Bedazzled</i>,
            where a black angel arrives at the eleventh hour to save Brendan
            Fraser's soul). How fortunate it is that, in these desperate times,
            Bagger -- like John Coffy in <i>The Green Mile</i> -- has nothing
            better to do than help the white folks, so clearly in need of
            guidance and uplifting. Rannulph's worthiness is indicated by his
            ability to absorb Bagger's advice and get into that sports-movie
            zone, where the crowd noise fades out, the motion goes slow, and --
            when this &quot;being in the zone&quot; is most ecstatic -- the
            other characters literally disappear off the screen and all that
            lies before our hero is &quot;the field.&quot; </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Or
            better, <i>The Legend of Bagger Vance</i> is <i>The Green Mile</i>
            meets <i>The Natural</i>, another inspirational sports film starring
            young Robert Redford as a supernaturally talented baseball player.
            Here Damon plays the Natural and Smith plays Wonder Boy (that would
            be the bat). I remember once hearing Randy Newman talking about
            writing the score for <i>The Natural</i>, and how difficult it was
            to come up variations on the basic theme for Redford's repeated runs
            around the bases, after hitting numerous home runs. This movie has
            the same inclination to repeat its primary images and soaring
            musical accompaniment (scored by Rachel Portman) -- elegant swings,
            soaring balls -- which is, to an extent, understandable, because
            once Rannulph accepts Bagger as his personal savior, there's really
            only one way for it all to turn out. </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            predetermined (fated?) plot means that the bulk of the movie (and
            the tournament takes over an hour to unfold), is about displaying
            the landscaped perfection of the golf course (showcased at pretty
            orange sunrises and sunsets, and in-between), slight shifts in
            weather (sunny to windy to nighttime), and the crowd's reaction
            shots, all approximating what Bagger calls &quot;the rhythm of the
            game.&quot; This rhythm, of course, has a very specific trajectory:
            Rannulph's deliverance into self-love and the love of his good
            woman, enabled by the love of his uncanny caddy. Of course, the fact
            that he's so torn up over a calamity that wasn't even his fault
            means that Rannulph is just a good man waiting to happen. Bagger's
            sage commentary -- &quot;You can't make that ball go anywhere, you
            got to let it,&quot; &quot;You got to find your one true authentic
            swing,&quot; and (my favorite) &quot;Don't think about it, feel
            it&quot; -- is only supportive, not instructive per se. At night,
            when Rannulph heads into the clubhouse for drinks, Bagger... well,
            who knows where he goes. During the days, Bagger mostly stays out
            the way, smiling and nodding at the white folks' competitive and
            romantic antics, until he sees that Rannulph needs a little
            provocation, whereupon he suggests that Rannulph &quot;lay down
            [his] burden&quot; and &quot;play the game.&quot; </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            while Bagger keeps reminding Rannulph that it is, after all, just a
            game, you do have to wonder exactly how he (Bagger) might be
            comprehending the racial dynamics the film can't help but show but
            also can't afford to address. Granted, it's not fair to bring a
            twenty-first-century sensibility to reading a historical situation,
            but this historical situation is considerably cleaned up, no matter
            how you look at it. Bagger, well, he just keeps on advising and
            observing, with his mere presence marking Rannulph's specialness,
            his moral righteousness. With Bagger by his side, Rannulph passes as
            a &quot;working man's&quot; golfer, except if you remember that
            amazing spread of property he's got or the fact that he's been
            living for ten years without a job. But I'm nitpicking. Legends
            serve broad cultural functions: revising the past, they make the
            present look less ominous. <i>The Legend of Bagger Vance</i> does
            just that -- as long as you don't think about it. <o:p>
