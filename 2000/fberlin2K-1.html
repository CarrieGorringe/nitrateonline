<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Berlin, Germany
(08 February) With about sixteen hours to go until the doors open for
registration, the sounds of hammering and drilling -- not to mention the sizzle
and flash of a guy soldering something on an elevated staircase -- echo about
the massive Berlinale-Palast, which houses the 1,600-seat competition theater
and the new press center. The phones have yet to be hooked up in the retooled
market hall, which occupies the entire ground floor of the DaimlerChrysler
Building, but these last-minute adjustments and delays haven’t dampened the
enthusiasm of the hard-working festival staff, not to mention everyone who will
arrive over the next couple of days (the festival opens 09 February) to see for
themselves just how one of the biggest film festivals in the world engineers a
full-scale move across town.</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Fest-goers know what to expect from the Berlin
International Film Festival: precise administration and the seemingly effortless
mounting of some 240 films (a total of 700 shows) on literally dozens of
screens. And everyone who comes here either has, or soon develops, a social
routine revolving around a favorite restaurant, sweet shop, coffeehouse and/or
pub along the fading Ku-damm and in the area around the Zoo station. What’s a
big mystery to all, however, are the locations, traffic patterns and meeting
spots in the spanking new Potsdammer Platz complex, which now hosts the bulk of
the festival. Formerly the commercial center of the city, the area peaked in the
1920s and was flattened during World War II. A veritable no-man’s land during
the Cold War, the area is in the process of being rebuilt, and resembles from a
distance nothing so much as an Oz for the new movie millennium, albeit one
surrounded by muddy fields and cranes instead of poppies. So everyone starts
over again from scratch, building time in already harried days for the
relatively pleasant U-Bahn trip (the route of which would have been impossible
just ten short years ago), a shuttle bus that makes the rounds of the hotels in
the west, or a taxi. Those adventurous enough to book a hotel room in the former
east will be quizzed on the quality of their lodgings as well as the available
nightlife along the Unter den Linden and Friedrichstrasse, not to mention the
up-and-coming new Mitte district.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">09 February</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Surfing the learning curve seems to be distracting nearly
everyone in one way or the other from the real reason of the trip: the movies.
Perhaps in part for this reason the inaugural afternoon press showing of Wim
Wenders’ new film <i>The Million Dollar Hotel</i> is greeted with respectful
but muted applause. Of course, this reaction could also have something to do
with the nature of the movie, which is a visionary technical achievement but an
emotionally abstract and challenging story set among a group of losers in a
run-down Los Angeles flophouse. As anxious as the critics were to get into the
new cinema, they were just as eager to get out again -- a situation providing
some comic relief as everyone attempted to navigate the unusual dead-end aisles
of the multi-level theater. The press conference is unusually chaotic, with
photographers refusing to sit down, Wenders and co-writer Bono of the pop group
U2 going on about the gestation of the movie and co-stars Peter Stormare and
Gloria Stuart arriving late to the dais. Still, there was a palpable sense of
something new -- if chaotic -- in the air.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And so it will go, through the remaining 11 days of Berlin.
The organization of the films themselves is relatively unchanged. In addition to
the aforementioned Wenders, the competition section features anticipated new
works from Zhang Yimou, Francois Ozon, Andrzej Wajda, Bruno Barreto, and local
heroes Volker Schlondorff and Rudolf Thome. The American presence here is
particularly strong, with European premieres of David O. Russell’s <i>Three
Kings</i> (complete with the presence of Ice Cube, Mark Wahlberg and George
Clooney at the press conference), Danny Boyle’s <i>The Beach</i> (or, as one
wag dubbed it, <i>Lord of the Flaws</i>), Jonathan Nossiter’s <i>Signs and
Wonders</i>, <i>The Talented Mr. Ripley</i>, <i>Magnolia</i>, <i>The Hurricane</i>,
<i>Man on the Moon</i> and, believe it or not, <i>Any Given Sunday</i> (American
football is growing in popularity here). Berlin has developed a reputation
recently for having a crystal ball when it comes to programming films that to on
to receive Oscar nominations, so this lineup could be a sneak look at next
week’s nominations.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">On paper, the Panorama section looks particularly exciting,
with lower-profile films that promise interesting stylistic and narrative
twists. Now in its 30<sup>th</sup> year, the Forum of New Cinema offers a survey
of the most cutting edge work from around the world. The New German Cinema
sidebar brings accredited guests up to speed with film developments in the host
country’s national industry. There are mini-tributes to French actress Jeanne
Moreau and American icon Robert De Niro; an odd but frankly fascinating
retrospective called “Artificial Beings and Manic Machines” featuring a
historical survey of such films from <i>Der Golem</i> to <i>The Terminator</i>;
and the Kinderfilmfest, the annual international gathering of children and
kid-themed movies that this year has taken over the Zoo Palast, which for years
was the flagship cinema of the festival as a whole.</font></p>
