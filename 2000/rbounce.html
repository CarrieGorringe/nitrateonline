            not a little creepy that airplane crashes are providing fodder for
            popular feature films these days (see <i>Fearless</i>, <i>Random
            Hearts</i>, and <i>Final Destination</i>). But it's also no
            surprise, given how hugely they loom in the popular, mass-mediated
            imagination, as a sign of fate and the lack of control anyone might
            have over his or her life. Still, as a route to conventional movie
            romance, airplane crashes are just a bit preposterous (ask Harrison
            Ford). The primary function of the crash appears to be that it
            provides survivors with the chance to reevaluate their lives,
            rethink their ambitions and values, or do good in the world. Or, in
            more mundane movie-plot terms, they are prodded to seek romance. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It
            may be that, at some point in its concept-to-product trajectory, <i>Bounce</i>
            was less conventional than it has turned out to be. Granted, it was
            probably never as acerbic and wondrously strange as writer-director
            Don Roos's first feature, <i>The Opposite of Sex</i>, but then, he's
            said (in <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>, so it <b>must</b> be true)
            that he wanted specifically to make a &quot;straight&quot; movie to
            avoid being &quot;ghettoized&quot; for his &quot;gay&quot; work,
            namely, his well-received scripts for <i>Boys on the Side</i> and <i>Single
            White Female</i>, as well as <i>The Opposite of Sex</i>. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><i><font size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Bounce</span></font></span></font></i><font size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
            is that straight movie, sort of. It's straight in the sense that it
            stars Ben Affleck and Gwyneth Paltrow, and does not include <i>Opposite
            of Sex</i>-style bitchiness, much less wily jokes about
            masturbation, Hollywood morality, and the Planet Maturia. It's also
            straight in the sense that it delivers to formulaic romance
            expectations: the two beautiful leads meet, fall in love, fight and
            make up, and there's never a doubt during all this that they are
            fated to be together: as male lead says to female lead, he's looking
            for a &quot;last call of the day&quot; (um, blecch). And it's
            straight in the sense that, aside from the above awful line and the
            fact that he appears to be stalking her (more on that little plot
            point below), these two characters are going through familiarly
            bland motions: someone has to, it might as well be them. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></span></font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Such
            adherence to straight conventions, however, is <i>Bounce</i>'s
            draggiest, least interesting aspect. That is to say, when it does
            veer even slightly from the line -- most obviously in the secondary
            characters -- it becomes more interesting, but definitely not a
            straight romance. The plot is more or less what you'd imagine for a
            movie starring such Hollywood anointeds. As Buddy Amaral, a
            smooth-talking LA-based ad exec, Affleck looks very pretty in
            Giorgio Armani, and as Abby, the mother of two young boys, Paltrow
            is lovely as ever, even if she is dressed (relatively) down, in
            brown hair and blue jeans. At their initial encounter, he's a
            recovering alcoholic and womanizer, and she's recovering from the
            year-ago death of her wonderfully devoted husband Greg (Tony Goldwyn).
            But I'm getting ahead of myself: the movie actually begins that year
            before, at O'Hare, where flights are -- surprise -- delayed. Buddy's
            talking his way into the bed of a Dallas exec (Natasha Henstridge)
            he's just met in the airport bar, when his progress is briefly
            interrupted by Greg's distracting and earnest nice-guyness. Yadda
            yadda. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            upshot is that Buddy gives his ticket home to Greg, who's anxious to
            get back to his Wife-And-Kids. The plane crashes. Buddy feels guilty
            and drinks to excess. His breakdown - meant to signal that he does
            have a conscience, despite all prior evidence to the contrary -- is
            marked by the film's one truly obnoxious and weird moment: after
            months of hiding out and drinking in his gorgeous beachfront home,
            Buddy attends a Clio Awards ceremony, where his advertising firm is
            honored for its cynically corny, self-ennobling we-honor-the-dead
            campaign for Infinity Airlines (the very airline that should be <b>sorry</b>
            because it &quot;crashed the plane,&quot; as Buddy puts it while
            watching the ads on tv at home). Drunk when he steps up to accept
            the award, Buddy says what's on what's left of his mind, upsetting
            the La-La-Land natives and getting himself trucked off to a Palm
            Springs rehab center. On his release, Buddy finds his non-partying,
            business-focused life profoundly unfulfilling, and so he decides to
            track down Greg's widow, to &quot;make sure she's okay.&quot; <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Buddy's
            journey to emotional health (represented by his eventual
            relationship with Abby, of course), is fraught with dully
            predictable plot devices and leavened by occasionally witty
            observations from his assistant and fellow recovering addict, Seth
            (Johnny Galecki, excellent in <i>Roseanne</i> and <i>The Opposite of
            Sex</i>). At first, the obnoxious and insightful Seth entertainingly
            slaps down Buddy's smarty-pants, class-based self-delusions, but
            he's soon reduced to the more routine role of gay sidekick, soon
            serving only to root on his boss's relationship with the endearingly
            fumbly real estate lady. (Sigh: this reduction is apparently an
            effect of the editing suggestions from the Miramax people, who,
            according to Roos, were bound and determined to cut back on all non-Benneth
            scenes, including those featuring Galecki and an airline employee
            played by Jennifer Gray, on screen for about five minutes total.) <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Abby's
            new gig, which she has apparently taken up due to her sudden
            single-motherhood, provides Buddy with a convenient way to meet her,
            as he &quot;happens&quot; by a building she's ineptly trying to
            sell. Because his partner Jim (Joe Morton, most definitely from
            another planet here, as the token black character in this movie's
            LA) is looking to expand their ad-biz into a larger building, Buddy
            secretly throws Abby a prime deal, which she handles amazingly well;
            in turn she invites him to a Dodgers game (whatta gal), and from
            there, it's clear what will happen. the only catch is the same one
            that plagued David Duchovny in Bonnie Hunt's <i>Return to Me</i>:
            Buddy knows who Abby is and why he's &quot;accidentally&quot; met
            her, but she knows nothing. <i>Bounce</i> actually underlines this
            knowledge differential, by showing Buddy as he watches Abby from a
            distance, sitting in his car, lurking across the street, arranging
            the real estate deal for her without telling her how or why: His
            manipulations might be understood as well-intentioned and -- once
            the wheels are in motion, so to speak -- inadvertent, but I can also
            understand her horror when she finds out that he did indeed know her
            dead husband. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">One
            of the film's many conventions is that Abby has a loyal and wise
            (and not as pretty as Abby) Best Friend who advises her to forgive
            herself for Greg's death and to move on, for the sake of her
            children, and to accept Buddy even if he's imperfect or, more to the
            point, not-Greg. Slightly less conventional is Buddy's buddy, Jim,
            who turns out to be a Not Very Good Friend, more interested in
            preserving their business than in Buddy's emotional health. I
            suppose this might excuse Buddy's generally bad behavior, his
            inability to fess up, though I think the more apparent reason is
            that if he told Abby who he was, the movie would be over, since the
            primary straight-romance convention is that when the couple commits,
            the movie is over. And so, Buddy puts off telling Abby the truth
            about his initial interest in her, so you can observe them falling
            in love and spending quality mommy-and-daddy-time with her two
            precious sons. As per formula, you worry. Oh dear, what will happen
            when the other shoe drops? <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's
            hard to say precisely why this sort of melodrama is appealing, or
            rather, to whom it appeals. Surely, watching an on-screen version of
            the off-screen chemistry between two attractive and famous young
            people has a certain allure, but watching <i>Entertainment Tonight</i>
            or reading <i>People</i> magazine offers at least as much pleasure,
            and for considerably less investment. The film's overt manipulations
            aren't so awful in and of themselves: at least, you might say, it's
            upfront about the games it's playing. And this may be the most
            salient and saddest observation offered by <i>Bounce</i>: that the
            games in non-ghettoized movies are by definition obvious and
            predictable. <o:p>
