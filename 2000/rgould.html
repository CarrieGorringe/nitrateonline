<p class="MsoBodyText"><font size="5"><b>F</b></font><font size="4">or his third
time round the directorial merry-go-round, Stanley Tucci has once more grabbed a
brass ring, spinning a self-immersed, character-driven tale of a flinty mad
hatter and the man who would be his storyteller. Based on two Joseph Mitchell <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">New Yorker</span></i><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"> </b>articles,
“Professor Sea Gull” and “Joe Gould’s Secret,” the seminal writer
himself now becomes one of the central ingredients in this glorious biographical
homage to one of Manhattan’s more unusual street characters, the other,
titular Joe that was a pavement-ranting intellectual and welcomed -- albeit
disheveled -- party crasher celebrated during the 1940s and 1950s. Tucci, who
fills the author’s shoes onscreen while co-producing and directing Howard A.
Rodman’s subtly crafted script, continues to create endearing cinematic gems
that, regretfully, have yet to find a wide audience. (Shame on you! At least go
out and rent the videos!)</font><o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Graduating from fine Italian food and romantic frolics (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Big
Night</i>) to sea-bound slapstick farce (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
Impostors</i>) to this new period homage, Tucci continues to focus on a
loose-knit group of strong individuals and theatrical-based innocence. His first
film, co-directed with Campbell Scott, focused on New Jersey shore
restauranteurs playing out their own version of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Waiting
for Godot</i>, while <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Impostors</i> was
Tucci’s most obvious stage-driven effort, skipping from an evocative New York
background to the break-away sets and painted-ocean cycloramas when the Marx
Brothers action and mad cap cast move overboard. Even with the Big Apple as his
canvas, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Joe Gould’s Secret</i> feels
like a confined drama; a handout at a preview points out the various hangouts on
lower East Side map, in much the way a playbill would note scenes in a Broadway
(on- or, as this film is more akin, off-) production. As a historical setpiece,
Tucci keeps much of his focus close-up, allowing for production designer Andrew
Jackness to exquisitely set the tone through small details. Director of
Photography Maryse Alberti has wonderfully captured the intimate Formica times
and faces riding about the subways and passing in the streets, while makeup and
costumes summon forth visions of Technicolor Christmases past.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The soft-spoken Mitchell is a workaholic writer whose
North Carolina drawl often gets tongue tied in the simplest conversation. He and
his doting wife Therese, an accomplished photographer of city life, both share
quality time with their two adorable girls (back in the simpler times when most
families ate meals together). Hope Davis doesn’t register as much screen time
as she deserves, but as a peripheral character she’s still a plus in any film.
Susan Sarandon and Steve Martin lend their names to the cast, but their roles,
as artist Alice Neel and publisher Charlie Duell, are effective, but fleeting.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Tucci, as co-star, plays a nebbishy Dr. Frankenstein who
discovers that his pen has wrought a two-edged sword. In search of inner
satisfaction he fathoms up the initial profile of penniless Joseph Ferdinand
Gould, and his subject becomes eternally grateful in monstrously thorny
proportions, staking out the New Yorker office in wait for his “biographer”
and fan mail filled with dollar bills, or calling him at home late at night,
rousing the family from sleep. Mitchell all but throws up his arms in disgust,
“Woe is me!” In the end, the writer becomes a haunted soul suffering in the
wake of his lost muse. His second piece on Gould would appear a few years after
the Bohemian’s death at a Long Island mental hospital; it was the last article
he wrote for the magazine, although he stalked their hallways for thirty more
years. Perhaps it would have been an interesting sidebar to delve into Joe
Mitchell’s secret (rather than learning this information as an end credit
postscript), but then the story’s about someone else<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Yes, the ultimate star, hands down (and dirty) is Sir Ian
Holm as the borderline lunatic that many Greenwich Village regulars accepted as
an intellectual sidewalk sparkplug whose home and theater were the neighborhood
streets. It’s a bravado performance, one of the strongest of the year, that
fits him like a well-worn work glove: “I was born in a lunatic asylum, my
father was a psychiatrist and I have had a breakdown myself. I’m not attracted
to it, I’m actually scared about madness or how close to the edge most of us
are at any given time.” Gould is one of those New York originals --
infuriating, curmudgeonly, gracious, intelligent -- that his circle of art
patrons and acquaintances appear to handle well in small doses. As a shared,
broken-down commodity he’s a harmless entity, espousing a massive, mysterious
“oral history,” a collection of apparently hundreds of handwritten
composition ledgers containing well over a million words secreted around town in
friend’s apartments, or, perhaps, at a duck and chicken farm out in the
suburbs. Holm adds an edgy dimension that makes the character leap off the
screen. He smothers the role with obnoxious glee, just as Gould smothers a meal
or a bowl of soup in ketchup. The actor embraces the role with a repugnant
fascination -- a rascally Rasputin whose imagination is his only menace. At one
party he opens his fly and pulls out a rolled-up copy of <i><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">The New York Times</span></i>, the better to keep his crotch warm on cold
winter nights. Later he quiets the crowd with a ditty about Jesus and flies.<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Tucci has crafted an absorbing character study and Holm
has filled it like a grand, oversized, flea-ridden sofa. Life’s not perfect or
fair in Joe Gould’s world, but you can’t help but be fascinated.</p>
