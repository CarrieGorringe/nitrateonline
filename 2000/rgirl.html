            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>French director Patrice Leconte
            (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Hairdresser’s Husband</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Ridicule</i>)
            is one of the cinema’s most accomplished magicians. While showing
            only centimeters of skin, his movies have a powerful eroticism.
            Leconte can do more with a few well-placed closeups than most
            directors can with hours of feverish coupling. His movies are
            teaming with wit, style and endearingly odd characters. He can
            effortlessly juggle a film’s moods, alternating between tension
            and whimsy without missing a beat. In short, Leconte knows how to
            grab an audience’s attention and to hold it indefinitely.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Girl of the Bridge</i>,<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"> </i>his
            latest movie to come stateside, Leconte and screenwriter Serge
            Frydman features a couple that could only exist on the big screen.
            Vanessa Paradis stars as Adèle, a young woman whose relationship
            with men have so far amounted to little more than disappointing
            one-night stands. She describes her existence as being little more
            than a trip to a waiting room. The scene where she describes
            letdowns comes in a long one-take sequence that looks like a therapy
            session or an interrogation. It’s the sort of sequence that seems
            pretentious and dull in other flicks. In <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Girl on the Bridge</i>, however, Paradis makes Adèle seemed
            grounded and sympathetic instead of flighty and disgruntled.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>She may not be the brightest person on the planet, but her
            complaints are understandable.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Frustrated by her luck, Adèle
            stands on a bridge above the Seine, ready to leap into the river.
            Before she can make the jump, a strange man interrupts her. His
            admonitions not to jump seem unconvincing, but he begs her because
            he needs an assistant. His name is Gabor (Daniel Auteuil, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Eighth Day</i>), and he claims to haunt the bridges of Paris looking
            for women who are either brave or suicidal enough to be a target for
            his knife-throwing act. Unwilling to listen, Adèle leaps into the
            water, and Gabor swims after her.</font></p>
            <p style="text-indent:0in;line-height:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">They
            both escape from a suicide ward and discover that together a strange
            magic exists between them. Gabor’s hands become steadier and throw
            blades that continually miss Adèle, even if she’s hidden behind
            drape or strapped to a wheel. Furthermore, they develop a strange
            synergy with gambling. They can pick winning roulette and even
            raffle numbers with eerie consistency. Their charmed partnership
            does have its drawbacks, though. Adèle grows to love the morose but
            caring Gabor, she makes him jealous by continuing to unsuccessfully
            try her luck with other lovers. Nonetheless, the two have a
            telepathic bond that allows them to communicate over great distances
            and even through serious misfortunes.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With his ability to use actors’
            faces the way other filmmakers use cutting rooms and cameras,
            Leconte’s use of subtlety in acting is frequently more powerful
            than most filmmakers’ heavy-handedness. Auteuil, who won BAFTA and
            Cesar awards for his turn here, pulls on our emotions. His hangdog
            look is appropriately sympathetic, but it’s fascinating to watch a
            confident grin start to creep over his face as the film progresses.
            When he and Paradis steal away to have a private session of
            knife-throwing, the two gaze at each other with such longing that
            the sequence becomes a visceral treat and not a silly sexual
            metaphor.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Simultaneously, Leconte dazzles the
            eyes and senses.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Jean-Marie
            Dreujou’s deft black-and-white cinematography makes the exotic
            locations look otherworldly. The casinos have a gloss that would
            look garish in color, and it makes the fantastic nature of the story
            seem more credible. The director packs considerable tension, wit,
            and romance into the nearly ninety-minute running time for <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Girl on the Bridge</i>. The movie shifts from Paris to Monaco to
            Istanbul at lightning speed and never gets a chance to wear out its
            welcome.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It’s almost
            as if a 'thirties screwball comedy had made its way across the
            Atlantic.</font>
