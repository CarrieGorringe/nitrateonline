            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>The Crew</i> looks like a
            movie that started out its existence sickly and weak and then ended
            up having the life beaten out of it before the opening credits were
            even over, after which its remains are poked and prodded at with
            sticks for about ninety minutes in an effort to fool us into
            thinking that it was still alive. It doesn't work.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Richard Dreyfuss, Burt Reynolds,
            Dan Hedaya and a defeated-looking Seymour Cassel play one-time Mafia
            men who are now living out their retirement in the dull splendor of
            a residential hotel in Miami Beach. They decide to fake a gangland
            hit in the lobby of their building, using a John Doe corpse from the
            local morgue. The results not only bring them media attention and
            cause all the young yuppie whippersnappers to move out of the place
            and leave them in peace, but the corpse they used turns out to be
            that of an actual gang boss who had gone missing. In addition, a
            stripper (Jennifer Tilly) threatens to snitch on them unless the
            four men agree to rub out her stepmother (Lainie Kazan).<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This last plot element is cause for
            the worst gag sequence to come along in a movie since <i>Me, Myself
            and Irene</i> -- it involves a rat with a length of burning rag tied
            to its tail, and while I'm not overly fond of rats, I do mind seeing
            helpless animals burned alive onscreen for our enjoyment. The
            picture also has the ugliest-looking cinematography of any
            Hollywood-made film in years. The colors look as if the footage had
            been dipped in India ink and then hung out to dry, but the
            filmmakers also decided to film all the medium and close shots using
            wide-angle lenses, which distort the actors' faces while emphasizing
            all of their worst qualities. Normally, the director's prerogative
            is to at least make the actors look presentable. Jennifer Tilly
            looks as if she has been blown-up to resemble a giant-sized version
            of Tura Satana, the maniacal vixen in <i>Faster, Pussycat! Kill!
            Kill! </i>It is not flattering.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While an attempt to parody the
            famous continuous tracking shot through a nightclub in <i>Goodfellas</i>
            is fumbled, Carrie-Anne Moss, playing a police detective, does get
            to let loose with one of her <i>Matrix</i>-style kickboxing moves
            (and from a sitting position, at that). On the other hand, Richard
            Dreyfuss dunks Burt Reynolds' head in a toilet bowlful of water,
            then resuscitates him mouth-to-mouth -- just when you thought the
            sequence with the unfortunate rat was as bad as things were going to
            get in this flick</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is probably not going to be of
            any help to the director Michael Dinner, who did some auspicious
            work in <i>Heaven Help Us</i> and, especially, <i>Off Beat</i> in
            the 1980s before becoming ensnared in <i>Hot to Trot</i>, which was
            taken away from him and destroyed by its studio. That film was like
            watching something being stretched on a rack; this one is simply
            mirthless.</font>
