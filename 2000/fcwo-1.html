<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For
his first film after <i>2001: A Space Odyssey,</i> Kubrick had wanted to do the
life of Napoleon, about which he had done a prodigious amount of research. But
plans were already underway at that time to do a gigantic film about the battle
of Waterloo, to be directed by Sergei Bondarchuk, who had just done the
definitive film version of Tolstoy's <i>War and Peace.</i> Instead, probably
inspired by the success of such youth-oriented films as <i>Easy Rider</i> and
Michael Wadleigh's three-hour documentary on Woodstock, Kubrick turned his
attention to a 1964 novel by Anthony Burgess, whose depiction of a near-future
of decay and pessimism would stand in direct contrast to the optimism and
achievement of <i>2001.</i> <o:p>

<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">With
the news of the return of <i>Clockwork Orange, </i>London newspapers have
already published lengthy exegeses about the genesis of Burgess' novel,
Kubrick's filming of it, and the end results of both. Of how Burgess wrote <i>Clockwork
Orange </i>as one of a series of short novels intended to provide for his wife,
after he had been -- erroneously -- diagnosed with a fatal brain tumor. Of how
the novel was inspired in part by a horrific real-life incident where a group of
intruders broke into the Burgesses house and attacked his wife, causing her to
lose the baby she was pregnant with and leaving her with permanent psychological
scars. How Kubrick's film virtually revived Burgess' moribund writing career,
even though he had sold the film rights to <i>Clockwork Orange </i>for a
pittance to producers who then turned around and sold them to Kubrick for much,
much more, and how Kubrick filmed many sequences straight from the novel,
directly the way Burgess wrote them. <o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Clockwork
Orange </span></i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">was
released, with an &quot;X&quot; rating, in the U.S. in December, 1971, and was
one of four films spotlighted in <i>Time </i>magazine as examples of Hollywood's
idea for that year of yuletide cheer, the other three being <i>Dirty Harry,
Straw Dogs, </i>and Ken Russell's Twenties musical <i>The Boy Friend, </i>a
complete turnaround from Russell's earlier 1971 film release, <i>The Devils. </i>Only
<i>The Boy Friend </i>tanked with the movie-going public (which, at the time,
didn't know that around thirty minutes, and two whole production numbers, had
been yanked out of the film prior to its American release). <i>Dirty Harry </i>became
a huge popular success, while <i>Straw Dogs </i>and <i>Clockwork Orange </i>became
vituperative conversation pieces, films people went to see to find out if what
they had heard about them was true. <i>Clockwork Orange </i>won the New York
Film Critics Circle award for best picture of the year, and was named by the
Harvard <i>Lampoon </i>as the worst picture of 1971. Both the film and Kubrick
were nominated for Oscars, although Malcolm McDowell, who should have been
nominated for Best Actor for his portrayal of the film's protagonist, Alex, and
Walter Carlos, who provided the brilliant electronic interpretations of works by
Beethoven, Rossini, and Henry Purcell (the film's theme was from Purcell's <i>Music
for the Funeral of Queen Mary</i>), were passed over. <o:p>

<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">After
souping themselves up on drug-laced lactose at the Korova Milk Bar, young Alex
and his &quot;droogs&quot; are shown properly sharpened-up for an evening's
worth of &quot;the old ultra-violence.&quot; They beat up a transient on the
street who insults them. They also beat the stuffing out of a rival gang they
come across. Stealing a car, they merrily run other motorists off the road
before stopping at the house of a writer and his wife. Tricking their way in,
they beat and bind the writer and make him watch as they overpower and attack
his wife. Returning to his parents' flat, Alex curls up in bed with his pet
snake while listening to one of his favorite recordings of Beethoven, the only
pure thing in his life. <o:p>

</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Alex
is later arrested for murder, and, after the interrogating police beat the
stuffing out of him, is sent to prison. There, he manages to win his way into
being a volunteer for a new experimental treatment that is supposed to get
common thieves and murderers out of prison more expediently (the jail space
being needed by the current government-in-power for &quot;political
insurgents&quot;). The &quot;Ludovico technique,&quot; unfortunately, causes
Alex to become incapacitated whenever he experiences sexual or aggressive urges.
Released from prison, he is spurned and rebuked by everyone who knows him,
resulting in an incident that drives him to suicide. Alex survives, and the
media depicts him as the victim of enforced brainwashing. He is lauded. <o:p>

<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
1974, Kubrick quietly made arrangements with Warner Brothers for the film to be
withdrawn from distribution in the U.K. Kubrick never made plain why, but the
reasons for this may have had more to do with his increasing protectiveness
towards his sense of privacy than anything else. Kubrick had become increasingly
weary of the &quot;crackpot&quot; responses, both public and private, to <i>Clockwork
Orange. </i>He then went to Ireland to film <i>Barry Lyndon, </i>where he staged
the sequences showing 18th-century British redcoats engaged in battle during the
Seven Years War. The film's production office then was contacted by a member of
the British Intelligence Special Branch, informing them that Kubrick was a
potential target of the Irish Republican Army. Kubrick's direct response to this
is not recorded, but, according to his line producer for <i>Barry Lyndon, </i>Bernard
Williams, &quot;Stanley freaked.&quot; He returned to Great Britain immediately,
with the production following thereafter. At the same time, to quiet controversy
and, possibly, his nerves, Kubrick contacted Warners and asked that the London
theatrical run of <i>Clockwork Orange </i>be brought to a close. Kubrick would
make all his future films within driving distance of his estate residence,
Childwick Bury, which was heavily gated, had an elaborate security system, and
whose main house was invisible from the nearest road. <o:p>

<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
film then became completely unavailable in that country, and Warners, acting on
Kubrick's behalf, prosecuted every attempt to show it, the most recent being
1992, two years before Warners would release Oliver Stone's meditation on modern
day violence, <i>Natural Born Killers. </i>A brisk business in covert, bootleg
copies of the film on VHS and, later, multi-regional DVDs sprang up. In 1990,
the Royal Shakespeare Company produced a stage adaptation of Burgess' novel,
starring Phil Daniels as Alex and with original music by U2 members Bono and The
Edge. Figures dressed as Alex's &quot;droogs,&quot; wearing white with black
bowler hats, boots, and swagger sticks, could be seen riding to and fro on
trains in the London Underground. <o:p>

<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
the U.S., meanwhile, the film had long since been surpassed as the <i>ne plus
ultra</i> in screen violence -- <i>Last House on the Left, The Exorcist, </i>and
the entire slasher film cycle, to name a few -- and the film went on to make
appearances on cable television and video, while its MPAA rating was changed
from an &quot;X&quot; to an &quot;R.&quot; (I have seen the film under both
ratings, and have discerned no difference.) <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;There
was me, that is Alex, and my three droogs, that is Pete, Georgie, and
Dim....&quot; After a retina-searing burst of orange signaling the start of the
opening credits, Kubrick's film begins with one of the most famous images in
screen history: Malcolm McDowell's Alex DeLarge, head tilted down, comfortably
numb, and feeling entirely in his element, staring into the middle distance
while seated on a couch in the Korova Milk Bar, wearing two spiky false
eyelashes on the left eye to denote his status as leader of his gang. The camera
tracks directly back from Alex to reveal that the tables in the milk bar are
made from life-sized, full-figure human sculptures, and that the milk dispensers
are in the form of kneeling young women with towering white hair. (The
&quot;human furniture&quot; was based on actual pieces created by London pop
artist Allen Jones.) Alex is our narrator, and, as in Burgess' novel, he speaks
in a slang language called &quot;nadsat&quot; made up of a polyglot derived from
rhyming-Cockney slang, Latin, and Russian. (Anthony Burgess wrote his novel
after visiting the Soviet Union, where he saw marauding youth gangs on Moscow
streets.) Alex's fellow gang members are referred to as &quot;droogs,&quot; from
the informal Russian word for &quot;guy&quot; or &quot;man.&quot; &quot;Glazzies&quot;
are eyes, and &quot;viddy&quot; refers to seeing. &quot;Real horrosho&quot; is a
term of approval, derived from both &quot;horror show&quot; and the Russian word
for &quot;good&quot; or &quot;very well.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
scene with the vagrant (Paul Farrell) -- &quot;Can you spare some copper, me
brother?&quot; -- set the tone for the rest of the film in many people's minds.
&quot;It's a stinkin' world because there's no more law-an'-order anymore!&quot;
he yells defiantly at Alex. &quot;It's a stinkin' world because it lets the
young get on the old, like you done! Oh, it's no world for an old man any
longer!....&quot; The vagrant's rant then turns into a sneer. &quot;Men on the
moon! An' men spinnin' around the Earth! An' there's not no attention paid to
earthly law-an'-order, no more!...&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's
a bit of a start because, at the time, what he was talking about was not all
that much different from what was going on outside the movie houses. The setting
looks alien, and yet not so. Anthony Burgess had originally intended his story
to be set in 1972, and some of the publicity materials for Kubrick's film even
stated that it was supposed to make place in the late Seventies. With few
exceptions -- the reflective wall covering in Alex's parents' flat which looks
like it was made by the appliance manufacturer Braun, and the wonderfully awful
women's hair tintings of blue and yellow (the film includes a credit for a
consultant on the hair colorings) -- the film could very well have been taking
place in 1971, a year when Youth was in all its unruliness, insolent, raucous,
flaunting and openly scornful of authority and the status-quo. Protestors making
obscene gestures at the police, parents telling their kids to &quot;turn that
garbage down!&quot; on their stereos, and driving through downtown Berkeley and
seeing huge pieces of cardboard where storefront windows used to be. Alex and
his &quot;droogs&quot; represented what could be your worst fears about where
things were going -- or with other audiences members' expectations and hopes of
what could happen once the &quot;old tigers&quot; had gotten really scared. <o:p>

<span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA"><font size="2">Like James Cagney and George M. Cohan, or Audrey Hepburn and Holly
Golightly, Malcolm McDowell and the role of Alex DeLarge seem fated to meet.
Other actors could probably have played the role just as well, but it wouldn't
be the same. McDowell's career would become overshadowed by Alex's twisted
smile, though he would go on to do some exceptional work in <i>Time After Time,
Get Crazy </i>(in which he did a dead-on parody of Mick Jagger), and Paul
Schrader's remake of <i>Cat People. </i>(And he would do some not-so-exceptional
work in <i>Caligula</i> and <i>Blue Thunder</i>.) It probably did not help that
McDowell also came to the fore, two years prior to Kubrick's film, playing a
teenager who ends up leading an armed revolution at his very proper boarding
school in Lindsay Anderson's </font></span>
