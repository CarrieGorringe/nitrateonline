            review by <a href="../joe.html" target="_top">Joe Barlow</a>, 30 June 2000</i></font>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Des McArnuff's
            <i>The Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle</i> is something of a
            minor miracle -- a film so clever, intelligent and devastatingly
            funny that we should all get down on the floor and kiss Hollywood's
            feet for letting a movie of this caliber escape from Development
            Hell. In an era overflowing with pointless remakes of baby-boomer TV
            shows, the real surprise is not the fact that <i>Rocky and
            Bullwinkle</i> works this well -- it's the fact that it works <i>at
            all</i>. While so many other live-action adaptations of cartoons
            fail miserably (I'm looking at you, <i>Flintstones</i>!), <i>The
            Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle</i> succeeds admirably -- dare I
            say brilliantly? -- simply because McArnuff and the cast treat their
            source material with the utmost reverence. This is a film built on
            love and admiration, and the utter delight with which it has been
            constructed is nothing short of infectious.</b> <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The screenplay, by <i>Analyze This</i>-scribe
            Kenneth Lonergan, is some kind of masterpiece, melding both the
            unapologetically bad puns of Jay Ward's original series with an
            abundance of self-referential modern jokes (there are gags involving
            rap music, the Internet, and fax machines, for example). But
            Lonergan has done his homework: the script has been so finely
            constructed that it feels just as natural to watch our favorite
            moose and squirrel comes to terms with modern technology (Bullwinkle
            discovers Microsoft's Solitaire game in one delightful scene) as it
            does to hear their traditional puns and wisecracks. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As our story opens, the
            ever-excitable Narrator (voiced by Keith Scott) informs us that
            Rocky (voiced by original actress June Foray) and Bullwinkle (Keith
            Scott again) have grown disillusioned with life in the animated
            world of Frostbite Falls, Minnesota. Since their show's
            cancellation, the duo has survived on an ever-dwindling number of
            royalty checks. Although the plethora of free time allows Bullwinkle
            to pursue his new passion -- saving his hometown's decimated
            woodlands -- both he and Rocky miss the excitement of their by-gone
            glory days. Nor has Frostbite Falls itself fared particularly well:
            the once-scenic town is now a dilapidated slum, and the local
            economy is so poor that the Narrator himself has been forced to move
            back in with his mother, narrating the events of his own life to
            alleviate the boredom. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But opportunity knocks when that
            dastardly trio of villains, Boris Badanov (Jason Alexander), Natasha
            Fatale (Rene Russo) and Fearless Leader (Robert De Niro) escape from
            Cartoon Land and find themselves in the real world. Fearless Leader
            wastes no time in ripping off <i>Mystery Science Theater 3000</i>
            with his plan to take over America: he'll project horrible
            television shows around the country, programs so inept that even the
            most brilliant minds in modern society will be turned into quivering
            bowls of jelly. (&quot;How is this different from regular
            television?&quot; inquire our heroes upon learning of the scheme.) A
            young FBI agent named -- you better brace yourself -- Karen Sympathy
            (a delightful performance from newcomer Piper Perabo) is assigned
            the task of stopping the trio, and she knows who to call for help.
            Faster than you can say &quot;Hokey Smokes,&quot; Rocky and
            Bullwinkle are summoned into our world to foil their old foes, once
            and for all. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">First things first: the film looks
            terrific. I'm not a huge fan of CGI graphics, and my biggest concern
            upon learning that <i>Rocky and Bullwinkle</i> was being done as a <i>Roger
            Rabbit</i>-esque live-action/animation hybrid was that our
            protagonists would look hopelessly insubstantial next to their human
            co-stars. Not so! Industrial Light and Magic has done a wonderful
            job of melding the animation with the cinematography, and
            &quot;Moose and Squirrel&quot; have never looked better. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The performances, too, find just
            the right note between camp and utter sincerity. Jason Alexander and
            Rene Russo are perfectly cast as Boris and Natasha -- the accents
            and costumes are perfect, even if they don't do much; the characters
            seem to be included only for the sake of completeness. Fearless
            Leader is the real star of the show here, and if De Niro doesn't
            really sound that much like the animated character he portrays, his
            performance is so campy and enthusiastic that it's an easy flaw to
            overlook. De Niro, who also co-produced, chews so much scenery over
            the course of the film that it's a wonder there are any sets left
            standing in Hollywood. That's not intended as a criticism,
            incidentally: he captures the movie's tone brilliantly. And as you
            might expect from any film daring to call itself <i>The Adventures
            of Rocky and Bullwinkle</i>, the movie is filled to the brim with
            satire. In addition to the aforementioned spoofs on modern
            technology, look for sly jabs at suburbia (every town in the movie
            is absolutely indistinguishable from any other), college life,
            government bureaucracy, and even a hilarious parody of the
            television show &quot;Cops.&quot; (De Niro himself also gets into
            the parody game, spoofing his own performance in Martin Scorsese's <i>Taxi
            Driver</i>. (&quot;Hey, you talkin' to me?&quot;) <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like the original television show,
            much of the film's humor is subtle enough that it will fly right
            over the head of younger audience members (one of the buildings of
            Wossamatta U's campus is proudly labeled &quot;J Ward,&quot; an
            homage to the show's creator, the late Jay Ward). But again, like
            the original show, there's enough variety in the presentation to
            make sure everyone comes out smiling. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I must warn you,
            though: the puns are brutal (one body of water is named Crymia
            River, and the nation's highest-ranking military officers are
            General Foods, General Store, and General Admission), but as any fan
            of the series knows, merciless puns are to be expected. Longtime
            Rocky and Bullwinkle admirers such as myself are going to be
            flabbergasted by how much this film feels like the show they know
            and love. Don't be scared off by its live-action elements: <i>The
            Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle</i> is a cinematic gem that gets
            absolutely everything right. Sometimes, it seems, you <i>can</i> go
            home again.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
