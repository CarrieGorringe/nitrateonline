            <i>
            How the Grinch Stole Christmas</i> is the clearest indicator of
            Hollywood’s creative stagnation that I’ve yet seen. I’ve never
            understood the entertainment industry’s incessant need to remake
            artistic works that were perfect -- or at least much better -- the
            first time around, yet every week brings more recycled material into
            movie theaters and onto radio airwaves. Why should studios try to
            nurture new talent when the public at large is more than willing to
            fork out its money to see or hear moderately different versions of
            the same old stories and songs?</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Narrated by Anthony Hopkins in a
            voice so dark and husky that I wondered if he’d begin expressing
            the desire to eat Cindy Lou Who’s liver with fava beans before it
            was all over, this live-action adaptation of How the Grinch Stole
            Christmas relies on its audience’s love for the classic Dr. Seuss
            book of the same name to carry it through. Most of the elements of
            the original storyline are in evidence here: the cantankerous Grinch
            (Jim Carrey), a furry chap who may be a distant cousin of Oscar the
            Grouch, lives on the outskirts of the merry village of Whoville, a
            community that delights in its annual Christmas celebration. The
            Grinch, however, despises these shenanigans, and hatches a scheme to
            ruin Christmas for everyone in town. With the help of his bumbling
            but well-intentioned dog Max, the Grinch sabotages the Yuletide
            season, only to discover that the spirit of Christmas does not,
            after all, center on commercialism, but on love and understanding.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">On the surface, the storyline
            sounds quite faithful to Seuss’s beloved tale. But Jeffrey Price
            and Peter Seaman, the film’s screenwriters, have missed the point
            of the original book, and in so doing, have lost every nuance of the
            plot. In Seuss’s book, the Grinch was a singularly unpleasant
            individual, full of malice. Ron Howard and his crew, however, have
            turned one of Christmas’s all-time greatest villains into a pouty,
            put-upon loser, wallowing in loneliness and waves of self-pity. The
            Grinch here is not so much a force of malevolence as a misunderstood
            loner, having suffered through a lifetime of abuse at the hands of
            the Who villagers. Because of this, when he finally gets around to
            stealing Christmas -- some eighty minutes into the film -- it’s
            clear that the Grinch’s actions are fully justified. The people of
            Whoville are, quite simply, despicable little bastards who deserve
            to be fed into a meat-grinder, so obsessed are they with
            commercialism, petty bickering, and the complete ostracizing of
            anyone who’s even the least bit different, including our dejected
            protagonist. These creeps have hurt the Grinch, and his desire to
            retaliate is entirely justified; indeed, these jerks deserve a lot
            more than the small amount of retribution he gives them.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s a fundamental shift in
            structure: in the book, the Whos teach the Grinch the true meaning
            of Christmas with their selfless attitude and insatiable desire to
            celebrate the holidays, regardless of the Grinch’s actions. Here,
            these same pious villagers torment a purely innocent creature,
            making him into the lonely outcast we see on the screen. I
            personally find it horrifying that the Grinch, the only creature
            brave enough to buck tradition, is painted as “evil” merely
            because he doesn’t share the beliefs held by the conservative
            townspeople. He’s the victim, and yet the story only rewards him
            when he conforms. Remember that lesson, boys and girls: you’re
            only a good person as long as you hold no opinions that challenge
            society’s status quo.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I hear you yelling at me. You’re
            frantically waving your arms, screaming that this version of the
            story must, by necessity, be at least somewhat different from the
            original tale. After all, Seuss’s book contains probably the same
            amount of text as this review, and certain things must therefore be
            altered in order to sustain a feature-length narrative. But the
            problem with the film’s reinvention of Seuss’s source material
            is not that things have been changed; it’s that things have been
            changed so carelessly that the story’s biggest joy -- its sense of
            unbridled innocence -- has been jeopardized. (“Honey, a baby’s
            here!” exclaims a delighted Who father after finding a small
            bundle on the front porch. “It looks exactly like your boss.”)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But even if his efforts to revamp
            and modernize How the Grinch Stole Christmas haven’t proven
            unilaterally successful, director Howard and his set designers have
            done a wondrous job of one-upping the good doctor’s book in one
            respect. The film boasts an exquisite visual style that plucks
            images from the depths of the imagination, with settings and locales
            that recall What Dreams May Come and the many brooding, gothic
            offerings from director Tim Burton. The visuals are so striking, in
            fact, that the movie just might be worth seeing for no other reason
            than to bask in the sheer spectacle of it all.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Nor are some of the new jokes
            without humor and wit. “I’m down a size and a half,” exclaims
            the Grinch after a self-administered heart exam. “And this time,
            I’ll keep it off!” But these types of gems are few and far
            between.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The new Grinch
            lacks the sprightly pacing that made the animated tale -- and the
            original book -- so much fun. The cinematic adaptation plods by,
            particularly in a much-too-long flashback, in documentary form,
            explaining the Grinch’s personal history. The whole sequence feels
            about as sincere as a typical episode of Access Hollywood. And,
            really, would Dr. Seuss have approved of a Grinch remake that
            incorporates cheap gags involving dog anuses, inexplicable animal
            attacks, and face-first dives into bountiful cleavage among its many
            “jokes?” Somehow, I think not. The final nail in the coffin is
            the fact that How the Grinch Stole Christmas, which is supposedly a
            story about the danger of materialism during the holiday season, is
            one of the most merchandised films in recent memory. Grinch toys
            line the shelves of every retail store, and the sheer hypocrisy of
            it all is enough to make the most devout fan let loose with a
            barrage of “Bah, Humbugs!” I respect what Howard and his crew
            tried to do with this adaptation, but, well intentioned or not, the
            movie simply doesn’t work. They may have tried to put the film’s
            heart in the right place, but alas, it’s still two sizes too
            small.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
