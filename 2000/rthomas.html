            review by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 28 July 2000</i></font>
            <p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Some
            big screen adaptations of children's TV-shows are merely retreads o
            their source material. The <i>Pokémon</i> series of flicks is a
            good example. With <i>Thomas and the Magic Railroad</i>, however,
            writer-director Britt Allcroft has grander designs. The simple
            stories that kept television audiences happy with <i>Thomas the Tank
            Engine</i> have been augmented with live actors and elaborate
            special effects. The TV series usually featured miniature train
            sequences narrated by an unseen voice (like Ringo Starr, George
            Carlin or Alec Baldwin).</b></font></p>
            <p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            change is a misstep because much of the charm to the series came
            from its low-key simplicity. The voiceover allowed viewers to use
            their imagination to accompany the onscreen action. The trains and
            human figures rarely changed expression, but the voiceover allowed
            the audience to fill in whatever was missing on screen with their
            imagination.</font></p>
            <p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">With a
            cast of name actors slipping in and out of the island of Sodor
            (where Thomas and his fellow tank engines live), things get
            confusing. This time around, Thomas (voice by Eddie Glen) has to
            defend himself and the other coal-driven engines against the
            mean-spirited Diesel 10 (voice by Neil Crone). With a fearsome claw
            coming out of his roof, Diesel 10 bullies any other engine he
            considers weak or obsolete. Mr. Conductor (Alec Baldwin) tries to
            corral the engines on the island, but he has a personal crisis when
            he runs short of the magic gold dust that allows him to disappear
            and reappear from one place to another.</font></p>
            <p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            key to solving these problems could be near Shining Time Station
            where Mr. Conductor also works. Shining Time Station is where Mr.
            Conductor comes up to everyone else's knees and bears a resemblance
            to the real world (the train engines do not talk). Close by lives a
            bitter hermit named Burnett Stone (Peter Fonda, last seen in <i>The
            Limey</i>). Stone keeps a classy old engine named Lady. Stone has
            let the engine down in some way and cannot bring himself to start
            her again. His granddaughter Lily (Mara Wilson, Matilda) heads to
            there to try to cheer him up.</font></p>
            <p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Even
            after watching the movie it's difficult to figure out how all of
            these factors relate. It's taxing for adults, much less children
            with minute attention spans. The movie makes even less sense for
            people who were either casual viewers of the TV-version or have not
            seen it at all. It also doesn't help that the film suffers from
            radical shifts in tone. The train sequences, with their low-tech
            approach clash with all of the gold dust special effects, which seem
            more like something from a <i>Star Trek</i> episode. In addition,
            Allcroft handles the live actors awkwardly. The children and even
            Baldwin frequently come across as stiff and affected. Only Fonda,
            who perfected his brooding mode in <i>Ulee's Gold</i>, seems at
            home.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A parent can leave a child at <i>Thomas
            and the Magic Railroad</i> and might even be able to sit through it
            on their own. Still, the sloppy storytelling leaves the magic in
            short supply.</font>
