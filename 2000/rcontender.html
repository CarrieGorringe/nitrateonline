            Rod Lurie’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Contender</i> plays like two very different movies awkwardly grafted
            together. Most of the film is an intimate look at the creepy process
            of assigning lofty offices (in this case, the vice-presidency).
            It’s as if the audience is allowed to catch the moments of the
            Watergate and Abscam scandals when there were no microphones in the
            room. The conclusion, however, panders to viewers like a fawning
            politician. By aiming so hard to please, Lurie winds up alienating
            the crowd instead.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Bismarck once
            said that there were two things a person is better off not knowing:
            how sausages and laws are made. The appointment process isn’t much
            prettier. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Contender</i>
            works best when it boisterously celebrates this ugliness. Through
            much of the movie, it’s like watching the emotional equivalent of
            grisly car wreck;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>no
            one gets maimed onscreen, but the damage is just as real. In the
            near future, President Jackson Evans (Jeff Bridges, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Big Lebowski</i>) has the unenviable task of picking an occupant for
            Air Force Two. The previous veep has just died, and after two weeks
            anticipation is high. Evans surprises several pundits when he
            rejects popular governor Jack Hathaway (William Petersen) in favor
            of Senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen). Hathaway, like Evans, is a
            Democratic Party stalwart and has made headlines for trying
            unsuccessfully to save a young woman from drowning in an auto
            accident. Evans, however, selects Hanson despite the fact that she
            used to be a Republican. Evan, who is obsessed with his legacy (as
            well as the fact that he can order any conceivable dish from the
            White House kitchen), wants to set a precedent by picking the first
            female vice president.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">He encounters a
            formidable roadblock when he crosses House Judiciary Chairman Shelly
            Runyan (Gary Oldman). Runyan has dozens of reasons for crushing the
            Hanson’s nomination. He’s bitter about losing the presidency to
            Evans, distrusts Hanson because she switched parties and believes
            her designation is merely showboating on Evans’ part. To derail
            her candidacy, Runyan launches a massive smear campaign. Rumors
            about Hanson’s sexual past pop up on web sites and even crawl into
            the confirmation hearings. During these moments, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Contender</i> brims with a deliciously dark humor. While appearing
            cordial, Allen and Runyan are at each other’s throats. Paid to be
            liked, none of these Washingtonians ever say what they are thinking.
            Listening to fixer Kermit Newman (slyly played by Sam Elliott)
            flatly reject Governor Hathaway but tells him that he’s &quot;the
            future of the Democratic Party&quot; is like learning a new
            language. It’s fun to try to decode what these folks are actually
            conveying.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Unlike a lot
            critics who step behind the camera (try to sit through Chris Gore
            and Roger Ebert’s lame attempts at filmmaking), Lurie knows what
            he’s doing. He has coaxes terrific performances from his entire
            cast. Bridges is especially fun. One wonders if we elected the wrong
            thespian President. Even some of the minor turns are memorable.
            There’s an interesting sequence where Mariel Hemingway plays a
            reluctant witness during the hearings. She stumbles in front of the
            camera and the microphones as if she’s never had to deal with them
            before. It’s a credit to both Hemingway and Lurie that they can
            make a star cameo that doesn’t proceed like a distraction. One
            also wishes the Anita Hill and &quot;Zippergate&quot; scandals were
            as well written as when Runyan advises a junior Congressman,
            &quot;Take out your dictionary, and cross the out the word
            ‘objectivity.’&quot;</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Because of the
            skill that Lurie demonstrates, the tidy conclusion is a betrayal.
            His appeal to the better side of human nature is out of character
            with the rest of the film. It’s sad to admit, but these
            protagonists are more fun when they’re nasty. When Hanson states
            her views on issues, Larry Groupé’s music swells loudly. What had
            once been a seductive insider’s view of power degenerates into a
            flat polemic. In addition, Lurie adds some lame surprise endings.
            Some of which don’t conform to the data he’s presented to the
            spectators earlier. It’s as if Lurie had lost faith in his vision
            and in the audience’s ability to stomach it.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">With all that
            Lurie and his cast get right, there is still much to recommend <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Contender</i>. Nonetheless, one walks out of the film with the same
            queasy feeling that accompanies having voted for a candidate who
            backed out of a tough promise.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
