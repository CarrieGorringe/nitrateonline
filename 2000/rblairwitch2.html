            difficult to know where to begin in describing the wasted mess that
            is <i>Blair Witch 2: Book of Shadows</i>, so let's start with the
            title. Nothing in the movie is referred to as the &quot;book of
            shadows,&quot; and no book or shadow plays any role in the story.
            The phrase does serve to bring to mind that which made the first
            film so effective, and this second one so drearily dull. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like
            it or hate it, <i>The Blair Witch Project</i> functioned more as a
            book than most movies in the way it stripped itself down to its bare
            story essence - no recognizable actors, no music, no polished
            cinematography - and simply recorded a happening that left much to
            the imagination of the audience. This was taken to an extreme that
            miffed many members of that audience, for this was a horror movie
            that never showed you the source of the horror. Those same viewers
            can subject themselves to the other extreme with its sequel, a movie
            which shows you everything, and tells you nothing.<o:p>

            is the mantra behind most good movie storytelling, but only when
            that which is shown serves to tell you something. Images without
            meaning are nothing more than that. <i>Blair Witch 2</i> is riddled
            with the horrific hallucinations and visions of its characters, and
            rarely shows any interest in distinguishing between that which is
            imagined and that which is real, and even more rarely attempts to
            connect them to any larger storytelling purpose. Five
            twentysomethings, in the same age group as the trio that first
            ventured into the Maryland woods looking to debunk or reinforce the
            myth of the <i>Blair Witch</i>, retrace the steps of that first
            group for pretty much the same reasons. They go crazy quickly, as
            unexplainable events occur around them, and pretty soon they are
            being questioned, in intermittent flash-forwards, in a murder case. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If
            <i>Blair Witch 2</i> told its story well, if it seemed to actually
            have an idea of what it wanted to do and then did it, we would
            simply be talking about a question of taste regarding the two
            diametrically opposed movies. One deals exclusively in character,
            detailing the gradual loss of sanity in the face of complete
            disorientation and fright, the other deals exclusively in viscera,
            slamming you with gory images, flinch cuts, and wild emoting from
            the virtual start. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            this sequel doesn't even succeed as a shock-fest. Co-writer/director
            Joe Berlinger is at once a strange and fitting man for the job. This
            is his first work of feature-length fiction, after working on two
            very well received social justice documentaries along with his
            partner Bruce Sinofsky. <i>Brother's Keeper</i> and <i>Paradise Lost</i>
            each explored a case of individuals living outside of the societal
            norm, whether they were uncivilized, possibly incestuous farmer
            siblings or metal-head, Satan-worshipping teens, being wrongfully
            accused of criminal behavior based almost solely on that appearance.
            <i>Blair Witch</i> deals with a selection of just such characters
            living outside of social conformity - a purveyor of stolen
            electronics and ex-mental institution resident, a practicing female
            witch with an interest only in the whiter side of her magic, and a
            young woman with psychic powers who chooses to dress like Morticia
            Addams. Along for the ride are the most whitebread, clean-cut of the
            bunch, a young romantic couple researching the aftermath of the <i>Blair
            Witch</i> phenomenon for their grad-school thesis. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Berlinger
            could have been a canny choice to blur the lines blurred so
            effectively by the original, between the fiction form and the
            documentary form, and in the beginning, Berlinger tries to get back
            into the story through those same murky lines, staging interviews
            with the Burkittsville townspeople regarding the phenomenon not of
            the Blair Witch, but of the <i>Blair Witch</i> movie. But that's
            abandoned as soon as it's begun, as we're introduced to the latest
            set of intrepid forest explorers and sent forward into what looks
            and feels much more like a conventional movie. And it all goes south
            from there. Berlinger turns to a sloppy filmmaking style that's
            noisy in every way, and a narrative that lurches all over the place
            in its attempt to connect the insanity of its characters, or the
            insanity caused by some higher evil power, to what turns out to be
            nothing more than a simple-minded murder mystery. The resolution to
            that mystery either fits right into Berlinger's storytelling
            interests, or it exists in direct opposition to them. Either one
            could be the case in this wishy-washy, ambiguous debacle, and
            neither one is any more meaningful than the other. <o:p>
