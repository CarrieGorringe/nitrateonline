            is a fine word too often used in a tiresome way, specifically, to
            imagine girls as wild creatures in need of taming by men who know
            how to ride them. This image is at the metaphorical center of Billy
            Bob Thornton's exceedingly tiresome <i>All the Pretty Horses</i>,
            which offers Penelope Cruz as the repeatedly slow-motioned,
            flowing-haired object of desire for would-be riders. As Alejandra,
            Cruz is less a character than an irresistible image, the Marlboro
            Man's wet dream -- she rides horses, swims naked, and pouts adorably
            when she's mad at her daddy, the wealthy and proud horse rancher Don
            Hector Rocha y Villarael (Ruben Blades). </b><o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Imagine
            how good Alejandra looks to a young horseman who's just ridden into
            Mexico all the way from Texas. John Grady Cole (Matt Damon, who was
            born to play cowboys in movies -- he looks fabulous here) leaves
            home when his mother decides to sell his grandfather's ranch. She's
            remarried, and Cole's lonely, beat-down dad (Robert Patrick) doesn't
            have much sway with her decision one way or t'other. Left more or
            less to his own devices, Cole lights out with his buddy Lacey
            Rawlins (Henry Thomas), looking for adventure and a means to
            maintain this cowboy life they've come to favor. The film opens with
            a set of images that show just why they love this life -- horses
            thunder across the screen in slow motion, dust churning beneath
            their hooves, their perfect muscles visible beneath their taut
            flesh. Cut to an overhead shot of Cole and Rawlins lying on their
            backs in the grass, looking up at the sky, as one asks the other,
            &quot;You ever think about dying?&quot; Well, yeah, they both do --
            it's 1849 and life in West Texas is hard, even if the horses are
            pretty and you occasionally get to lie out on the range and
            contemplate the clouds. They also worry about what might happen
            after they die, whether there's a way to know what's coming, or
            whether faith is enough to sustain you if can't know or see the road
            ahead. Cole wraps up their conversation neatly: &quot;I guess you
            can believe whatever you want to.&quot;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Based
            on Cormac McCarthy's award-winning novel and reverently, if
            spasmodically, adapted by Ted Tally and director Billy Bob Thornton,
            <i>All the Pretty Horses</i> is a film about belief -- how you make
            it into a system and hold to it -- but just what's at stake in that
            belief is open to question. As the film opens, Cole's most immediate
            and familiar belief system (built on the family, the ranch, and the
            horses, always the horses) is shattered by what he sees as his
            citified mother's betrayal, her sell-out to newfangled ambitions and
            practices (that this crushing blow is delivered by a banker played
            by contemporary death-of-the-Western chronicler Sam Shepard is not a
            little unsubtle). He and Rawlins conceive their journey as a way to
            preserve their youthful beliefs, and the film frames it as a way to
            show the loss and destruction of the American West. This loss is
            initiated by Cole and Rawlins' decision to cross the Texas-Mexico
            border, which ends up making for all kinds of metaphorical trouble
            -- they're also crossing over from youth to maturity and, in Cole's
            case, crossing over class and race lines when he falls for Alejandra.

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            journey itself is full of instructional episodes, and much of the
            narrative logic is rendered incoherent due to poor editing : the
            Cole-Alejandra romance sequence, for instance, is reduced to a
            cliched montage of sensuous moments. By far the most legible and
            rewarding plot-section involves Cole and Rawlins' encounter with a
            teenage runaway, Jimmy Blevins (Lucas Black, who played the kid in
            Thornton's <i>Slingblade</i>). Blevins is a welcome live wire, all
            jangly nerves and pumped-up aggression, and Black is terrific in the
            part. Cole pegs his huge gun and his fabulous horse as stolen, but
            Blevins hangs onto them dearly, obviously aware that a man is only
            as good as what he owns, in particular those established emblems of
            masculine potency, the gun and the horse. Cole and Rawlins are
            equally invested in such tokens, of course, but they have each other
            as well as their stuff, which makes them slightly less
            trigger-happy. When Blevins has to re-steal his horse one night, he
            does so with a ridiculous confidence inspired by his youth, poverty,
            and incipient lunacy -- he's primed to become a legend, or a serial
            killer. Understanding that his outlaw status will endanger his
            newfound friends, he scoots off into the darkness, leaving behind a
            storyline that will miss him dearly -- without Blevins, the film
            turns into a much less energetic, more prosaic affair, a ruggedly
            romantic paean to a mythic past. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Once
            over the border, Cole and Rawlins land at Don Hector's ranch and
            demonstrate their horsemanship -- they break fourteen mustangs in a
            single day, duly impressing their hosts. The locals celebrate the
            white boys' prowess with a montage of music, food, and drink. Thank
            goodness the real cowboys have arrived! Promoted to Don Hector's
            chief advisor on horseflesh, Cole catches the eye of his willful
            daughter, Alejandra. In one scene, she convinces Cole to let her
            ride daddy's big black stallion, bareback (um, this image might be
            just a little heavy-handed). He knows it's wrong, he frets that she
            wants to get him &quot;in trouble.&quot; She smiles and announces,
            &quot;You're already in trouble!&quot; Whoosh, she gallops off on
            the steed, not so tactfully inviting the stunned Cole to chase her.
            The film doesn't explore the cultural or historical context for this
            transgression; it focuses on the idea that Don Hector (or perhaps
            more to the point, Alejandra's aunt, played with quiet dignity by
            Miriam Colon) doesn't want Alejandra sleeping with the help, but
            never addresses the obvious anxieties that would be raised by the
            fact that he's white and she's Mexican. Rather, her exquisite and
            exotic otherness is treated by the camera as if it explains
            everything -- she's luscious, ooh so desirable, and off-limits, but
            she's also a symbol of that Old West Cole has had to abandon back in
            Texas. And so she must be what he wants, what he wants to believe
            in. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Of
            course, the relationship is doomed. What you might not anticipate is
            the punishment, which, by a circuitous route having to do with
            Blevins, lands Cole and Rawlins in a scary Mexican prison, where
            they suffer derision and abuse -- that is, they have fallen from the
            vaulted position they once held at Don Hector's ranch, because Cole
            couldn't resist what amounts to Alejandra's siren-call. That he's
            sacrificed his friend Rawlins into the bargain, well, that is hard
            to take. And so the film eventually leads Cole on another journey,
            this time alone, seeking vengeance against the mean and corrupt
            Mexican police and helped not a little by a reasonable and kindly
            Caucasian judge back in Texas (played by Bruce Dern, who reportedly
            completed the role before Thornton abruptly left Dern's daughter
            Laura for Jon Voight's daughter, Angelina). Unfortunately, Cole's
            vengeance has lost whatever historical context it may have once had
            in the novel, and so his story descends into a bit of tying up loose
            ends, with more than a nod to the self-congratulatory sensibility of
            Clint Eastwood's <i>Unforgiven</i>. In <i>All the Pretty Horses</i>,
            character probably does come down to deciding what you want to
            believe in, but Cole's choices are predetermined and, for all the
            vast beauty of their Western backdrop, trite. </font><o:p>
