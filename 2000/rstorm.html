            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>A lot of water gets tossed about
            in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Perfect Storm.</i> Using the new millenium’s finest special
            effects arsenal – plus a few million gallons of H20 – this movie
            takes viewers on a vicarious tour of The Atlantic. The highlights
            include wind-whipped drizzle, menacing whitecaps, jet-black skies
            spitting forth lightning, and hundred-foot swells. Based on
            Sebastian Unger’s 1998 book chronicling an ill-fated journey into
            churning seas by a Gloucester sword fishing boat, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Perfect Storm </i>is director Wolfgang Petersen’s latest in a
            series of larger-than-life actioners that includes <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Das Boot, In the Line of Fire, </i>and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Air Force One.</i> Despite the macho presence of George Clooney and Mark
            Wahlberg as deep-sea angling partners aboard the <i>Andrea Gail</i>,
            the film’s true star is its storm; a triple-shot of hurricanes
            colliding head-on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As
            this monster typhoon lays waste to watercraft with the ease of a
            garbage disposal chugging down yesterday’s leftovers, the effect
            is convincing, and will pass the scrutiny of anyone who’s ever
            blown chunks over the side of a salmon charter boat out on choppy
            waters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There’s no
            feeling quite as helpless.</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Why is it, then, that one walks out
            of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Perfect Storm</i> with a feeling as empty as the ice chest of a
            skunked skipper?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Unlike
            a summer box-office competitor like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Patriot,</i> which covers a broad canvas of characters, plotting,
            and geography, this film’s story is confined to a much more
            personal story.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But it’s handled in the manner of a big, loud,
            effects-driven blockbuster.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>That’s
            the mistake.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Instead of
            teaching viewers enough about its characters to make them forget
            about the digital effects and action, the script is so generic that
            you’re almost salivating to see the <i>Andrea Gail’s</i>
            crewmembers nailed by the rotten weather. You feel like a geeky
            peeper watching Freddy Krueger gutting teenagers, anxious for the
            rush of action, but ashamed that you’re getting entertainment
            value out of watching others suffer.<o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Perfect Storm</i>’s obvious spiritual predecessor,<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">
            Titanic</i>, didn’t forget to invest some time in its central
            romance before the final, tragic scenes played out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Watching Jack and Rose dance a forbidden jig with the
            downstairs “steerage” was a story in itself: the sinking ship
            was a dramatic bonus.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
            says something that a movie as massive as James Cameron’s Best
            Picture recipient boasted a more intimate love story than <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Perfect Storm</i>, which reaches for an epic feel when it should be
            embracing its smaller-scale Gloucester group with more detail and
            less bang for the buck.<o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Perfect
            Storm</i>’s various human flotsam and jetsam are introduced at the
            Crow’s Nest, a lively dockside watering hole that packs ‘em in
            like crowded sardines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Among
            the barstool regulars are Billy Tyne (George Clooney, sporting an
            unshaven, Don Johnson look), a down-on-his-luck skipper whose
            paychecks and catches are both getting smaller, and Bobby Shatford
            (Mark Wahlberg), an upstart seaman who spends most of his on-shore
            time groping girlfriend Christine Cotter (Diane Lane).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Swigging booze a few tables down are Murph (John C. Reilly),
            a human teddy bear to his admiring, towhead son, and Bugsy (John
            Hawkes), a lonely runt who makes it to first base with the Bette
            Midler-esque Irene (Rusty Schwimmer).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Rounding out this cluster of human driftwood is Linda
            Greenlaw (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), another skipper who flirts
            with Billy but maintains a tough exterior. Meanwhile, Alfred Pierre
            (Allen Payne) is a Jamaican who’s so busy bedding the local women
            that he apparently doesn’t have time to mumble more than a few
            words during the film’s 129 minute running time.<o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Perfect Storm</i>’s first few scenes do a fairly good job of
            establishing Gloucester’s hard-living, economically tight
            subculture of ocean-reliant, blue-collar toughs. Most of the main
            characters are recently divorced, juggling the messy aftermath of
            child custody, alimony payments, and unreliable incomes. When
            fishermen wait in line for paychecks, there’s a convincing tension
            generated as boat crews with poor catch quotas are reprimanded with
            lower earnings. After this early scene, the short-of-cash Tyne
            alerts his men that he’s planning on taking an extra trip out to
            sea, and they follow him in search of a catch that will “set the
            market” and promise them all weightier reimbursement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Shatford, Murph, Bugsy, and Pierre round out his crew, along
            with a scrappy hothead tagalong named Scully (William Fichtner).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Once at sea aboard the <i>Andrea
            Gail</i>, the men crank up some ZZ Top, submerge the baitlines, and
            wait for some action.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There’s
            an inexplicable rivalry between Murph and Scully, who throw punches
            and hurl insults to and fro.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Later,
            when Murph’s hand is impaled by a baithook and he’s yanked
            overboard by a taut line, it’s Scully who comes to his rescue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Much male bonding and reconciliation follows.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Later, when the men huddle inside the boat and grumble about
            their crummy, miniscule catch, Tyne rouses them into action like a
            sea-bound Bobby Knight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>“This
            is where the men are separated from the boys,” he proclaims,
            wrapping up a stale pep speech.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>More bonding, more reconciliation. We’ve seen it before.<o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">All of these introductions and
            “characterizations” hardly matter when the three storm fronts
            start weaving their black magic spell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Perfect Storm</i>
            attempts to beef up this impressive attack by Mother Nature, which
            is followed by a weatherman in a Massachusetts newsroom, with a
            subplot involving the rescue of a yacht via Coast Guard ships and
            Air Force helicopters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Under
            black skies and seemingly impenetrable sheets of rain, there’s a
            spectacular mid-air attempt to refuel a helicopter that brings to
            mind a similar set piece from <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Air Force One. </i>It’s obvious that Petersen feels completely at home
            combining high-tech gadgetry with kinetic, nail-biting rescue
            scenarios: he’d be a good candidate for the next Tom Clancy
            adaptation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile,
            the <i>Andrea Gail</i> is tossed and turned, with similar set pieces
            popping up.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>When an anchor sways loose on a chain, careening through
            windows and whipping about like a lethal mace, Tyne is left to climb
            the <i>Andrea Gail’s</i> exterior and dismantle it with a
            blowtorch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It’s a
            harrowing scene.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There’s no denying that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Perfect Storm</i> is exciting: if you’re out for two hours of
            escapism, it delivers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
            there’s a formulaic feel to the pacing and plotting, reminding one
            that this is only a movie.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You’ll
            gawk at the forbidding maelstrom of black water and crushing waves,
            but never forget that you’re viewing this spectacle from the safe,
            snug confines of a local multiplex.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>This might be the result of limited emotional involvement
            with the <i>Andrea Gail’s</i> doomed crew.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Unlike <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Jaws</i>, which
            threw together an angry old salt, a jittery cop, and a rich-boy fish
            expert for a deep-sea shark-hunting expedition and evolved from the
            personalities of its trio, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Perfect Storm</i> really doesn’t invest a minute’s time in
            building up its cast.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Does
            Bugsy’s lack of self-esteem fit into any of the onboard scenarios?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Does the studly Pierre offer any groundbreaking revelations
            about his Casanova-style dating techniques?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Do we really get a sense of what drives the courageous Tyne?
            Negative.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ultimately, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Perfect Storm</i> is much like marveling at the great technique of a
            fisherman casting into a bathtub.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>He might be good at what he does, but what’s the purpose?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Likewise, Petersen’s hellraising tides are a lot of fun to
            look at, but his shallow characters are beached on dry land before
            these oceanic fireworks even start.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font>
