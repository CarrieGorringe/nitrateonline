            near-miracle-working director (he convinced William S. Burroughs to
            appear in <i>Drugstore Cowboy</i> and coaxed the best performance
            Keanu Reeves will ever give in <i>My Own Private Idaho</i>) has been
            meting out increasingly uninteresting pap over the years,
            culminating with 1997's <i>Good Will Hunting</i>.</b><o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now
            -- just in time for a joyously commercial holiday season -- comes
            another well-intentioned male melodrama about the salvation of a
            brilliant underachiever, buoyed somewhat by an earnest performance
            by newbie Rob Brown and Busta Rhymes' charismatic turn as his older
            brother. Brown plays sixteen-year-old Jamal, a gifted high-school
            basketballer and aspiring writer. Before the contrived plot actually
            kicks in, the movie has a lot going for it, most having to do with
            Brown's performance (startlingly, he has enough presence to hold his
            own with a renowned scene-chewer like Sean Connery). Jamal is a
            quiet, middle-class kid, dedicated to his mama, serious about his
            callings. But his likely end stares him in the face daily, in the
            form of his very nice, go-nowhere brother Terrell (Rhymes), a
            once-talented ballplayer who now works as a parking lot attendant at
            Yankee Stadium. Jamal has bigger plans but no practical way to
            implement them. So, he focuses on the present. When he's not writing
            in his journal in his bedroom, Jamal and his boys shoot hoops on a
            local Bronx street court. They note that they're being observed by
            someone with binoculars in a nearby apartment building. They take to
            calling this odd fellow The Window, meaning -- symbolically, don't
            you know -- that even as he lacks identity, he also poses a new
            frame through which they might see themselves, if only they take a
            chance. And can't you just picture Robin Williams sitting on a
            bench, in his rumply sweater, offering some wise paternal advice? <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Apparently
            Jamal missed that movie, so he's still intrigued by what might
            happen next. On a dare one afternoon, he sneaks into The Window's
            apartment, where the old man jumps out from the dark with a rather
            sadistic whoo-ha!, frightening Jamal into running off without his
            backpack. The old man goes through the contents, reads and marks up
            the kid's journal, and lo! Jamal has found a mentor. The red-inked
            comments range from the insipid &quot;constipated thinking&quot; to
            the glorious &quot;Where are you taking me?&quot; This last is
            privileged in the TV ads, and might be understood to articulate the
            film's central question -- how will these characters lead each other
            to places they might not anticipate? The problem is that viewers
            will have no trouble predicting most every turn along the way. And
            so, in the first of several non-surprises, The Window turns out to
            one William Forrester (Sean Connery) who, forty years back, wrote
            the Great American Novel, won the Pulitzer Prize, then disappeared
            from public view following a few too many run-ins with his adoring
            public, or more to the point, people who misread his profound words
            (this J.D. Salinger routine is so tired by now, it might almost be
            more radical for an author in the movies to embrace fame and
            fortune).<o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Forrester
            is a crotchety coot, which ostensibly signifies his high standards:
            when he snipes at Jamal in a vaguely racist way, the boy is supposed
            to handle it, like it's a test of deep thinking or some nonsense. It
            hardly need be said that this is a wholly disturbing test to run on
            a sixteen-year- old, no matter how splendid his writing skills, but
            the film treats the episode as evidence of Forrester's sore nerves
            and Jamal's innate sagacity and patience. As imagined by Mike Rich's
            simplistic script, Jamal is caught between hard places -- the
            self-righteous Forrester makes him promise never to reveal his
            identity to anyone, even though this means he has to lie to people
            about where he is and what he's doing every afternoon. Jamal is not
            so much a character as a device in a movie full of guidance-seeking
            White Folks. He's the Idealized Young Black Male, a Non-threatening,
            proper-English-speaking, polite-conversation-making, shy-acting
            counterweight to all those scary pimps, hustlers, and foul-mouthed
            comedians favored by MTV and the local news. This isn't to say that
            Jamal isn't -- or can't be -- representative in his right, but to
            say that the movie treats him like he's exceptional rather than
            typical. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">That
            is, he's bookish as well basketballish. Though Jamal has been
            underachieving in class -- a plot point catering to the stereotype
            that black students want to get bad grades to fit in with their
            bad-grade-getting peers, a stereotype that lets school
            administrations off the hook -- his dazzling test scores reveal he
            is a secret genius. True to its clich</span>é<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">d form, the film delivers this non-surprise with the
            obligatory scene where the teacher (April Grace) calls Jamal's
            mother in to school, to inform her of her child's amazing abilities
            -- somehow, despite the movie's own suggestion that Jamal and his
            mother have a strong relationship, she's missed this crucial detail.
            At this point a pricey Manhattan private school that's looking to
            win a basketball trophy recruits him. There he meets a friendly
            white girl in a cute school uniform, Claire (Anna Paquin), who
            happens to be the headmaster's daughter. Their friendship hints at
            yet another story cliche, this one of the Romeo-and-Juliet-ish
            variety, but the movie loses interest in that angle, and pretty much
            leaves Paquin hanging. She spends most of her on screen time framed
            in reaction shots -- watching Jamal perform on the court or in
            class. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></span></font></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">He's
            certainly worth watching, but the movie can't seem to think of what
            to do with him. The most thrilling, obviously fetishized scenes --
            aside from some smooth court action, where Jamal's primary opponent
            is the school's only other black student, conveniently for the
            film's general avoidance of dicey racism and race politics -- take
            place when Jamal is at the typewriter. At first he's nervous, so
            Forrester gives his student a bit of his own (Forrester's) prose as
            a jumpstart, telling him to type out the first paragraph and then
            make it &quot;his&quot; (let's just say that this is a peculiar
            instruction technique). The kid takes to writing on this manual
            typewriter like nobody's business, and starts churning out great
            essays , so great that they spark suspicion in his English teacher,
            who happens to be played by Saligeri (that is, F. Murray Abraham),
            apparently still raging against his own mediocrity. There's a
            ridiculous classroom showdown in which Jamal challenges Mr.
            Mediocre's knowledge of what famous writer wrote what famous passage
            (they go through Coleridge, Twain, Kipling, et. al.), which
            basically sets him up for a big vengeance play by the teacher. That
            this play (occasioned by a writing contest) comes at the same
            moment, dramatic-arc-wise, that Jamal is called on to take the team
            to a championship ensures a jam- packed climax. And of course, all
            this happens at the same time that Jamal and Forrester grapple with
            their friendship, mutual obligations, and, of course, the looming
            question of whether or not Forrester will ever get the heck out of
            his apartment. The answer to this question is, like most everything
            else in the film, no surprise. </font><o:p>
