            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>What to say about Peter
            Greenaway's film <i>8 1/2 Women</i>? The title, in case you haven't
            guessed, comes from Fellini: the two main characters take in a
            showing of the director's 1963 film, and during the scene where
            Marcello Mastroianni's Guido comes home to a houseful of women, they
            wonder aloud if Fellini had to sleep with Sandra Milo and Barbara
            Steele in order to get such an array of womanhood for his film.
            Fellini, of course, did not, his increasingly phantasmagorical
            representations of women coming out of psychotherapy he underwent in
            the Sixties, with the interpretation of his dreams leading to the
            presence of the lusty blondes, the giantesses, and the girls who
            shake and moan to rock music like Regan in <i>The Exorcist</i>, that
            turned up increasingly in his films. What Mastroianni did, on the
            other hand, was his business.</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Storey (Matthew Delamere), the son
            of Swiss investment banker Philip Emmenthal (John Standing), has
            just helped his father close a deal in Tokyo to buy a string of
            pachinko parlors when he gets a phone call, from Philip, back in
            Geneva: Mum has suddenly died. Storey returns to the family chateau
            and finds his father in such an overwhelming state of grief over the
            vacancy of a woman in the house that Storey arranges for his father
            to spend time with a pretty young woman to, if not actually do
            anything in bed, at least to take his mind off his emotional state.
            It works: Philip draws Storey into a plan whereby they could fill up
            all those gloomy, vacant rooms in the chateau with a whole array of
            women, all of whom would be at their beck and call.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">These end up including three Asian
            women -- a pachinko parlor addict (Shizuka Inoh), a highly efficient
            accounts executive (Vivian Wu), and a traditionally-dressed Japanese
            girl (Kirina Mano) who wants to learn how to be an &quot;onagata,&quot;
            the traditional actor who plays female parts on the Kabuki stage, so
            she can be even more &quot;feminine&quot; than she already is.
            There's also a former nun (a humorless Toni Collette, speaking with
            a yumpin'-yimminy Swedish accent); a Jane Austin-type equestrian who
            joins them after she falls off her horse (Amanda Plummer, who,
            starkly made-up and wearing a garishly-styled full-length orthopedic
            corset, looks like the Bride of Re-Animator); a woman (Natasha Amal)
            who likes being pregnant all the time (&quot;I'm good at having
            them,&quot; she says about babies); a housemaid (Barbara Sarafian)
            who agrees to join under the condition that she be allowed to wear
            the late lady-of-the-house's hats; and a tease (Polly Walker) who
            stipulates that she'll take-part only under strict contractual
            terms, and then walks about the place issuing demands like, &quot;I
            want my bottom spanked today. With intense robustness.&quot; (The <i>1/2</i>
            of the title is Greenaway's &quot;pièce de résistance&quot; -- he
            has one in all of his films.)<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Of course, what Greenaway is doing
            is addressing the objectification of women, and how men talk their
            way around the fact that they end up objectifying them. This is a
            useful way to short-circuit any criticism that the film could be
            objectifying them, too. Some have responded to the picture with
            intense dissatisfaction, others with guarded approval, but I think
            the film ends up falling somewhere in between these two poles. The
            men's merry banter (and there's plenty of it) is sometimes not-bad,
            but it ends up distancing us from them and from the film, while, in
            turn, the actions of the women who, one by one, emancipate
            themselves from the chateau (something which has a Pauline Reáge
            ring to it that was, probably, intentional), end up having little
            emotional effect on us.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Primarily, once Greenaway gets
            everyone all together, he doesn't do anything with them. No giddy
            explosions of euphoria as couples change partners and bound from one
            embrace to the next, no wild reactions over the exploration of
            boundless possibilities, lest things get too priapic in the film.
            But why summon together eight women when you're only going to
            portray about as much happening as you would get if there were only
            one or two? Despite Storey's assertion that he and Philip are
            following their fantasies to their &quot;exhaustive
            conclusions,&quot; the film itself simply flirts with the material,
            only giving us glimpses of who-knows-what going on, and the studied
            perspective begins to induce an unusual, rather queasy air to the
            proceedings. (One character dies and is dumped, like a sandbag, into
            a lake. Another dies of concupiscence.)<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film is impeccable on a visual
            level, with Sasha Vierny, a longtime colleague on Greenaway's films,
            again doing the cinematography, and with some subtle and cunning
            manipulations and desaturations of the images for effect. Part of
            the costuming and production design was done by the great Emi Wada,
            who has worked on several of Kurosawa's films, among others.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Then there's the fact that most of
            the nudity in the film turns out to be -- ha! ha! fooled you! --
            provided by the two men. Early on, father and son strip-down and
            stand in front of full length mirrors, and Philip wistfully observes
            that Storey's body seems full of &quot;immortality,&quot; while his
            is full of &quot;grief.&quot; Later, at the cemetery, Philip throws
            a fit and starts tearing out of his clothes again completely, in
            public. Considering that John Standing is sixty-six and has done
            extensive TV and film work on both sides of the Atlantic, this is no
            small feat. It took guts for him to comply with Greenaway's
            requests. If only it was for some better cause.</font>
