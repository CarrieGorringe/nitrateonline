<hr size="4" width="60">
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="5"><b>&quot;C</b></font><font size="4">ecilia
was the first to go.&quot;</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It's
hardly a new idea, to read into adolescent girls' suicide something poetic,
passionate, and deeply meaningful. Neither is it a secret that countless girls
have admired Sylvia Plath and Anne Sexton, Joni Mitchell and Tracy Chapman,
seeing in their wounded and inviolate art reflections of themselves, their own
pain and enchantment. Still, Sofia Coppola's directorial debut, <i>The Virgin
Suicides </i>refracts and refines this familiar notion, such that the romance
appears strange and revealing in new ways. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">In
part, this strangeness is a function of the movie's source, Jeffrey Eugenides'
1993 novel. But Coppola's script is more pithy than the book, less concerned
with situating itself in relation to the disturbing phenomenon it describes,
namely, the suicides of the five blond Lisbon sisters, thirteen-year-old Cecilia
(Hanna R. Hall), fourteen-year-old Lux (Kirsten Dunst), fifteen-year-old Bonnie
(Chelsea Swain), sixteen-year-old Mary (A.J. Cook), and seventeen-year-old
Therese (Leslie Hayman). The general shape of the girls' experience is recounted
by Giovanni Ribisi's unseen narrator; as in the novel, his is the collective
voice of the girls' young male neighbors, now looking back on the past with
self-indulgent nostalgia. But the film never pretends to get beneath the girly
surface that so mystifies their chroniclers. Coppola's <i>Virgin Suicides </i>delicately
highlights its narrator's limits, and so, performs much like Mary Harron and
Guinevere Turner's <i>American Psycho. </i>Though, in their themes and
aesthetics, these films couldn't be more different, they both remake novels by
men so that what critics have read as their misogyny or self-preserving
ignorance is more charitably transformed into a genuine lack of understanding:
boys just don't get it. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">This
would be the most obvious interpretation of <i>Virgin Suicides. </i>The boys who
observe and moon over the Lisbon sisters reveal themselves in that collective
voice over to be trapped in an emotional netherworld, an arrested adolescence
that, the film implies, results more or less directly from their inability ever
to know the objects of their infatuation. Set in a Michigan suburb during the
early 1970s, the film takes the boys' restricted point of view, sometimes
imagining scenes they could never witness, other times watching the girls' house
from a distance, using binoculars and telescopes. A haunting soundtrack by the
French band, Air (especially the recurring, nearly weightless theme,
&quot;Playground Love&quot;), and Edward Lachman's cinematography approximate
the boys' combination of longing and confusion. The camera seems to dance over
translucent, gold-inflected surfaces, the kind typical of the decade's
pop-sentimentality and more recently, ironically cheesy evocations of same (as
in Beck and Jon Spencer Blues Explosion music videos). The lovely Lux appears
repeatedly in such images, captured forever in the boys' memories as a Breck
shampoo commercial girl, with sunlight creating sheer, pale yellow halos from
behind her, as her flowery dresses glow transparent, the outlines of her
immaculate thighs barely visible.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Apparently
the boys have been remembering and recalculating the sisters' situation for some
twenty years. Now young men, they invisibly recall their vision of the sisters
cruising the halls at school, in slow motion, moving as if one creature, or less
fearfully, the evenings when they call the girls and play on their stereo, songs
full of yearning and loss by Gilbert O'Sullivan (&quot;Alone Again,
Naturally&quot;) and Jim Croce. In the boys' recollection, the girls
reciprocate, with Carole King and Janice Ian, and you see them as the boys
picture them, lying about in one of their oh-so-feminine bedrooms, their heads
in one another's laps, their fingers trailing over album covers, their dreams
tending to escape. That they desire escape is one of the film's perfect
fictions: you can only go along with it, given what you see. For one thing, you
see the unreasonable restrictions placed on them by Mr. and Mrs. Lisbon (James
Woods and Kathleen Turner), fretful parents loathe to let their precious girls
out of the house, for fear they will be corrupted.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Exhibit
A for the parents' righteous fear is provided in the film's opening moments,
with the invocation of Cecilia's death -- the above-quoted &quot;Cecilia was the
first one to go&quot; -- accompanied by images of her first, unsuccessful
attempt, a bit of tentative wrist slashing that lands her in the hospital. Lying
wan and waif-like in her bed, Cecilia looks out at you, positioned behind her
white-coated pediatrician as he shakes his head. &quot;You're not old
enough,&quot; he says, &quot;to know how bad life gets.&quot; To which Cecilia
has a remarkable and sensible response: &quot;Obviously Doctor, you've never
been a thirteen-year-old girl.&quot; Her wisdom, however, is lost on all the
adults looking after her. Her shrink (Danny De Vito) shows her some Rorschach
blotches and advises her parents that she should socialize with
&quot;boys.&quot; And so, the Lisbons hopefully organize a party in their rec-room
basement. Mom serves punch, dad (a physics teacher at the high school) shows the
guests his model airplanes. His deadly dull explanations of aerodynamics theory
make the kids to slink off one by one. Awkward in their suits and ties, the boys
welcome the arrival of a mentally retarded neighbor, who &quot;sings&quot; a
song, performing everyone else's anxieties and allowing them a focus other then
themselves. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Cecilia
sees through this charade, or so the boys' version of the story goes. They watch
her beg off the rest of the evening and climb the stairs to her bedroom. Within
minutes, she's jumped out her bedroom window and impaled herself on the spiked
iron fence in the front yard below. All the kids rush to see and not see
(alternately craning their necks and turning away in horror), as Mr. Lisbon
tenderly holds her lifeless body so that it doesn't just hang off the fence.
It's an awful moment, and in another movie, it would be tragic spectacle. But in
Coppola's perversely delicate rendering, it's less emphatic, more nuanced. The
next day, workmen appear to dig the fence up and tow it away, while the
neighbors watch, one woman in her tennis costume and another balancing multiple
glasses of iced tea on a tray. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">This
trauma, not surprisingly, frightens the boys but also reignites their
enthrallment with the surviving sisters. One of them steals Cecilia's diary, and
together they pore over its pages, hoping to discover in its dull descriptions
nonevents, the girls' secret selves. Soon their interest becomes focused through
the most popular boy at school, the appropriately named Trip Fontaine (Josh
Hartnett). Cocksure and charming in his way, Trip (introduced swaggering down
the locker-lined high school hallway to Heart's &quot;Magic Man&quot;) finds
himself irresistibly drawn to the unattainable Lux and determines to make her
his date for the prom. At first she demurs, but then invites him to an evening
watching TV at the Lisbon home, where he's treated to a glimpse of her toes on
the coffee table (before Mrs. Lisbon shoos them away) and of her family in
elaborately posed non-action, the girls lounging and their parents fussing. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Trip
is the only boy from these scenes whom you see as an adult (weathered by
substance abuse and other fast living into Michael Paré). His story is, you
quickly learn, full of regrets, mostly, for the film's purposes, concerning his
treatment of Lux. He wins her over and convinces her father to allow her out for
the prom (as long as he provides respectable dates for all the sisters). On the
big night, the girls wear mom-made dresses (no cleavage, baggy cotton fits).
With Lux and Trip voted Queen and King, and Styx's &quot;Come Sail Away&quot;
booming on the soundtrack, the scene drifts into dreamland, though it's hard to
tell whose. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Even
when Lux opens her eyes the next morning, alone on the football field, the movie
doesn't launch into explanations about her disappointment or Trip's panic.
Instead, <i>The Virgin Suicides </i>maintains its careful distance and
deliberate vagueness. Lux's sexual awakening proves disastrous, as such things
do in the minds of boys. Her own feelings remain tantalizingly beyond reach, so
that the boys must impute to her a romantic and self-abhorring misery. How else
can they explain the &quot;oddly shaped emptiness&quot; that swallows up Lux and
her sisters? As the narrator mourns still, long after the events, &quot;It
didn't matter how old they were, or that they were girls, but only that we loved
them, and that they hadn't heard us calling...&quot; What the boys can never
know, of course, is whether the girls heard them calling or not, or whether the
girls cared that they were calling. The boys, though, have to hang onto what
matters to them. This is what <i>The Virgin Suicides, </i>for all its many
ambiguities, makes achingly clear. <o:p>
