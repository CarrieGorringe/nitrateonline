            camera cranes out and over Central Park, swooping down through
            golden leaves dappled with pale autumn light. On the soundtrack,
            Diana Krall sings a soft-pop-jazzy &quot;Let's Fall in Love.&quot;
            The camera picks up beautiful people strolling on sidewalks,
            children running in innocent delight. Everything is bathed in that
            damned autumn light. It's all so charming, so perfect, so completely
            contrived and risible. And this is only the beginning. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Maybe
            I went in to the screening of <i>Autumn in New York</i> with a bad
            attitude. I had read, just days before, that the film would not be
            previewed for critics because critics had laughed and snarked
            throughout one New York City screening. But then director Joan Chen
            complained that MGM's decision was unfair, that her stars -- Richard
            Gere and Winona Ryder -- gave wonderful performances, that the movie
            deserved to be seen without the prejudice that would inevitably fall
            out from not pre-screening. As it turns out, MGM's instincts were
            right, but that doesn't explain how the thing was made in the first
            place. Why didn't someone, at some point, say out loud that it was a
            really, really bad idea? <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">What
            makes this especially ironic is that the characters in <i>Autumn in
            New York</i> remark on its bad-idea-ness frequently: Everyone in the
            film can see that pairing a forty-eight-year-old womanizer with a
            twenty-two-year-old girl dying from a sketchy illness &quot;of the
            heart&quot; is lame, not to mention derivative, unpleasant, and
            pathetic. But there it is, on the big screen in all its
            golden-light-suffused splendor. Allison Burnett's hoary script <i>is</i>
            the one idea, and everyone ends up just filling time, which they
            tend to do by talking about what they're doing than doing it.
            Consider the following insights from the Male Lead's Best Friend:
            &quot;There ain't a right angle in it!&quot; The Female Lead's
            Grandmother: &quot;She's <i>really</i> sick.&quot; The Male Lead:
            &quot;This isn't right.&quot; Or the Female Lead Herself, on hearing
            Male Lead assert that their relationship is a bad idea: &quot;The
            stench of truth.&quot; What do they know that the filmmakers do not?
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">All
            these characters are introduced in the simplest, corniest ways, as
            if effectively jerking tears was a matter of filling in the
            formulaic blanks. We meet womanizer-restaurateur Will (Gere) in the
            aforementioned first autumnal scene, strolling in the park with his
            lissome girlfriend of the moment, Lynn (Jill Hennessey). When she
            catches him flirting with a beauteous pregnant girl, his character
            is pretty much set, but in a slightly tricky way: He's an unfaithful
            and self-involved cad, of course, primed to learn a life-changing
            lesson about the value of family and commitment. As if none of us
            anticipate what's to come when he tells Lynn, &quot;I don't like
            surprises, actually.&quot; Next! <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If
            only it were over at that point. But the movie goes on, for many,
            many more minutes of viscous clichés. First, of course,Will must
            encounter his life-changing teacher (I believe the tagline goes
            something like this: &quot;She taught him how to love, he taught her
            how to live&quot;... um, blecch). She's Charlotte Fielding (Ryder),
            first presented while having her birthday dinner in Will's
            multi-star restaurant, surrounded at her table by a bevy of
            girlfriends wearing what you initially take as ridiculous hats:
            wires and feathers and little stars with glitter sticking out from
            their impeccably-coifed heads. Their number includes a gay male
            friend, apparently included so that the gushing over Will's
            &quot;Sexiest Man Alive&quot; status might be affirmed by both
            genders (Simon, however, is not wearing a hat). Meanwhile, Will's
            prowling about the premises, scoping for babes (his maitre d' and
            best friend John [Anthony LaPaglia] early on offers to keep &quot;a
            chute and a cattle prod by the front door&quot; -- this would be the
            film's version of guy humor). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And
            then, magic. Will and Charlotte's eyes meet across the proverbial
            crowded room, their point of view shots artfully obstructed by
            restaurant decor and passing bodies. And then: more magic. Will
            finds himself being introduced to Charlotte by an old friend,
            namely, her affected grandmother Dolly (Elaine Stritch), who knew
            him back in the day when he was dating her daughter, Charlotte's
            mother. In another movie, you might at this moment imagine a stereo
            needle screeching off the record surface: <i>ffwiiit</i>! But in
            this movie, Dolly's concern that maybe Will shouldn't be dating the
            girl who could have been his daughter (if he'd ever slept with her
            mother, which, everyone insists and contrary to everything else we
            know about him, he did not) is cast aside as square or unromantic or
            even mean-spirited, since she's a bitter alcoholic who's long since
            lost her wealth and good looks. (Dolly inexplicably describes this
            fall from grace in the following terms: &quot;One day you're rich as
            an Arab, the next day you're lucky if you can afford pistachio
            nuts.&quot;)<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            &quot;luminous romance&quot; (as it's termed on the film's very
            fancy website) proceeds apace, because, after all, the girl is dying
            and autumn is a relatively short season in New York. Will escorts
            Charlotte to some upper-crusty dos, and she behaves in a
            categorically giddy-schoolgirlish manner, giggling, batting her
            enormous eyes, twisting her gamine-cut hair and making golly-gee
            faces when they're on the phone and he can't see her (though of
            course, we are subjected to every twitch and grin). Occasionally
            Charlotte mouths a pre-emptive joke about the age thing, such as,
            &quot;I collect antiques.&quot; Most of her dialogue is less direct,
            though, more cloying and cryptic (Will suggests they <i>not</i> kiss
            the first time, and she tilts her head to one side, looks off into
            the distance, and says, &quot;I can smell the rain...&quot; Come
            again?) She fancies Emily Dickinson, and quotes her a lot, as if to
            educate her loutish lover (&quot;Hope is a thing with feathers that
            perches in the soul&quot;), and you know that by the end, he's
            quoting Dickinson back at her, so profoundly mutated is he by
            Charlotte's influence. She goes so far as to dress up as Dickinson
            for a Halloween party, and while dressed-as-a-puppy Will is fooling
            around with his ex (Lynn comes dressed as Audrey Hepburn in <i>Breakfast
            at Tiffany's</i>!), Charlotte's upstairs in her bonnet, telling
            stories about butterflies to the hosts' multitude of children. She
            is so <i>very</i> good. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            if to draw attention to such mushy plot elements, the film includes
            Hallmarkish visual effects, from falling yellow leaves and
            Rockefeller Center ice-skating to roiling river waves beneath a
            bridge to sex scenes shot as clasped hands seen through filtered
            glass. But there are moments when it almost looks like Chen (<i>Xiu
            Xiu: The Sent Down Girl</i>) and DP Changwei Gu (<i>Farewell My
            Lovely</i>) are making a different movie than the one we're seeing.
            The most trivial bits of business turn rather nimble, as when Will's
            work with his chefs is skillfully composed <i>through</i> a series
            of kitchen appliances, run of the mill ballroom dancing suddenly
            resembles an Impressionist painting, or snowy-gray balcony scenes
            become precise visual poems. But alas, these shots are the
            exceptions that prove the film's melodramatic rule. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Since
            everyone knows what happened to Ali McGraw, <i>Autumn in New York</i>
            makes gestures toward complicating its story, that is, by
            complicating Will's story. On a couple of occasions, Charlotte has
            trouble breathing and faints, each time landing in the hospital so
            that her doctor (Mary Beth Hurt, looking very scary) can tell Will
            repeatedly that there's no hope, that no one will perform a
            potentially life-saving operation, that the kid is doomed, etc.
            (Note that the doctor talks to Will, the boyfriend of two months,
            not Charlotte's family or friends, or even Charlotte.) Will's drama
            is trumped up in a couple of ways, one being his frantic search for
            a doctor who will perform the surgery. This amazing and courageous
            surgeon is none other than <i>Oz</i>'s primo Nazi monster, a.k.a.
            Prisoner #92S110, a.k.a. Vern Schillinger, a.k.a. the actor, J.K.
            Simmons. His appearance can only strike terror into the hearts of
            anyone who gets HBO, and can only confirm your worst suspicions
            that, as John tells Will as soon as he meets Charlotte, &quot;The
            whole thing is out of whack.&quot; But the characters in <i>Autumn
            in New York</i>, as privileged as they are, don't have this crucial
            background information. And so they hope for the best. <o:p>
