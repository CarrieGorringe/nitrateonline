            review by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 11 August 2000</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The French comedy writer Francis
            Veber describes the movies that some of his countrymen make by
            saying, &quot;It is boring, so it must be interesting.&quot; Despite
            having won the Grand Jury Prize at last year’s Cannes Film
            Festival, writer-director Bruno Dumont’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Humanité </i>easily falls into this category. Despite covering potent
            topics like murder and voyeurism, the film lumbers for two hours and
            fifteen minutes, leaving its viewer with a feeling of indifference
            that swells with each passing frame.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The movie opens as a
            desperate-looking man stumbles through an open field. From the way
            he runs, it’s hard to believe that he’s actually a cop in the
            small village of Bailleul. Indeed, Pharon De Winter (Emmanuel Schotté)
            has soft doe-like eyes and lives with his bossy mother, so he’s
            hardly the type to put fear into the hearts of criminals. Lonely and
            socially maladroit, he’s so desperate that when a couple are
            having sex, he walks in the open door and gawks at them.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">All of these factors make him a
            joke in the town. Unfortunately, someone has just raped and
            mutilated an eleven-year-old girl, and Pharon has been assigned to
            investigate. If the stress from the case weren’t enough, he spends
            an equal amount of time carousing with a young woman named Domino (Séverine
            Caneele) and her sarcastic, hot-tempered boyfriend Joseph (Phillippe
            Tullier). The two alternate between angry shouting and sweaty
            lovemaking. Nonetheless, Pharon longs for the closeness they seem to
            share and even takes the verbal abuse that occasionally comes with
            being their friend. Hanging around with the two of them leaves
            Pharon with an eternally sour and guilty expression. Of course,
            another reason for his tortured look could be the possibility that
            he is investigating a crime he himself has committed.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The most likely explanation,
            however, is Dumont’s unorthodox and ultimately unsuccessful
            casting technique. The director reportedly scoured the French
            countryside searching for relatively untrained performers to fill
            the roles. On the plus side, his principals look as if they could
            inhabit a town like Bailleul. Their appearances lack the spit polish
            that some professional thespians have. The lack of high-priced
            hairdos makes the movie more naturalistic. Still, there’s no
            substitute for an accomplished thespian’s range. Schotté has a
            single expression: the look of a small boy who has soiled himself.
            Were he able to evoke other emotions, his performance would be far
            more empathetic and certainly more believable. In addition, if
            Schotté is always dour, Caneele and Tullier come across as
            abrasively selfish. Their torrid couplings seem extraneous,
            unconvincing and downright annoying. Rarely has big screen coitus
            seemed more uninviting.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Dumont’s dreary depiction of
            coitus is indicative of the attitude he imbues into the rest of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Humanité</i>.
            While it is commendable that he is willing to treat the story as
            something other than a whodunnit, he finds little that generates
            tension or even a reason to stay awake. His pacing is glacial.
            Worse, he loads the rambling tale with empty back stories (like the
            explanation for Pharon’s <i>ennui</i>) and pointless subplots
            (like a labor strike involving Domino). The long, wide shots and the
            eternity that stretches between them would be easier to take if the
            characters and situations were better conceived. Instead, Dumont
            demands the audience’s attention but offers them little in return.</font></p>
            <p style="tab-stops:94.5pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Without
            likeable or even compelling protagonists, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Humanité</i>’s
