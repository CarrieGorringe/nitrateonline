            review by <a href="../joe.html" target="_top">Joe Barlow</a>, 25 August 2000</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece,
            the crowning gem in a career dedicated to the creation of cinematic
            art, is his 1985 epic, <i>Ran</i>. It is a film whose merits are
            difficult to communicate with words, for these units of language are
            unable to express the overwhelming beauty of the movie's visual
            style -- its grand sweep, its haunting performances, and its
            masterful choreography, which is so precise and graceful that the
            film's battle sequences play out like a glorious ballet. More than
            anything, <i>Ran</i> reveals a confident auteur at the peak of his
            abilities, helming the production he'd been building toward his
            whole life.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Much of <i>Ran</i>'s storyline is
            lifted straight from William Shakespeare's <i>King Lear</i>,
            although many critics have been tempted to interpret the film as an
            allegory to Kurosawa's own life. The tale's main character, the
            Great Lord Hidetora Ichimonji (Tatsuya Nadakai), is, like Kurosawa
            at the time he made the movie, a man entering his sunset years.
            Believing his death to be at hand, the ruler abdicates the throne
            and splits his kingdom into thirds, giving a portion to each of his
            sons. The hierarchy is thus set: the eldest son, Taro (Akira Terao),
            will be the new ruler of the land, while the second and third sons,
            Jiro (Jinpachi Nezu) and Saburo (Daisuke Ryu), are given lesser
            castles over which to preside. In one of the film's most famous
            scenes, Hidetora demonstrates the power of unity to his offspring:
            taking an arrow from his pack, he breaks it across his knee. He then
            repeats the process using two arrows; again they snap, but it is
            much more difficult. Finally, with three arrows held together, the
            bundle cannot be broken. &quot;Three individuals are weak and can
            easily snap,&quot; warns the father. &quot;Three together, however,
            are strong, and will withstand any amount of stress.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The lesson is a good one, and
            Ichmonji hopes that his sons will unite their provinces, forming an
            invincible ruling class. But unfortunately, the optimistic leader
            has underestimated the power of jealousy -- the younger brothers
            immediately begin to resent Taro, while Taro grows so paranoid that
            he spends all his time guarding himself and no time ruling. Soon the
            formerly peaceful country is plunged deep into civil war, with the
            siblings using their newfound power to attack each other's
            territories. Ichmonji, aghast at his sons' behavior, tries to smooth
            things over, but is told that leadership matters are no longer his
            concern. Alienated from his family and having nowhere to go,
            Ichmonji finds himself homeless, forced to spend his days wandering
            the countryside. Very few images in cinematic history are as
            heartwrenchingly pathetic as the sight of the nearly catatonic
            Ichmonji shuffling aimlessly through the bloody battlefields, driven
            to the brink of insanity by the horror he has unwittingly unleashed
            upon his country.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If the film's protagonist has it
            tough, Kurosawa himself had an equally hard time making the movie;
            indeed, the name <i>Ran</i> translates into English as <i>Chaos</i>,
            and a more apt name for the production is difficult to imagine. The
            filming of <i>Ran</i> was interrupted numerous times by a string of
            catastrophes, including a multitude of financial setbacks (including
            a reluctance of Japanese investors to put money into such an
            ambitious production, coupled with both unforeseen cost overruns and
            severe misbudgeting on Kurosawa's behalf). Combined, these problems
            made <i>Ran</i> -- ten years in the making -- the most expensive
            Japanese film ever produced, a title it still holds to this day. Nor
            were matters helped by the seventy-five-year-old director's failing
            eyesight, which deteriorated to almost complete blindness by the
            time the movie was released. As if these weren't enough
            complications, Kurosawa's wife died midway through the shoot;
            although grief-stricken, the director was so pressured to complete
            the film that he halted production for only a single day to mourn.
            But despite all this -- or perhaps because of it -- Kurosawa
            weathered the storm and created one of the finest works ever to
            grace a theater screen.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Ran</i> is not just a great
            film; it's a triumph of cinematic style. Every image on the screen
            breathes with life and color; it comes as no surprise that the movie
            won the 1986 Oscar for Best Costume Design (even if -- incredibly!
            -- it didn't bring home the Best Cinematography or Best Director
            trophies, for which it was also nominated). But don't be fooled by
            the somewhat morbid description I've given; despite its frequently
            bleak tone, <i>Ran</i> is a celebration of life and beauty. Much of
            the plot centers around happier thoughts than those discussed above,
            including the joy of reconciliation, a call for group unity, and the
            power of forgiveness and remorse -- three arrows which are strong
            together indeed.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In celebration of the film's
            fifteenth anniversary, <i>Ran</i> has just been theatrically
            reissued, and you owe it to yourself to catch it on the big screen
            if at all possible. If it's not playing in your town, Fox-Lorber
            also offers <i>Ran</i> in a terrific letterboxed DVD edition. (A
            widescreen VHS version is also available.) Look for it in the
            Foreign section of your favorite video store.</font>
