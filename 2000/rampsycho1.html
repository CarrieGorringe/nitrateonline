Easton Ellis' 1991 novel <i>American Psycho</i> became notorious not only in its
attempts to depict its upwardly-mobile young American business professional,
Patrick Bateman, as being so amoral and soulless that he could perpetrate
inhuman acts of violence with complete impunity, but also for how he would
identify people not by their facial features or the color of their hair, but by
what clothes they wore, as if the only thing he read in <i>Vanity Fair</i> or <i>GQ</i>
were the advertisements instead of the articles. Thus, each character was
introduced, in every scene, by an exhaustive rundown of what they were wearing
and by whom. Some friends attempted to convince me that if you started treating
these designer laundry lists, which took up page after page of the narrative, as
some sort of recurring mantra, the book would start to work in your head. But
after 125 pages I couldn't care less who was wearing Cerutti 1881 or not, and
threw the book across the room. And I hadn't even gotten to any of the really
gross stuff, yet. (which was when my friends promptly threw their copies of the
book across the room.) <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">If
anyone could make a legitimate film out of this opus, it would be Mary Harron,
who previously took the real-life story of Valerie Solanas -- the woman who
believed that the world could only be made a better place by exterminating the
&quot;male species,&quot; and shot Andy Warhol in an attempt to try and start
doing so -- and turned it into a surprisingly evocative, insightful, and even
sympathetic film. Harron has said that she read Ellis' <i>American Psycho</i>
(she was going to school in Oxford at the time of its publication) as a
depiction of male misogyny in America during the 1980s -- post-feminist male
rage. And Patrick Bateman's treatment of women, which ranges from dismissive to
cruel and way, way beyond, can certainly be seen as exemplifying the uneasy
truce that has existed between men and women over the last quarter of a century
(and which was most exquisitely depicted in Mike Leigh's great 1993 film <i>Naked</i>).
<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Near
the beginning of Harron's film, the young men who work as executives at Pearce
and Pearce, the anomalous financial place where Bateman works, are seen milling
about in a conference room. Since everybody has bought the same clothes from the
same designers, they've all started to look the same (The film uses Eighties
&quot;power color&quot; shades of black, grey, chrome, and white predominantly).
Patrick is mistaken for someone else by a visiting executive, and he happily
encourages the guy -- who leaves his business card before departing. One of the
young Pearce and Pearce Turks says, why doesn't he show them his new business
card, fresh from the printer's? The other men examine it, mouth responses -- and
the chrome/silver card cases begin snapping open. Bateman produces his and can
identify its exact type style and paper color. But then one exec displays his --
raised lettering, and, to Bateman's horror, it even has a watermark. They're
like latter-day incarnations of members of the old European courts, making a big
deal about rating particularities because they have nothing else to fill-up
their lives. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Harron's
film is probably going to be attacked for all the wrong reasons: it's either
violent, or not violent enough (the fleeting glimpses of violence, in context
with the rest of the film, are even more frightening than if they were less
fleeting); that it's too mannered (when it's actually ironic) or superficial
(it's reporting on a superficial time, not emulating it); that it's too stylized
(except that people really did wear these clothes, furnish their apartments, go
to these restaurants, and assume these values during that period); that it's too
serious (it's actually quite funny, in parts). The film is hampered by the same
thing as Ellis' novel, in that it asks us to first pay attention to a zero who
can only express himself through increasing acts of mayhem, and comes to depend
upon it more and more (&quot;I'm requiring increasing amounts of homicidal
violence...,&quot; Bateman says, incredulously, at one point, as if discussing
how his medication had just been upped). Ellis exacerbated the violence to the
point where it was criticized for being the novel's only reason for existing.
Harron, though, who did the film's screenplay adaptation with Guinevere Turner,
has made some allowances. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">She's
taken what I can think of as the only workable approach to this sort of
material, one that's slightly distanced yet alert for moments of sardonic humor,
without playing down the gravity of Bateman's misdeeds. Cara Seymour plays a
working-girl whom Bateman picks up on a darkened nighttime corner to take back
to his apartment, where he has her bathe, change into a couturier dress, and
then sit, in anticipation of who-knows-what, while he pontificates on the
meanings and significance of the &quot;oeuvres&quot; of Phil Collins or Whitney
Houston (Harron could not have anticipated, while she was making the film, the
merriment that will be had over that latter choice). In the scene, Harron stays
with Seymour's character, who's scared, trying to hold herself together, because
she has to make a living, while Bateman talks and issues small commands about
how to sit or where to stand, which she must comply with to get her money. The
quiet tension that arises out of the dynamics of the scene is more harrowing
than if it had been done in a more overt, unsophisticated way. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Christian
Bale, who has been doing steady, fine work in films for years, certainly does
more with the role of Patrick Bateman than Leonardo DiCaprio probably ever would
have (In case you were in Nepal last year, it almost looked like DiCaprio was
going to get the part). The actor's arms, legs and torso have been bulked-up to
absurdly pointless perfection, and the results have emphasized a squareness in
Bale's cheekbones and brow, making his face more dynamic, his stare, when it
becomes dark, more imposing. Bale speaks in the rounded, oracular tones of
cultivated cordiality that walks the line between sincerity and disguise (At
times, he sounds like Adam West's jaded businessman in <i>The Marriage of a
Young Stockbroker</i> and, later, <i>The New Age</i>, before he got married, got
a house, and turned to drink). Yet he gives Bateman a slightly quizzical quality
during all this -- as if he's been dropped, out of nowhere, into this godlike
corporeal form, wearing fine clothes, working in a fancy office where he makes
loads of money for doing practically nothing, and he doesn't seem to know quite
what to do with himself. This tension, vibrating like a reed in the wind, is
sustained up until Bateman's eventual, harrowing break. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">In
the final scenes, Harron pulls off an astonishing <i>coup de cinéma</i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>which calls everything that Bateman has done previously in the story into
question. We suddenly realize that what we have been seeing, bad or good, has
all been from his point-of-view. And that, of course, is flawed. Bateman himself
comes to realize that he's at the point where he can no longer be sure how much
of what he's been doing is truly delusional. Someone who was supposed to be dead
is assured to be very much walking-around and alive; in the meantime, Bateman's
ill feelings towards women become more than evident to the one person in his
life who cares about him as a person (Chloe Sevigny, whose ingenuous quality
makes her perfectly cast). Bateman finds himself plunged into a fix where he has
to receive some sort of assurance, some sort of affirmation of himself. At the
film's conclusion, where the famous THIS IS NOT AN EXIT scene is recreated from
Ellis' novel, Bateman looks around him and sees something like the
&quot;infinity&quot; effect that occurs when two mirrors face each other, only,
in the scene, it is done with people, all of whom look alike, all of whom are as
buff-polished and cut-off from caring and existence as he. Bale makes Bateman's
desperation very palpable, very believable, and affecting, as it is revealed
that he is in a prison of his own making, and the occurrence is most chilling.
He needs something from people, and they can never give it to him. He is a
fallen angel who reaches out for redemption, and finds that there's nothing
there. The meanings in Harron's stark film don't come together right away until
well after the final frame has turned to black; the film is a bomb set to
explode in your consciousness by delayed timing.<o:p>
