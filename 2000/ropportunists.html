            Opportunists</font></b></i><b><font face="Verdana" size="2"> reminds
            us that not all people are well-manicured, young, upwardly-mobile
            professionals with Bay Watch-perfect bodies, gleaming Ferraris in
            the garage, and a seemingly endless line of credit. If you were an
            extraterrestrial attempting to study human behavior based on films
            like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Mission: Impossible 2</i>, you’d marvel at these perfect beings with
            perfect lives and seeming immunity from death and debt. In a
            refreshing twist, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Opportunists</i> gives us Victor Kelly (Christopher Walken), a
            deadbeat mechanic whose life in Queens, New York is a cluster of
            greasy-fingered engine repairs, tinny radios, and outdated
            furniture. Like everything he surrounds himself with, Victor is a
            real antique.</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When the movie opens, we’re given
            a glimpse of Victor prodding around under the hood of a tan Riviera
            with an oily crescent wrench. There are no computers, cell phones,
            or DVD players filling space in Victor’s dreary home, but there <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">is</i>
            a pair of orange curtains and some flower decals adorning a grungy
            trailer that this one-time safecracker stashes outside his garage.
            The kitschy, dated look of nearly everything in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Opportunists</i> comes across as a bit of a shock in this age of
            over produced movies that almost always <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">look
            </i>good, even if they’re bad in every other respect.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Written and directed by newcomer
            Myles Connell, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Opportunists</i> makes it clear from the beginning that Victor is
            struggling with a checkered past and a criminal record. The
            consequences of this failed history are everywhere. His
            twentysomething daughter, Miriam (Vera Farmiga), is attempting to
            rebuild some trust and lives with Victor, after his part in a
            burglary resulted in eight years behind bars. But she’s easy on
            her old man. &quot;The last time you got caught,&quot; she says,
            reminding Victor that he’s not a villain, &quot;you gave the money
            back, and got a reduced sentence.&quot;</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Then there’s Pat, a friend from
            his criminal past, eager to talk Victor out of his reformed ways for
            &quot;an easy job&quot;, while a landlord lurks about demanding rent
            money. &quot;Tack on an extra fifteen dollars for the bank
            charge,&quot; he sulks after Victor’s check bounces. Meanwhile,
            Victor’s Aunt Diedre will be asked to leave her assisted living
            residence unless he can bring her account up to date. While
            bartending girlfriend Sally (Cyndi Lauper) is eager to help him out
            with some extra savings, her man is too proud to accept help. Victor
            admits that &quot;being a regular citizen isn’t working out so
            well,&quot; and Sally smells trouble.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Trouble <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">does</i>
            arrive in the form of a young Irishman named Michael (Peter
            McDonald), who claims to be a &quot;cousin.&quot; Fresh off of a
            plane from Dublin, Michael’s presence is welcomed by bored Miriam,
            even as Victor slams the door in his face. &quot;I’m Uncle
            Franco’s son,&quot; Michael insists. &quot;You’re
            mistaken,&quot; fires back Victor. Why would Michael fly across the
            ocean to shack up with this disinterested relative? Because, it
            seems, Victor’s reputation as a safecracker has been inflated
            overseas, where he’s a legend of sorts. Michael has envisioned a
            dapper gangster and a chance at some lucrative action, but when he
            sees Victor as a washed-up, broken man struggling to go straight,
            he’s disappointed. Even so, he’s attracted to Miriam’s spunky
            enthusiasm, and at her insistence, Victor eventually houses Michael
            in a dilapidated old trailer apart from the Kelly home.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Opportunists</i> sorts out this web of relationships, it sets the
            scene for Victor’s inevitable return to crime. And indeed, the
            movie culminates in a low-key heist involving crooked security
            guards, a seedy money transport company, and an unexpected
            revelation concerning Michael. Surprisingly, the film’s finale
            isn’t the despairing downer it seems to be arriving at. There’s
            a redemptive turnaround that, like everything else in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Opportunists</i>, comes across as casual and unforced.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s difficult not to appreciate
            this movie’s uniquely laid-back approach to a sensational subject,
            with Victor’s daily routine painted as anything but the frantic
            and unexpected labyrinth inhabited by Quentin Tarantino’s
            underworld characters. But the film pays a price. By following these
            unexceptional people through their unexceptional steps and catching
            the oftentimes drab <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">sameness</i>
            of real life, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Opportunists</i>
            also comes across as a bit boring. Maybe I’m just another victim
            of today’s MTV quick-cutting and television commercial editing,
            hungry for the rush of Michael Mann or John Woo. Or maybe I’m
            pigeonholing the fine, complex Walken as an actor who should
            specialize only in freaky character roles, like the gallery of
            ghouls he portrayed in<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"> True
            Romance, Pulp Fiction, Sleepy Hollow, and Things to Do in Denver
            When You’re Dead.</i></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Indeed, Victor Kelly might be
            Walken’s most understated role to date. With his friendly but
            defeated approach to a life of downsized dreams, Kelly is a nice
            contrast to the more gullible, optimistic Michael (convincingly
            played by Peter McDonald with a wide-eyed, childlike enthusiasm).
            Tom Noonan also registers strongly as a seen-it-all crook that
            provides Victor with the various tools of his safecracking trade as
            needed.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Does <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Opportunists</i> work? As a relaxed character study, I suppose it
            does. But in acting as a lens with which to view Victor Kelly’s
            somewhat lazy routine, the movie lacks cinematic juice. Following
            Victor around this barren landscape is like watching one of TV’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Survivor</i>
            castaways without the palm trees, exotic beaches, rats, and elusive
            million dollar prize. It feels real, but where’s the hook?</font>
