            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 10 November
            2000</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>Red Planet</b></i><b> turns
            out to be an all-out disaster, and I'm not just referring to the
            story's opening setting. It's 2056, and the Earth has become,
            surprise surprise, so poisoned and polluted that it is beyond saving
            (meaning Bush must've won the election), and plans are underway to
            start moving most of the population to Mars. Astronauts are sent to
            make the final arrangements, but someone must've forgotten to
            install a surge protector onboard the spacecraft, so that, at the
            first solar flare and burst of gamma rays, everything short circuits
            and the whole mission is thrown into chaos and disarray.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">So is the movie, which is riddled
            with gaps in logic and plot from beginning to end. An out-of-control
            landing craft which should've wound up anywhere on Mars sets down on
            the right spot after all. Other calamities occur but are never
            explained. A modem salvaged from an old computer processor is used
            as a sort of wireless mobile phone. Mission control on Earth manages
            to fix massive engine damage in the craft orbiting Mars apparently
            by interplanetary shortwave. The landing crew nearly asphyxiate
            themselves when their oxygen tanks in their spacesuits run out, but
            before checking to see if the outside air is breathable. (It is
            supposed to have been made so already). A fifty-year-old Russian
            space probe is used as an escape craft, but how it is supposed to
            dock with the orbiting ship instead of plowing a hole right through
            is left for us to take on faith.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Then there's the astronauts' robot
            helpmate, which looks like a sinister, more articulated version of
            the robot dogs that are just now hitting the market. A machine
            supplied by the Marines, it still has combat programming loaded into
            it. Naturally, it ends up going berserk, and takes off after the
            crew members. Why would anyone want to take such a thing along on an
            immensely important, risky, and possibly dangerous mission, knowing
            that it could possibly malfunction and start taking offensive action
            against them? (The answer is simple: robots in movies are cool).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film might have worked as a
            straightforward character drama<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

            </b></i>but there are no characters, so there's no emotional
            involvement in what happens to them. The dynamic Carrie-Anne Moss is
            stuck in space for most of the picture, flipping switches and
            wringing her hands. (Her character's name is Bowman, and she's
            involved in an airlock sequence rather similar to the one Keir
            Dullea's Bowman experiences in <i>2001</i>). Down below, most of the
            more interesting cast members are picked off early, while Val Kilmer
            squints and mutters his way into becoming a non-entity. There are
            two instances where he suddenly breaks into a song his
            &quot;grandfather&quot; taught him, the Rolling Stones'
            &quot;Nineteenth Nervous Breakdown<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">.</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
