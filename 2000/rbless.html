            <p class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Well, it should
            be an old saying. And you’d wished the producers thought about
            this before they went through the effort of spending millions on
            this lame turkey. Taking a closer look at one of the men pulling the
            financial strings you’ll see why this clunker got the green light.
            Executive puppeteer Mace Neufeld must be going through the same
            mid-career crisis that afflicted Jerry Bruckheimer. Just as the
            latter’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Coyote Ugly</i>
            reshaped his <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Flashdance</i>,
            Neufeld is returning to a quarter-century-old success (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Omen</i>) hoping to rekindle box office gold after the dregs of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The General’s Daughter</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Lost
            in Space</i>, and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Black Dog</i>.
            Bottom line: Paramount’s got deviled egg on its face. The husband
            and wife scriptwriting team of Clifford and Ellen Green (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Baby</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Space Camp</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Seventh Sign</i>) get rewrite assistance from Tom Rickman (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Coal
            Miner’s Daughter</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Truman</i>),
            but the final dreary effort is just a contrived mishmash of
            been-there-done-that, devil’s-gonna-get-you, cat-and-mouse waste
            of your time. Effects-laden director Chuck Russell may have scored
            well overseas with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Eraser</i>,
            his last effort four years ago, but he’s still riding the now
            threadbare coattails of 1994’s comedy crime fantasy <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The

normal"> </i>and now <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Bless the Days</i> is
            the latest demonic disaster you’d be wise to avoid. If you need a "Save
            My Child From Satan" fix, hold off a month of so for the ultimate
            Linda Blair witch project, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Exorcist</i>, back in enhanced, digitized sound, re-release glory at
            darkened theaters everywhere. For the next few weeks, top-billed Kim
            Basinger’s newest release is another inadequate choice destined to
            make a few more bucks (but not many) that her spring feature <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">I
            Dreamed of Africa</i>. I guess you could double-bill these with the
            tagline "Bless the beasts and the children," but not many of you
            will get the twenty-eight-year-old pun. No one should spend good
            money on either of these films anyway. That’s a BIG hint for those
            of you planning to rent or buy (the fools among you) <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

            the Child</font></i><font size="2" face="Verdana"> starts out with
            cutesy gothic credits, a supernaturally en-chanting score, and the
            typical on-every-corner stone gargoyle outside your Manhattan
            apartment window. If that isn’t enough for psychiatric nurse
            Maggie O’Connor (Basinger) to see the writing on the wall, she has
            a perfect stranger spouting Christmas celestial seasonings at her
            about a Star of Lieberman aligning with Santa Claus, who wins the
            lotto. Well, maybe I missed something with the woman’s Caribbean
            accent (I think she was a Republican, too), but the real fakery
            starts soon enough: the snow’s falling from a cloudless sky. Nine
            days later Maggie’s strung-out, drug addicted sister Jenna (Angela
            Bettis) dumps her fatherless daughter in the lap of her infertile
            sibling before heading back to New York’s rain swept streets for a
            six-year bum’s vacation. Fast forward three, then six years to
            find the ever unlucky in love Maggie devoting her very protective
            affections to raising a semi-autistic Cody (Holliston Coleman) and
            fighting off rodent-filled visions (or are they just lots of little
            Mickey Mice).</font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><o:p>

            <p class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Meanwhile
            6-6-6-year olds are disappearing off the streets of the naked city.
            The cops are too dumb to realize something’s rotten at the core,
            except for FBI agent John Travis (Jimmy Smits), a former seminary
            student and now Big Apple occult-related crime honcho who seems to
            know his bible and tattoos. Unfortunately he doesn’t realize all
            the dead/missing youngsters share the same birth date. December 16,
            1993—if you care. My first thought was: hey, the cops can’t be
            that dumb not to realize a handful of the city’s youngest have a
            similar distinctive date with destiny. Well, perhaps they aren’t
            that smart. But Mr. Big Shot G-Man (actually the screenwriters) must
            have had a complete brain meltdown after the second snatching not to
            start WARNING parents with kids the same age to be on the lookout
            for some really nasty people.</font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><o:p>

            <p class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Soon we realize
            Cody has some "special" abilities, like being able to pop tupperware
            and rattle fine china, an endowment that pops the interest and the
            ever-wide bug eyes of smirk-faced Eric Stark (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Dark
            City</i>’s Rufus Sewell), a.k.a. the Dark Side. Though never fully
            explained, he’s seemingly pulled Jenna off the streets through his
            monstrously successful (according to Leeza Gibbons!) cult-like
            self-help youth organization, Devil Worship for Dummies (a.k.a. The
            New Dawn Foundation: send in your children and $400 contributions
            today) as a means to shanghai her daughter from the flustered aunt.
            He’s even brought along the Zombie Nosferatu Nanny from Hell (Dimitra
            Arlys), who’s short a pint or two of affection.</font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyText"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yeah, it’s
            all a big creepy mess. Ian Holm appears for a minute or two as a
            wheelchair-bound religious scholar that hardens Maggie’s resolve
            with spiritual battle dialogue that just hardens your stomach (hold
            back the laughter!). Christina Ricci has a few scenes as a
            runaway/cult escapee before losing her head waiting for the "F"
            train at Delancey Street. Occasionally we spot angels holding open
            subway doors, watering plants, and throwing a line like "A good man
            is never alone in this world," at a lapsed Catholic here and there.
            Bums get burnt. Nuns pray. And dentists see patients the day before
            Easter (huh?). The dialogue turns to drivel, the characters to
            cardboard, and the plot to a ghoulish stew. The film stumbles into
            one rut-filled chase after another, with cut-rate CGI vermin
            eventually filling the night skies above the suburbs of Albany, New
            York. Surely there are some politicians in the Empire State bold
            enough the outlaw this type of nonsense.</font>
