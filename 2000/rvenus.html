            not going to translate for the American gander. While it may not

            Martin Guerre</i>, and the recent <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">An
            Affair of Love</i>) as the attractive 40-year-old Angèle Piana. She
            carries the psychological baggage of her parents’ love-crossed
            deaths a generation-and-a-half earlier and her own countless
            affairs, back seat quickies, and one-night stands that merely cover
            up a morose psychological sadness. Love, jealousy, and pain are
            behind her, she proclaims, and a plain wrapper passionless future is
            laid out for all of Paris to see behind the window-enshrouded shop.
            Her former boyfriend Jacques (Jacques Bonnaffé) wanders in and out
            the salon, his disfigured face (apparently her fault) a subdued
            reminder of all that can wrong with her love life.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">One
            man’s female trash turns out to be another one’s treasure, and
            while Angèle is given the heave-ho after a three-day tryst, scruffy
            stranger Antoine Dumont (Samuel Le Bihan) admires her spunkish
            resentment from nearby, falling hopelessly for the sad-eyed lady. He
            stoops to conquer her, but has his own burdens to bear, not the
            least being a beautiful twenty-year-old fiancée (Héléne Fillières)
            who is extremely hesitant to end their relationship. As the object
            of his affection, Angèle is less than enthused. She prefers to
            involve herself with her accidental vocation, pseudo-counseling her
            two co-workers, and small talk with the shop’s patron Madame
            Nadine (the fabulous Bulle Ogier, always the object of my
            attention). Newcomer Audrey Tautou (she won one of those Césars) is
            the stunning and meek Marie, a young beautician smitten with big
            tips and pearls by M. Lachenay (Robert Hossein), a rich,
            well-meaning client and ex-pilot bearing the brunt of Angèle’s
            suspicion and ridicule (he has scars that were covered with skin
            from his now-deceased wife’s buttocks). The sultry Mathilde
            Seigner is the semi-dumpy Samantha, the other worker who finds life
            and the approaching Christmas and New Year holiday season too
            depressing to bear. One of the more memorable appearances is by
            Claire Nebout as Madame Buisse, a free spirit who wears nothing but
            an overcoat into the spa and dumps it ceremoniously at the front
            door for all, including many wide-eyed passersby, to gaze at her
            glorious full frontal attributes. As the stalking paramour, Antoine
            has to bear his complicated soul and his heart (especially as he’s
            forced to become a patron himself to get a word or two in to the
            reluctant-to-love Angèle), his free time currently sponsored by a
            church that has commissioned a sculpture from him. Figures he’s an
            headstrong artist.<o:p>

            turned director Tonie Marshall’s film (her first of a handful to
            get commercial release over here) follows the general mundane lives
            of these characters and their relationships, something French
            cineastes gobbled up. And something that American audiences might
            have no appetite for this post-Thanksgiving season. Undoubtedly they
            have enough dysfunction of their own (let alone figuring out who our
            next president will be) to defer time watching another weary Gallic
            variation of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">filme d’amour</i>.<o:p>

            eggnog. It's 105 minutes of misery and solitude.</font></span>
