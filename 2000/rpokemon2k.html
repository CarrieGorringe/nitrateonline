            review by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 21 July 2000</i></font>
            <p style="tab-stops:.5in"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>It’s
            easy to deride Pokémon. Like a lot of popular crazes, it makes
            little sense to the uninitiated, and even its fans admit the whole
            thing gets silly. Nonetheless, the appeal of the Japanese video
            games and trading cards is easy to understand. The creatures
            themselves are exotic but unthreatening. It’s hard not to enjoy
            the sort of imagination that would create an animal that is half
            turtle-half squirrel.</b></font></p>
            <p style="tab-stops:.5in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The movies
            inspired by the game, the cards, and the TV-show are another matter.
            Despite the abundance of odd creatures, neither <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Pokémon:
            The Movie</i> nor its sequel <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Pokémon
            2000</i> is much fun.<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"> </i>For
            all of the strange characters that inhabit the movies, little about
            the flicks inspires wonder or much beyond a yawn.</font></p>
            <p style="tab-stops:.5in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like its
            predecessor, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Pokémon 2000</i>
            is comprised of two segments. The first, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Pikachu’s
            Rescue Adventure</i>, falls short of its title. The "rescue" portion
            of the story is negligible, and the storyline is so thin that it
            could hardly be considered an adventure. The segment begins as the
            little monsters all fall into a giant hole. Falling with them is the
            treacherous talking cat Meowth. He spends a good deal of time
            hanging from a branch while the electric mouse Pikachu wanders
            through a land that is teaming with creatures like him. Legions of
            popular Pokémon make cameos here, but few leave any sort of
            impression. The only ones who have any discernable personalities are
            Pikachu and Meoth. One can learn more about one of these beasts by
            reading a trading card than by watching the entire cartoon. As a
            result, the segment seems less like a movie and more like a numbing
            barrage.</font></p>
            <p style="tab-stops:.5in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Nothing
            improves when the second segment, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Power of One</i>, kicks into gear. This time a Pokémon hunter is
            out to capture three rare and powerful creatures (birds that control
            fire, lightning and ice) so that he can later harness the power of
            the bird of the ocean. His obsession with collecting the creatures
            is never adequately explained. Still, his quest disturbs the natural
            order as freak storms pummel the word. Fortunately, the brave but
            impulsive Pokémon trainer Ash Ketcham and his friends emerge on the
            scene and may be able to rectify the situation. Despite the prospect
            of global catastrophe, this segment never registers because, as with
            the first segment, the filmmakers take their audience for granted.
            The squirming children I witnessed at a recent screening indicate
            the contempt is mutual. The stories are disjointed (Ash is supposed
            to collect three magic spheres, but we never find out how he
            acquired the second one), and the animation is jerky. Furthermore,
            the dub job rarely matches the characters’ lip movements. It’s
            almost as if the committee behind this mess is daring the audience
            to find a moment when they did something right. The irksome puns
            (When a robot fish crashes, Meoth exclaims, "I hope we have carp
            insurance!") don’t help.</font></p>
            <p style="tab-stops:.5in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Those who
            wish to see what Japanese animation has to offer should avoid <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Pokémon
            2000</i> and should instead check out anything that Hayao Miyazaki (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">My
            Neighbor Totoro</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Princess
            Mononoke</i>) has directed. He, like the creators of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Pokémon</i>,
            has made a healthy income from merchandising. Still, he cares enough
            about his visuals, his stories and his fans to make cartoons that do
            more than sell toys. Die-hard Pokémaniacs may like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Pokémon
            2000</i>, but few others will.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana"><o:p>
