            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>For those who
            tend to associate animated films exclusively with the Disney studios
            (and with its financial reach and talent base, it's an easy
            association to make), the name of Aardman Animations might more
            likely to conjure up images of anteaters than of some of the most
            innovative animation to emerge in the last twenty years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>For just about that length of time, Aardman has been arguably
            the most singular force, aside from Will Vinton and his California
            Raisin commercials, in promoting the sorely-neglected genre of clay
            animation. (the term &quot;claymation&quot; has been copyrighted by
            Vinton, and therefore won't be used here to describe Aardman's
            output).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And, yes,
            you’ve definitely seen some of the studio’s eye-popping output,
            even if nothing comes immediately to mind: Peter Gabriel's
            ground-breaking video for &quot;Sledgehammer&quot; and Oscar-winning
            Wallace-and-Gromit outings such as <i>A Grand Day Out</i> (1992) and
            <i>The Wrong Trousers</i> (1993) (both directed by Park and
            co-produced by Lord) are among the best-known.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The real strength of Aardman has been its ability to meld the
            strengths of clay animation – namely, its retention of its status
            as a handicraft and the characters three-dimensionality, which is
            always present and not having to be the result of audience
            assumptions – along with subtly witty scripts.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>By these criteria, <i>Chicken Run</i> can be described, with
            no exaggeration, as the zenith of Park and Lord’s collaborations
            to date.</b></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film opens on
            a lugubriously lit, run-down farm belonging to the evil Mrs. Tweedy
            (Richardson) and her milquetoast husband (Haygarth), and, for its
            inmates, life here is nothing like the zany, bucolic world of <i>The
            Egg and I</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
            chickens are obliged to undergo the arbitrary cruelty of a daily
            &quot;selection&quot; and those who have not met their
            egg-production quota are sent to the chopping block and from there
            to the Tweedy's dining-room table.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The sinister historical analogy is deliberate; for these
            chickens, Tweedy's Farm is a death camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>One way or another, they are not getting out alive (can you
            tell that co-director Park spent two summers on the line in a
            chicken-processing plant?).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Just
            as Mrs. Tweedy has decided to liquidate the camp –- sorry, I mean
            the farm --<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>in the name
            of higher profits (having discovered that there is more money in pot
            pies than in eggs), along flies Rocky the Rooster, whose
            braggadocio-laced tales of daring in the air turn him into the Great
            Feathered Hope.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
            not-too-bashful bantam promises to help the chickens learn to fly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>It’s an unlikely possibility, since their exaggerated
            endomorphic shapes and the idea of any of them taking flight are
            mutually exclusive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Only
            Ginger (Sawalha), the chickens' de facto leader, and the Colonel
            Blimp-like Fowler (Whitrow) see through his transparently phony
            training regimen. There are two questions by the film's mid-point:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>can Ginger keep Mrs. Tweedy's porta-pot pie factory out of
            commission long enough to get the remainder of her friends to
            safety, and can she resist Rocky's charms while doing so?</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">Chicken Run</font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">
            is an effortlessly enjoyable film.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>There's historical quotation for the film buffs:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>the plot line consists of a broad parody of the
            prison-camp-escape film (think of <i>The Great Escape</i> and <i>Stalag
            17</i>:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the
            screenwriters throw out a direct quotation from Billy Wilder's film
            between Mr. Tweedy and the chicken ringleader named Ginger at the
            beginning just to set the ironic tone).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>As mentioned earlier, the animation is top-notch. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>The
            actors are having a ball with their characters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>There are some intense moments, but very few, and the ending,
            suffused with color and optimism, is a worthwhile payoff.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The only thing left to say is this:<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>just go and see <i>Chicken Run</i><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>-- otherwise you’ll feel like a cluck.</font>
