            <p><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Saving
            Grace</font></b></i><b><font face="Verdana" size="2"> could aptly be
            described as &quot;Cheech ‘n Chong meets Merchant-Ivory.&quot;
            Director Nigel Cole’s unlikely pairing of good manners and reefer
            madness is certainly inspired, even if the final reel sends this
            promising premise drifting into thin air, like a cloud of pot smoke
            engulfing a Phish concert. Spinning the offbeat yarn of sheltered
            Grace Trevethan (Brenda Blethyn), a Cornwall widow who uses her
            greenhouse as a marijuana-growing den to pay off the bills left
            behind by an irresponsible spouse, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Saving
            Grace</i> begins at her late husband’s funeral. Seems his
            parachute didn’t open during an ill-fated skydiving adventure,
            making him a messy dirt bullet unfit for an open-casket ceremony.
            But even in the formal confines of his memorial service, people are
            grumbling with such venom that one wonders if the poor schmuck
            wasn’t tossed from the plane. &quot;Bastard owes me money,&quot;
            whispers one bitter burial attendee.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Left to mop up her deceased hubby's
            considerable debt, Grace spends the film morphing from naïve
            hot-house flower to proactive schemer. It’s heartbreaking to see
            this Cornwall socialite awaken from her bubble of rose cultivating
            and ladies’ clubs, only to find a mountain of debt and a mistress
            from her spouse’s shady past. Collection agencies and banks haunt
            the phone line with persistent calls and threats to claim her house.
            Soon, her checks to grounds-keeper Matthew (Craig Ferguson, also the
            film’s co-producer and co-screenwriter) are bouncing, and Grace
            confronts the magnitude of her desperate situation.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Two-time Academy Award nominee
            Brenda Blethyn is superb as a woman in the throes of change. When
            her banker announces that Grace is responsible for 300,000 English
            pounds, and asks her if there’s anything &quot;tucked away,&quot;
            she responds in the manner of a woman kept entirely in the dark
            during her passive, unquestioning marriage to this shifty heel.
            &quot;We have a Swiss bank account,&quot; she chirps hopefully.
            &quot;There’s nothing in it, but we’ve got one!&quot; Meanwhile,
            the ruffled widow takes up cigarette smoking. Huddled next to a
            photo of her not so dearly departed, Grace flicks an ash onto his
            portrait. &quot;Bastard,&quot; she grumbles bitterly.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meanwhile, fellow villagers in her
            Port Liac stomping grounds offer their support. Local merchants
            refuse to let Grace pay for her groceries, and Matthew continues his
            allegiance despite her inability to pay him for groundskeeping
            duties. There’s a reason for this good-natured employee’s
            passivity: it seems that Matthew is cultivating pot plants covertly
            at the local cemetery. He’s not the only one in Cornwall to
            inhale. Many of the residents in this scrubby, impoverished district
            are self-medicating with the leafy sedative, including funeral
            guests who hide their doobies while unknowing cops pursue salmon
            poachers instead. One of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Saving
            Grace</i>’s interesting touches is how the film portrays the Port
            Liac townsfolk as fiercely loyal to one another, while completely
            unconcerned with minor outlaw offenses like reefer rolling.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With the neighborhood casting a
            blind eye towards Matthew’s cannabis-growing, and Grace enduring
            considerable guilt over her inability to reimburse the loyal bloke,
            it’s no great surprise when the down-on-her-luck lady grants
            Matthew his request to house pot plants inside her massive
            greenhouse. &quot;How much are these plants worth?&quot; she asks.
            &quot;The good stuff’s worth more than gold,&quot; replies a
            grinning Matthew.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Soon, the two are scheming to bail
            Grace out of her debt by manufacturing the illicit weed in a
            greenhouse previously confined to the less questionable practice of
            rose growing. It’s worth a chuckle to see this proper English lady
            and her shaggy accomplice sneaking cannabis into the greenhouse,
            even as collectors haul furniture out the front door of her home.
            Eventually, the suspicious lights emanating from her modified pot
            parlor and illuminating the skies like the Close Encounters
            mothership have the locals whispering. However, no one in this
            rebellious, authority-hating town seems to mind. As a neighborhood
            bartender observes, &quot;It seems as though Grace is carrying on
            the local tradition of total contempt for the law.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Saving
            Grace<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"> </b></i>generates
            considerable suspense, as the proper lady-cum-pot cultivator dodges
            threats from bankers while continuing her daring debt-reduction
            scheme. Meanwhile, Blethyn shows Grace’s pain as she continues to
            absorb new revelations about her husband’s shady past. Confronting
            his mistress, Grace asks the seductress why he’d take on an
            outside lover. &quot;I think that he thought you just weren’t
            interested,&quot; offers the woman. &quot;He thought wrong,&quot;
            Grace responds with a betrayed scowl.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Later, there’s a hilarious scene
            where this one-time conservative comes out of her shell and samples
            her wares. &quot;Will you give me one?&quot; she asks Matthew.
            &quot;I want to know what it feels like.&quot; The bewildered
            gardener does a spit take, mistaking his curious employer’s
            comment as a come-on. Later, he introduces her to the pleasures of
            reefer madness: think Kid Rock lighting up with Emma Thompson, and
            you’ve got some idea of the resulting chemistry.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There are terrific supporting roles
            in this Fine Line production, including that of Valerie Edmond as
            Matthew’s girlfriend, who’s harboring a secret and angry at her
            partner’s descent into this criminal venture. Equally fine is Ken
            Campbell as a local policeman who knows more than he lets on.
            Meanwhile, another of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Saving
            Grace</i>’s stars is the Cornish coastal town of Port Liac, with
            its gray rock landscapes and emerald hills tucked alongside the
            white-capped ocean. Dilapidated buildings mesh with a loud ‘n
            proud fishing trade, accented by clusters of crab traps and
            fishnets, conveying the look of a scrappy little town with a history
            of economic reliance on the sea.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What a shame, then, when <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Saving
            Grace</i> ultimately becomes victim to its own lightness, drifting
            away in a cloud of cornball gags. The movie’s earlier tension
            dissolves completely when potentially dangerous drug dealers are
            revealed to be innocuous putzes with hearts of gold, and the local
            cop turns out to be anything but a threat to Grace and her merry
            clan of would-be outlaws. Suppose Grace found that she enjoyed this
            forbidden foray into the dark and daring. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">That </i>would be an intriguing – if more challenging – path to
            take. As it stands, Cole is striving for light comedy, not edgy
            fare. The result is that this feel-good farce delivers moments that
            echo the spirit of similar UK triumphs like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Waking
            Ned Devine<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">, </b></i>even if
            the wrap-up feels like a safe cop-out.</font>
