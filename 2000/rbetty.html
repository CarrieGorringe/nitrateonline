            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>For
            anyone under the impression that a well-conceived character is a
            likable character, a character you can care about, there was Neil
            LaBute who, with his <i>In the Company of Men</i>, responded to that
            idea with an emphatic &quot;I don't think so.&quot; With a story
            driven by two low-level businessmen slugs, one of whom was
            maliciously cruel, the other merely pathetic, the no-budget indie
            told a riveting tale of the rat race gone worse than it already is,
            with the male ego crying out for attention and entitlement. LaBute
            followed that up with a film that supported the original manifesto.
            This time, with <i>Your Friends and Neighbors</i>, all the malice
            and bitterness lacked a context, and although vividly drawn, the
            cold-hearted characters were left out in the cold. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            this context comes <i>Nurse Betty</i>, directed by LaBute but for
            the first time not written by him. That's an important credit
            distinction, because it helps define the movie's significant
            shortcomings. In <i>Nurse</i> Betty, a waitress named Betty (a
            winning Renée Zellweger) comes straight out of the small-town
            working-class-dreamer school. She has a low-paying job, she has a
            philandering jerk of a husband, and she spends every waking hour of
            her day thinking about another world. Except it's not that soap
            opera. It's one called <i>A Reason to Love</i>, a daily serial set
            in a hospital where the hero is a dashing heart surgeon named David
            Ravell, played by an actor named George McCord, played by actor Greg
            Kinnear. When Betty witnesses a horrific act of violence, the shock
            sets her mind afloat, and she loses the ability to distinguish
            between the real world and the soap world. And so she sets out to
            find the love of her life in Los Angeles, the one she's always
            regretted letting go, the one and only Dr. David Ravell. Following
            close behind are Charley (Morgan Freeman) and Wesley (Chris Rock),
            the two hitmen who committed the horrific act that sent Betty into a
            tailspin. They need to finish the job they started, but as soon as
            they learn her story, Charley instantly falls for Betty and
            idealizes her in much the same way she idealizes George McCord/David
            Ravell.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So
            we're looking at a few layers of artifice here, and the movie never
            takes advantage, or depending upon your tastes, never falls into the
            trap, of the built-in postmodern possibilities the story affords.
            There's nothing wrong with avoiding an obvious angle, but there is
            something unsatisfying about what the movie chooses to do with its
            time instead. In the movie's best, most alive scene, when crazy
            deluded Betty inevitably gets to meet actor George in person, the
            unexpected reaction gives the character of George a deepening level.
            When it turns out that the movie intends him as nothing but a
            hissable fall guy, another male jerk to contrast against Betty's
            angelic, irreproachable innocence, the movie's real agenda becomes
            disappointingly clear. Nurse Betty, the movie, wants you the
            audience to like it so badly that it awkwardly and maliciously
            strives for likableness on all fronts. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            choosing this script as his next film project after the critical
            drubbing he took for <i>Neighbors</i>, a script that goes so clearly
            against his prior artistic instincts, it appears that LaBute has
            attempted a rather massive over-correction. He should have stuck to
            the lesson his first movie conveyed in such exhilarating fashion.
            Likableness does not necessarily translate into something worth
            watching. His reasons for picking the script are certainly more
            complex than that, but they don't much matter in the execution,
            because in the execution, all attempts to find substantial ground
            are muffled. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Underneath
            all its plot gyrations and personality quirks, nothing in <i>Nurse
            Betty</i> is propelled by anything but the bluntest human
            motivations. The plot is aimed at Betty finding her true self, but
            it accomplishes that from an off-putting distance. John C. Richards'
            and James Flamberg's script, which won the screenwriting award at
            this year's Cannes, dedicates all kinds of time to laughing at poor
            old Betty, as she interacts with people who are understandably slow
            to realize the nature of her dissociative sensibilities, but it
            comes up painfully short on any real examination of who she is.
            There's no Betty underneath the nurse. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So
            if <i>Nurse Betty</i> is not character study, and it is not social
            satire or media satire, what is it? Good movies certainly don't need
            to be pigeonholed movies, but Nurse Betty never quite seems to know
            what it wants to do or be. It portrays a candy-coated sitcom small
            town where a character can get his scalp sliced off. Too much of it
            has the feel of quirkiness for quirk's sake, and the desires and
            actions of its inhabitants often feel determined by an authorial
            agenda rather than by any impulse that flows naturally out of their
            personalities. That agenda turns out to be aimed at forcing all of
            the story's disparate bits into little more than a banal ode to
            following your dreams. There's nothing wrong with the message, only
            the medium. For all of its broad movements in tone and character
            mindsets and physical locations, <i>Nurse Betty</i> never gets to
            travel very far. <o:p>
