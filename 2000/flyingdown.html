<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There may not be a statue for screenwriter
Frances Marion, but Turner Classic Movies is helping to make sure her remarkable
legacy is remembered. All through August, TCM will be broadcasting films made by
Frances Marion and other influential women filmmakers. Viewers can now sample
through Marion’s directorial effort <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
Love Light</i> (1920) on August 3 or her remarkably intelligent silent
adaptation of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Scarlet Letter</i>
(1926) on August 31.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Many of these films are not currently available
on video and have never before been seen by television viewers. This previous
neglect is particularly troublesome for the work of Frances Marion because she
was one of the more innovative and skilled filmmakers of any gender. She penned
the innovative prison drama <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Big House</i>
and based her work on visits to real prisons. Her work on that film and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
Champ </i>made her the first multiple Oscar-winner. She was also Hollywood’s
highest-paid screenwriter and was a favored scribe for stars like Mary Pickford,
Lillian Gish, Wallace Berry, Greta Garbo and MGM production head Irving Thalberg.
With almost 200 filmed scripts to her name, it’s a wonder she also had time to
be a painter, a sculptor, a World War I correspondent and a single mother after
the death of her husband, cowboy actor Fred Thompson. Her accomplishments seem
even more remarkable because they occurred during a time when little was
expected from women.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Writer Cari Beauchamp has been helping to keep
Frances Marion in the spotlight. She penned the biography <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Without
Lying Down: Frances Marion and the Powerful Women of Early Hollywood</i>, which
was chosen as one of the most Notable Books of the Year (1996) by <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The New York Times</i>. It was also named Outstanding Book of the Year
by the National Theater Library Association. With director Bridget Terry, she
has produced and written the documentary <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Without
Lying Down: Frances Marion and the Power of Women in Early Hollywood</i>.
Narrated by Uma Thurman, the film features interviews with Beauchamp, Brownlow,
Leonard Maltin and contemporary filmmakers like Martha Coolidge (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Rambling
Rose</i>) and Robin Swicord (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Little Women</i>,
1994). It also includes brief samples of Marion’s work read by actress Kathy
Bates. Beauchamp was preparing for a New York screening and panel discussion of
the documentary when reached at her home in Los Angeles.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>Dan Lybarger:</i></b> I was pleasantly
surprised when you got to make this documentary because Frances Marion, despite
the fact that she was a major filmmaker, is not a household name.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>Cari Beauchamp:</i></b> 
Not only that, but one of the
things that was brought up in some of the pitch meetings was that her story
wasn’t particularly sexy: She wasn’t a loner; she wasn’t a victim. In
fact, it’s a complicated story to tell because her friends were such an
important part of her life. It’s different in that way, and it was more of a
challenge to "sell."</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>Turner
Classic Movies is not only broadcasting your documentary, but they’re also
going to be showing a lot of the work by Frances Marion and other women
filmmakers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CB: </i></b>They’re showing a night of Frances Marion films, about four or five of them.
They’re showing a couple that haven’t been seen [on television] before like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
Secret Six</i>. Then of course, Turner’s also restored <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
Scarlet Letter</i> and put in 20 minutes of footage that’s been missing for
decades. They’ve commissioned a new score for it. I couldn’t be more
thrilled than to have it back in one piece again because it’s one of Lillian
Gish’s finest works. It hasn’t been screened because so much was missing. It
was so chopped up. To have it restored is such a pleasure.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Half the films are silent including Lois
Weber’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Where are my Children?</i><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>You think of what Lois Weber was doing in 1915 and 1916 with split
screens and her filming on location in real houses. She was an innovator, and we
don’t think of that now.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We look at <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
Big House</i> now, and if you look at it out of context, you think, "My
goodness. What a bunch of clichés!" No, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
Big House </i>was the first prison movie. There were no such clichés because
never before had the audience heard the prison door slam or 900 prisoners
shuffling down the hallway. This was the first time.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>DL:</b>
 </i>
The documentary covers that adaptation of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
Scarlet Letter</i> in some detail. When I was reading your book, I was
continually struck by how some of the scripts that preceded hers bore a
frightening resemblance to the Demi Moore version of the movie.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>CB:</b>
 </i>
There were at least three full scripts that were turned in before Frances came
in, also a variety of letters and conference notes that went with them. My
personal favorite was the script that suggested they change the letter "A"
to a different letter that represented something less offensive. They were
self-censoring at that point. One of (the scripts) had a happy ending with
everybody getting on the boat and heading off to England [Starting to laugh].
There were no limits to the changes they were willing to make, and [Irving]
Thalberg wasn’t willing to make the changes, so he called in Frances Marion.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I was sitting there by myself in the USC
reading room. I was all by myself except for this poor work-study student who
had to sit there just because I’m in there reading these valuable scripts.
You’re reading for hours on end, and when I ran across the suggestion that
they change the letter "A" to something less offensive, I literally heard
myself think "Oh, my God!" and just started to laugh out loud. The poor
[student] looked up and thought I’d gone crazy.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>DL:</b>
 </i>
In the documentary you demonstrate how director Victor Sjöström followed
Frances Marion’s script to the letter in many cases, even her instructions on
shot selection and editing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>CB:</b>
 </i>
He had the lighting and obviously set the wonderful mood. The four of them --
Frances Marion, Victor Sjostrom, Lars Hanson, and Lillian Gish -- had a
gold mine together because they got along well and worked well together. It was
a collaborative effort.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Having said that, Kevin Brownlow says how much
easier it was writers to write a talkie than a silent film. It was less
restrictive for writers to use dialogue because before they had been limited to
writing pantomime. They had to be able to write movies that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">moved</i>. One of the games Frances would play with herself was to use
the fewest number of titles possible. She wanted to be able to show the
character in pantomime. What we do with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
Scarlet Letter</i> in the documentary is have the voice of Frances Marion
[played by Kathy Bates] literally reading from her script. Her script is down to
"Mid Camera Angle," "cut to Bells tolling," "long shot of puritans walking." Her script for <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Scarlet
Letter</i> is loaded with set decoration and camera angles, and that’s more or
less followed. When we have the scene where Frances is talking from her script
and Lillian is acting, Lillian is following [Marion’s] script word-for-word.
That’s not to take away from Lillian Gish’s brilliance. I think it’s one
of her finest performances, but she is following what Frances wrote in that
script.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>DL:</b>
 </i>
After watching her movies, it’s obvious that Frances Marion had radar
concerning what to keep and cut from her source material.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>CB:</b>  </i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
Scarlet Letter</i> is, I think, the pinnacle of her adaptations. She had done <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Stella
Dallas</i>. The silent is much more moving than the later talkie. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Stella
Dallas</i> was maybe more difficult because it’s told in flashback, and
[Marion] "un-flashbacks" it. In <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
Scarlet Letter</i>, she had to make a modern heroine out of Hester Prynne. Here
she was trying to sell this story, an 1850 novel about Puritan New England, to a
Jazz-Age audience. It’s not the story that one would expect to have audiences
lining up around the block to see [laughs]. It’s also a very passionate story,
and [recalling] the challenge of adapting it is one of the joys of doing the
book first. Read her script. Read the novel. Go read her script again. You see
what she leaves out. You see that the novel is Dimmsdale’s story. In the
movie, it’s Hester Prynne’s story. The novel is Dimmesdale’s tortured
mental path toward confession. Pages and pages of the novel are his own
monologue in his own mind. This not stuff that’s made for movies, but I think
the essence of the story is very clearly there. [Marion] gets it down but tells
it in a different light.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>DL:</i></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
What’s also interesting about Marion’s movies is that even the villains are
three-dimensional.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>CB:</b>
 </i>
Any good writer knows that your hero or your heroine has to have a flaw or two,
but Frances always took that one step further and gave her bad guys sympathetic
quirks, and almost always in the first ten minutes of the film. You could never
totally root against the bad guys. In <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
Secret Six</i>, Wallace Beery in the great crime lord of Old Chicago, and yet
he’s always the little boy who always drinks milk. In <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Big House</i>, [Beery] is the most violent prisoner on the block in
San Quentin, and yet there’s this bluster when he pretends that he’s able to
read when he really can’t, and that pulls at the heartstrings a bit. When he
talks about his mother when after he learns she’s died, you have some sympathy
for this guy who has a sensitive side.</o:p></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><i><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></b></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">
In the documentary, you prove there’s no such thing as a "woman’s" film.
Frances Marion’s output was remarkably diverse.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>CB:</b>
 </i>
Her two Oscars were both for two films that immediately put the lie to the idea
that women only write "women’s" films and "matinee weepers." <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Big House</i> was the first real talking film to take place in
prison, and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Champ </i>was the classic
boxing film. It really shows that not only she could, but that [women] were
encouraged to do every single genre. June Mathis wrote <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Ben Hur</i>, and Bess Meredith finished it. June Mathis did <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
Four Horseman of the Apocalypse</i> and a huge series of films starring
Strongheart, the predecessor to Rin Tin Tin, Adela Rogers-St. Johns wrote comic
westerns as well, and Bess Meredith wrote <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Zorro</i>.
They did everything.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><i><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></b></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">
One of the more effective moments in the documentary is when you recall how the
male executives despised Frances Marion and Mary Pickford’s first movie
together, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Poor Little Rich Girl</i>, but
audiences loved it. It matched what a lot of contemporary women filmmakers seem
to go through now.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>CB:</b>
 </i>
They thought that what they had done was very clever and fun. They had never had
more fun on a set, and then were greeted with that kind of fear. The situation
with [producer] Adolph Zukor was if it works, we’ll make money. If it
doesn’t work, I’ve got Mary Pickford right back under my thumb, which is
where she belongs. They thought it was so bad because it was so different. That
was the film that created the little-girl persona of Mary Pickford.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There was an interesting piece in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The New York Times</i> by Molly Haskell about a spate of films that have
come out about young women’s sexuality from women directors. It was an aspect
that had just not been on the screen before. Again though, one of my
screenwriting friends says, "I’m still waiting for the call to adapt Elmore
Leonard." Women writers and directors are much more slotted today than they
were in the twenties. You have to admire [director] Betty Thomas. She’s doing
films like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Brady Bunch</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Doctor Doolittle</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Private
Parts</i>. [Women filmmakers] have to be free to do those things, too.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>DL: </i> </font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Marion
was also a noteworthy talent scout.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>CB:</b>
 </i>One of my favorite Frances quotes is, "My boys come first, and then it’s a
photo finish between your work and your friends." Now her friends would have
said it wasn’t a photo finish at all. She gave more to her friends than she
did to her work. Although she would make light of her work, she would get up at
five in the morning to write. She cared very much about what she wrote. I do,
however, think that one of the reasons she was so successful over so long a time
and being able to write such incredible characters was that she really cared
about people. If she had gone through a day without helping people, it wasn’t
a full day. It was part of her joy in filmmaking to nurture someone.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When [producer] Sam Goldwyn’s secretary said,
"My boyfriend wants to be in the movies. Could you just take a look at him?"
She looked out the window and saw this 6’2" guy standing there and went,
&quot;Hm, hm, hm.&quot; She said, "Sure. Bring him in, and let’s see his test."
Sam Goldwyn didn’t think he had anything going for him, and Frances fought for
him to the point to where she brought in all the secretaries, and when Gary
Cooper’s screen test came on, the &quot;ah’s&quot; were audible. Because of that,
he was cast as Abe Lee in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Winning of
Barbara Worth</i>. Frances always said that she didn’t know if she felt
sorrier for Sam Goldwyn because didn’t have the faith to sign him to a
long-term contract or for Goldwyn’s secretary who very shortly afterwards lost
Gary Cooper to Clara Bow. The night after that movie was screened, Paramount
signed him to a long-term contract.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Frances also fought hard to have Clark Gable
cast as the romantic lead in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Secret
Six</i>. When he wasn’t, she went back and methodically rewrote the part to
give him a little bit of comedy and show of that smile and to show him as, "the kind of guy who wasn’t a good guy and wasn’t threatening to men but
was attractive enough to women that they would say, ‘If I could get my hands
on him, I could straighten him out.’" That’s exactly the kind of character
she wrote for him. Again, he took off. He always went back to Frances with every
script he was given. One of the fights he got into with [Louis B.] Mayer was
about <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Parnell</i> [one of Gable’s rare flops]. She said he shouldn’t be in
that. The other that she said there was nothing there for him was <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Adventure</i>,
the movie with the slogan, "Gable’s back, and Garson’s got him." He was
back from [World War II], and she said, "You’ve got to give him more to do
than mooning over some babe even if it’s Greer Garson.”" [Marion] went to the
mat for him. They stayed friends forever. She loved him because he was not at
all pretentious. He took his work serious, but he never took himself seriously.</o:p>

How did you and director Bridget Terry split duties?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CB: </i> </b>We
co-produced and co-wrote it. We really co-wrote it. Bridget directed, and it’s
based on my book. It does get a little old. "Written and produced by Bridget
Terry and Cari Beachamp. Directed by Bridget Terry. Based on the book by Cari
Beauchamp." [Laughs] When you are writing a documentary, it’s entirely
different than writing a book because your writing is dictated in part by: one,
the interviews;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>two, the era
footage that you have, and three,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>you’re
showing a story, not just telling one.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>DL:</b>
 </i>
What kind of impact have you had with the book and the documentary?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>CB: </b></i>When the book first came out, Lynda Obst [the
producer of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Contact</i> and author of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Hello,
He Lied</i>] greeted me with this huge hug and said, "My God! I thought it
started with [fifties B-movie director] Ida Lupino.”" [Paramount Pictures
Chairman] Sherry Lansing called and said, "Thank you for giving me my history." I just find time and time again in different ways [women filmmakers]
instead of viewing themselves as isolated incidents, the ability for women to
see themselves as a link in a chain just gives them tremendous strength and
courage. Even a residual effect of this if fabulous.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I do think men take for granted their history.
They know their history. They know there have been all these other men who done
all these things. I’m not saying that men have it easier in any way because
they have a set of expectations put on them that I would never want to have to
deal with. Having said, that [<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Without
Lying Down</i>] is not a revisionist history. It’s an excavated history. It
was always there. It just hasn’t had the spotlight on it, and this documentary
allows us, albeit briefly, to turn the spotlight on a group of women at a brief
wonderful time when Hollywood was a magnet for creative women. It was not only a
magnet; it nurtured creative women.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>DL:</i></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
Isn’t ironic that the person who paid for half of this documentary is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>CB: </b></i>Yeah,
but you know, my thinking was he’d already made the money [lets out a loud
chuckle], and there are a lot of ways he could spend it. The fact that he could
