            seen the trailer for <i>Coyote Ugly</i>: Girls dancing on a bar.
            Girls in tight leather pants stomping their cowboy boots in time
            with INXS, sliding between each other's legs, dousing each other
            with pitchers of ice water. Girls flinging their lusciously long
            hair for a crowd of yee-hawing guys. It looks like some kind of fun,
            the kind that would have been so transgressive and wild back in, oh,
            say, 1956. These days, such imagery is more ridiculous than
            rebellious, but still, the movie's promotional staff has been
            working overtime to publicize its &quot;do-me feminist&quot; theme:
            in the year 2000 -- when <i>Stuff</i> magazine and <i>The Man Show</i>
            rule (dude!) -- girls are baring it all because they feel empowered
            and emancipated when they do so. And if you need a clue, follow the
            bouncing newbie, the perky small-town blonde who becomes a better
            woman for surviving her trials and traumas in the big city. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If
            all this sounds familiar, that's because it's the plot of countless
            movies about girls growing up into stars of some kind, from Ruby
            Keeler in <i>Footlight Parade</i> and Katharine Hepburn in <i>Stage
            Door</i>, to any of the <i>Star Is Born</i>s, to Diane Keaton in <i>Annie
            Hall</i> and Jennifer Beals in <i>Flashdance</i>. This last is an
            especially resonant precursor, being the film that put producer
            Jerry Bruckheimer on the blockbuster map, way back in 1983. Since
            then, of course, Bruckheimer's action flicks (<i>Top Gun</i>, <i>Beverly
            Hills Cop</i>, <i>Bad Boys</i>, <i>Con Air</i>, etc., many made with
            his late partner Don Simpson) have reigned supreme at the box
            office. And because his biggest successes are aggressively
            guy-focused, the return here to a girl's story almost seems
            nostalgic. What's more surprising, frankly, is that for the first
            forty minutes or so, the girls and women in <i>Coyote Ugly</i> are
            almost respectable, as characters. They're less reduced to T&amp;A
            (as you'd guess from the trailer) than they are passionately
            independent, passably intelligent, and definitely not taking any
            shit from their over-stimulated male bar patrons, whom one
            &quot;coyote&quot; describes as having &quot;little toddlers in
            their pants.&quot; (Put another way, they are in much better shape
            than any woman character in Paul Verhoeven's insipidly misogynistic
            and mean-spirited <i>Hollow Man</i>, opening down the way from this
            film at your multiplex.)<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            first scenes of the film take place far from its primary location,
            the excessively stylized and very white East Village saloon, named
            Coyote Ugly and based loosely on a &quot;real&quot; joint. At first,
            pretty Violet (Piper Perabo) is working her last shift at a South
            Amboy, New Jersey pizza parlor, where everyone knows her name, as
            well as the fact that she's about to embark on a new life. Within
            minutes, she's saying sad goodbyes to her tollbooth-clerking dad
            (John Goodman) and her best chum since childhood, Gloria (Melanie
            Lynskey), who has a broad NJ accent even though Violet has none
            (Violet being the Perfectly Bland Neutrogena Model Girl). Gloria
            drives Violet across the bridge forty-two miles to her new downtown
            crib, which is seedy and small, decidedly less unbelievably grand
            than <i>Flashdance</i>'s loft, but still affording a rooftop where
            Violet can play her keyboard and sing her heart out; or rather,
            LeAnne Rimes sings Diane Warren pop-ballads, while Perabo
            lip-synchs; or rather again, according to the press materials, Rimes
            &quot;embellishes&quot; Perabo's vocals. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So
            here's the sort-of twist: Violet wants to be a songwriter, not a
            singer. Because she has terrible stage fright, she believes that her
            talent is composition. Just her luck, in this day and age,
            singer-songwriters are the thing, and so she must perform your work
            to get noticed. Though her apartment is burgled one night to
            illustrate how down on her luck she's feeling, Violet remains even
            more resiliently naïve and sugary than Jennifer Love Hewitt in <i>Time
            of Your Life</i>, determined to &quot;leave a tape&quot; and be
            discovered (eventually, she learns that she needs to have a neato
            carefully product-placed Mac and burn her songs onto CDs to get an
            audition). One agency receptionist, played by Ellen Cleghorn (and
            what is <i>her</i> career up to these days?) snaps Violet (and us)
            to quick, hilarious attention with a monologue that's more in touch
            with NYC reality than anything else in the movie. But this is a
            momentary diversion, and soon enough, we're back on track, following
            our girl through the standard melancholy montage-time: traipsing
            from agency to agency, writing more goopy girl music on the roof,
            and finally, drawing much-needed (as in, welcome to the twenty-first
            century!) inspiration from a B-Boy practicing his moves in an
            apartment across the way. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Though
            Violet meets the ideal boyfriend on her first day in town (a
            charming Australian named Kevin, played by Adam Garcia), the film
            banks on her sense of professional rejection and desperation, which
            makes it okay for her to take a job at Coyote Ugly. She comes on the
            idea when she sees three dancer-bartenders at a cafe after work,
            flashing their cash and even executing a few moves for the
            late-night diners. Don't look away during this scene, because it
            comprises two of Tyra Banks' seven or so minutes on screen, as her
            character -- Zoe -- is heading off to law school (don't even ask),
            in order to open up a spot as a &quot;coyote&quot; at the
            not-quite-legal establishment. The other girls are first-time
            feature actors and buxom lasses, the kind Adam Corolla and company
            calls &quot;juggies&quot;: Izabella Miko plays the ever-so-nice
            Cammie, Bridget Moynahan the hard-hearted Rachel (she of the
            fire-breathing gimmick in the TV ads). These two opposites give
            Violet a place to fit in between: self-confident but not too
            belligerent about it. All the &quot;Bar Belles,&quot; including
            Maria Bello, who plays the bar's owner, named, of course, Lil, are
            featured in this month's <i>Maxim</i> magazine, wearing various
            black leather outfits. The accompanying text approximates actual
            interviews (Perabo: &quot;I'm not a tropical drink girl. A can of
            Schaefer is fine&quot;; Banks: &quot;I can show me people that I
            have a crazy side and that I'm not just a sex kitten&quot;), but
            it's clear enough what's important about these girls: they're ready
            to party. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Perhaps
            more intriguingly, they're long past Ally McBeal's
            &quot;post-feminist&quot; yearning and uncertainty. They're
            unapologetic, self-assertive, and full of sand. With such excellent
            role models, can there be any doubt that Violet will become a star?
            At work, she learns to toss bottles while pouring shots, dance on
            the bar, and pacify drunken-asshole customers. Miraculously, during
            a near-riot one night, she also learns that she can sing in front of
            a live audience, even if only along with the (creaky) Coyote Ugly
            jukebox faves, Don Henley, Def Leppard, Blondie, and the Stray Cats.
            And wouldn't you know, with just the right amount of needling from
            her coworkers, loving support from Kevin (oh yeah, him), and a mix
            of guilt-tripping/conditional-loving from dad, Violet takes the
            appropriate risks and learns some crucial lessons about herself.
            After all the semi-outrageous bar-behavior, the film's speedy
            descent into conventional melodrama and moral punch lines does seem
            a bit silly. But it's also instructive. The coyotes are total
            pop-packages, the Supreme Chicks, trashy and hip, but with a vague
            air of autonomy, almost like they've thought up their dance-moves
            and attitudes themselves.</font></span>
