            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>I’ll admit this up front.
            Jackie Chan’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Legend of Drunken Master</i> lacks the somber dignity of a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Schindler’s
            List</i>, the emotional pull of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Terms
            of Endearment</i>, and the resonance of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Citizen
            Kane. </i>In other words, it’s not likely to have Chan racing to
            the podium to pick up any Oscars next March (although I’m sure
            that the stunt god’s theatrics would make Roberto Benigni look
            absolutely catatonic by comparison, were the occasion ever to come
            about). But this sensational showcase of martial arts genius
            certainly deserves to win <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">something</i>.
            After all, how many of the above critics’ favorites boasted any of
            the following jaw-dropping kung fu moments: a.) two foes sparring
            with spears beneath a train, twirling and jabbing their weapons in
            the manner of manic baton-twirlers; b.) Chan’s lovable hero Wong
            Fei Hung fending off an army of axe-wielding assailants, trapping
            their hands inside a tube of split bamboo as they zero in on him
            like persistent mosquitoes; c.) Wong’s durable backside skidding
            over a vat of red-hot coals, like a kid diving onto a slip ‘n
            slide in the summer heat; d.) Wong going &quot;mano a mano&quot;
            with a furious-footed kick fighter (Ken Lo), whose lower extremities
            twist, jerk, and thrust like Elvis after his fifteenth pot of
            coffee. And I haven’t even mentioned the fire-breathing scene.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jackie Chan’s recent film
            releases have fallen into one of two categories: widely-publicized,
            high visibility American releases like this year’s Touchstone
            comedy <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Shanghai Noon</i>, and
            a back-catalogue of re-issued Hong Kong movies, such as 1997’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Operation
            Condor</i> (originally released as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Armor
            of God II</i> during its 1990 Hong Kong premiere).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The U.S. productions have favored a tried ‘n true, urban
            &quot;buddy movie&quot; formula: 1998’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Rush
            Hour</i> coupled Chan with motormouth comedian Chris Tucker, in what
            might be described as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Lethal Weapon Lite</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile,
            the older movies, resurrected in the States by Dimension Films, have
            superior action and stuntwork, but suffer from obvious dubbing and a
            comparably low-budget feel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>1996’s

            <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Legend of Drunken Master</i>
            is another vintage Chan flick that’s been culled from the
            archives.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, this
            gem leads head and shoulders above the rest, emerging as Chan’s
            piece de resistance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Chan
            is currently pushing fifty, and his notoriously dangerous,
            &quot;I’ll do it myself&quot; approach to stunt work has mellowed
            some in recent years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The</i>
            <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Legend of Drunken Master</i>
            was the pinnacle of his physically comedic approach to Kung Fu, with
            Chan’s self-assured, graceful ballet of movement contrasting the
            insanely hazardous perils he faced.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Unlike recent, unsatisfying actioners such as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Mission: Impossible II</i>, where the audience suffers through dreary,
            expository passages waiting for the big action payoff, this
            resurrected masterpiece is savvy enough to weave its many fight
            scenes throughout the film.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
            takes off like a gunshot, and builds up with the momentum of the
            Millenium Falcon jumping to light speed.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film opens as Chan’s
            well-meaning but trouble-finding hero Wong Fei Hung (based on an
            actual kung fu legend from 1920’s-era China) boards a train,
            intending to deliver a ginseng plant to his stern, herb salesman
            father (Ti Lung).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
            when he accidentally misplaces the ginseng, exiting the train with a
            valuable Chinese artifact, Wong unveils an English Ambassador’s
            plan to smuggle priceless Chinese antiques out of the country.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There’s a funny bit involving
            Wong’s attempts to pawn off the roots of a bonsai tree as the
            missing ginseng herb, to one of his father’s unsuspecting
            customers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile,
            Wong gets into a street skirmish with a bullying steel mill foreman,
            in one of many prolonged, exhausting fights where Chan incorporates
            a kung fu style known as &quot;drunken boxing.&quot; According to
            the rules of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Drunken
            Master’s</i> eccentric universe, booze is to the kung fu master
            what spinach is to Popeye. It’s not long before Wong’s mother
            (Anita Mui) is tossing him booze from the sidelines and watching him
            pound the attacker into mincemeat with each consecutive sip of this
            alcoholic fuel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Such &quot;drunken boxing&quot;
            bouts are among the most elaborately staged spectacles ever filmed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Chan sways to and fro like a jack-in-the-box sprung from its
            holding box, staggering like a wino but punching at the speed of a
            punk drummer thrashing his trapset.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Meanwhile, his charming, clownish humor is also evident, as
            he projects a crooked, soused grin: at one point, Wong even resorts
            to chugging gasoline, before burping up a cluster of bubbles and
            exhaling flames like Gene Simmons of Kiss.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Legend of Drunken Master</i> culminates in Wong’s linking of the
            antique-smuggling operation to a steel factory. This latter setting
            acts as the showcase for a truly eye-popping finale, as Chan fends
            off pipe-wielding thugs, cauldrons of steaming coal, steel barrels
            dropped from a rooftop, and every other combination of weapon,
            assailant, and projectile within striking distance.<span style="mso-spacerun:

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Raised in a culture of raucous
            sitcoms and quick-cut MTV editing, I’m betting that U.S.
            moviegoers will spend more of their dollars on the conventionally
            funny, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">48 Hrs</i>.-type Chan
            than on the earlier, more no-holds-barred counterpart that surfaces
            in older, Hong Kong-based films such as this one.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>However, if action fans can take a chance and wade through
            the unfamiliar settings and awkward dubbing, they’ll find an
