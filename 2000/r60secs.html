            <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>In 1989, a
            junkyard magnate-turned-movie producer named H.B. &quot;Toby&quot;
            Halicki, who earned the nickname &quot;Car Crash King&quot; by
            producing, directing and starring in the landmark stunt-filled
            low-budget 1974 action movie <i>Gone in 60 Seconds</i> (&quot;The
            Original Basher! 93 Cars Destroyed in 40 Minutes! It’s Grand Theft
            Entertainment!&quot;), was killed during the filming of the
            much-publicized sequel when an intricate but routine (for him,
            anyway) gag went awry. The indefatigable self-promoter left behind a
            handful of genial, fetishistic movies (<i>The Junkman</i>, <i>Deadline
            Auto Theft</i>) which to this day exude the confident swagger of a
            time gone by and the relatively straightforward love of a man for
            speed and extensive collections of everything from sunglasses and
            wigs to toys and, of course, high-performance automobiles. Cut to
            midway through the befuddled and uninspired new remake from producer
            Jerry Bruckheimer, director Dominic Sena (<i>Kalifornia</i>) and
            star Nicolas Cage: &quot;Remember the seventies?&quot; one car thief
            says to another. &quot;Too young. Thank God,&quot; is the snide,
            terse reply.</b></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thus do we learn
            the importance of maintaining a healthy respect for history.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">A misfire by any
            measure, the retooled <i>Gone in Sixty Seconds</i> shifts the focus
            of the original Maindrian Pace (a part Halicki himself played and
            obviously relished), skilled car thief and part-time, large-living
            insurance investigator who gets a little bit of luck at just the
            right time at the tail end of a jaw-dropping forty-minute car chase
            through and around Long Beach, California, to scruffy loner Randall
            &quot;Memphis&quot; Raines (Cage, oddly subdued) who survives a
            four-day ordeal with minimal skill and a whole lot of luck when
            he’s forced to plan and execute the boosting of fifty cars in one
            night to save his loutish brother (Giovanni Ribisi) from a nasty,
            cartoonish heavy (Englishman Christopher Eccleston) whose
            motivations are never fully explained.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In order to do
            this Memphis tracks down the gang that disbanded when he quit the
            business. This ragtag crew of specialized misfits include former pal
            Atlee Jackson (Will Patton, in the only character held over from the
            original), grizzled garage owner Otto Halliwell (Robert Duvall, in a
            role close to the one he played in the Bruckheimer-produced <i>Days
            of Thunder</i>), stressed-out driving instructor Donny Astricky (Chi
            McBride), mute muscle the Sphinx (former star British footballer and
            <i>Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels</i> star Vinnie Jones), and,
            in the movie’s most severely underwritten role, Oscar-winning
            actress Angelina Jolie as tough-talking mechanic, Ferrari freak and
            former squeeze Sara &quot;Sway&quot; Wayland (in this movie, most
            everybody has a cute nickname and talks in a self-conscious,
            tongue-twisting slang). As if that weren’t enough to propel a
            feature-length film (which runs a minute shy of two hours, some
            twelve minutes longer than the original), Memphis is dogged by
            former rival Johnny B (an uncredited cameo by rapper Master P) and
            his gang, as well as two members of the Governor’s Regional
            Autotheft Bureau (G.R.A.B., get it?), Detective Roland Castlebeck (Delroy
            Lindo) and his wisenheimer sidekick Drycoff (Timothy Olyphant).<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As the window of
            opportunity dwindles to a single night, and then a couple of hours,
            before all the cars must be rounded up at a Long Beach pier, Memphis
            comes face to face with his elusive &quot;unicorn,&quot; a silver
            1967 Ford Mustang Shelby GT 500 named Eleanor (as in the original,
            the high-end autos are coded with women’s names -- but in the
            first movie, Eleanor is a bright yellow 1973 Mustang fastback). In
            the ensuing mayhem, Memphis thwarts the bad guy, earns the respect
            of the cops, and rides off into the sunset with Sway.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">If all this
            sounds vaguely -- and depressingly -- familiar, that’s because
            Scott Rosenberg’s script continues the contempt for fundamental
            storytelling exhibited by his work on Bruckheimer’s <i>Armageddon</i>
            (1998), without any of the kinetic wit and visual panache he brought
            to their first collaboration, <i>Con Air </i>(1997). <i>Gone in
            Sixty Seconds</i> clearly fancies itself a character-driven movie,
            but the characters themselves are woefully underdrawn, the result of
            numerous plot strands that leave no time for individual development
            (&quot;the script was still evolving as we were attempting to
            cast,&quot; admits Sena in the production notes, and it shows).
            Thus, Cage is a wearily reluctant anti-hero who loves his momma
            (Grace Zabriskie, gone in not much more than sixty seconds after a
            single, borderline irrelevent scene) and has no time for
            distractions (Jolie, looking ridiculous in a greasy and garish
            blonde cornrow thing and in the movie for not much longer than
            Zabriskie with not much more to do). Stealing liberally from the
            structures of <i>Armageddon</i> and <i>Con Air</i>, which in turn
            swiped the concept of the nobly charged miscreants rounded up for a
            big score from <i>The Professionals</i>, <i>The Dirty Dozen</i> and <i>The
            Wild Bunch</i>, Rosenberg has cluttered the movie with so many
            characters and plot strands that nobody -- not even the leads --
            make much of an impression.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Worse, the movie
            completely misses the delirious, naïve joy of livin’ large 1970s
            style that gave Halicki and his movies such an eccentric appeal. In
            place of the eye-poppingly conspicuous consumption of the admittedly
            garish period is a world of dingy garages and surly cohorts chiefly
            concerned with an absurdly irrational mix of greed and loyalty.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As directed by
            commercial and music video vet Sena (who claims to have worked for
            Halicki for a time during the filming of <i>The Junkman</i> in the
            early 1980s), the film is stylized to the point of distraction.
            Chris Lebanzon’s editing is abrupt and distracting, while much of
            the action seems to have been photographed (by first-time lenser
            Paul Cameron) at sunset, just after a heavy rain. And for a movie
            about cars and car chases there are no real thrills in the picture,
            with long passages of exposition (signaled, as in all Bruckheimer
            films, by major-chord musical passages) slowing things down
            considerably. The climactic car chase is nothing to get excited
            about either, capped by a mid-air escape jump as fake looking as it
            is poorly blocked.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Just about the
            only silver lining in this cloud is the involvement of executive
            producer Denice Halicki, who married Toby Halicki only a few months
            before the accident that took his life. Apparently involved in
            developing remakes of <i>The Junkman</i> and <i>Deadline Auto Theft</i>,
            she’d be well advised to let the originals speak for themselves (DVD
            editions would be nice), concentrate on the book she’s writing on
            the driver’s life, take Bruckheimer’s money for this
            ill-conceived wreck of a movie, and move on. Certainly in this
            crowded summer marketplace, <i>Gone in Sixty Seconds</i> has a title
            befitting its fate.</font>
