            -- a bravura black-and-white debut feature that covers some of the
            same territory and family problems as his latest effort -- U.K.
            filmmaker Shane Meadows’ second full-length film is a remarkably
            unadorned tale of youthful foibles, of childhood friendships
            strained and rejoined amid the Midlands council estates (what we
            here in the U.S. would call a working class housing project).
            Painted on the bare canvas of his own adolescence relationship with
            co-writer and now famed choreographer Paul Fraser, Meadows’
            coming-of-age tale is told with natural brushstrokes and earth tone
            colors. You won’t find any day-glo special effects and barely a
            tracking shot over its ninety-minute length. Yet it will be more of
            a reaffirming experience and its high spirits will linger much
            longer amid the clutter of big-budget, over-hyped studio releases
            this season.</b><o:p>

            original cast (you’ll probably only recognize Bob Hoskins -- star
            of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">twentyfourseven</i> -- in a small bit as a narcoleptic tutor, and
            possibly Frank Harper from Guy Ritchie’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Lock,
            Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels</i>) features three unknowns: Andrew
            Shim and Ben Marshall star as Romeo Brass and Gavin
            &quot;Knocks&quot; Woolley are the guileless incarnations of
            vulnerable thirteen-year-olds caught in the seductive world of
            Morell, an eccentric character filled with violent underpinnings by
            newcomer Paddy Considine. An accomplished photographer and friend
            for years with the director (they played in a band together),
            Considine had long ago given up hope of an professional acting
            career based on amateur aspirations, but his presence is one of the
            most compelling performances of the year, let alone for a novice
            screen thespian. As with his earlier film, music also enhances the
            flavor of the story, with selections from Fairport Convention (Matty
            Groves) and the thirty-five-year-old &quot;Colours&quot; by Donovan
            Leitch among the gems picked from euphonious obscurity.<o:p>

            <p style="tab-stops:121.5pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times">The
            boys are neighbors and best friends; the fact that one is black and
            the other white never plays into the equation of their friendship;
            they quip over the chubby Romeo’s eating habits and his selfish
            demeanor, while the irresolute Gavin suffers from a bad back and
            hides behind a distorted sense of humor. Rather, it is the
            introduction of the mysterious Morell that splits the lads apart as
            they jockey for favor with him as virtual father figure. Their real
            dads are noticeably without inspiration. Romeo’s estranged father
            Joe (Frank Harper) is a selfish bastard who has fractured the
            family’s confidence, while Gavin’s spineless breadwinner Bill
            (James Higgins) is a devout couch potato and girly-magazine devotee
            who likes to confiscates errant soccer balls that land in his back
            yard. When Morell slaps around some playground bullies that pick on
            the boys, a tentative trilogy is formed, further cemented by the
            weirdly unsophisticated stranger’s attraction to Romeo’s sister
            Ladine (Vicky McClure), and the lads’ amusing efforts to recast
            the crude misfit (his clothes place him at the bottom of the social
            pyramid) as a Dapper Dan. Initially presented as a fanciful comic
            figure, Morell’s mating rituals are coarse and hilarious, and he
            scores just a brief kiss from Ladine, and that is merely as a favor
            to her brother.<o:p>

            <p style="tab-stops:121.5pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times">The
            film meanders along in day-in-the-life-of routine before taking an
            unexpectedly dark turn that distances the boys at a key junction in
            their association. Gavin is the first to see the true nature of the
            neighborhood beast, but his friend is blind to the gloom down the
            street. Their alienation forces Gavin to recover from back surgery
            in quiet dullness with his family, while Romeo spins off into
            delinquency before a truly repugnant madness confronts him head on.
            While bordering on melodrama as both families face up to the dark
            edge of sanity, there is a heartwarming, magical ending that clears
            the skies and smoothes the battle scars of life.<o:p>

            Ashley Rowe’s straightforward cinematography differs sharply from
            his brilliant work on <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">twentyfourseven</i>,
            and he was probably chomping at the bit to add more sophisticated
            touches. Crispian Sallis’s production design is uncluttered; I
            loved the dinosaur wallpaper in Gavin’s bedroom.<o:p>

            audiences have warmed considerably to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Elliot</i>,
            winner of the British Independent Film Award last month (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Romeo</i>

            and Monsters</i>). <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Elliot</i>,
            being pushed to the hilt for Oscar consideration, has more marketing
            power (via Universal Pictures) to shut out <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Romeo</i>
            in the foreign film category, but <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Romeo</i>’s
            unpretentious low-key approach offers a more realistic story that
            will fill any movie house with winners who opt for something
