            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Alice doesn’t appear until the
            end of this British ensemble feature, and she’s just small enough
            to follow you down the rabbit hole you tumbled into ninety-plus
            minutes earlier. It IS worth the wait. Her parents, grandparents,
            aunts, nephew, and a few other black sheep associated with the
            family have been making a jolly interweaving run of the town for the
            last seventy-two hours and she’ll have to grow up a few years
            before she realizes the foibles, fun, heartbreak, sadness, boredom,
            ignorance, and bliss they’ve put us through in this new film from
            director Michael Winterbottom (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Butterfly
            Kiss</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Jude</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Welcome to Sarajevo</i>).
            It’s a wonderful feature debut script by Laurence Coriat, inspired
            by Robert Altman’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Short
            Cuts</i> and with a less sprawling nod to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Magnolia</i>.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">One family’s ties are knotted
            over a long weekend in South London. On the menu are three sisters
            (one married, one divorced, one single), an estranged and oversexed
            brother, and their pathetic, bickering -- almost to the point of
            physical harm -- parents. Everyone’s emotion-filled lives connect
            this way and that as the hand-held camera captures their
            relationships. We get to eavesdrop on them as if watching an
            unbelievably realistic documentary. No doubt Winterbottom’s choice
            of Sean Bobbitt, an experienced non-fiction film cameraman, as
            director of photography (his feature debut) had a significant role
            in shaping this film. Throughout the film the camera explores maybe
            a hundred or more faces -- strangers, subliminal characters -- to
            emphasize the gloom, elation, or pride of events surrounding them.
            As effective as the use of natural lighting is, Michael Nyman’s
            score adds a bold dimensional layer to the soundtrack, often
            overpowering the dialogue but never detracting from it.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We first are introduced to
            twenty-seven-year-old Nadia (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Notting
            Hill</i>’s Gina McKee), a café waitress with budding whiffs of
            Princess Leia hair buns. She’s searching for love in all the wrong
            places, i.e. personal ads and lonelyhearts clubs. Her phone tape is
            chock full of messages from daily liars and losers. Obviously Mr.
            Right isn’t through the entire film, until a peripheral character
            makes his move (and thus explains his seemingly unrelated
            storyline). Apparently not all at ease with her parents (none of the
            siblings are), she offers to one her dates that “I used to pretend
            I was an orphan.”<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">She occasionally babysits Jack
            (Peter Marfleet), the young son of her older sister Debbie (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Topsy-Turvy</i>’s
            Shirley Henderson), a hairdresser who likes to use her salon to
            entertain male guests after hours with vodka and sex. Her ex-, Dan
            is a (to her) self-impressed, beer-drinking, pub-hopping
            ne’er-do-well, shirking responsibilities and seemingly causing the
            family much aggravation by his roving eye and lazy habits. Ian Hart,
            who starred as John Lennon in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Backbeat</i>,
            fills the wannabe lady-killer role with a grand gusto of
            indifference, concern, and misunderstanding.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A very pregnant Molly (Molly
            Parker, lately of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Sunshine</i>
            and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Five Senses</i>) and doting husband Eddie (Jon Simm) are barely
            making end’s meet on his salary as a kitchen salesman. She thinks
            she’s fat and ugly (Debbie helps with a makeover). Meanwhile the
            anxiety of his job and the forthcoming birth of their daughter force
            him to drastic measures that batter his wife’s nerves as she goes
            into labor. A coincidental motorcycle accident allows for an
            unexpected reunion.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Darren, their handsome brother who
            has disconnected himself for some time from the family, takes a
            hotel room with a beautiful orange-haired girlfriend and proceeds to
            have a very happy birthday. Before leaving town he makes a short but
            poignant effort to rejoin the family circle.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mom and dad haven’t had a
            love-filled moment in years, perhaps caused by the “loss” of
            their son from the fold. He’s wimpy and always tinkering with the
            car (anything to get out of the house), and she’s a nervous wreck
            from the ever-barking dog belonging to the inconsiderate Portuguese
            family in the next-door flat, looking for solace at a local bingo
            parlor. Neither cares to jump ship or cause waves, although she does
            take a rash step one evening to get a good night’s rest. They’re
            devoted to their children, but obviously not part of their inner
            circle. Kika Markham and Jack Shepherd fill these positions with
            loneliness and desperation.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film’s approach, while
            linear, does make for some confusion until you can figure out all
            the characters in the program. There are adequate clues, but you
            might want to keep good mental notes. You’ll find the final quiz
            that much easier and the film that much more enjoyable for the
            challenge. Yes, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Wonderland</i>
            is wonderful.</font>
