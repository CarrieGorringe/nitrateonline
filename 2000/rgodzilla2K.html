            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 18 August 2000</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Let me first go on record by
            saying that I enjoyed every frame of <i>Godzilla 2000</i>, and it
            had nothing to do with the particularly vile movie that I had just
            seen the day before -- or maybe it did.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">True, the special-effects shots
            look a little dingy, and you can tell how some of the shots were
            &quot;mattéed&quot; together. But this ain't no mutated iguana,
            here. We want our Godzillas to be genuine &quot;gojiras&quot;, the
            fierce dragon gods of Asian mythology, and that's exactly what we
            get in this movie. He's got somewhat scraggly, jutting upright
            scales on his back, and his fiery breath is preceded by a sort of
            firefly aura around the edges of his mouth that looks a little like
            radioactive pyorrhea. But he's got more of a forbidding stare that I
            can recall from previous films, and when he moves, his tail switches
            back and forth authoritatively, protecting his turf fore and aft on
            the battling ground.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It turns out that Japan now has a
            &quot;Godzilla Prediction Center&quot;, a grass-roots operation that
            monitors the Big G.'s movements, and which is run by Shinoda (Takehiro
            Murata, who has the amiably disheveled demeanor of one of Toshiro
            Mifune's samurai heroes) and his young daughter Iyo (Mayu Suzuki),
            with a journalist, Yuki (Naomi Nishida) tagging along on-assignment.
            Iyo takes care of the business side of the Center -- Yuki is
            politely informed that she needs to take out a membership if she's
            going to be hanging around the place very much, ¥200,000 ($1,844)
            to join, plus ¥50,000 ($460) a month dues -- and, when Godzilla
            almost squashes them at the beginning of the story, he holds up the
            car the three humans are riding in, seems to take a close look at
            Iyo's face, and lets them off easy.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">So, what's Godzilla doing back in
            the neighborhood? A large meteorite -- probably around forty million
            years old, one person says off-handedly -- is raised from the ocean
            floor: it either is a possible source for new energy (particularly,
            a replacement for fossil fuels, which, of course, come from
            dinosaurs), or there's something living inside. Guess which one it
            is. The rock takes off for Tokyo, Godzilla takes off after the rock,
            and one character gives what is probably going to be the most quoted
            and re-quoted line of the film year, &quot;Did you see that flying
            rock go by?&quot; (Despite the English dubbing, the actors in the
            movie are entirely appealing, and the version being distributed in
            the U.S. does not wantonly excise any scenes that would have
            undercut their performances.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Revealed to be a shiny, silver
            craft with no hard edges, the visitor settles down atop one of
            Tokyo's main skyscrapers and, it is discovered, wants to rearrange
            life for everyone and everything on Earth. The similarities to <i>Independence
            Day</i> are, I am sure, not coincidental, nor is the creature that
            finally emerges to do battle with Godzilla, a real horror (named
            Orga, by the way, according to the closing credits -- Godzilla fans
            know that Japanese filmmakers love to dub their beasts with
            monikers, sometimes even before they've made an appearance
            on-screen) who bears a resemblance to the aliens in both <i>Alien</i>
            and <i>Predator</i>. So, Godzilla, the &quot;King of the
            Monsters&quot;, can be seen as taking on a representative of the new
            movie monsters who are attempting to unseat him.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This means that Tokyo's
            architecture gets rearranged a bit, as well as some buildings in the
            hinterlands, but the film plays by very specific guidelines. There
            are no gloating shots of people getting squashed, crushed or
            trampled, and various buildings and structures fall around
            characters instead of on top of them. (Notably, one noodle shop that
            only gets a little sideswiped has a traditional &quot;lucky
            cat&quot; statue behind the counter.) As the monsters tear things
            up, the humans stay at abeyance, almost respectfully: cities can
            always be rebuilt. Unfortunately, Takagiri (played, with elegant
            menace, by Hiroshi Abe, who at one point appears with a beautiful,
            malevolent black outercoat swirling around him), is not so polite.
            Godzilla stares him down at one point, and he...takes out a pack of
            Lucky Strikes, pulls a cigarette out, and stares right back at him.
            Godzilla does not offer him a light.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is an old-style affair, from
            the wonderful ad art that appeared, spread gloriously across one
            whole page in last Sunday's <i>Times</i>, to the reprisal of Akira
            Ikufube's theme when the Big G. first emerges in the film from the
            waters of Tokyo Bay. But I was surprised by one reaction I had, when
            Takegiri, newly appointed head of &quot;Crisis Control
            Intelligence&quot; decides, in &quot;¿que est mas macho?&quot;
            fashion, to rub-out Godzilla using armor-piercing missiles. As the
            missiles -- which were already shown to be able to plow through
            three consecutive concrete blocks like butter -- strike Godzilla, I
            found myself having an almost wincing reaction, like watching an old
            friend you've grown to know and love getting beat to a pulp by some
            sadistic creeps. (The same happens when the Big G. takes some
            particularly nasty hits from the alien malefactor). As Shinoda
            reflects, &quot;Maybe...Godzilla is inside each one of us.&quot;
            He's right.</font>
