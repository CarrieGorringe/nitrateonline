            review by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 15 September 2000</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>South African-born director
            Roger Mitchell is known in the United States for lighthearted fare
            like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Persuasion</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Notting
            Hill</i>, so it’s a pleasant surprise to discover that he can
            handle weightier subjects with equal aplomb.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Mitchell’s offhanded approach to storytelling is a
            considerable asset that prevents <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Titanic Town </i>from playing like other films on the conflict in
            Northern Ireland. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Boxer</i>
            and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">In the Name of the Father</i>
            were solid movies that dealt with the Troubles in a grim, solemn
            manner. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Titanic Town</i>,
            however, seems fresh because it brims with a pungent gallows humor.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Set in 1972 Belfast, the film,
            which is based on Mary Costello’s autobiographical novel,
            initially treats the war with bemused detachment. Newly arrived in
            the Andersonville section of Belfast, the McPhelimy family find
            quickly themselves stuck in the middle of the fighting. British
            tanks roll through the streets, and the evenings are interrupted by
            gunfire. Curiously, it doesn’t seem to phase Bernie McPhelimy
            (Julie Walters, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Intimate
            Relations</i>), who chases an IRA gunman out of her yard because his
            presence endangers her family. When British soldiers demand to
            search her home, she becomes upset not because her house has been
            invaded but because she’s worried the soldiers will find her
            husband Aidan (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Persuasion</i>’s
            Ciaran Hinds) and her four children to be slovenly.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Bernie’s attitude abruptly
            changes when a close friend of hers dies while watching Bernie’s
            son. The other locals are content to blame the British despite the
            fact that the woman was actually killed by a stray IRA bullet.
            Bernie begins attending peace meetings and publicly blames the IRA.
            Soon bricks are flying through her window. Bernie doesn’t give up
            and goes on the radio asking to meet with IRA members to find out
            what happened and to convince them not to attack during the day when
            bystanders can get caught in the crossfire.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When the IRA actually honors her
            request for a meeting, Bernie winds up becoming a mediator between
            them and the British government. She instantly becomes a darling of
            the local media and a pariah at home. At first many of the locals
            assume she’s an informer, making Bernie’s children outcasts at
            school. Her adventures wind up aggravating Aidan’s ulcer, sending
            him to the hospital. Her daughter Annie (Nuala O’Neill in a
            terrific debut) suffers the worst, however. Annie can’t understand
            why her mother goes on television claiming to speak on behalf of her
            children when her children would like her to quit.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mitchell and screenwriter Anne
            Devlin, a Belfast native, manage to make Bernie’s quest seem naïve
            but not foolish. Walters, who normally plays comic roles, imbues
            Bernie with the proper dignity to make one root for her efforts even
            if they might ultimately be doomed. Mitchell and Devlin avoid moving
            <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Titanic Town</i> into outright
            satire and paint most of the characters sympathetically. While often
            quite funny, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Titanic Town</i>
            avoids ridicule. While many of the locals are fanatical
            nationalists, the IRA members she meets are cooperative, and some of
            the British soldiers are depicted as frightened outsiders. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Titanic
            Town</i>, which takes its title from the fact that the ill-fated
            ship was built in Belfast, is consistently believable and compelling
            because it offers hints that others may later follow Bernie’s path
            but with more success.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
