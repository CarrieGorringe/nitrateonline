it does get better on subsequent viewings. The DVD format should bring out the
best qualities in Conrad Hall's cinematography, as well as afford a chance to
have another look at Kevin Spacey's Oscar-winning portrayal as a middle-age,
middle-class family man whose attempts to break out of the rut he has fallen
into create reverberations in the lives of everyone around him: wife (Annette
Bening, whose &quot;I'm going to sell this house today!&quot; scene is a
classic), disaffected daughter (Thora Birch, who should have been up for an
Oscar), and neighbors (including Wes Bentley, Chris Cooper and Alison Janney).
Prediction: Cameron Crowe's <i>Almost Famous</i>, co-produced by the same
company (Dreamworks SKG) that produced <i>Beauty</i>, will be referred to as
&quot;this year's <i>American Beauty</i>.&quot; (Which means that <i>American
Beauty</i> can also be referred to as &quot;last year's <i>Almost Famous</i>&quot;?).
The reported three-and-a-half hours of extras on the DVD include production
notes; a theatrical trailer; audio commentary with director Sam Mendes and
screenwriter Alan Ball; production storyboard with accompanying commentary from
Mendes and Hall; and the production featurette <i>American Beauty: Look Closer</i>.

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Sixteen
players preen and promote their trade in <i>American Pimp</i>, the busily
mischievous but often uncomfortably blunt feature-length documentary from Albert
and Allen Hughes (<i>Menace II Society</i>, <i>Dead Presidents</i>). With names
like Bishop Don Magic Juan, Fillmore Slim and Rosebudd (inevitably, there’s a
clip from <i>Citizen Kane</i>), these entrepreneurs explain their lives and
justify their existences in mostly boisterous and aggressive tones. Nothing
wrong with that, except for the movie’s cumulative effect of greed and
brutality run amuck: it seems that the brothers Hughes, for all their historical
and sociological referencing (including the blues tradition, blaxploitation
pictures and Nevada’s legalized prostitution), apparently kind of admire this
world. Thus, assertions like one mack daddy’s claim to be performing a public
service because one of his stable is thus off of welfare and another’s
dramatic story of trying to encroach on the Los Angeles &quot;track&quot; (short
for street; there’s a lot of pimp jargon in the movie) plays less like
ignorant boasting and more like heroic achievement. When the siblings screened
the film for a packed house at the Czech Republic’s Karlovy Vary Film Festival
this past summer, the reaction was a mixture of enthusiasm and wonder. Domestic
audiences are likely to feel much of the latter, with the level of the former
depending entirely on individual levels of tolerance. The DVD edition of <i>American
Pimp</i> features an onstage discussion between the directors and New York Times
film critic Elvis Mitchell, conducted at the South By Southwest Film Festival in
Austin, Texas.<o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">In
many ways the most difficult of films to pull of properly, the mainstream
romantic sex comedy often ends up looking forced and perfunctory, the exact
opposite of the light, breezy, mildly erotic tone filmmakers have in mind.
Virtually ignored during it’s admittedly low-profile stateside release, the
engaging <i>Bossa Nova</i> announces a return to his native Brazil and comic
form for director Bruno Barreto, whose <i>Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands</i> was
an arthouse hit in the states some twenty-two years ago, eventually garnering a
Golden Globe nomination for Best Foreign Film. After an opening credits sequence
that plays like a widescreen tourist promotion for Rio de Janeiro, Amy Irving is
introduced as Mary Ann, a former flight attendant and widow who has spent the
two years since her husband's accidental drowning in a kind of emotional stasis
while working as a language instructor (&quot;in English, please!&quot; seems to
be the motto of her company). Meeting distinguished yet distracted lawyer Pedro
Paulo (Antonio Fagundes) on an elevator, Mary Ann is soon drawn on to a whirling
merry-go-round of passions and pratfalls. Her fellow riders include student
Nadine (Drica Moraes), who is carrying on an internet romance with the unseen
Gary, a long-haired Soho artist; Pedro Paulo's tailor father Juan (Alberto de
Mendoza), who is in danger of losing his business in a messy divorce; determined
law intern Sharon (Giovanna Antonelli); Pedro Paulo's lovesick brother Roberto
(Pedro Cardoso); libidinous soccer star Acacio (Alexandre Borges) and his
manager Gordo (Sergio Loroza); and Pedro Paulo's soon-to-be-ex-wife Tania (Debora
Block), who has</span> left <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">him and is
living with a Chinese Tai-Chi-Chuan instructor, Wan-Kim-Lau (Kazuo Matsui).
Things come to a comic boil when Pedro Paulo meets client Trevor (Stephen
Tobolowsky) at the airport, and the balding, eccentric American turns out to be
an unwitting catalyst for resolution of the tangled relationships. As the
presskit so breezily puts it: &quot;Tania wants to win back the love of Pedro
Paulo, who in turn loves Mary Ann, but thinks she loves Trevor. Nadine finally
meets her virtual love. Roberto loves Sharon, who loves Acacio, who had a crush
on Mary Ann, who rediscovers love with Pedro Paulo.&quot; Got that? . In a
roundabout career with his share of triumphs (<i>Carried Away</i>) and stumbles
(<i>One Tough Cop</i>), <i>Bossa Nova</i> pulls off a deft comic coup and is a
fine kind of homecoming. The DVD edition is set to street in early January 2001.</span></font></p>

wanted to pull God out of my chest,&quot; someone says during the course of the
thirty-six-minute documentary <i>Un-Defining Punk</i> that’s a featured bonus
of <i>The Filth and the Fury</i>’s DVD edition, and that’s as good a
definition as any of the late 1970s movement known as punk rock (perhaps
somewhat florid, but those who love the music love the music). Director Julien
Temple was an up close and personal observer of the trend, having made a feature
starring the Sex Pistols called <i>The Great Rock’n’Roll Swindle</i> that
one critical wag called &quot;the <i>Citizen Kane</i> of rock’n’roll
movies.&quot; For this anecdotal and visually subversive history of the band and
the scene, Temple conducts interviews with the surviving members of the group
(all amusingly shaded from view like in some reality TV show) that collectively
chart their brief but tumultuous history. There’s the influence of hustling
manager Malcolm McLaren (roundly hated by all), the notorious incident where
demonically beady-eyed lead singer Johnny Rotten cursed on British television,
the absurd bidding war that found the quartet signed to and fired from labels
for which they never recorded, and, in the band’s darkest chapter, the strange
and tragic story of doomed bass &quot;player&quot; Sid Vicious and his
exploitative girlfriend Nancy Spungen. It’s all here for the aging punker and
neophyte alike, making <i>The Filth and the Fury</i> a movie both irreverent and
invaluable.<o:p>

there are worse things than getting a baseball in the headlight of your
Mercedes: the rueful note on which this engaging---and, for 9/10ths of the way,
surprisingly well-executed---fantasy involving what happens when a Queens
firefighter (Dennis Quaid, in an excellent performance) makes contact, via his
ham radio set, with his grown son (Jim Caviezel) 30 years in the future. The
story, written by Toby Emmerich and directed by Gregory Hoblit, touches upon
everything from how father-son relationships turn into man-to-man ones, how
reality can shift with the blink of an eye, and the poignancy of getting second
chances. Only when the film tries to hit one out of the ball park, so to speak,
near the end does things trip up a bit. With a strong supporting cast that
includes Andre Braugher (who does a great job pulling off a tricky scene near
the end where his character becomes convinced about what is happening) and the
beautiful Elizabeth Mitchell. The video is priced to rent, while the DVD edition
has no additional features.<o:p>

enjoyable romantic lark in which two childhood friends, a Catholic priest
(Edward Norton, who also directed the film) and a Jewish rabbi (Ben Stiller),
get thrown for a loop when they meet their other childhood friend, a
very-grown-up business consultant (Jenna Elfman), for the first time in years.
Very funny in parts, very easy to take as a whole, and the performers have
plenty of room to work around in and develop aspects of their characters that
would have been either skipped-over or ignored in other films. And, yes, this
would probably make a very good &quot;date&quot; film (although you'll both be
laughing with the film). The VHS tape is priced for the rental market, and the
DVD includes Norton’s commentary, an audio track from producer Stuart Blumbert,
over twenty minutes of deleted footage and even an eight-minute gag reel.<o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">In
1981, from adjoining houses in the Baldwin Hills section of Los Angeles, two
children meet and form a bond for life. Quincy McCall is the arrogantly
confident son of a pro basketball star who meets his match in Monica Wright, who
tells him &quot;I’m gonna be the first girl in the NBA&quot; and has the moves
to back up the boast. As the two move from being rivals to lovers, their high
school, college and pro careers take distinctly different paths and each must
re-examine their priorities with family, relationships and the game they both
love. An intimate journey of personal achievement with the emotional sweep of an
American epic, Love and Basketball features a strong leading performance from
Omar Epps as Quincy and heralds the arrival of a new star in Sanaa Lathan as the
focused, vulnerable, iconic Monica. Debuting writer-director Gina Prince-Bythewood,
who made time for college athletics as she earned a degree from UCLA’s film
school, has made a remarkably assured, technically dazzling, unabashedly
old-fashioned sports romance that grapples with the hot-button issues of the day
(gender equity, education vs. professional opportunity, paternity suits) while
more than living up to the first part of its title. The DVD edition of Love and
Basketball features deleted scenes and bloopers; three commentaries;
storyboards; a music video; and two original documentaries, <i>The Rise of
Female Athletes </i>and <i>The Portrayal of African-American Women by the
American Media</i>.</span><o:p>

crashing spectacularly on an arid desert planet, a mismatched group must pull
together to thwart a terrifyingly bloodthirsty life form that stalks their
dwindling number during an extremely rare eclipse of all three suns. <i>Pitch
Black</i> was made in Australia, which goes a long way towards explaining its
odd mood that’s part <i>Alien</i>, part <i>Road Warrior</i>. Co-writer and
director David Twohy (who wrote <i>Waterworld </i>and directed <i>The</i> <i>Arrival</i>)
displays a forceful and confident visual style that understands the power of
suggestion over the kind of booga-booga cheap thrills found in so many similar
exercises. The cast is relatively unknown but uniformly fine, with musclebound
hunk Vin Diesel (Private Caparzo in <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>) having the most
malicious fun as a seemingly indestructible convict who must gain the group’s
trust before he can help them out. Radha Mitchell (<i>High Art</i>) has some
good moments as the reluctant leader, and B-movie fans will recognize both the
name and face of Cole Hauser, estranged son of cheapie mainstay Wings Hauser.
Along with <i>Supernova</i>, <i>Pitch Black</i> is the year’s major genre
surprise, a hard-nosed, no-nonsense actioner that’s bound to end up being a
lot of people’s annual guilty pleasure. Three minutes of snipped gore is all
that distinguishes the unrated from the rated DVD versions, each of which also
sports production notes, a &quot;Making-Of&quot; featurette and Twohy’s
commentary track.<o:p>

you sure can fight,&quot; Owen Wilson’s raffish outlaw tells Jackie Chan’s,
well, Jackie Chan during the course of the action star’s latest vehicle to
make it to home video, the ‘way post-modern western <i>Shanghai Noon</i>. Sent
with a small band of fellow Forbidden City guards to rescue duped princess Pei
Pei (Lucy Liu) from the paws of leering heavies in the old, wild west, Chan
survives and triumphs through his usual dazzling blend of pluck and luck. In
addition to the extensive fight scenes that with each passing project showcase
Jackie’s split-second timing above his extreme risks, the script (by <i>Lethal
Weapon 4</i> scribes Miles Millar and Alfred Gough) has some very funny material
in it, from the duo’s real names—no spoilers here—to Wilson’s zonked out
assessments of their constant predicaments. Chunks of Randy Edelman’s score
sounds suspiciously like the <i>Blazing Saddles</i> theme, which on second blush
isn’t all that inappropriate. The DVD edition features commentary tracks by
Chan, Wilson and director Tom Dey, as well as deleted footage, a music video and
three—count ‘em, three—production featurettes.<o:p>

Hawks would be proud: <i>U-571</i> is a big, brawny, rat-a-tat sociopolitical
action adventure in the mold of the prominent director from Hollywood’s Golden
Age (see <i>Dawn Patrol</i>, <i>Only Angels Have Wings</i> and <i>Rio Bravo</i>).
Refreshingly old-fashioned in its credo of &quot;do your job,&quot; the movie
follows a daring World War II raid on a German U-boat in the Atlantic Ocean by a
group of American seamen in search of the Enigma coding machine, which the Nazis
were using to rule the shipping lanes. So breakneck is the pace and so seamless
the special effects that there’s no time to question the common sense of the
heroics involved. Like in Das Boot, the tension is ratcheted up by the
claustrophobia of the submarine interiors (unexpectedly poignant in the wake of
the Russian Kursk disaster). Following up on the promise of <i>Breakdown</i>,
director Jonathan Mostow cements his reputation as a shrewd orchestrator of
action sequences; as a bonus, his crisp direction of Matthew McConaughey, Harvey
Keitel and the rest of the all-male cast proves that he’s got skill with
ensembles as well. Universal’s superlative special edition DVD features a
boatload of extras, including Mostow’s commentary, cast and crew interviews, a
production featurette and information on the real-life British operation that
lead to the capturing of the Enigma.<o:p>

their race to provide America with the most titillating adult film experience,
Joey Quinn (Bob Hoskins) pulls ahead of established porn director Ronny
Bartolotti (Robert Loggia) by enlisting the latter’s daughter Katrina (Mena
Suvari) to lose her virginity during a pay-per-view television event that
viewers can experience interactively via some sort of body suit apparatus. One
of those satirical social comedies that sounds a lot more scathing than it
actually is, <i>American Virgin</i> (aka <i>Live Virgin</i>, which is what it
was called before Mena Suvari achieved fame in her next movie, <i>American
Beauty</i>, as a character of similar sensual surliness) is constructed by
writer-director Jean-Pierre Marois as one of those cheerfully hyperactive
screwball comedies that Hollywood used to be so good at. Unfortunately, the film
seems to think its social barbs are fresh and new, when in fact this kind of
self-ironic media spoofery is by now as tired as its subject (Sally
Kellerman’s Sally Jesse Raphael-ish talk-show host is the lone exception; why
doesn’t the original Hot Lips Houlihan in Robert Altman’s big-screen version
of <i>M*A*S*H</i> make more movies?). And Marois’ leering tone does nothing to
sharpen the satire, suggesting that maybe—just maybe—<i>American Virgin</i>
might actually have been intended as a serious indictment of a media gone amok.
Now that’s really scary. The DVD edition features a commentary by Marois and
the usual complement of trailers and subtitling options. One final plea: could
we have a moratorium on movies with &quot;American&quot; in the title for
awhile? Please?<o:p>

small mountain town of Tolzbad, the villagers live in mortal fear that any loud
or sudden noise will bring an avalanche down on their heads. As a kind of ripple
effect, the good people of the town have developed a series of rituals and folk
wisdom directives as arcane as they are elaborate. Above all, they must be <i>Careful</i>.
Welcome to the prodigiously inventive world of Canadian filmmaker Guy Maddin,
whose earlier art-house triumph <i>Tales from the Gimli Hospital</i> is reviewed
in the 2000 Fright Film Festival elsewhere on the Nitrate Online site. In direct
contrast to that film’s black and white aesthetic, <i>Careful</i> is filmed in
a saturated color process reminiscent of the primitive color experiments of the
1920s and 1930s. Combined with his trademark embracing of both the primitive
B-movie aesthetic and the visual constructs of German Expressionism, <i>Careful </i>looks
and plays with a kind of otherworld nostalgic modernity, residing in a universe
where everything is somehow both bracingly exotic and reassuringly familiar. In
addition to a commentary track by Maddin and writer George Toles, Kino on
Video’s fine DVD pressing of this Zeitgeist Films release (in the USA) has the
added bonus of <i>Guy Maddin: Waiting for Twilight</i>, an hour-long documentary
on the filmmaker and his unique vision (in fact, many attendees of the recent
twenty-fifth anniversary Toronto film festival thought his commissioned
five-minute short <i>The Heart of the World</i> the best single work in the
program). Recommended for the adventurous and historically informed moviegoer.<o:p>

is based on Baspsi Sidhwa’s novel &quot;Cracking India.&quot; As that title
indicates, the film is set against the abrupt and subsequently turbulent
splitting of the Indian sub-continent by the British in 1947 (the event is known
as &quot;Partition&quot;). In Lahore, eight-year-old Lenny (Maia Sethna),
afflicted with polio, watches as her nanny, or &quot;Ayah,&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Shanta (Nandita Das), juggles two men. Shanta loves Muslim masseur Hasan
(Rahul Khanna) and likes Dil, aka &quot;Ice Candy Man&quot; (Aamir Khan). As the
young girl observes the interactions, she learns hard lessons about religion,
culture and society. <i>Earth </i>is very good at exploring the volatility of
different cultures and religions freed from outside control. Currently available
exclusively as a priced-to-rent videocassette, New Yorker Video’s transfer
preserves the lush production values of the film; as with the majority of titles
from the distributor, <i>Earth</i> is letterboxed to preserve the original
aspect ratio (cinematographer Giles Nuttgen, who’d worked with Mehta before,
went on to shoot John Travolta’s <i>Battlefield Earth</i>). After enduring
some cuts to <i>Earth</i> for Indian release and a banning in Pakistan
altogether (<i>Fire</i>’s frank discussion of lesbianism also created
controversy), Mehta is currently at work on the final film in the trilogy, <i>Water</i>.<o:p>

Cold War in Europe will not remain cold very much longer,&quot; gloats SPECTRE
agent and former SMERSH operative Rosa Klebb (cabaret singer Lotte Lenya) to
&quot;homicidal paranoiac&quot; Red Grant (Robert Shaw, still a dozen years
removed from <i>Jaws</i>) in the red-hot <i>From Russia with Love</i>, one of
the seven titles in the third and final James Bond box set from MGM and among
the handful of truly great films in that franchise. The second Bond film
(following <i>Dr. No</i>), this is the one that emphasizes geopolitical
skullduggery over gadgets (it’s the first Bond film featuring Desmond Llewelyn
as Q) and has among the best casts ever put together for a 007 adventure. The
high point? Undoubtedly the brutal fistfight between Bond and Grant on the
Orient Express, after which Connery’s first impulse is to straighten his tie.
The DVD edition features John Cork’s thirty-four-minute documentary
&quot;Inside <i>From Russia With Love</i>&quot; (narrated by
&quot;Avengers&quot; star Patrick Macnee), a profile of co-producer Harry
Saltzman, animated storyboard sequences, various trailers and promo spots and
among the snazziest menu graphics around. As has been reported recently, MGM’s
profits have jumped considerably, even though the only film they released
commercially in the third quarter of the year was that dreadful Richard Gere-Winona
Ryder melodrama <i>Autumn in New York</i>. The increase has a lot to do with the
quality of their DVD releases, which include <i>This is Spinal Tap</i>, <i>Supernova</i>
and the trio of boxed Bonds. Note to other studios that cut corners: consumers
are paying attention to DVD quality beyond the packaging, which means that
proper restoration of the image and value-added extras are of the utmost
importance (see <i>Toy Story</i>, below).<o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">In
early 1970s Newcastle, local boy-turned-gangster Jack Carter (Sir Michael Caine)
is back from London to settle the score with a racketeering kingpin (playwright
John Osborne) and the lowlifes who murdered his brother and ensnared his niece
(or is she?) in their amateur pornography ring. &quot;Get Carter before he gets
you,&quot; intones the steely-voiced narrator in the accompanying trailer, and,
as with <i>Dirty Harry</i> (released in America the same year), <i>Get Carter </i>is
the story of one man’s remorseless, inevitable justice in the face of
corruption and set against the backdrop of some fashion choices at once hideous
and pretty cool. Caine, seen reading Raymond Chandler’s &quot;Farewell, My
Lovely&quot; in an early scene, pitches his Carter perfectly as a dead-eyed
angel of death, while the direction of Mike Hodges (who had an improbable but
welcome art-house hit in 1999 with <i>Croupier</i>) relies a bit much on
telephoto lenses—all the rage in the early 1970s—but gives the film the
terse clockwork precision of, well, a Chandler book. Clean if not particularly
crisp, with a bit of dirt in a late reel, the Warner Bros. DVD edition features
audio commentary from Hodges and cinematographer Wolfgang Suschitzky (whose
bleak Newcastle chills to the bone), as well as a catchy jazz riff from composer
Roy Budd. &quot;Good God,&quot; someone says, laying eyes on the dapper Carter;
the killer’s rejoinder—&quot;is he?&quot;—captures perfectly the mood of
this tough, taught little thriller. Oh, and Sylvester Stallone’s recent
remake? Skip it, and find copies of <i>Point Blank</i>, <i>The Long Good Friday</i>
(the Criterion edition will do), <i>Stormy Monday</i> (also set in Newcastle)
and <i>The Limey</i> instead, all of which owe a debt of steely cool to <i>Get
Carter</i>.<o:p>

would-be musician Ivanhoe Martin (Jimmy Cliff) records the killer song of the
title, only to be cheated out of the profits by a ruthless producer in Kingston,
who pays him but $20 for the tune. Finding some success selling ganja, his
ruthless killing of some policemen transform him into a folk hero and sends the
song to the top of the charts. Many Americans can pinpoint their awareness of
reggae music to the popular and enduring soundtrack to the 1973 Jamaican film <i>The
Harder They Come</i>, which remains to this day among the best single-disc
introductions to the music ever assembled. Now comes a new DVD edition of the
movie, remastered from the original 16mm camera negative and digitally cleansed
of dirt and debris under the supervision of producer-director Perry Henzell
(rumored to be working on a sequel) and released under the Criterion Collection
banner. There are religious, political and class criticisms along the way for
those who seek them, yet the movie as a whole retains a raw enthusiasm because
of the music, which includes songs by Toots and the Maytals (&quot;Pressure
Drop&quot;), Desmond Dekker (&quot;Shanty Town&quot;) and Cliff himself, whose
trio of tunes includes &quot;Many Rivers to Cross&quot; and &quot;You Can Get It
If You Really Want.&quot; Fans will want to own the CD soundtrack as well as the
film, given the mono sound mix that contributes to the movie’s outlaw power.
The disc features audio commentary by Henzell and Cliff; an exclusive video
interview with Island Records founder Chris Blackwell; illustrated
bio-discographies on the soundtrack artists; and an invaluable English subtitle
option that helps immensely with the film’s island patois.<o:p>

Big Ones of 1993 and 1997, and nobody had seen anything like them. Michael
Crichton's novel, about a theme park featuring genetically recreated, and very
much live, dinosaurs, was artfully paired down for Steven Spielberg's screen
version, but it was the digitally-created, and completely convincing, dinosaurs
that knocked everyone for a loop (the first time this now-standard motion
picture FX method had been used to such great extent), along with the
newly-created DTS sound system, which created both hair-raising effects as well
as crystal-clarity for one of the most memorable scenes in recent films: the
slight thump, accompanying the shot of water in a glass being slightly
disturbed, that heralded the first appearance of the most terrifying dinosaur in
the film. Oh, yeah, there are some actors in the film, as well: Sam Neill (who
holds his own very nicely), Laura Dern (who seems overwhelmed, and I don't blame
her), Jeff Goldblum (who's smooth &quot;chaos theory&quot; character made a
second appearance in <i>The Lost World</i>), Martin Ferrero (whose character
comes to a memorable end), and Richard Attenborough (whose character, the
creator of the theme park project, has been changed from the James Stewart-like
venerable-old-soul in the novel into a sort-of reprisal of Scottish comedian
Harry Lauder). Also, this was the first of Spielberg's extraordinary one-two
punch for 1993: <i>Jurassic Park</i> was released in theaters in May, then, in
December, his film version of <i>Schindler's List</i> premiered. The rest is
history. There are numerous DVD editions of both movies with various extras.<o:p>

far southern region of Mexico, the Zapatista National Liberation Army and their
charismatic leader, Subcomandante Marcos (who poses for photojournalists with
enthusiasm), play a nervous game of cat-and-mouse with 30,000 Mexican troops in
the mid-1990s. While her first-person narration is vocally tremulous, Canadian
filmmaker Nettie Wild is to be commended for making such an obviously dangerous
journey and telling such an absorbing story. Photographed over a period of eight
months in remote jungle terrain, this saga of what one journalist called
&quot;the first post-modern revolution&quot; is both harrowing and absurdist.
Tellingly, the film won the Canadian Genie (their version of the Oscar) for Best
Documentary, as well as the equivalent prize from the International Documentary
Association and the Los Angeles International Film Festival’s audience award. <i>A
Place Called Chiapas</i> is well worth seeing, but may require some effort to
obtain: the VHS tape is priced for rental, with no DVD release scheduled. The
best bet is to check with your local brick and mortar rental shop and hope for
the best.<o:p>

friend or friends, unsure of where events would lead, which party you’d crash
and who would end up with whom? Novelist-turned-filmmaker Lukas Moodysson does,
and it is this feeling of hesitant yet intoxicating freedom, combined with the
unmannered veracity of his cast, that makes <i>Show Me Love</i> shine. A bigger
hit than <i>Titanic</i> when the two went head-to-head at the Swedish box
office, the film won a string of international festival awards and is ringing
proof that subtitles don’t need to stand in the way of universal
understanding. By turns cruel and tender, <i>Show Me Love </i>suffers only from
an overreliance on the dangerously dated Dogme 95 handheld visual approach, yet
is still an object lesson to Hollywood filmmakers wishing to tackle similar
themes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Strand Releasing’s
bare-bones DVD edition not only doesn’t have any extras, it doesn’t even
have a booklet. No matter: the company deserves praise for bringing one of the
most heart-warming, inspirational and just plain funny relationship comedies in
a good long while to American audiences.<o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Social
satire has long been the province of filmmakers from eastern Europe, but seldom
has the wit been as bloody and bitter as the recent crop of films from
Yugoslavia, which</span> <span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">feature
prominently among them Srdjan Dragojevic’s <i>Pretty Village, Pretty Flame</i>.
In his follow-up to that important work, <i>Wounds</i>, Dragojevic follows the
brutal early 1990s criminal adventures of two enthusiastic young hoodlums,
narrator Pinki (Dusan Pekic) and Kraut (Milan Maric). Kind of a Serbian spin on
Martin Scorsese’s <i>GoodFellas</i>, the movie follows the tutelage of the
boys by comically insane two-bit criminal Dickie (Dragan Bjelogrlic). Seeking to
unseat the local hoodlums featured on the tabloid TV show &quot;Asphalt
Pulse,&quot; Pinki and Kraut become amoral killing machines in a country wracked
by divisiveness and civil war. <i>Wounds</i> is peopled with prominent actors
from the region, including Miki Manojlovic as Pinki’s politically fickle
father and current heartthrob Nikola Kojo as Pepper, one of the TV criminals.
Featured at numerous film festivals upon its initial release, <i>Wounds </i>(named
for a grisly pact entered into by the boys) won the Bronze Horse in Stockholm
and the international critics’ prize in Thessaloniki. The DVD edition from
First Run Features is a very clean full-frame transfer that highlights the
film’s uncommonly high production values and Dragojevic’s penchant for often
uncomfortably intimate close-up work. Other titles of interest from this era and
region include Emir Kusturica’s <i>Underground</i> and <i>Black Cat, White Cat</i>,
as well as Goran Paskaljevic’s monumental <i>Cabaret Balkan</i> (aka <i>The
Powder</i> <i>Keg</i>). At once desperate and focused, the incendiary brilliance
of these films comes from the righteous anger of their makers, who yearn for a
better world in the midst of unrelenting chaos and grief and know that laughter
can often be the best medicine.<o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;This DVD is awesome; wait’ll you see
it,&quot; enthuses <i>Toy Story</i>’s jolly creator, director John Lasseter,
during the live action connecting sequences featuring him and the band of merry
men and women who created this deserving franchise, and he’s right: a late
arrival at the DVD party, Disney has jumped into the forefront of classy and
value-added box sets with <i>Toy Story: The Ultimate Toy Box</i>. Clocking in at
a whopping nine hours and six minutes, this three-disc collection features the
eighty-minute <i>Toy Story</i> (1995) on disc one and the ninety-two-minute <i>Toy
Story 2</i> (1999) on the second disc. While each of these discs has a full
complement of extras (audio commentary, production featurettes and the like),
they also have content that sets them apart from the norm. Early Pixar shorts
such as the Oscar-winning <i>Tin Toy</i> and <i>Luxo Jr.</i> are here, as are
those famous <i>Toy Story</i> outtakes, a multi-language reel demonstrating what
the film looked and sounded like in 30 different countries, the dozens of
exclusive interstitials created for ABC’s Saturday morning slate and even a
sneak peek at the next Pixar opus, <i>Monsters, Inc</i>. But the real revelation
of the box for fans of the films who are also interested in the process is disc
three. The supplemental features cover all phases of the production, from
early-years story gestation (did you know Buzz Lightyear was originally named
Lunar Larry?) through the relatively last-minute decision to release <i>Toy
Story 2</i> commercially instead of straight-to-video (!!!). There’s
more—much more—and as a real bonus to the consumer the extras are detailed
on the outside of the packaging. &quot;We sweat the details,&quot; Lasseter
chirps brightly deep in disc three, and he ain’t kiddin’: making these
movies must’ve been a high-risk enterprise, but Toy Story: The Ultimate Toy
Box makes it look like nothing but fun. <o:p>
