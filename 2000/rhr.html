            Resources</i>. French workers may have an enviable 35-hour week, but
            downsizing is just as real a danger as it is on this side of the
            Atlantic.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Not surprisingly, the conflict over
            the implementation of that abbreviated work schedule drives the
            film. Young Frank (Jalil Lespert) returns from college in Paris for
            a coveted internship at the factory where his father (Jean-Claude
            Vallod) works in rural Normandy. Dad, who has a monotonous job
            assembling parts, is proud that 30 years of toil has enabled him to
            send his son on the executive gravy train. With his blue-collar
            roots and his confident, energetic manner, Frank seems ideal to help
            mediate some of the disputes with the local union.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Even though he looks at home in his
            suit, the company and his father’s co-workers trust him to help
            settle some of the issues the company has with the 35-hour week. The
            company has just returned to profitability after laying off over
            twenty workers. The initially cordial negotiations get nasty when
            the local boss (Lucien Longueville) refuses to grant job security.
            The uncompromising and abrasive union leader Mrs. Arnoux (Danielle Mélador)
            storms out, stalling the talks. In order to circumvent the union,
            Frank sends out a questionnaire about the new hours. Because it
            allows management some flexibility in assigning hours, both the
            suits and the rank-and-file happily comply.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Frank’s success makes him eager
            to join the company and get on the executive fast track. His
            attitude changes radically when he discovers that the management is
            secretly planning to drop 12 more workers, including Frank’s
            father. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Human Resources</i> is
            a little film that has a lot going for it, but plot developments
            like this one almost sink it. The characters are often too narrowly
            delineated. From our first encounter with him, Longeuville comes
            across as evasive and condescending, and most of the works appear
            long-suffering but noble. It takes a Herculean effort to sympathize
            with greedy CEO’s, but Cantet and his co-writer Gilles Marchand
            make the conflict too obvious. When revelations that are intended to
            startle fail to do so, it’s because the situation, while credible,
            still feels inert.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If Cantet outlines <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Human
            Resources</i> like a Gallic Frank Capra movie, he ends the flick
            ambiguously, bolstering its credibility. Cantet also demonstrates a
            remarkable hand with his performers. Lespert has an appealing
            presence and shows some real range. He’s also the only
            professional thespian in the cast. All of the others on the screen
            are landed jobs on the film when Cantet scoured the unemployment
            lines looking for people who could fit the roles. Bosses play the
            bosses, and Mélador is really a union official. All of the people
            in the film look as if they belong in the factory, but they have
            enough poise in front of the camera to hold their own with Lespert.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Cantet also shot the movie on
            Digital Video. Although the technology shown here is inferior to
            film, it’s actually an asset. The grainy, dull colors make the
            factory and the town that surrounds it look even more bleak. If the
            workers don’t appear to be leaping for joy, one quick glance
            offers an explanation. The tasks are repetitive and often reduce the
            workers to components of the machines. With his eye for atmosphere
            and the people who inhabit it, Cantet can be forgiven for standing
            too long on his soapbox.</font>
