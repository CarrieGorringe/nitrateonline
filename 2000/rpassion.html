it's hard to say when a film goes wrong. It may be a brief image that looks out
of place or bit of dialogue that sounds stilted and silly enough to make an
audience laugh out loud -- when the film isn't a comedy. In <i>Passion of Mind</i>,
the point of no return comes early and hard. Specifically, it comes in the first
minute, as the camera slowly approaches a clay bust that sort of resembles star
Demi Moore. Her voice over speaks scratchily (like she always does) but also
softly, like she's dreaming, or better, imagines she's being serious and
intimate: &quot;This is me or her, we're the same. That's what we look
like.&quot; She's concerned, you see, Moore's character Marie, because when she
dreams at night, she becomes Marty, and vice versa. Both experiences are so real
to her that she doesn't want to give up either. And besides, what's so great
about reality anyway? Or smart movies, for that matter? <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Right.
This is yet another movie about a woman with two selves, or two lives, or two
dimensions, like <i>Julia and Julia</i> (Kathleen Turner got there ahead of the
pack, way back in 1987), the anemic Gwyneth Paltrow vehicle <i>Sliding Doors </i>or
this year's <i>Me Myself I, </i>starring the previously irrepressible Rachel
Griffith. The dilemma facing these characters invariably involves bringing home
the bacon and frying it up in a pan, that is, choices they wish they'd made or
had, that is, between career and motherhood. Given that this formula is fairly
set, one might wonder what Ms. Demi, who has taken on her share of silly and
dicey, controversial and/or preposterous parts, might have had on her mind when
she made the choice to appear in yet another rendition of it. I suppose someone
could make the case that the movie -- directed, sadly, by Alain Berliner, the
Belgian filmmaker who managed an insightful and delightful critique of gender
roles in <i>Ma vie en rose </i>a couple of years ago -- offers the intrepid
Moore a chance to &quot;stretch,&quot; in the way that actors like to say they
like to do. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">But
for the most part, Moore looks and acts the same as Marie and Marty. Marie is a
widowed mother of two daughters, a book reviewer living in Provence, where she
can root around in the dirt and wear overalls and smudges on her nose. At
bedtime, she locks herself in her room, so that no one can wake her unexpectedly
(like, for a fire, or an emergency concerning one of her young daughters) and
tear her from her other life before she's ready. A lingering shot of Marie's
keys on the nightstand... and voila!, the film cuts to Marty's ablutions morning
in Manhattan. Where Marie's life is recognizably cluttered but simple -- perhaps
grounded is the better term -- everything in Marty's existence is expensive and
tasteful, precise and reeking of privilege: she's a fancy schmancy literary
agent who takes her coffee and cell phone to her rooftop that allows her (and
the sweeping camera) to survey the Big Apple's spectacular skyline, and she
dresses in ferociously haute couture, all layered black suits and ruffled necks
and expensive brooches. Dynamic, successful, and not a little brittle, Marty's
been -- you guessed it -- avoiding romance until she meets a compassionate
accountant, Aaron (William Fichtner). At this point, the film lurches into some
higher gear, by which I mean, it begins to spin its wheels furiously on its way
to nowhere special. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">While
Marty confides in Aaron (who calls his secretary and cancels his Day when Marty,
all a twitter after an emotional night as Marie, pleads, suddenly needy and
girlish, &quot;Stay with me today?!&quot;), Marie has Jessie (Sinead Cusack), a
boozy, chain-smoking woman who seems to have nothing better to do than sit
around and listen to Marie describe her other life. As Marie talks, she's
planting things or cleaning up after her kids. Marty has to be taught to feel
anything sensual: Aaron takes her on a ferry ride (woo-hoo!). The contrast is
clear enough in all kinds of rigidly conventional and ideological terms: Marie
is the earth mama and Marty (as her name trumpets) is the urban, mannish, and
lonely executive. Yet, each incarnation has ostensibly attractive points
(otherwise, why would they be dreaming each other up?) and each has annoying
hang-ups and twitches (and, truth be told, as Marty, Moore has moments where she
calls up the perky corporate demonness she played in <i>Disclosure, </i>that
excellently trashy flick in which her dizzied-up cyberself attacked Michael
Douglas in a green-gridded virtual reality: you can file that under appealing or
annoying, whichever you prefer). <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Jessie's
not the only one who's in on Marty and Marie's secret. They know about each
other (the time frame is not entirely clear, but it seems they've been at this
for a couple of years), and increasingly, they're blabbing about their other
lives to anyone who will listen. Two who are paid to do so are their respective
shrinks, Dr. Peters (Peter Riegert) in the city and Dr. Langer (Joss Ackland) in
the country (he speaks with a Freudish accent and an apparently genuine concern
for his troubled and often tearful patient, all of which suggests, right off,
that he's somewhat less than real). Marie's in love with a writer whose book she
once tore up in a review, the rumpled and passionate William (Stellan Skarsgard).
He courts her with a candlelit dinner (shot in the castle that once belonged to
the Marquis de Sade: make of that what you will). Before he becomes aggressive
in his pursuit, William is perfectly patient and devoted to Marie's kids, and
lets her lock herself up in the bedroom after they make love while on vacation.
How perfect is that?, you may be thinking, as William snarfles off to the sofa
in the next room. Or, you might just as likely be thinking, what's wrong with
this picture? The significantly named Dr. Peters thinks there's plenty wrong,
and he tells Marty straight up: she should not be talking about her second life
(her &quot;condition,&quot; as Peters puts it) to anyone, especially Aaron,
because he might think she's psycho and she'd lose her last chance for love.
Oops, too late! <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">And
so the deal becomes this: which existence will be more tolerant and forgiving of
Marty's and Marie's selfishness and doubleness and wild imagination(s)? The
belief among Marty/Marie's cohort is that the more generous one is the unreal
one, because life is hard (and two are <i>really </i>hard). Such difficulty and
complexity are not always a sign that you are &quot;mad as a hatter&quot;
(Marty's phrase, or perhaps it's Marie's, I've lost track). Rather, these are
the sorts of quandaries that shape most daily lives. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Passion
of Mind's </span></i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">melodramatic
approach to Marty/Marie's search for her &quot;identity&quot; seems born of the
era which has produced it, the era where public confessional stands in for
actually working through a problem, where appearing on <i>Oprah </i>or <i>Jenny
Jones </i>is a sign that you are seeking a &quot;normal&quot; life (the
definition of &quot;normal&quot; remains elusive, but assumed). In fact, the
horribly titled and unevenly written (by Ron Bass, responsible for <i>Rain Man </i>and
<i>My Best Friend's Wedding</i>) <i>Passion of Mind </i>is rife with questions
worth asking, like, for instance, How do you know what's real? How do you know
who you are? How do you shape reality, by thinking or imagining it? Do multiple
realities exist simultaneously, just waiting to be uncovered by warp speed and
other on-the-horizon technologies? But the film never quite gets to the radical
departure from normalizing narrative that it promises. Instead, it reduces
potential answers to these questions to a kind of convenient psychobabble,
having to do with Marie/Marty's family history, and in effect, &quot;hystericizes&quot;
her in a very conventional and unimaginative way: exploring her own passions, it
seems, can only make a woman unhappy and confused. Better for her to capitulate
to expectations, and not aspire to too much.<o:p>
