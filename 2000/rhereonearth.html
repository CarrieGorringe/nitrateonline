<p class="MsoBodyText"><font size="5"><b>“T</b></font><font size="4">o the
moon, Alice!” I hear the late Jackie Gleason (as Honeymooner Ralph Kramden)
telling his wife where <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Here on Earth</i> should be forwarded. Look for a crash landing as this
airless, misbegotten movie sinks under the onerous weight of Michael
Seitzman’s boggy, recycled tale of two boys and a girl whose paths cross on
the proverbial wrong side of the tracks. Stop this film, you’ll want to get
off, unless you like that unintentional snickering that’s breaking out in
theaters nationwide showing this tragedy. This all-too-serious attempt to
reprise the prep student vs. townie conundrum ends up flat as a CD. (The
film’s calculated-to-sell rock soundtrack is best heard without watching the
film.) Oh the pain, the PAIN!</font></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Kelley Morse (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Election</i>’s
Chris Klein) is so rich his father bought him an extra vowel, yet can’t spring
for an ounce of love. Workaholic and heartless dad (Stuart Wilson, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">sans</i>
the gleeful menace of his nefarious characters in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
Mask of Zorro</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">No Escape</i>) has
most recently offered up to his valedictorian son an ultra-expensive Mercedes,
hoping to replace a hug with a hot rod as the boy approaches graduation day at
Rallston, a posh New England private school. We’ll eventually learn that Morse
and son hide one of the film’s several “secrets,” supposedly positioned to
tinge the story with pathos, yet director Mark Piznarski, in his feature debut,
slamdunks too many clues to make the final revelation anything resembling a
mystery.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">When the brawny and supposedly brainy offspring (we know
this by his uninspired spouting of Robert Frost's poetry) goes slumming in the
nearby small, Norman Rockwellesque town of Putnam, he gets blue collar stares
from the patrons at the popular eatery Mable’s Table. After making goo-goo
eyes at the porcelain-skinned Samantha “Sam” Cavanaugh (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Joan of Arc</i>’s Leelee Sobieski), her longtime, hotheaded boyfriend
Jasper (Josh Hartnett from <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Halloween: H20</i>)
suffers a disastrous case of road rage with the out-of-towner that obliterates
the local gas station and the adjacent diner, which had been in Sam’s family
for several generations.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The rest of the film finds both boys responsible in the
eyes of the law and forced to help rebuild what they have destroyed. Rich
boy/poor boy bonding (actually the lack thereof) and the sexual awakenings of
the girl betwixt them take up most of the time, as Sam, her makeup and hair
perfect for a prom date in way too many scenes, is attracted to the moody,
Adonis-like Kelley. The resulting triangle results in a flood of sharp,
hot-headed edges and bad feelings, as the rich kid mopes by himself, forgoing
happy meals but getting drunk with cows.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">One of the two most dysfunctional scenes in the film
occurs on one of those hot summer days. Sam’s boiling sexually as the warm
sunshine pounds the glistening, sweaty body of a shirtless, narcissistic
“I’m a hunk; fly me.” Kelley. “I’m hot,” she mutters. “Oh no!”
the audience laughs as she stares at the young stud muffin. There’s small talk
of handcuffs. I wonder: let’s jail the screenwriter.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Later I think, &quot;Let’s amend the arrest warrant and
throw in director of photography Michael D. O’Shea for too much sun-drenched,
luminous flawlessness.&quot; Which brings me to another cricket-chirpy sequence
bathed in bucolic brilliance but lacking in anything but droll educational
value. It’s a geography/anatomy lesson in which Kelley plays doctor/teacher
with Sam, cradled on a bed of grass, with his idea of organic statehood. He
caresses her Florida feet and North Carolina knee, moving north to my home state
of Maryland (belly button). Censors must have eliminated references to Virginia,
but Sam’s breasts are christened New York and New Jersey before the nutty
professor lands on the mouth of Massachusetts. Not enough contrived cuteness for
you? Sam zings a final “(Massachusetts) welcomes you.” Ugh.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Although sporting an impressive supporting cast (Annette
O’Toole and Bruce Greenwood as Sam’s parents; Annie Corley and Michael
Rooker as Jasper’s folks), TV director Piznarski (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Relativity</i>,
<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">My So-Called Life</i>) garners nothing but
lead out of Sobieski and Klein, both of whom have flourished under better
supervision. Overwrought with kitsch and with an obvious nod to 1970’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Love
Story</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Here on Earth</i>’s final score is two hankies, and one star (out of
four). They got the title wrong too: talk about <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Hell on Earth</i>.</p>
