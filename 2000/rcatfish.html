            (Chi Muoi Lo) and his sister Mai (Lauren Tom) have been living in
            Los Angeles for some twenty-two years, ever since they fled Vietnam
            in 1975, during the fall of Saigon, and were adopted by Harold (Paul
            Winfield) and Dolores (Mary Alice). Dwayne appears to be fully
            assimilated into U.S. culture, meaning that he listens to hiphop,
            eats cereal while reading the box, uses slang like &quot;Peace,
            out,&quot; and shares an easy, trusting friendship which his sweet
            white boy roommate Michael (Tyler Christopher). In addition, and
            perhaps as further testament to his assimilation, Dwayne is fretting
            about asking his pretty nurse girlfriend Nina (Sanaa Lathan) to
            marry him. After an afternoon during which the time has never been
            quite &quot;right&quot; enough to pull out the ring and pop the
            question, Dwayne is at his wit's end. Partway through a barbeque at
            his folks' place, he can't get Nina's attention, and he's fingering
            the ring. Suddenly, Dwayne yells out the question, so that it seems
            he's pledging his troth while in the throes of a fit of some kind.
            The camera cuts to reaction shots: Harold, Alice, and Nina all
            looking politely astonished and then, still politely, horrified. And
            yet everyone carries on, as if this is all just fine. <o:p>

            knowing how to react is a problem that runs throughout Chi Muoi Lo's
            <i>Catfish in Black Bean Sauce</i>, which is named for a traditional
            Vietnamese dish that originated in China. Seeking some kind of
            settled identity within his mixed cultural heritage, Dwayne is
            rather scrambling about. And you're privy to much of this process,
            as the film provides scenes that are immediately revealed as his
            &quot;fantasies,&quot; anxieties making their way to the visual
            foreground (for instance, he imagines Nina riding off with a traffic
            cop on the back of his motorcycle). Such images are cute, but they
            never have much at stake, and worse, instead of getting you inside
            Dwayne's head, they tend to make you feel sorry for him or again,
            not sure how to take him. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">With
            all his traumas concerning Nina, Dwayne is naturally preoccupied,
            which means he doesn't see his next trauma coming. It turns out that
            Mai, while ostensibly secure in her marriage with the infinitely
            patient Vinh (Tza Ma), has also been &quot;dealing&quot; with her
            anger and feelings of displacement; because she is older than
            Dwayne, she has actual memories of their lives before. The result:
            she tracks down their birth mother in Vietnam, and brings her to the
            States. Once Thanh (Kieu Chinh) arrives, however, she is less
            interested in her daughter than in her son -- who frankly would
            rather have nothing to do with her. Thanh turns down Mai's offer of
            a room (which has been in preparation for months) and moves in with
            Dwayne and Michael. No surprise, this leads to something of an
            identity crisis for Dwayne, who begins to recover his Vietnamese
            roots, re-adopting his birth name, Pho, and rejecting Harold and
            Alice. At the same time, and in a sort of secondary-plot overkill,
            Michael is going through his own crisis, as it comes out that his
            flamboyant Chinese girlfriend Samantha (Wing Chen) is a transvestite
            who once went by the name of Sam (she's either pre-op or
            never-going-to-op, it's never quite clear). <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">These
            emotionally charged situations are too often turned into broad
            comedy, showing the family members learning to accept one another
            despite their obvious turf anxieties. One set piece in particular
            illustrates the various dynamics and battles. Thanh comes with
            Dwayne to dinner at Harold and Alice's, and when Thanh finds the
            Chinese food that Alice has prepared not quite tasty enough, she
            pulls out a bottle of Vietnamese sauce. Not knowing how to react --
            again -- the rest of the group either abstains altogether or douses
            their food with the sauce, grimace, and attempt to hide their
            distaste. This comic-hijinksy moment is followed up by a
            morning-after scene, where Harold is feeling the effects of the
            sauce. This would be the clear cost of cultural mixing. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For
            all its clumsiness, however, <i>Catfish</i> does make some
            potentially pressing points. One has to do with the differences
            between the ways that generations handle cultural and racial
            disparities: while Mai often behaves as if she's mothering -- or
            scolding -- Dwayne, when she's with her mother(s), you realize that
            in fact, she is a daughter, trying to come to grips with her
            position between one culture and another, and more to the point, one
            mother and another. While good-natured Harold tends to stay out of
            the way, the two older women are hard at it in their competition,
            not so much for the children's affections as their declarations of
            loyalty. This is surely a relationship worth exploring, but the
            film's low point comes when the two mothers have it out, clawing at
            each other's hair and flailing about with their balled-up fists, in
            Dwayne's living room, before yet another assembly of astonished
            viewers. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">That
            these viewers include Michael and Samantha is another potentially
            interesting issue that the film never quite wrestles to a
            conclusion. Michael is going through his own &quot;issue,&quot;
            insisting to Dwayne that he's not &quot;gay,&quot; because Samantha
            looks like a girl. And Samantha, well, she's a drama queen in most
            every way, and the butt of a couple of audience in-jokes when Thanh
            points to her as an example of an &quot;appropriate&quot; wife for
            Dwayne, as opposed to Nina. But this is tedious joking at Samantha's
            and Thanh's expense, skipping over Dwayne's real confusions about
            his allegiances -- to black, U.S., Vietnamese, or masculine
            cultures. Or, more precisely, he's confused about whether
            allegiances are necessary to understand himself as a whole and
            worthy individual. This is a real question, and one he (or anyone,
            for that matter) might be better off asking without having to
            perform the answers for audiences, on and off screen. Too often glib
            in its presentation of complex concerns, at its best, <i>Catfish in
            Black Bean Sauce</i> explores the costs of passing judgments. In the
            end, not knowing how to react may be the most honest and potentially
            productive reaction. <o:p>
