            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Alvin
            Sanders (Jamie Foxx) is on the run. Almost from the moment you first
            see him, Alvin is running, from dogs and bad guys and supposed good
            guys, though the very fact that he's running from them makes even
            the good guys suspect. Although he's basically a petty thief, Alvin
            is dim but also brilliant in a typical movie &quot;street&quot;
            sense, well-intentioned, and undeniably charming. Sure, he talks
            fast and postures like a tough guy, but from jump, <i>Bait</i> makes
            sure you know right away that he's easily frightened, amiable, and
            uses his genius only in the most non-threatening ways. He doesn't
            even wear baggy jeans. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">To
            set up this nice-guyness, the film introduces Alvin just as he and
            his brother Stevie (Mike Epps, from <i>Next Friday</i>) embark on
            one of the more harebrained schemes ever conceived, stealing sacks
            of shrimps from a seafood warehouse. Within two minutes, Alvin and
            Stevie are charging down an alley, bags slung over their shoulders
            and a big old Doberman guard dog close on their asses. The brothers
            split up, and in just a couple more minutes, Alvin's in a prison
            cell with a white guy named Jaster (Robert Pastorelli), who just
            happens to have stolen and hidden $42 million in gold and also
            happens to have a heart condition. Afraid he's going to die soon
            (which he does), Jaster gives Alvin a cryptic message to deliver to
            his (Jaster's) wife. The special treasury agents looking for the
            gold decide that Alvin knows something (which he only sort of does:
            he has no idea what the coded message means) and set about to
            develop a specific technology that will enable them to use Alvin to
            recover the loot. (Hence, &quot;bait,&quot; a reference parlayed
            into a number of jokes during the film, not the least cute being
            Alvin's mugshot on his arrest that fateful night, for which he poses
            holding a shrimp up next to his face.) <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            surveillance technology turns out to be a kind of tracking device
            implanted surgically into Alvin's jaw: it happens while he's in
            prison, and don't even ask how the feds manage this insanely
            clandestine &quot;operation&quot; -- as Alvin's wheeled in on a
            gurney, someone asks the man in charge, &quot;Exactly how many laws
            are you breaking here?&quot; To which he responds, &quot;You don't
            want to know.&quot; I guess that means &quot;a lot.&quot; It plainly
            means that this man in charge -- who is by the way, named Edgar
            Clenteen (David Morse) -- is a serious force to be reckoned with,
            menacing without even needing to draw a weapon: he's unnerving just
            by showing up. So, in <i>his</i> first scene, Clenteen observes the
            detectives and cops who are standing around, contaminating
            &quot;his&quot; crime scene (the vault from which the gold has
            disappeared), then scares them all off with a few choice words. All
            this is to say, he is the complete opposite of our Alvin. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            federal agents tend to do in such hackneyed situations, Clenteen
            assembles a crackerjack team, including David Paymer as his second
            in command, <i>Scream</i>'s Jamie Kennedy as the computer geek (who
            wears mr. cool sunglasses for his intro shot), Nestor Serrano as the
            man on the street, and Megan Dodds as the woman (she needs no other
            description, unfortunately: the film features repeated close-ups of
            her red-lipsticked mouth during tense situations). Their objective
            is to be there at the precise moment when Alvin is contacted by
            Jaster's partner, a Kevin Spacey-meets-John Malkovichian psycho
            named Bristol (Doug Hutchison -- slimy Percy in <i>The Green Mile</i>
            and the even slimier Tooms in TV's <i>X-Files</i>). Bristol escaped
            at the time of the heist, and has been waiting nearly two years to
            track down the gold his dead partner stashed. As bait, Alvin's
            expendable, according to Clenteen, but it's not long before the team
            is admiring their target's chutzpah and secretly wishing him well.
            Their surveillance is total: they listen to Alvin as he reunites
            with Stevie (&quot;Yeah! We back on the block!&quot;) and with his
            girlfriend Lisa (Kimberly Elise), who is also -- he learns just now
            -- the mother of his infant son. Complications arise, as Bristol
            invades Alvin's domestic space (kidnapping the mother and child,
            naturally). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">All
            this relentless tracking -- mapping Alvin with digital devices and
            grids, protecting him from arrests and beat-downs, listening in on
            him having luscious sex with his woman (the men listening in are
            increasingly uncomfortable, the woman sucks on her pencil), or
            foolishly applying for a job at a store he once robbed -- may bring
            to mind another recent film, Tony Scott's <i>Enemy of the State</i>
            (1998), in which Will Smith is the object of U.S. military pursuit,
            embodied by Jon Voight. And this reference in turn may bring to mind
            the Keenen Ivory Wayans vehicle, <i>Most Wanted</i> (1997), in which
            he is also pursued by an ornery authority figure played by Jon
            Voight, or again the many variations: Brian Hooks in <i>3 Strikes</i>
            (2000), Danny Glover in <i>Predator 2</i> (1990, where the
            &quot;authorities&quot; are space aliens), Martin Lawrence in <i>Blue
            Streak</i> (1999), Samuel Jackson in <i>The Long Kiss Goodnight</i>
            (1996) and <i>The Negotiator</i> (1998), Ice T in <i>Surviving the
            Game</i> (1994), Denzel Washington in <i>Ricochet</i> (1991), Tupac
            Shakur in <i>Gridlock'd</i> (1997), Laurence Fishburne in <i>Fled</i>
            (1996), Ving Rhames and Vondie Curtis-Hall in <i>The Drop Squad</i>
            (1994), Mario Van Peebles in <i>Solo</i> (1996), Will Smith in <i>Wild
            Wild West</i> (1999), Wesley Snipes in almost anything -- <i>U.S.
            Marshals</i> (1998), <i>Boiling Point</i> (1993), <i>The Art of War</i>
            (2000), and so on. This list is hardly exhaustive, but you see what
            I'm getting at: a black man on the run from the law is,
            unfortunately, always timely, dating back to Oscar Micheaux and
            Spencer Williams's &quot;race&quot; movies and expanding
            representational possibilities in more militant incarnations like
            Melvin Van Peebles in <i>Sweet Sweetback's Baadasssss Song</i>
            (1971) and Ivan Dixon in <i>The Spook Who Sat by The Door</i>
            (1973), or even the venerable Sidney Poitier in <i>The Defiant Ones</i>
            (1958).<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">A
            friend of mine, Scott Trafton, calls these films &quot;new fugitive
            slave narratives,&quot; because they rehearse and sometimes reinvent
            many of the old texts' themes and plot structures: brainy, sexy,
            unapologetically aggressive black male protagonists (and they are
            almost always male, Pam Grier and Tamara Dobson being the 1970s'
            potent exceptions) outfox white authorities, prove themselves
            superior in numerous arenas (political, physical, legal, romantic),
            find support from a subversive network or individual. As it happens,
            <i>Bait</i> is completely upfront about its sources, citing Harriet
            Tubman by name and sending Alvin through a variety of
            &quot;underground&quot; routes to reach his goals (dark city
            streets, the back stables at a racetrack), in addition to featuring
            repeated images of him locked up, tied up, and otherwise messed up
            by diabolical maniacs on both sides of the law (these include a pair
            of &quot;comic&quot; Latinos, Julio and Ramundo [Jeffrey Donovan and
            <i>Oz's</i> Kirk Acevedo], who, thwarted in their efforts to pound
            him, start calling Alvin &quot;the Devil&quot; because his
            persistent good luck is just too strange). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            fact that <i>Bait</i> can make these frankly righteous points
            without seeming overtly self-righteous is to its credit, though to
            do so it occasionally lapses into crude comedy (which Foxx actually
            handles with sly charm) and cruder action-movie clichés (Alvin has
            to save his otherwise very capable girlfriend when she's knocked
            unconscious). The film's most effective balancing act comes in the
            form of Foxx's terrific performance: throughout, he's quirky,
            subtle, and thankfully able to keep up with the movie's lurching
            tone-and-genre shifts, from comedy to action to almost-arty to
            melodrama. It's a tricky part, and he mostly convinces you that
            good-hearted Alvin is not as clueless as he seems. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">All
            this is not to say that <i>Bait</i> is an especially
            &quot;good&quot; movie: it's predictable, silly, and annoying. But
            it's also well-aware of the formula it's running. And it works hard
            to hit on multiple generic thrills while also making its
            audience-friendly &quot;fugitive slave narrative&quot; points about
            class and race politics. And generally, <i>Bait</i> does all right
            as an intelligent action-comedy. And if it isn't so blunt with its
            politics as, say, <i>Blade</i>, it does have a similar sensational
            stylishness (time-lapse photography, lots of neon and chiaroscuro).
            Director Antoine Fuqua (<i>The Replacement Killers</i>),
            cinematographer Tobias Schleisser, and editor Alan Edward Bell have
            concocted outrageous riffs on conventions like car chases and fight
            scenes, which are just flat-out awesome to watch. You feel like
            you're on some wild-ass carnival ride: the images are so close and
            the cuts so fast that you can barely read what's going on. For
            instance, Alvin and Bristol beat on each other in a horse's stall,
            the animal thrashing about all around them, suddenly you notice out
            of the corner of your eye that Alvin is actually <b><i>biting</i></b>
            that a**hole. It's enough to make you wonder who and what you're
            rooting for. And that's a good thing to wonder. <o:p>
