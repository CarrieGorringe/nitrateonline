            kuen II (Drunken Master II)</i>, a limp Chinese noodle-headed sequel
            to his 1978 breakthrough feature. Trying to sacrifice a few bucks
            from your wallet to the box office gods, you could spare yourself
            those dollars by renting the English-subtitled version long
            available from your home video store. It’s pretty much the same
            film, dubbed (horribly) and with a new, perfunctory score by Michael
            Wandmacher. Even the British actors’ voices don’t sync up
            properly! If you’re going to see this film, I recommend you
            don’t watch the actors’ lips; it’ll be very disconcerting.<o:p>

            the stuntwork is hyped as &quot;must-be-seen-to-be-believed,&quot;
            its small scale stuff. Don’t expect anything other than
            fast-and-fancy footwork and hand-to-hand combat in this campy salute
            to Chinese folk-hero Wong Fei-Hung. As the legendary master of a
            never-ending variety of Kung Fu styles, the ever charismatic Chan
            embraces that real life character as a drunken role model, guzzling
            oddles of wine and undoubtedly encouraging young impressionable
            minds to go home and scavenge through their parents’ liquor
            cabinet in search of similar inspiration. Somewhere, some youngster
            will undoubtedly aspire to imitate the alcoholically-impaired Fei-Hunt
            as he stumbles to martial mastery against corrupt British officials
            smuggling Chinese artifacts out of the country (a plot device
            peripherally appropriated for Chan’s 1998 first American starring
            vehicle <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Rush Hour</i>). There
            are obvious similarities to Popeye, replacing spinach with fermented
            grain.<o:p>

            the other hand, an ambitious adolescent may just look at the film
            and realize they could write something a hell of a lot better than
            this leaden undertaking. The film is just plain dull and confusing.
            Perhaps I shouldn’t begrudge Mr. Chan for what I consider a lesser
            effort, but then a character that’s been the subject of more than
            200 Hong Kong and Chinese films should have been retired if the
            screenwriters couldn’t come up with something more exciting than
            this sad excuse for action entertainment.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Chan
            imbues a dopey charm on his drunken master, with a latent defiance
            that nearly always proceeds into one of the several battle
            sequences, two of the better featuring director/martial arts
            choreographer Lau Ka Leung as Fu Min-chi, a sly old fellow who Fei-Hung
            later befriends. Their initial confrontation beneath a train stopped
            for supplies showcases a rubbery bamboo spear and just as pliable
            metal sword. Later they both clash with a horde of ax-wielding
            mercenaries who can’t seem to plant their weapons terribly well.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">On
            the home front, the 40ish Chan barely passes off as the dutiful,
            twentysomething son of Wong Kei-Ying (Ti Lung), who runs a martial
            arts school on some valuable land, and shrewdly aware stepson of
            thirtysomething Madame Wong (Anita Mui), who not-so-delicately hides
            her affinity for gambling from her husband (although everyone else
            in town seems to known about her formidable mah-jong triumphs).
            Family and friends (a fishmonger and snake seller among them)
            eventually get drawn into the farce, which begins when Fei-Hung, to
            avoid a customs payment, secrets a valuable ginseng root in a
            diplomat’s bag. The container happens to be the same size and
            shape, and be wrapped in the plain yellow covering, that it becomes
            mixed up with a box containing a precious jade seal being pilfered
            from the People’s Republic. The comic situation that follows, as
            Fei-Hung and Madame Wong maneuver to replace the missing root, is as
            underdeveloped as the rest of this story line, wherein mom decides
            to sell a precious necklace (why not use her wagered gains?) to
            spare her stepson embarrassment before his father. The writers also
            rip off a Three Stooges routine that belittles the memories of Moe,
            Larry, and Curly (who seem to have doubles lurching amongst the
            henchmen). Nyuk-nyuk-no-no.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            action climaxes in a steel factory, whose malevolent management are
            thugs in cahoots with the evil British consul, but the overworked,
            underpaid workers seem to evaporate as the stuntwork increases. As
            the rest of the cast vanishes, Fei-Hong gets busy downing large
            shots of what appears to be high octane unleaded to fire up his
            opposition. He’s hot and bothered, but all his drinking just makes
            me angry and tired. Next time I’m at the video store, I’ll pass
            this one by.<o:p>
