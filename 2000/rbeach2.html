<hr size="4" width="60">
</i>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="5"><b>&quot;I</b></font><font size="4">nnocence
never lasts forever.&quot; This is the tagline for <i>The Beach</i>, the
expensive and highly touted occasion for Leo's long-awaited return to the big
screen. How silly it sounds, when everyone knows that &quot;innocence&quot; is
impossible to lose because it never exists, except as a marketing hook and plot
device, a gorgeous vacation postcard brought into perfectly composed cinematic
existence in <i>The Beach</i>.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It
surprises me that the well-paid and surely well-experienced PR folks would cook
up a tagline so dumb and so overtly cynical, but it could be that I'm missing
the point. It could be that they think potential viewers of the film will read
that tagline and think, &quot;Hmmm, you know, that's <i>so</i> true, innocence
doesn't last forever,&quot; and then happily lay down their eight bucks to get a
look at this innocence-losing process in <i>The Beach</i>. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It
could be, but I doubt it. For <i>The Beach</i> is the crassest kind of star
vehicle, where everyone involved seems to be hoping for a turn on Leonardo
DiCaprio's unimaginable popularity-ride. The movie commercials focus on Leo's
tanned body, MTV's <i>Movie Special</i> on his struggles with sex-symboldom, the
magazine covers on his youthfully poofy cheeks and fuzzy chin (<i>Talk</i>, <i>The
Face</i>, <i>Rolling Stone</i>, <i>Time</i>) or his scrumptious-diddly-umptious
co-star Virginie Ledoyen (<i>Glamour</i>, <i>Details</i>, <i>Maxime Figaro</i>).
And what do you learn from this onslaught of Leo-ness? You learn that he
probably made the correct choice in taking <i>The Beach</i> Over Mary Harron's <i>American
Psycho</i> (based on Brett Easton Ellis's inflammatory novel), a
festival-rousing, controversial film about complex and difficult issues like
U.S. consumer culture, male aggression, racism and heterosexism. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
Beach</span></i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"> is
also about these things, but it handles them with a self-congratulatory
simplicity. This is sad, considering that the film has been put together by the
once-deft-and-trendy <i>Shallow Grave</i> and <i>Trainspotting</i> team,
director Danny Boyle, writer John Hodge (working from Alex Garland's novel), and
producer Andrew Macdonald (let's forget <i>A Life Less Ordinary</i> for the
moment, as everyone attached to <i>The Beach</i> seems to have done). It's also
sad that <i>The Beach</i> is at heart a silly movie with little to say about any
of the topics it appears to want to wrestle with. DiCaprio told <i>Rolling Stone</i>
that he sees the movie as being about &quot;how the human animal is pretty much
preprogrammed to destroy the natural order,&quot; and his character, Richard,
&quot;thinks he wants to live in a very primitive, isolated world,&quot; but
can't help being a &quot;silicon man,&quot; a product of his culture. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Early
in <i>The Beach</i>, Richard tells himself that he's looking for the real thing,
whether that be love, enlightenment, self-knowledge, or compassion. This is the
kind of quest that characters in &quot;important&quot; movie usually undertake,
whether on purpose or accidentally. <i>The Beach</i> references several of the
most famous of these movie quests, including <i>Apocalypse Now</i> (Robert
Duvall on the beach, on a background TV), <i>The Deerhunter</i> (via a nasty
Russian roulette-ish showdown), and <i>Lord of the Flies</i> (perhaps the most
obvious precedent, though far more devastating and self-interrogating than <i>The
Beach</i> seems able to imagine being). Even compared to Cimino's sentimental
recuperation of mishmashed community and patriotism, <i>The Beach</i> is
lightweight. Bewildered to the end, Richard and the movie pretend that he learns
a lesson about moral commitment. But he gets off easy, undeterred from the
blissful racism and imperialist ignorance with which he begins the film. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">This
beginning takes the form of a voice-over, as Richard wanders the crowded streets
in Bangkok, a tourist looking for a dose of what he conceives as dirty reality.
Challenged by one fellow to drink snake's blood, Richard initially resists, then
decides to do the deed: the camera shows him through a glass aquarium in which a
cobra is conveniently placed to flare its hood when Richard triumphantly imbibes
his bloody shot. &quot;Never refuse an invitation,&quot; he advises the rest of
us. &quot;Never resist the unfamiliar.&quot; Titillated by his own derring-do,
the erstwhile &quot;tourist&quot; Richard takes off his walkman and risks making
friends with a manifestly demented fellow renting down the hall who calls
himself Daffy (Robert Carlyle). Sweaty, ashy-faced, and crusty-lipped, Daffy's a
lot like Martin Sheen back in Saigon, troubled by demons (only he's a junkie
rather than a drunk). He and Richard share a spliff and some chat about paradise
and parasites, Daffy gives Richard a crude hand-drawn map, showing the way to a
mysterious island where dope grows everywhere and people are really, really
friendly. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Nervous
about going off on his own and not a little tempted by the beautiful French girl
staying with her boyfriend in the same hotel, Richard asks the couple to come
along. Luckily for the expedition, Etienne (Guillaume Canet) has some Thai, and
Francoise (Virginie Ledoyen) has more nerve than both the boys put together.
More easily than they should be able to, they make it to this island Valhalla,
and wouldn't you know it, things fall apart. There are clues along the way that
trouble is brewing, because Richard is a blabbermouth narrator, eager to tell
you what everything means and how it fits into his story. Mostly, he's eager to
tell you how he's feeling, which ranges from self-righteous to vaguely guilty to
victimized. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">At
the island, they're greeted by a fellow &quot;traveler&quot; named Keaty
(Paterson Joseph), who happens to be the only black character with a speaking
part. (&quot;Travelers&quot; are different in their minds from
&quot;tourists”.) Tellingly -- in this film's racial schematic -- Keaty will
serve as a kind of wise adviser to Richard, suggesting, for instance, that he
not take up with Francoise (which of course he does) and that he not isolate
himself from the rest of the community (which he also does). Deeper into the
island's forestry, Richard and his friends find that community, camped out for
some six years on an internal beach, what Richard calls &quot;a beach resort for
people who don't like beach resorts,&quot; composed of white sand, clear water,
and perfect fish who seem ready and willing to be speared (all gloriously shot
by Darius Khondji). <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">And
it turns out -- again, tellingly, given the money and leisure time it takes to
be reach the island -- that most all the community members are white,
English-speaking, and apparently straight beauties (a couple of girls hold
hands, but there's no sign that anyone has coupled off in any units other than
those of the standard &quot;missionary&quot; persuasion). This self-deemed
&quot;family&quot; (dysfunctional of course) is blond and tanned, looking way
too much like that happy fascist community who lived on the Utopian Planet in
the original <i>Star Trek</i> series, the one Captain Kirk had to lecture about
democracy and murder. Richard offers commentaries on the principals, but until
he's pressed, he mostly forgets about the first people he encounters on the
island. The &quot;farmers,&quot; as they're called, are a group of Thai men with
guns, guarding their abundant marijuana fields against interlopers. Though they
have a deal with the settlers, it's soon broken. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">This
change of terms is orchestrated around Richard's increasingly testy relationship
with the white folks' leader, Sal (Tilda Swinton). Though she appears at first
to be the ideal sort of leader-by-acclaim, she's soon revealed to be more
narcissistic than maternal or discreet, aided by her supercilious
carpenter-boyfriend Bugs (Lars Arentz-Hansen). She ends up being abusive in many
ways, and so transmutates into Richard's object lesson in bad behavior,
fair-skinned and freckled, treacherous and intimidating. Embodying whiteness and
self-interested aggression, Sal might be read as the film's perfect poster
person, someone willing to go to just about any lengths to preserve the
civilization-building fictions of paradise and innocence. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Sal's
conflict with Richard redeems him, which means she must be bad so he can be
good. This conflict is exemplified in a scene where he recounts his experience
with a shark that comes at him while he's spearing fish during a rainstorm that
has denied the community their usual fish meals. Imagining himself as the hero,
Richard tells his audience -- whose plates are now heaped with sharkmeat --
about his encounter, his initial fear, his decision to fight back, his delirious
triumph. Sal and Bugs sit off to the side, grumpily noting Richard's
self-aggrandizement at the expense of what was likely a baby shark, not an
accomplished predator at all. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Richard,
however, can't understand their disapproval. He sees himself as a hero and grand
storyteller. He's got the second part pretty much correct. <i>The Beach</i>
tells a lot of stories, not the least being that it has anything substantive to
say. In truth, this movie is not going to upset any conventional ideas, say,
neat oppositions between &quot;man&quot; and &quot;nature,&quot; or innocence
and experience. Instead, it's about confirming the myths that allow so-called
&quot;civilization&quot; to live with itself, to imagine that its intentions are
good even when its effects are horrific. What's more, the film is going to leave
DiCaprio's post-<i>Titanic</i> career intact, meaning that it's unlikely it will
change the way anyone feels about him, for good or ill. Throughout <i>The Beach</i>,
the star looks pretty, sun-blondish and flawlessly tanned. Even when he plays
caddish for a few minutes and has a raucous good time imagining himself (after
Sal banishes him to the forest for a few days) as a Playstation Gameboy hero.
The effects in this sequence are deliriously out of place in the rest of the
movie, which is one reason it's actually interesting, a bit of out-and-out
derangement in the midst of too much breathtaking beachscape imagery. Leo's fans
who are legion needn't fret. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
maintenance of DiCaprio's celebrity is, of course, no small matter, as it means
a lot of money for various people. (Lucky for Kate Winslett, no one seems to
hold her responsible for delivering star turns in the way everyone and his
mother seems to demand it of her <i>Titanic</i> co-star: even if <i>Holy Smoke</i>
is disappointing -- and not because of her -- <i>Hideous Kinky</i> is a lovely,
sensual, and risk-taking film, of which she should be proud). DiCaprio acts like
he means to do right by his fans and handlers, which translates, in part, to
acting mystified by his own fame. He recently told the <i>London Sun</i> that he
feels he's gone from being the underdog, whose movies never made any money,
&quot;to being the Antichrist.'' Poor guy. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Still,
it's possible to see <i>The Beach</i> as a parable for this trajectory, in that
it traces a young man's search for a rumored island paradise and his
disillusionment with the monstrosity he finds there, or more to the point, the
monstrosity he finds in himself (figured most spectacularly in that Gameboy
sequence: the tech-entertainment-creature rising up). But star and story never
probe too deeply into this revelation, as it might involve acknowledging the
extent to which the film's production itself became monstrous. That is, 20th
Century Fox has not fulfilled its promise to restore the location -- Maya Bay,
on the island of Phi Phi Lay -- that the production crew transformed into a
recognizable &quot;paradise&quot; (by planting non-indigenous palm trees that
ruined the island's own ecology). As if to add insult to injury, the studio has
embarked on a campaign to promote tourism in Thailand, in order to appease the
government, if not the actual people who live there. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It's
not a little ironic, then, that <i>The Beach</i> thematizes but never examines
its own assumptions concerning a similarly neocolonialist threat to
&quot;natural&quot; purity. On this tip, it may be worth noting that the movie's
Richard is not British, as in the novel, but a prototypical U.S. child of
privilege. Certainly, U.S. kids are the easiest targets for those looking to
condemn pop culture-multimedia-heads. Richard, so intently self-absorbed and so
oblivious to the chaos he wreaks during his search for truth and purity, appears
to embody all that is corrupt in U.S. cultural exporting. It could be that
Richard's grim glibness is precisely how <i>Simpsons</i> fan Danny Boyle sees
&quot;youths&quot; evolving Stateside, into dangerous, self-absorbed sharks,
feeding off their environments and exploiting anyone and anything that gets in
their way. But it's also true that such sharks are by definition unable to see
beyond themselves and their immediate needs, and that in human form, they tend
to make themselves feel better by creating and consuming self-images that look a
lot like <i>The Beach</i>.</span></p>
