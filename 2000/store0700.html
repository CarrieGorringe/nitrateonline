<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There’s something to be said for consistency,
particularly over a thirteen-film career now on the verge of its third decade.
And while there’s the legitimate question of what makes Pedro Almodovar
popular with a wide audience just now -- did the world finally catch up with his
gender-bending worldview or has he gradually retooled his approach for the
mainstream? -- there’s little debate about the unity of his vision. Since he
first burst on the American art-house scene with <i>Women on the Verge of a
Nervous Breakdown</i> over a decade ago, Almodovar has staked out the territory
of a Spanish cross between George Cukor and John Waters, the flamboyant but
compassionate chronicler of the often tangled but always rewarding relationships
among women. Following the momentum of 1995’s <i>The Flower of My Secret </i>and
1997’s <i>Live Flesh</i>, <i>All About My Mother</i> confirms his increasing
maturity as a filmmaker of great visual and emotional gifts (a pity the 1999
Cannes jury didn’t think so, giving Almodovar the Best Director award instead
of the Palm d’Or everybody else thought the movie deserved). The complex and
rewarding saga of a mother who travels from Madrid to Barcelona after her son
dies tragically, <i>All About My Mother</i> makes pointed structural references
to the Bette Davis picture <i>All About Eve</i> and Tennessee Williams’ "A
Streetcar Named Desire" in its story of show business, sexual ambiguity and
support. Drawing from the circle of actresses that have appeared in many of his
films, Almodovar elicits rich performances from Cecilia Roth as the grieving
mother, Marisa Paredes as a vulnerable actress, and Penelope Cruz as a pregnant
nun (what would an Almodovar movie be without a pregnant nun?). Thoughtful and
heartfelt, <i>All About My Mother</i> is a melodrama for moviegoers wary of the
genre. The DVD edition includes an isolated music score track, production notes
and featurette, and a conversation with the director. <o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Winner of the Audience Award at the
recently-concluded Karlovy Vary International Film Festival in the Czech
Republic, Alan Parker’s adaptation of <i>Angela’s Ashes</i>, Frank
McCourt’s heart-wrenching memoir about growing up in extreme poverty in
Limerick, touches some audiences and leaves others cold. In this way it displays
much of what’s good and bad in the director’s oeuvre. On one hand, there are
some ferociously vivid performances, particularly from the always-dependable
Emily Watson as the Angela of the title, who must suffer the human weaknesses of
her husband (Robert Carlyle) while raising her brood. But, as with most of
Parker’s most popular films (<i>Fame</i>, <i>Mississippi Burning</i>),
there’s a huge gulf between the accuracy of the image and the honest emotions
they portray -- this is why he’s best at the loud pomp of rock and roll in
such work as <i>The Commitments</i> and <i>Pink Floyd: The Wal</i> (although the
subtleties of <i>Evita </i>completely eluded him). Technically accomplished yet
somehow unaffecting, <i>Angela’s Ashes</i> is, at the end, an emotional
conundrum. The DVD edition includes commentary from both McCourt and Parker, as
well as interviews with cast and crew and the film itself in both widescreen and
full-frame formats.

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As empty and wrong-headed as Hollywood gets,
Leonardo DiCaprio’s much-ballyhooed follow-up to <i>Titanic</i> (not counting
his frighteningly authentic turn in Woody Allen’s <i>Celebrity</i>,) is a
misfire from beginning to end. He plays a strident, selfish American out for
kicks in Southeast Asia who discovers a deceptively sinister paradise in the
form of a remote island populated by like-minded dropouts under the mysterious
control of the great Tilda Swinton, whose mastery of her craft -- see <i>The War
Zone</i>, below -- is completely wasted (their love scene together is a
profoundly twisted moment in the annals of contemporary movies). Nothing about
the film rings true for a moment, from DiCaprio’s faux hip petulance to the
wildly improbable plot. The only saving grace, as is usual in a film directed by
Danny Boyle (<i>Trainspotting</i>), is the music, highlighted by an early
sequence on the beach cut to Sugar Ray’s respectful cover of the lovely Brian
Eno/John Cale composition "Spinning Away." Which is exactly what this movie
seems to have done. The DVD includes a commentary track from Boyle, deleted
scenes and an alternate ending, a storyboard gallery, TV spots and the All
Saints' <i>Pure Shores</i> music video.<o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Denzel Washington's performance as Ruben
&quot;Hurricane&quot; Carter, a professional boxer who was wrongfully accused of
murder and imprisoned, holds one's attention throughout this otherwise square,
sometimes poorly-made film which condenses real-life incidents, and skips over
others. The work of several law firms, for instance, who donated considerable
time to helping Carter is reduced to the sole efforts of three Canadian social
workers (who are, fortunately, portrayed by a trio of fine actors: John Hannah,
Deborah Unger, and Liev Schreiber), and the film never reveals what motives the
police detective (Dan Hedaya) who railroaded Carter into jail had (or even if
there were some unknowable motives behind his actions). There are some fine
scenes depicting Carter's growing relationship with a young boy (Vicellous Reon
Shannon) who is inspired by Carter's published memoirs, but they are shuttled
into the background during the last portion of the film, which shifts from being
a wronged-man scenario into a story about racism, an indictment of the prison
system, and finally into a courtroom drama and mystery. (Rod Steiger, who
appeared in director Norman Jewison's earlier film, <i>In the Heat of the Night</i>,
appears as a judge during the courtroom sequences). But Washington's
exceptionally well-conceived portrayal of Carter holds things together-- not an
inconsiderable achievement-- and the film may cause people to seek out Carter's
book &quot;The Sixteenth Round&quot; and Sam Chaiton and Terry Smith's account
of Carter's case, &quot;Lazarus and the Hurricane&quot;. The DVD edition
includes an audio commentary from Jewison, deleted scenes, production notes and
a "location spotlight."<o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A two-part TV. film adaptation of the Gospels,
written in contemporary vernacular, and with Jeremy Sisto, smiling goofily and
shambling amiably, in the title role. Much of the teachings have been cut back
or dropped to make room for scenes of political intrigue, backroom plotting, and
even blood-and-gore, as if the filmmakers were afraid that people would grow
restless and start flipping channels if there was too much talking. Joseph and
Mary are played by German actor Armin Muller-Stahl and the British Jacqueline
Bisset-- which raises questions of credibility about how they could have raised
a son with a decidedly SoCal accent-- while Gary Oldman shamefully swans his way
through the role of Pontius Pilate. But the height of lunacy is reserved for the
scenes where Jeroen Krabbe appears, in a late-twentieth century suit, as the
Tempter, who, with a wave of his hand, swamps the screen with boffo visual
effects, or transports himself and Jesus to a modern-day battlefield under fire.
&quot;A world war! What a concept!&quot; Krabbe cries. Abandon all hope ye who

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like the American high school kids who in
future generations will look to Oliver Stone’s <i>JFK</i> for facts about the
Kennedy assassination, this incarnation of Jane Austen’s <i>Mansfield Park</i>
offers the writer’s sense and sensibilities filtered through a distinct
creative/feminist agenda -- that of Canadian adaptor and director Patricia
Rozema. Thus, this Fanny Price is less glum and more pro-active than Austen’s
(and in fact resembles the writer’s own apparent temperament, culled from her
writings and journals), even finding herself the object of overt affections from
both sexes. The cumulative effect is oddly disjointed, neither an accurate
visualization of the book nor a contemporary spin on the issues it raises.
Still, Frances O’Connor brings a beguiling earthiness to Fanny, matched by the
sexual craftiness of Embeth Davidtz and Alessandro Nivola as the scheming
Crawfords, Mary and Henry. Only poor Jonny Lee Miller, saddled with the most
conflicted character, lacks the requisite punch as Edmund Bertram (although
playwright-turned-actor Harold Pinter makes the most of the severely compromised
Bertram patriarch). Coincidentally, a DVD edition of the 1986 BBC production<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>of <i>Northanger Abbey</i> (currently being remade with Rachel Leigh Cook
in the lead) was released June 27. The Mansfield Park DVD features unspecified
audio commentary and an equally mysterious "making of" component.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Roman Polanski's film of Arturo Perez-Reverte's
excellent novel, <i>The Club Dumas</i>, with Johnny Depp as a rare book hunter
who is engaged to authenticate a volume that may possibly hold supernatural
powers, turns out to be one of the director's more minor works. Polanski really
seems to be simply marking-time with this picture: the protagonist's love for
swashbuckling adventure stories (and how they start to blur in with his
real-life experiences) which enlivened the novel has been removed, and what's
left is nothing more than routine spookery, something that any director can make
off-the-cuff. (And Polanski knows his way around the territory, having already
made <i>Repulsion</i>, <i>Rosemary's Baby</i>, and the underrated <i>The Tenant</i>.)
Johnny Depp's performance is fine, as is Barbara Jefford, as the proprietor of a
library on demonology who comes off with all the charm and poise of an
upper-class socialite, while Emmanuelle Seigner, when she isn't whipping her
blonde hair around while casting sly glances and throwing herself in and out of
cars, shows that she can throw a kickboxing movement with the best of them. The
DVD edition features a commentary track from Polanski, production info and a "making of"
featurette, as well as the film in both widescreen and
full-frame versions.<o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A good try: an attempt to do a literary
adaptation that is serious-minded without being solemn, yet also doesn't look
like it's merely bouncing about in period settings for the fun of it. Ralph
Fiennes plays the early 19th century Russian aristocrat of Alexander Pushkin's
verse novel, a roué who indulges himself until he meets a young girl, Tatyana,
whom he first spurns but then finds that he has genuinely fallen in love with
her. As Tatyana, Liv Tyler looks beautiful but simply isn't entirely up to the
task of the role as an actress, but Fiennes' performance (which initially seemed
too poised and remote) is ultimately affecting in its portrayal of a man of
manners who suddenly finds himself stung by the force of true feeling. Martha
Fiennes, Ralph's sister, directed the film; novelist D.M. Thomas translated the
letters exchanged by Onegin and Tatyana from Pushkin's original Russian text.

expressive animation, its dark but beautiful design, the songs by Alan Menken
and Stephen Schwartz -- are probably better appreciated now than when the film
first came out in 1995, with an overwhelming tidal wave of promotional tie-ins.
Pocahontas (voiced by Irene Bedard, sung by the Broadway musical actress Judy
Kuhn), while loving and respecting her father, tribal chief Powhota (voiced/sung
by Russell Means), meets and falls for New World newcomer John Smith
(voiced/sung by Mel Gibson). He proves to be receptive to her ideas about
respecting Nature, learning from other cultures, and honoring one's ancestors,
as opposed to the grasping and avaricious Capt. Ratcliff (voiced/sung by David
Ogden Stiers), who, convinced there's gold to be had out there, tells his men
that &quot;with all that's in ya,/Boys, dig up Virginia!&quot; The central
romance is not unlike those in &quot;The Little Mermaid&quot; and &quot;Beauty
and the Beast&quot;, and the animal sidekicks-- a hummingbird named Flit and a
raccoon named Miko-- almost succeed in worming their way into your heart. Kuhn's
rendition of <i>Colors of the Wind</i> -- even after one had heard it, in all
sundry and various forms, all over the place in 1995 -- is undeniably ravishing.
Billy Connolly and Christian Bale also provide voices for some of the supporting
characters. The only Disney Studios animated feature to be directed (so far) by
Mike Gabriel and Eric Goldberg. The DVD version of the film features a couple of
music videos (<i>Colors of the Wind</i> and <i>If I Never Knew You</i>),
interactive components and the requisite theatrical trailers. &nbsp;<o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the end far better than the third chapter of
this emblematic teen horror franchise has any right to be, <i>Scream 3 </i>(the
target audience has no time or tolerance for Roman numerals) manages to, uh,
flesh out the characters without stretching credulity. Putting the
overly-complicated but shrewdly funny plot aside for a moment (the faithful know
it, while newcomers are advised to see the films sequentially), the film’s
makers have themselves become critic-proof by deriding the movie’s very
existence up front. Yet for all the meddling that apparently went on behind the
scenes, director Wes Craven has pulled everything together and made a movie that
succeeds both as mindless entertainment and a sly meditation on personal growth,
remorse and facing up to individual and group demons. By the end, <i>Scream 3</i>
has proven itself a surprisingly fun conclusion to a unique cycle of horror
films that were products of their decade. The DVD edition includes an alternate
ending with commentary from Craven, outtakes from all three films and Creed’s <i>What
If</i> music video. The trilogy is due as a box set September 26.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">By their very nature, movies are products of
their times: what captures the public’s imagination today could be video store
fodder tomorrow. In this way, old movies are endlessly fascinating windows on
their day, giving modern audiences clues to trends in fashion, morals, rhythm
and storytelling that help to decipher eras gone by. Thus is the case with Roger
Vadim’s 1956 debut sensation <i>…and God created woman</i>, the film that,
as much as many of its celebrated brethren of the about-to-be-launched French
New Wave, bridges the gap between the more conservative post-war Gallic cinema
and the young and sexy thinking that would soon overtake the industry.
Twenty-one when the film was made and Vadim’s lover since the age of fifteen,
Brigitte Bardot (by then Mrs. Vadim) stars as Juliet, the resident free spirit
of St. Tropez (that "Pagan Paradise," according to the amusingly dubbed
trailer included in the package) who spends her time balancing the various
overtures of smooth millionaire Carradine (Curt Jurgens), caddish Antoine
(Christian Marquand) and Antoine’s naïve younger brother Michel (a very young
Jean-Louis Trintignant). The transfer offered by the Criterion Collection is
flawless, restoring a pungency and luster to the Eastmancolor CinemaScope
picture that probably wasn’t there to begin with (prior to his death earlier
this year, Vadim, who consulted on the restoration, pronounced it the best
version since the theatrical print). And once again, Criterion is to be
applauded for their stylish and eye-catching packaging, bridging as it does the
gap between 1950s chic and current product aesthetics in such a way that
newcomers to the Bardot phenomenon will come for the flesh ("her ass is a
song," someone says) and stay for the history. Be sure and watch the brief
restoration demonstration on the disc, which vividly illustrates the minute yet
cumulatively daunting task faced by the restoration team in restoring this
pivotal French film to its former glory.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Before he made a name for himself directing
westerns under the first name "Budd," Oscar Boetticher made this nicely smug
little film noir about a private investigator (Richard Carlson, later the
non-scaly star of <i>The Creature From the Black Lagoon</i>) who checks himself
into the shady La Siesta Sanitarium in search of a corrupt judge hiding from the
law. Once there his cover is blown and it’s up to the femme fatale who sent
him there (Lucille Bremer) and a punch-drunk inmate (Tor Johnson, who later
achieved immortality via <i>Plan 9 From Outer Space</i>) to save his bacon.
Presaging Sam Fuller’s <i>Shock Corridor</i>, the film often plays mental
illness for laughs but gets genuinely creepy when the doctors conspire to make
the shamus a permanent resident. Snappy dialogue, the requisite black and white
chiaroscuro (in a fine Kino Video transfer) and the pleasant sixty-two-minute
running time make <i>Behind Locked Doors</i> a valuable addition to anyone’s
noir library.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">"Act a little more," John Waters tells one
of his brave ensemble during priceless behind-the-scenes footage from the making
of the underground classic <i>Pink Flamingos</i>, and the line could serve as a
motto for the career of this influential Baltimore-based American independent
icon. Waters defines the kind of resolutely regional, cheerfully bizarre
filmmaking that everyone likes to think is the hallmark of the now dangerously
stagnant Amerindie movement (the director had a cameo in Woody Allen’s recent <i>Sweet
and Lowdown</i> and had a new picture, <i>Cecil B. Demented</i>, in Cannes).
With reminiscences from dozens of friends and colleagues, including Steve
Buscemi, Mike and George Kuchar, former Maryland censor Mary Avara (yes,
Virginia, until not so awfully long ago Maryland had a film censor), Jim
Jarmusch and, of course, Waters’ parents, this meticulously researched film
from another Baltimorean, Steve Yeager, offers a thorough and fascinating look
behind the scenes of what Village Voice critic J. Hoberman called "probably
the most important underground movie made after [Andy Warhol’s] <i>Chelsea
Girls</i>, one of the first real midnight cult films."</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The great filmmakers are consistently
fascinating, even in their less-than-great work. Such is the case with
Michelangelo Antonioni’s <i>Identification of a Woman</i>, which was dismissed
by high-profile critics of the day and thus never properly distributed in the
United States. Egotistical film director Niccolo (Tomas Milian) is bogged down
in a new project, unable to find the right woman for his new film about an ideal
woman ("I’m looking for a face," he says, seemingly helpless to describe
it further). As he moves back and forth from Mavi (Daniela Silverio) to Ida
(Christine Boisson), the answer becomes no less clear and he ultimately abandons
the project in favor of a science fiction story. Made when the director was
seventy, the film neatly sums up many of the major themes in his work (which
includes the trilogy <i>L’avventura</i>, <i>La notte</i> and <i>L’eclisse</i>),
including thematic obsessions and technical innovation. Unfortunately, Facets
Video’s edition of the film is full-frame (only the credit sequences are
letterboxed), and the transfer is not as pristine as one would wish for a
filmmaker of Antonioni’s importance. Still, they’ve done a valuable service
in making this title available for inquiring cineastes, as time and fashion have
been good to this inscrutable yet involving drama.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Although a troubled production from start to
finish, Steven Spielberg’s first big special effects success, seen today,
betrays little of the problems with weather, a malfunctioning mechanical shark
nicknamed Bruce, and insufficient coverage that threatened to sink the movie
during principal production (the movie’s quiet hero has always been editor
Verna Fields, who, according to legend, took Spielberg’s mounds of mismatched
footage and made a movie from it. Seen today, in a crisp and sonically complex
new transfer replete with some seventy-five minutes of outtakes, flubs and
supplementary material, <i>Jaws</i> is a lean, mischievous boys’ adventure
that smells of sweat and aftershave, with only flashes of the childlike wonder
and sentimentality that would leaven almost every subsequent film the director
would make. While Robert Shaw’s scene-stealing Quint still reverts to
irrationality a little to abruptly, Richard Dreyfuss’ impeccable comic timing
with much of the expository material about the viciousness of sharks and Roy
Scheider’s oddly touching mixture of eagerness and stoicism in the face of his
fear of water remain appealing. Not incidentally, the wild success of the movie
minted the now-routing summer blockbuster beauty-pageant approach to movie
releasing.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A major revelation for film noir fans. After
returning from a stint in the Special Services Film Unit of the United States
Army during World War II (where he worked with Frank Capra on the "Why We
Fight" series), Kiev-born U.S. citizen Anatole Litvak directed <i>The Long
Night</i>, a remake of Marcel Carne’s 1939 drama <i>Le Jour se lève</i> (<i>Daybreak</i>)
with Henry Fonda as chainsmoking factory worker Joe Adams (Jean Gabin starred in
the original) in a steel town "somewhere near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border"
and Vincent Price as the oily traveling magician who steals his girl (Barbara
Bel Geddes) and suffers his wrath (Ann Dvorak has a nice turn as a "bar
girl" -- read hooker -- with a heart of gold). Holed up in his boarding house
after shooting Price, Fonda remembers the path that led to his undoing as the
cops prepare to force him to surrender. <i>The Long Night</i> is presented as
part of Kino Video’s fourth edition of Noir: The Dark Side of Hollywood (see
also <i>Behind Locked Doors</i>, above, and <i>Strange Impersonation</i>,
below), and the reissue is especially ironic in light of the fact that when <i>The
Long Night</i> first opened, RKO Pictures attempted to buy and destroy all
copies of <i>Daybreak</i>, an effort they were fortunately dissuaded from
pursuing. In fact, the DVD edition of <i>The Long Night</i> features scenes from
Carne’s earlier film as well as an essay on Eugene Lourie’s remarkable
production design. Kino’s packaging bills the film as "a rediscovered
American classic," and they’re right: reminiscent of the great Robert
Mitchum film, <i>Out of the Past</i> (made the same year), <i>The Long Night </i>is
an instant keeper.&nbsp;<o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Controversial winner of the grand prize <i>Palme
d’Or</i> at the 1999 Cannes festival after a closing day screening that had
critics split down the middle, <i>Rosetta</i> is a monumental achievement in
contemporary neo-realism, a ringing damnation of the Belgian social services
system and a tour-de-force showcase for newcomer Emilie Dequenne as the title
character, a young woman so determined to be a worthy contributor to society
through sheer force of will that she sabotages as many jobs as she lands (in
another controversial move, the Cannes jury awarded Dequenne the Best Actress
prize -- in tandem with another non-professional, Severine Caneele from <i>Humanity</i>).
<i>Rosetta</i> also fits snugly alongside the first feature from brothers Luc
and Jean-Pierre Dardenne, <i>La Promesse</i>, which also tackled the thorny
issues of social services in its story of a young boy who slowly discovers his
father is cruelly exploiting foreign workers. With its hand-held camera,
complete lack of music and deliberate, fatalistic pace, Rosetta isn’t for all
tastes by any means. But as an astonishing example of what a true filmmaking
collaboration can be, it is an unparalleled achievement, at once brutally
heartbreaking and giddily inspirational. At press time <i>Rosetta</i> was
available exclusively in a cassette edition priced to rent (at $55,
significantly below most such titles), with no DVD plans yet announced.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This extraordinary simultaneous release from
Kino Video pairs German director Fritz Lang’s third film with his last (in
separate purchases). In the digitally mastered adventure classic <i>The Spiders</i>,
a secret society led by a mysterious femme fatale embarks on a rousing and
visually imaginative journey to discover a lost Incan city of gold. Long thought
lost, the film resurfaced in 1978 and here features an original organ score by
Gaylord Carter. Also long unavailable in its original version, Lang’s last
film, <i>The 1000 Eyes of Dr. Mabuse</i>, reveals itself to be a nifty,
letterboxed black and white Cold War thriller starring a pre-Goldfinger Gert
Frobe as a police inspector trying to get to the bottom of a journalist’s
murder. The criminal mastermind behind the mayhem is, of course, the same Dr.
Mabuse that Lang dreamed up many years before in a sporadic series of films that
straddled the silent and early sound years, here spiffed up to include
references to terrorism and atomic weaponry. Although fascinating today, by most
accounts the director had little enthusiasm for the project; subsequently,
Lang’s only film work was an appearance in Jean-Luc Godard’s 1963
moviemaking drama <i>Contempt</i> (<i>Le Mépris</i>). His 1959 film <i>The
Indian Tomb</i> is also on the July release schedule (see below).&nbsp;<o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Talking on The Onion website recently about the
recent re-release of <i>Blood Simple</i>, filmmaker Ethan Coen defined film noir
as "plain, mean, ordinary people doing mean things to each other," a
sentiment he might have felt had he screened the latest genre releases from Kino
Video (see <i>The Long Night</i> and <i>Behind Locked Doors</i>, above), which
include the obscure but decidedly un-ordinary noir <i>Strange Impersonation</i>
(1946). Directed by Anthony Mann (born Emil Anton Bundmann), who went on to
genre fame as the director of such important 1950s westerns as <i>Winchester
’73</i> (1950), <i>Bend of the River</i> (1952) and 1953’s <i>The Naked Spur</i>
(all of which starred James Stewart), <i>Strange Impersonation</i> stars Brenda
Marshall as a determined scientist who shifts her energies from research to
revenge when her work is sabotaged by a jealous colleague (Hillary Brooke). At
sixty-eight minutes more of a programmer than a fully realized feature, the
bizarre twists of the plot (plastic surgery, rampant melodrama) and Mann’s
formative but still identifiable emotional intensity make <i>Strange
Impersonation</i> a prime candidate for rediscovered cult status.</o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The directorial debut of actor Tim Roth (<i>Reservoir
Dogs</i>, <i>Rob Roy</i>), <i>The War Zone</i> is an extraordinary film, both
delicate and brutal, about the multi-layered power struggle among the four
members of a seemingly happy family uprooted from London to the windswept Devon
coast. Along with their children Tom (newcomer Freddie Cunliffe), Jessie (Lara
Belmont) and new baby Alice, Dad (Ray Winstone) and Mum (Tilda Swinton) have
relocated and depend on each other for support until they can meet new friends.
Slowly, Tom begins to suspect a horrible secret being shared by Dad and Jessie,
the confirmation of which will lead to a life-changing confrontation. Based on a
1989 novel by screenwriter Alexander Stuart, the film benefits greatly from
Roth’s restrained yet unblinking direction (he’s cited both Alan Clarke and
Tarkovsky as influences). New Yorker’s letterboxed transfer is superb,
preserving Seamus McGarvey’s rawboned yet crystalline photography -- an
integral element of the film’s mood, and impact. Moviegoers affected by this
challenging work are referred to actor Gary Oldman’s directorial debut <i>Nil
By Mouth</i> (also starring the great Winstone) and Andrew Birkin’s similarly
themed <i>The Cement Garden</i>, also in release this month. Harrowing,
unforgettable stuff.</font></p>
