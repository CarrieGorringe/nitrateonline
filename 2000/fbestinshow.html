Well the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">(National) Lampoon</i> was my
first real gig in 1970, way prior to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Spinal
Tap</i>. I did radio shows and helped to create <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Lemmings</i>,
somewhat of a departure in the world of comedy. I think everything came out of
the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Lampoon</i> experience. I’ve been
working with Michael McKean since 1967. In our family tree of comedy, which has
a lot of overlaps and connections, Michael then went to work with Harry Shearer
while I got together with Rob Reiner. We all rejoined and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Spinal Tap</i> was formed, which, contrary to some people’s
understanding, did not start out as a short film. The original <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Spinal
Tap</i> was actually a scene on a a 1978 tv show called <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
TV Show</i>, that Rob Reiner, Harry Shearer, me, Billy Crystal, and Martin Mull
wrote. It was a special for ABC, with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tap</i>’s
first appearance mimicking the popular show <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
Midnight Special</i>. Loudon Wainwright was the keyboard player and Russ Kunkel
was the drummer. He didn’t spontaneously combust at that time (for those of
you familiar with the band’s tragic history), although he later appear in the
film as Stumpy, one of the guys who did. We went to Marble Arch Productions (Sir
Lew Grade), who offered x-amount of money to write this film. We of course knew
we’d never write the film because it was going to be completely improvised.
Instead we actually started shooting <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Spinal
Tap</i> with the development money that he gave us, ending up with a 20-minute
film. After he saw our footage, he showed us the door. (&quot;Please get out of
my office.&quot;) We then took this film around town and got pretty much the
same answer. They didn’t know what the hell it was. They didn’t know what a
documentary was. The next step was Norman Lear at Embassy Pictures, who took a
chance. Albeit a low budget movie, there was no script. And we shot it.<o:p>

Well that’s very nice. At the same token, it’s really fun to go back and
play. Because we have this added dimension of playing music. Other movies may be
like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Spinal Tap</i>, but you don’t have
the actors doing the actual music. There was a very strange episode that
happened on our last tour when we played the Royal Albert Hall, a dream we all
had. I came off stage after the first night and there was a little boy who asked
for my autographed. As I was signing, I looked up and saw his dad. George
Harrison. It was one of those quintessential moments. I got the chills. This was
so eerie because The Beatles had played the Royal Albert, we did this movie
about this fictitious group which is now a real group playing the same hall, and
now one of The Beatles’ sons is going to see the real fictitious group
influenced by The Beatles. It’s way chicken and egg.<o:p>

No. Not at all. Actually before we even did the movie, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">SNL</i>
producer Bob Tischler, a friend of mine from the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Lampoon</i> days, when he produced and edited our records, asked me to
join the cast. I rejected them initially. While we were shooting <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Spinal
Tap</i>, he and (executive producer Dick) Ebersol then asked me to do just the
Weekend News Update. &quot;But I’m making a movie!&quot; I told them. They
wanted me to fly in from Los Angeles, where we were shooting. Finally, when the
filming was done, they asked me, Michael (McKean), Harry (Shearer), Billy
Crystal, and Marty Short to be on the show. Michael, because of his family,
opted out, but became a regular ten years later. The rest of us signed one year
contracts. We got to do a lot of interesting stuff. Most people (on <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">SNL</i>)
don’t have the luxury (of setting contract terms), but because we were
somewhat established, we set our own deal.<o:p>

Sir Denis Eaton-Hogg, the fictitious owner of Polymer Records in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">This

seems to be your credo in your films. You’ve taken these really quirky, often

Well I would say that from the time I was a child I would watch people. Their
behavior. Their voices. The way they walk. I didn’t know what this was at the
time -- I just enjoyed it. As a child I would look out the window and make up
voices for the people as they walked by. My mother would ask what I was doing,
and I said &quot;nothing.&quot; I think my family thought I was funny. I have a
four-and-a-half year old son and he’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">really</i>
funny. He makes me laugh more than anyone. There is something going on in his
eyes, something mischievous. Part of that is external forces and some of it
you’re born with. Anyway, that’s what I remember when I was growing up, and
I still do it. I see people and something about them gets lodged in my brain.
There was a character I created on <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Saturday
Night Live</i> that originated 15 years earlier at a New York City hotel. I was
checking in and there was a completely bizarre guy behind the desk. While I
don’t consciously have a library of memories, they are triggered when someone,
somehow, makes me remember. While I can’t remember exactly where Harlan Pepper
comes from, I’ve heard that voice, I’ve been in the South, and I was
intrigued by the musicality of that accent. (At which point he riffs into that
nearly indecipherable drawl before returning to normal.) I have to feel
comfortable that I can sustain that through the film.<o:p>

When you prep a film, how much load do you place on the actors? Obviously
there’s a lot of improv here.<o:p>

It’s ALL improv. 100 percent. Which is hard for people to understand.
(Co-writer) Eugene Levy and I have a story (his latest was originally called <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Dog Show</i>) with a first, second, and third act. There’s a linear
flow through the movie. The characters all delineate. We know their histories,
their names, their relationships to the friends and family. I give the actors
the ability to expand even on that. But there is no dialogue written down
whatsoever. The exceptions are, for instance, the scene with Rob Reiner in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Spinal
Tap</i>, where I point to the number 11 on the sound amplifier and we had to
construct that joke in order to have the prop. With that exception, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Spinal
Tap</i> is completely improvised. In <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Best
in Show</i>, as with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Waiting for Guffman</i>,
there is no rehearsal. You can’t, because you might blow the whole deal.<o:p>

Fifty percent is second take. 25 percent is first take. Generally we never went
beyond that. At the most we had some third takes, because you start to lose the
spontaneity. What makes this film special is that the audience is hearing
something spoken for the first time. It may be a subliminal reaction, but
somehow they know this is something different. That this is the way people
really talk and react in real time. In any other reel film you have a master
shot, then an hour breakdown before a two-shot, followed in another hour by a
close-up. At the end of the day, you’d have 20 seconds of dialogue recorded
and maybe two-and-a-half minutes of footage. In a given day on <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Best
in Show</i> we’d have an hour-and-a half of dailies. Ultimately I had 60 hours
of material. We shot it on Super16mm and our budget was around $7 million. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Guffman</i>
came in at $4 million. The increase was partly a function of quite a bit bigger
cast. These actors are the best at this type of work. Everyone gets scale.<o:p>

(an emphatic) No! Simply because Chris Farley died right after we made the
movie. I’m now in a position of doing a press junket about a guy who died. I
think his performance is incredible in that movie. Truthfully, I think it’s
the best thing he ever did. He had huge potential above the dopey movies he did.
He had some profound talent that people never had a chance to see. We had a
glimmer of that in this film. I liked the script. The movie just didn’t work.

look for acting work. I don’t think there are any characters I’d like to
play (as he scrunches his face in thought). I don’t even think of it. If
someone comes along and offers me something I find interesting, I’ll do it. I
like doing any acting, but that’s a secondary consideration at this point. I
said several years ago I wouldn’t even mind being on a tv show. Not as the
main lead, but as the guy who comes in from next door every once in a while,

Regarding some of your more obscure television work is the short-lived series <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Morton
&amp; Hayes</i> (Guest offers up an affectionate laugh). Was that more than just
a summer replacement? [Telecast in 1991, this series within a series showcased
the fictitious and too-often forgotten comedy team of Chick Morton (Kevin Pollak)
and Eddie Hayes (Bob Amaral). Each week, Rob Reiner introduced some of their
forgotten Max King-produced 2-reelers to the adoring fans at home.]<o:p>

That was one of those shows where if people catch on to the idea, then you do
more. It was a very bold idea, first of all because it was in black-and-white.
It was incredible fun to do. It was also very difficult. I directed five of the
six episodes. I was in probably five of the six. I think I wrote four of the
six. And I was producing the show. Which was insane. To be totally honest, if
CBS has picked this up, I don’t know what I would have done. Kevin and Bob
were terrific. The atmosphere was completely insane. People wrote in and asked
&quot;Why is Rob Reiner pretending to be Max King III?&quot; So you know
you’re in trouble.<o:p>

Exactly. When we previewed that, the audience was wondering why we made a movie
about stupid people. So you’re dead. Obviously <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Morton
&amp; Hayes</i> was before it’s time or after it’s time. It just wasn’t
it’s time. People couldn’t comprehend this subtle comic premise.<o:p>

I found reference to a 1981 pilot called <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Likely
Stories</i> that you directed and co-produced with David Jablin? What was that?
Did it air?<o:p>

Oh yes. This was when cable was really cable (and before all the award-winning
originally programming of today). This was not HBO, but something like oak
cable, and something genuinely bizarre. I was approached by David, who wanted to
get all our friend to contribute to the show. Rob Reiner directed his first
short, called <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Tommy Rispoli Story</i>
that featured the limo-driving chauffeur later embodied by Bruno Kirby as Tommy
Pischedda in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Spinal Tap</i>. Billy Crystal
and I did a short called <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Prizefighter</i>.
I did some animation for the program. My first thing I ever directed is there,
in which I play all the parts. I did it in a film noir style, a ‘40s detective
story in which I’m the private eye, the woman who hires him, the murdered
husband, the Indian guy with a turban who hits the detective over the head, and
so on. No one had told me you shouldn’t play all the parts. Richard Belzer,
Stephen Collins, and other friends were on the show. Harry Shearer and Michael
McKean did a bit.<o:p>

No, we’ve made a decision not to do that. We wanted to keep our careers
separate. Her part on the show was just a short bit in which she is interviewed
about how much Spinal Tap has meant to her.</span></font></p>
