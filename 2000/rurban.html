            group of college students is on their way home from their Hawaiian
            vacation. An ominous storm hammers their 747, as the camera takes
            you inside, where pretty couples wearing leis are dancing in the
            aisle, drinking, and putting their tongues down each other's
            throats. One smart-ass brings up the aged specter of the gremlin in
            the <i>Twilight Zone</i> episode. Suddenly, disaster strikes: a
            knife-wielding stalker is loose among them, discovered by Beautiful
            Blond and her Ken Doll Boyfriend when they emerge from the bathroom,
            where they've been joining the Mile High Club. Suitably horrified,
            the couple runs and stumbles up the aisle, past strewn stewardess
            bodies, to the cockpit, where they learn that the pilots are also
            dead. Beautiful Blond screams. While Boyfriend bars the cockpit
            door, she proceeds to the instrument panel, where she struggles
            mightily, her eyes wide like a baby Julie Haggerty, to come to terms
            with the murderous asshole coming up behind her and the dials and
            buttons laid out in front of her. And then, she begins to <i>fly the
            plane</i>. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yes,
            it's retarded. But it might be that <i>Urban Legends: Final Cut</i>,
            the Sequel With No Reason For Being, knows that it's retarded. For
            at this moment, the film does cut, or rather, a young male director
            yells &quot;Cut,&quot; and the camera pulls out to reveal another
            camera, lights, and a stage set, and some guy sitting on a board
            that he's pumping up and down to resemble the kind of rocking a
            plane would get in a storm. The young male director even makes a
            crack about Beautiful Blond's terrible performance. Ha Ha. The trick
            is hardly new. Too many slasher films begin with a dreadful murder
            scene that turns out to be a nightmare, from which a pretty girl
            wakes in a panic, sweaty and trembling. She calms down, the audience
            breathes easy, and whomp, the killer is upon her, knives or hooks or
            machetes flailing. It's a road-tested formula, proven over the years
            to get a rise from viewers. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Except
            that increasingly, viewers are way cooler than those filmmakers who
            resort to such worn-out business. These viewers have seen
            everything, they know exactly what's going on and when, and you're
            not going to get any one of them to jump -- or even gasp -- by
            sending a kitty cat out of the closet instead of Michael Meyers. In
            part, this jadedness is a function of generation: you can see every
            damned horror or slasher movie that's ever been made on video or
            sometimes on cable. They're at least as hip as the Jamie Kennedy
            video-store-geek character in <i>Scream</i>: they know all the
            tricks and the rules and, moreover, they know they're retarded. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            this jadedness is also, more recently, and perhaps more
            significantly, a function of Scream, or more precisely, the
            phenomenon of self-conscious slasher flicks that make lots of money.
            Almost <b><i>any</i></b> slasher flick is self-conscious: Tobe
            Hooper's <i>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i> and Wes Craven's <i>Last
            House on the Left</i> -- both eminently crude and effective films --
            are also intelligent and insightful critiques of horror movies,
            family dysfunction, and (my favorite) consumer capitalism. And you
            can make cases for the social and political arguments lying just
            below the bad, bloody surfaces of movies not made by acknowledged
            masters of the genre, say, <i>My Bloody Valentine</i>, <i>Motel Hell</i>,
            <i>Return to Horror High</i>, and of course, the <i>Chucky</i> and <i>Slumber
            Party Massacre</i> series. Still, being self-conscious is not enough
            if a film is to run for more than a week or two in theaters, or even
            open in theaters, rather than going straight-to-video. A slasher
            flick must also make money, which, frankly, is not very hard to do,
            considering that the talent (teens in underwear) and effects (Karo
            syrup) can be had for peanuts, in Hollywood terms. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">All
            of which brings me back to Urban Legends, after a fashion. As the
            second installment in what might become a series (and you can never
            tell what <b><i>will</i></b> become a series; just ask the Wayans
            brothers, who vowed never to make a sequel to <i>Scary Movie</i>), <i>UL2</i>
            carries a certain burden of... let's call it representation. Mostly,
            this means it must improve on its lackluster predecessor, which made
            enough money to warrant a follow-up (as long as it's made cheaply,
            and so, investments are easily recoup-able on video), but did not
            set the slasher world on fire. At the same time, <i>Urban Legend</i>
            (singular) did set up the titular gimmick, which, on paper, is not a
            bad one: college students are killed in manners resembling
            &quot;urban legends,&quot; like a girl being killed during a dorm
            ritual when everyone else is screaming, so no one hears her scream;
            or a dog being microwaved (I have to confess, I had never heard that
            particular legend before <i>UL1</i>, but it definitely made for a
            yucky visual effect). <i>UL2's</i> burden, then, is to come up with
            more legends to represent, or at least stories that are foul enough
            that no one will complain. In other words, if imagination and
            effects and inspiration fail, the film must be clever, at least a
            little bit. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            cleverest thing about <i>UL2</i> is its setting, a film school. This
            allows repeated allusions to previous films: the posters in the
            students' rooms are credited at the end -- <i>Touch of Evil</i>, <i>Rocky
            Horror</i>,and <i>The Brain That Wouldn't Die</i>; the kids are
            competing for The Hitchcock Prize (a stipend and a chance to direct
            something in Hollywood after graduation); someone whistles the <i>Funeral
            March of the Marionettes</i>, like Peter Lorre in <i>M</i>; scenes
            set in a campus tower and an amusement park ride; images referring
            to films by David Cronenberg and Brian DePalma; and a killer in a
            fencing mask (a variation on the more pedestrian hockey mask or
            Leatherface's dramatic human-skin mask). All this reference-spotting
            is good fun and provides a neat frame for the pleasure of watching
            Hart Bochner as the kids' teacher, Dr. Solomon, Bochner being most
            wonderfully remembered for his charismatic turn in Martin Donovan's
            brilliant <i>Apartment Zero</i>, in which he and Colin Firth become
            hopelessly entangled in a series of old movie plots. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Solomon's
            students are headed up by a lantern-jawed golden boy, Travis
            (Matthew Davis), who is apparently the shoo-in winner of the
            Hitchcock Prize (you never see the film, so you'll never know), and
            a tomboyish blond girl Amy (Jennifer Morrison, best known as the
            pasty-faced dead girl in <i>Stir of Echoes</i>). She's just come up
            with her final project concept: a serial killer whose murders are
            based on urban legends. (Um, didn't someone already make this
            movie?) &quot;Will it be horror or suspense?&quot; asks the suddenly
            intrigued and encouraging Dr. Solomon. He's especially impressed
            that the idea raises several &quot;Hitchcock themes,&quot; like
            &quot;paranoia, fear of imprisonment, wrong man accused.&quot; (How
            does he derive these particular themes from the urban legends idea?
            Let's assume he's just especially insightful.) In any event, here
            you have the brilliantly twisted and doubled-up premise of <i>UL2</i>:
            it's a movie within a movie about a movie.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            second cleverest thing about <i>UL2</i> is that it brings back
            Loretta Devine as Reese, the cagey security guard from the first
            film. Here again, Reese is an enthusiastic Pam Grier fan, and she
            judges Amy to be all right, when she can quote from <i>Foxy Brown</i>
            (&quot;That's my sister and she's a whole lotta woman!&quot;).
            Still, Reese notes repeatedly, Amy tends to do the dumb things that
            &quot;skinny-assed white girls&quot; tend to do in slasher movies,
            like walk to the library after hours in the driving snow, sneak into
            the campus tower where a fellow student has been murdered, get
            chased by the killer through editing rooms, basements, and tunnels
            that feature those spinning orange emergency lights. Luckily for
            Amy, Reese tends to show up at exactly the right moment during these
            scenes in order to save her skinny ass. When Amy tells Reese about
            her final project idea, Reese brings a welcome dose of working class
            experience and &quot;reality&quot; (at least as this might be
            imagined in a slasher film set at an imaginary West Coast film
            school, where even the work-study students wear the coolest
            clothing). She raises her eyebrow and sighs: &quot;Mmm-Hmm.&quot;
            And then Reese suggests to Amy that at least one of the urban
            legends she's talking about did take place, and, as a matter of
            fact, it took place at the very college where Reese... <b><i>used to
            work</i></b>!<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Reese
            is a little sensible for the film, which is, like most slasher
            flicks, silly and brutal and full of plot holes (according to
            director-composer-editor John Ottman's very enthusiastic website
            &quot;Diary&quot; [www.johnottman.com/projects/directed/urbanlegend2/],
            he and writers Paul Harris Boardman and Scott Derrickson revised a
            lot). But even if incoherence and ugly violence are par for the
            slasher flick course, <i>UL2</i> offers a few murder-ideas that
            stand out, appropriately ripped off from other films. One, a girl
            wakes up in a bathtub after being slipped a mickey, to find that her
            liver has been removed: as she tries to escape her killer, slipping
            and sliding all over the blood on the bathroom floor, he grabs at
            her, and locks his fingers into her liver-removal-wound: yucky. Two,
            a couple of young effects experts (Anthony Anderson, last seen
            playing one of Jim Carrey's sons in <i>Me, Myself &amp; Irene</i>,
            and Michael Bacall) are murdered while on the job, such that their
            bodies resemble the very effects they've been creating: double
            yucky. And three, another girl is chased down by a killer wielding a
            camera and a mike, in a snuff segment ripped off from Michael
            Powell's classic, <i>Peeping Tom</i>. As her fellow students screen
            the footage, they believe at first that it's something she's done on
            her own, &quot;for her reel.&quot; Their responses are fairly
            standard: &quot;Eww!&quot; &quot;Bitch!&quot; &quot;Get her!&quot;
            And then: &quot;That's not realistic.&quot; Or, &quot;There's not
            enough blood.&quot; And when they do discover the truth, they're
            only briefly chastened. Cut.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
