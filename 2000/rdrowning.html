<h4><b><font size="5">N</font></b><font size="4"><span style="font-weight:normal">ick
Gomez's <i>Drowning Mona</i> is the best TV sit-com I've ever paid seven bucks
to see. If there's ever been a film more deserving of the epitaph &quot;Wait for
video,&quot; I can't think of it. Indeed, the movie feels so much like a
mediocre offering from the Fox network that watching it on the big screen just
seems... well, wrong somehow. All that's missing is the cheesy laugh track. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></h4>
<p><i>Drowning Mona</i> is the latest entry in the saturated &quot;black
comedy&quot; genre, and takes its place alongside such crowd-pleasing chestnuts
as <i>Drop Dead Gorgeous</i> and <i>Throw Mama from the Train</i>, although it
pales in comparison to either one. The story: Chief Rash (Danny De Vito) is a
detective in the sleepy town of Verplanck, NY, investigating the murder of a
much despised townswoman, the ironically-named Mona Dearly (played with
pleasantly malicious gusto by Bette Midler, in a series of flashbacks). The
twist in this rather mundane story is that every single person in Verplanck had
a motive for killing her, and after we see a few flashbacks, we understand why
they might take matters into their own hands: she's a monster.</p>
<p>So what's the problem? Easy: we simply don't care who committed the crime.
It's made so abundantly clear that the town is <i>much</i> better off now that
she's dead that it's hard to be interested in discovering the identity of the
murderer -- unless, of course, we want to send him or her a thank-you card. It's
very difficult to make a convincing mystery/comedy, and <i>Drowning Mona</i>
stumbles by trying to be both a first-rate detective story and a laugh riot.
Unfortunately, by trying to embrace both genres, director Nick Gomez has mired
himself too deeply in convention. Tedious mystery subplots continuously
interrupt the funniest moments, and vice- versa, while actor Danny De Vito is
essentially wasted in a role that requires him to do little more than look grim,
nod, and walk around. How unfortunate to waste De Vito's comedic talents in a
film that could have used them!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">There are some good moments to be found, though: a lot of
the jokes <i>are</i> genuinely funny, and -- apart from De Vito -- the
performances are a lot of fun, even if everyone in the movie is essentially a
caricature of stereotypical small town residents, much like the characters in
the much better <i>Drop Dead Gorgeous</i>. But regrettably, the movie isn't able
to escape its own gravitational pull, and collapses in on itself when trying to
break free from the clichés and stereotypes that comprise it. <i>Drowning Mona</i>
isn't horrible, but it's a lot cheaper to just stay home and watch sit-coms
instead. Less crowded, too.</p>
