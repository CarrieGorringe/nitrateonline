            Delacroix (Damon Wayans) lives in a swank New York City apartment
            where the bedroom &quot;window&quot; is a gigantic clock face: as
            the sun comes up, the space is filled with light and shadows cast by
            the clock's hands and numbers. It's like Samuel Jackson's alarm
            clock in <i>Do The Right Thing</i> has turned enormous and
            inevitable: up your wake, up your <i>wake</i>! No one ever said
            Spike Lee was subtle. And yes, he <i>knows</i> what time it is. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            most everyone knows by now, Lee's new film, <i>Bamboozled</i>, was
            making folks nervous long before its arrival in theaters, when word
            went round that he was tackling racism in television. Coming on the
            heels of the NAACP's threatened boycott of network TV, reports that
            the New Spike Lee Movie featured performers in blackface and white
            gloves sounded almost ominous. Some expected sermonizing, others a
            weak-assed storyline, and still others, imperious finger-pointing at
            an industry that was just beginning to increase &quot;black&quot;
            and &quot;multicultural&quot; programming (on UPN and the WB,
            anyway). That Spike, you know, he's so grumpy and sensitive, always
            picking on popular shows like <i>In Living Color</i> or <i>The PJs</i>.
            That Spike, you know, he just needs to lighten up. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            it turns out, in <i>Bamboozled</i>, Lee does work in some
            sermonizing and the script doesn't quite keep its many complicated
            balls in the air. But the film's extraordinary ambition and
            painfully clear vision more than make up for these snags. Messy,
            outrageous, and mostly brilliant, <i>Bamboozled</i> is bound to make
            trouble. And I can't think of a more important trouble to make. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Shot
            in digital video -- which brings a sense of TV-immediacy -- the plot
            follows a couple of stories, entangled so they become part
            melodrama, part cultural critique, part grand spectacle. At the
            center is Pierre, a writer for a ratings-starved TV station. When
            you meet him, Pierre (whom Wayans plays so broadly that he's less
            funny than disturbing) prepares to face yet another awful day at the
            office, where -- being the only black writer on staff -- he's under
            pressure to come up with a new &quot;black&quot; show. (He's also
            got daddy issues, being perpetually angry at his raucously
            old-school stand up comic father, beautifully underplayed by Paul
            Mooney). The camera circles Pierre as Stevie Wonder sings on the
            soundtrack: &quot;1999, our colors fill the jails / It is through
            the grace of God, that we all were not scarred / From back then
            until now I see, no comedy / We have been a misrepresented
            people.&quot; At this point, the Harvard-degreed Pierre still feels
            he has a chance to represent, not misrepresent, through his work at
            the station, but he's about to come up against seriously ugly
            social, political, and economic forces. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Enter
            the second storyline, through Pierre's smart, high-powered
            assistant, Sloan Hopkins (Jada Pinkett-Smith). She serves as his
            combination conscience-and-goad, but has her own issues. For one
            thing, her brother Julius (Mos Def) has dumped his government name
            for a new one, &quot;Big Black Africa&quot;, and has become involved
            with a hardcore hiphop-activist collective, the Mau Maus (played by
            the slam poet Mums, and hiphop artists Charli Baltimore, MC Serch,
            DJ Scratch, Gano Grills, and Canibus). Sloan is skeptical of her
            brother's underground methods, not to mention his drinking and
            dope-smoking, which the film repeatedly depicts in images -- close,
            smoky, dark, wide-angled -- that suggest it agrees with her
            judgment. But if she resents Big Black's preaching at her, she also
            has questions about her own choices that she can't admit to him. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">These
            come to a head when she hears Pierre's scheme to get back at his
            boss, Dunwitty (Michael Rapaport), a white man who claims license to
            use the &quot;n-word&quot; because he's married to a black woman
            (whom you never see), has two biracial babies, and keeps framed
            photos of black athletes -- Willy Mays, Hank Aaron, Mike Tyson -- on
            his office wall (it's like <i>Do The Right Thing's</i> &quot;Wall of
            Fame&quot; turned back round on itself). When Dunwitty tells Pierre
            to come up with a new &quot;black show&quot; or else, Pierre catches
            a scandalous inspiration. Thinking he'll educate the masses while
            ridiculing Dunwitty, he pitches <i>Mantan: The New Millennium
            Minstrel Show</i>, a variety show featuring local street-performers
            Womack (Tommy Davidson) as Sleep 'n' Eat and his tap-dancing buddy
            Manray (Savion Glover) as Mantan. They black their faces with burned
            cork, run Amos 'n' Andy-style routines, and dance with a back-up
            troupe called the Pickaninnys (whose members include Lil Nigger Jim,
            Aunt Jemima, Sambo, Jungle Bunny, and Rastus), while the Alabama
            Porch Monkeys (the Roots), wear ball-and-chains and provide
            down-home music while literally sitting on a porch right near a
            watermelon patch. Pierre figures he's made such a monstrous show
            that its racism will be obvious even to the most dimwitted viewer or
            network suit. But no. <i>Mantan</i> is a through-the-roof hit. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            not before a major dose of media &quot;controversy&quot; makes it
            visible. And it's in illustrating the show's journey from concept to
            phenomenon that <i>Bamboozled</i> works its most potent, wily magic.
            Pierre and Sloan audition a series of potential players: when the
            Mau Maus perform their terrifically fierce &quot;Black Iz Blak&quot;
            (on the soundtrack CD and rotating as a music video), Pierre recoils
            in horror (&quot;I don't want anything to do with anything 'black'
            for at least a week!&quot;), but when shuck-and-jiving Honeycutt
            (Thomas Jefferson Byrd) speaks his wisdom, &quot;Niggers is a
            beautiful thing,&quot; Pierre is thrilled by its awfulness
            (&quot;'Niggers <i>is</i> a beautiful thing!'&quot; he smiles at
            Sloan. &quot;Write that down!&quot;). But all the while Pierre
            thinks he's putting together a scathing satire, Dunwitty is hiring a
            whiter-than-white staff (the head writer is from Finland) and a
            combo black-culture/spin expert who advises that they publicize that
            they hire a black gaffer and best boy, and publicize that Pierre --
            a black man -- came up with the idea, to answer charges of racism,
            all standard ploys in the business. Pierre sneers and calls her
            &quot;Oh great niggerologist.&quot; The blatantly made point that
            this expert is a Jewish woman has already raised eyebrows, but the
            choice seems of a piece with the rest of Lee's ongoing critique of
            the industry and, even his own past use of stereotypes. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There's
            not really an aspect of media-image-making that doesn't get shafted,
            whether producers or consumers, black or white, young or older
            generations. From Timmi Hillnigger's (played by Danny Hoch) jeans
            and Da Bomb malt liquor to Al Sharpton and Johnnie Cochran (played
            by themselves) leading much-publicized and arguably self-serving
            protests against the show, the film pulls no punches. It even
            targets memorably &quot;poignant&quot; moments: Pierre's own Emmy
            acceptance speech (which looks to be a fantasy, but who can say),
            during which he sucks up to presenter Matthew Modine (he first
            mistakes him for Matt Dillon and then gives him his award, à la
            Ving Rhames giving his Emmy to Jack Lemmon) and dances wildly on
            stage like Cuba Gooding Jr. winning his Oscar. It's hard to resist
            the feeling, as these images are intercut with those from the past
            that <i>everyone </i>agrees are racist -- minstrel dance numbers,
            blackfaced joy-joy moments -- that not much has changed, or at least
            not <i>enough</i>. Quoting liberally from its most obvious
            precursors, <i>A Face in the Crowd</i> and <i>Network</i>, <i>Bamboozled</i>
            sets out to communicate -- in no uncertain terms -- heart-wrenching
            grief and fury at the way &quot;things are.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">By
            the time <i>Mantan</i> has become a blockbuster sensation on the
            scale of <i>Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?</i>, with studio audience
            members coming in blackface and eagerly testifying as to how they're
            all &quot;niggers,&quot; it's clear that the satire -- of the TV
            show and to an extent, the movie -- is out of control. As Pierre
            puts it, he feels like &quot;Dr. Frankenstein,&quot; beset by his
            own creation. At the same time, stars Womack and Manray are having
            their own doubts, the latter's increased by the instruction in the
            history of minstrelsy he's receiving from Sloan. And for her, the
            burden of representation -- in the midst of so much
            misrepresentation and the roiling passions about it -- is heavy
            indeed. While Lee has long been presenting strong women on screen --
            in particular, in <i>Crooklyn</i> (starring Alfre Woodard), <i>Girl
            6</i> (written by Suzette Lori Parks and acted by Theresa Randle),
            and <i>Summer of Sam</i> (Mira Sorvino and Jennifer Esposito) -- he
            also has a well-known early history of thinly-written and -conceived
            female characters. But if Pinkett-Smith's Sloan has the hardest part
            in the film -- which she does, embodying and revealing everyone
            else's anguish and aspiration, dread and desire -- she (character
            and actor) also rises to it with grace and subtlety. This is
            difficult, I think, in a Spike Lee Joint, where the point is never
            understated, where the rage and politics tend to come at you like a
            runaway train. But Pinkett-Smith does make it work. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still,
            what's going on around her is often train-like. That's not
            necessarily a bad thing. Critics are complaining -- again -- about
            Lee's overkill representations and indictments (one has written that
            because &quot;we&quot; all know that minstrel shows are just not
            funny anymore, it's hard to believe <i>Mantan's </i>prodigious
            success: this despite the film's obvious concern over what <i>is</i>
            funny, and to whom). But most all are loving <i>Bamboozled's</i>
            dazzling climactic coda, on a videotape that Sloan prepares to teach
            Pierre about the legacy to which he is contributing, so lethally.
            This tape fills the screen with a series of famously racist
            representations, ranging from Hattie McDaniel and Bill Robinson
            (dancing with Shirley Temple), to <i>Birth of a Nation's</i> Gus and
            any number of big-lipped, oversexed, and slothful cartoon
            characters, to Al Jolson and Judy Garland in blackface, to Jimmie
            Walker and a whole string of characters reciting, &quot;Yassir!&quot;
            or &quot;Yessum!&quot; (many of these historical images and others
            are available in Marlon Riggs' videotapes, <i>Ethnic Notions</i> and
            <i>Color Adjustment</i>, which astutely chronicle the history of
            mediated racism). It's reassuring, of course, to say that
            &quot;we&quot; have moved on from these past manifestations of
            racism, and that &quot;we&quot; should be able to appreciate the
            strides made and the hard work people have put in over the years to
            allow someone like Spike to make the films he makes now. I'm all for
            appreciating the work. But that doesn't mean you have to ignore
            today's realities. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It
            may be that with <i>Bamboozled</i>, he's so dead-on-target that this
            is what's making people uncomfortable. Sure, &quot;things&quot; are
            &quot;improved&quot; since Butterfly McQueen's day. But that doesn't
            dispel the urgent significance of the rallying cry &quot;forty-one
            shots&quot; or the image of that plunger used on Abner Louima, the
            prejudice and ignorance that continue to plague real people in real
            neighborhoods every day. It's not even that there's no place on the
            planet for TV series like <i>The Parkers</i> or movies like <i>The
            Ladies Man</i> (each distressing in its own way). The point is that
            Andre Braugher and Spike Lee and Denzel and Kasi Lemmons get work
            despite the shameful legacy of racism, not because it's over and
            done with. Spike Lee himself has, just this week, signed a one-year
            contract with Studios USA to develop TV shows for the USA Networks,
            with hopes to deliver counter programming to the stereotypical
            images that persist, in different, insidious, and dangerous forms.
            Lee's <i>Bamboozled</i> does not look away. As Prince puts it in his
            song on the film's soundtrack, &quot;Radical Man 2045,&quot;
            &quot;The day you wake up is when you get the real cream.&quot; <o:p>
