screens and over 250 films to choose from, attending this cinematic equivalent
to the New York Marathon is a blur of flashing passes at ushers, negotiating

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Such was the case with
back-to-back screenings of a re-issued <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">Raging Bull</span></i> and the current documentary <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Wadd</span></i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Both of these exceptional character studies carve away at pop-culture
legends and reveal the deeply flawed personas found slithering beneath the
glitz.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Martin Scorsese’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">Raging Bull</span></i>, heralded by many critics as the best American film
of the eighties, tells the unwashed tale of middleweight boxing champion Jake
Lamotta.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, Cass Paley’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Wadd</span></i>
puts porno star John C. Holmes under its microscope and finds an equally epic
story anchored by many of the cornerstones that haunt Scorsese’s tortured
fighter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Raging Bull</span></i> is an
artful masterpiece of precision editing and cinematography, while <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Wadd</span></i><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">
</b>is a rough ‘n tumble collage of smut footage and interviews.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Ultimately, however, both movies arrive at the same conclusion, using
very different but equally effective techniques.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"><a name="RagingBull" target="_top"></a>Raging
Bull</span></i> still projects a go-for-broke attitude, twenty years after its
original release. But in retrospect, the movie’s maverick vibe isn’t
confined to the brutal, disorienting boxing scenes -- undeniably the best fight
footage ever filmed -- that won praise at the time of its release. And it’s
not limited to Robert DeNiro’s brilliant character portrayal, in which the
actor morphs from lean fighting machine to blubbery human walrus in the span of
129 minutes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Scorsese’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">real</i> step off the cliff was his willingness to let scenes linger and
play out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When Lamotta initially
courts wife-to-be Vickie (Cathy Moriarty), he walks her through his shoddy
apartment like a nervous real estate agent courting a homebuyer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"There’s the bird," he comments, before noticing that a certain, er, "stillness" haunts the parakeet cage inhabiting a far corner of the grungy
abode. "Well, it <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">was</i> a bird," he
continues, matter-of-factly. "It’s dead now."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>As Vickie saunters through this interior decorator’s nightmare,
there’s a certain anxiety that reminds us all of those uneasy first dates,
when long pauses in conversation seemed like an eternity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">More uncomfortable yet is the
scene in which Vickie teases Jake with the promise of sexual foreplay before a
big fight: he’s game for a roll in the hay, but reluctant to let such
hanky-panky affect his performance in the ring.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The scene goes on and on, as the boxer negotiates sex and career, and
we’re alarmed at how unusual this type of painfully realistic onscreen
intimacy has become. In the age of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Armageddon</span></i>,
the current erotic standard has Ben Affleck lamely shuffling animal crackers
across Liv Tyler’s torso in what has got to be the most ludicrous love scene <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">ever</i>
filmed.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Meanwhile, a second viewing
of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Raging Bull</span></i> tunes us
into the often-overlooked humor in Paul Schrader’s salty script.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>After losing his first fight in 1941 to Jimmy Reeves, Lamotta takes out
his frustrations on his first wife.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Don’t
overcook it," he demands as his much-abused spouse fries a steak in their
cramped kitchen. "You overcook it, then it defeats its <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">own</i>
purpose."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile, his brother
Joey (played by a never better Joe Pesci) negotiates a meeting between Jake and
the mob.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"If he’s in a good
mood, I’ll talk to him," promises Joey to resident goodfella Salvy (a suave
Scorsese favorite, Frank Vincent), while his brother smashes dishes and turns
over tables upstairs, obviously displeased with his slab of London broil.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"Aw, honey," he offers shallowly to his wife after leveling the
house, "c’mon -- let’s be friends."</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Audiences gave a roar of
laughter after this perfectly timed sequence, and consequent giggles emerged any
time the incredibly small-minded, macho, sexist siblings try to express
themselves. It ain’t pretty, but observing these two dysfunctional louts
brings on a larcenic-laced familiarity that grows on you. Watching Jake ‘n
Joey is kind of like tuning into <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Siskel
&amp; Ebert: </i>you’re always waiting, perversely, for the bickering to
start.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Eventually, however, the
laughs are stifled by The Bronx Bull’s descent into hell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The heart of the film emerges as Lamotta’s madonna-whore complex boils
over.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Why do you always curse
around me?" Jake grumbles, chastising Joey for letting out a cuss word in the
presence of Vickie.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Like other
Scorsese antiheroes Travis Bickle (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">Taxi Driver</span></i>) and Tommy (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Goodfellas</span></i>),
this possessive schmuck can’t tolerate such pollutants existing in the same
air that his long-suffering women breathe. Eventually, Jake’s possessiveness
results in a violent crescendo of betrayal, alienation, and -- eventually --
incarceration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Watching the enraged
Jake pounding his fists and head into the concrete of a Florida jail still sends
chills down a viewer’s spine, as does his final transformation into a
weathered nightclub comedian (where he looks suspiciously like William Shatner
crooning for pricenet.com).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
bull still packs a punch, even into the new millenium.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As rough as Jake Lamotta’s
world was, it’s Disneyland compared to the sleazy, predatorial life of John C.
Holmes as documented in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Wadd</span></i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In the alternative world of adult cinema, Holmes was Tom Cruise, Brad
Pitt, and Clint Eastwood all wrapped into one during his smut-king reign over
the seventies and early eighties, before cocaine and AIDS saw the well-endowed "Elvis Presley of Porn" meet an early demise at age forty-three.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Holmes was a naïve Ohio kid who migrated to L.A. as an average Joe
blessed with a thirteen-and-a-half-inch appendage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Paul Thomas Anderson, the wunderkind director who based his recent film <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Boogie
Nights</span></i> on Holmes’ X-rated escapades, accurately summarized Holmes
as "a gangly geek with a big dick."</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There’s considerable humor
generated from Holmes’ one-note talent.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"If
not for his endowment," laughed an adult-film business associate, "he’d
have a hard time getting hired as a truck driver."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Bill Amerson, Holmes’ manager, called his larger-than-life organ "a
great marketing tool."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><a name="Wadd" target="_top"></a>Meanwhile,
<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Wadd</span></i><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal"> </b>gives viewers a firsthand look at the rebel porn underground.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Porn historian Al Goldstein, a bearded, bearlike presence with
considerable comedic charm, outlines the popularity of early seventies sex films
like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Deep
Throat</span></i> and the almost outlaw subculture that accompanies such
productions. These films showed actual insertion -- a daring extreme in an
industry previously known for softcore sixties films referred to as "nudie
cuties.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">"</font><font size="2" face="Verdana">The cops were the bad
guys," continued early Holmes loop director Bob Vosse, who resembles an
embalmed cross between The Cryptkeeper and Keith Richards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"To shoot these movies, we were always one step ahead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>We’d all meet at a restaurant, and go from car to car. The police were
always eager to charge us for something, such as ‘conspiracy to commit oral
copulation’."</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Holmes’ real claim to fame
was his "Johnny Wadd" persona: a cop with the street smarts of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Shaft</span></i>,
the ruthlessness of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Dirty
Harry</span></i>, and the sex life of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Fritz
the Cat</span></i>. Bob Chinn, who directed Holmes’ in a string of Wadd films,
chuckles as he reflects on his star’s audition. "I asked him what his
credentials were," recollected Chinn, "and he, er, showed me his
credentials."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The director/star
combo was a far cry from Scorsese and DeNiro, writing their first script on the
back of an envelope.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Chinn comments
on the quick production-to-distribution time that was associated with such
films. "We dredged up $750 dollars to shoot a movie called <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Flesh of the Lotus</span></i>,"
he recalled. "It took one day to shoot the film, which was then produced in
less than a week.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It was on the
market within a week’s time!"</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The "crime noir" vibe of
Holmes’ Johnny Wadd films, beginning with 1975’s<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"> </i></b><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Tell Them Johnny Wadd Was Here</span></i>,
was completely overshadowed by the main character’s bedroom antics. Goofy Kung
Fu sequences and laughable chase scenes were a far cry from John Woo. "Wadd
shot a gun," says adult film authority William Margold, "but not very
well."</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Ironically, Holmes would soon
become a snitch for the FBI. "He really got into the role of informant,"
claims Tom Blake of the LAPD. "He would tell us where the productions were
being shot."<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">Wadd</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">’s</span>
narration comments on the irony of Holmes’ willingness to get X-rated stars
busted, just as he was popularizing the adult industry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Like P.T. Barnum, Holmes
would inflate his legend via fabricated stories about turning tricks in Europe
as a high-priced gigolo, and of sleeping with 14,000 women.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Meanwhile, he claimed to have a degree in physical therapy from UCLA.
However, Amerson lets the truth be known by admitting, "the closest he got to
a B.S. was stealing something from a car in a college parking lot."</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Soon enough, Holmes was
living the high life with cash and cocaine, like Tony Montana in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Scarface</span></i>.
But freebasing made him impotent, and soon he was bottom feeding to support his
habit. When he double-crossed an underworld kingpin by leading rival dealers to
his stash, Holmes became involved in a bloody multiple murder and was eventually
incarcerated for a short time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Like
Lamotta, Holmes would lose it all, wasting away from AIDS in a Los Angeles
hospital bed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A grueling fate, for
sure, but even Holmes’ most faithful fans will surely wince as he pimps his
second wife and puts female porn starlets at risk by continuing to perform in
films, even after knowing that he was HIV positive.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Raging
Bull</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Wadd</i></span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">
</i>concludes with a mesmerizing dive into darkness.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><a name="SavingGrace" target="_top"></a>A
much-needed antidote of English humor was on hand with Nigel Cole’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
bold">Saving Grace</span><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">,</b></i> which
spins the offbeat yarn of sheltered Grace Trevethan (Brenda Blethyn), a Cornwall
widow who uses her greenhouse in unorthodox ways to pay off the bills and
mortgage that a reckless husband has left behind. Offering the same good-natured
guffaws that made <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Four
Weddings and a Funeral</span></i> such a frothy delight, this post-Cheech ‘n
Chong pot comedy stumbles during its third act, which is as goofy as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Fast
Times at Ridgemont High</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">’s</span>
Jeff Spiccoli after an all-night bong binge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Two-time Academy Award
nominee Brenda Blethyn is superb as a woman in the throes of change, after her
financially irresponsible husband dies in a skydiving accident and leaves her to
mop up the debt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The film
introduces its bewildered heroine as she attends her beau’s funeral.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Surrounding the congregation is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">Saving
Grace</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold">’s</span> other star:
the coastal town of Cornwall, with its grey rock landscapes and emerald hills
tucked alongside the white-capped ocean. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Dilapidated
buildings mesh with a loud ‘n proud fishing trade, accented by clusters of
crab traps and fishnets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
townsfolk might be hard up for dollars, but they’re also full of spit and
vinegar, including Grace’s dope-smoking gardener, Matthew (Craig Ferguson, who
could pass for one of the Gallagher brothers from the English band Oasis).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">While Grace’s mourning
turns to rage as she learns that her husband was concealing a mountain of debt,
and a mistress, Matthew is growing pot plants covertly at the local cemetery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He’s not the only one in Cornwall to inhale.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Seems many of the residents in this scrubby, impoverished
district are self-medicating with the leafy sedative, including funeral guests
who hide their reefers while unknowing cops pursue salmon poachers instead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Meanwhile, local merchants refuse to let Grace pay for groceries: they
may turn the other way when it comes to drug enforcement, but they’re a loyal
and supportive bunch all the same.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Blethyn injects the character
of Grace with a naïve charm: even as she’s sinking into this financial
quicksand, she’s generating laughs during brainstorms with a financial
consultant.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>"Have you got anything tucked away?" he asks, hopefully.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"We have a Swiss bank account," she retorts. "There’s nothing in
it, but we’ve got one." Meanwhile, it’s heartbreaking to watch this
good-hearted woman confront her misfortune as she takes up smoking to take the
edge off.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Bastard," she
grumbles to a photo of her late husband, before angrily flicking ashes onto the
portrait.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Eventually, Matthew’s
checks are bouncing, but he’s not beyond working for favors.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>When he asks Grace if she can house his pot stash inside her lavish
greenhouse, she reluctantly gives him a thumbs-up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>"How much are these plants worth?" she asks. "The good stuff’s
worth more than gold," replies a grinning Matthew.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Soon, the two are sneaking
cannabis into the greenhouse, even as collectors haul her furniture out the
front door of her home. The duo wagers that it can grow enough weed to bail
Grace out. Eventually, the suspicious lights, emanating from her modified pot
parlor and illuminating the skies like the Close Encounters mothership, have the
locals whispering.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However, no one
in this rebellious, authority-hating town seems to mind. As a neighborhood
bartender observes, "It seems as though Grace is carrying on the local
tradition of total contempt for the law."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Saving
Grace</font></span><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:

suspense, as the proper lady-cum-pot cultivator dodges threats from bankers
while continuing her daring debt-reduction scheme.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Meanwhile, Blethyn shows Grace’s pain as she continues to absorb new
revelations about her husband’s shady past.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Confronting his mistress, Grace asks the seductress why he’d take on an
outside lover. "I think that he thought you just weren’t interested,"
offers the adulterer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"He thought
wrong," Grace responds with a betrayed scowl.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Later, there’s a hilarious
scene where this one-time conservative comes out of her shell and samples her
wares.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>"Will you give me one?"
she asks Matthew. "I want to know what it feels like."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The bewildered gardener does a spit take, mistaking his curious
employer’s comment as a come-on. Later, he introduces her to the pleasures of
reefer madness: think Kid Rock lighting up with Emma Thompson, and you’ve got
some idea of the resulting chemistry.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are terrific supporting
roles in this Fine Line production, including that of Valerie Edmond as
Matthew’s girlfriend, who’s harboring a secret and angry at her partner’s
descent into this criminal venture.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Equally
fine is Ken Campbell as a local policeman who knows more than he lets on.</font></p>

contrast, Takashi Miike’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">With the help of a fellow
entertainment executive, the love-starved Aoyama stages an audition for a phony
romantic movie.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When the
applications start pouring in, he can sift through resumes, call in the thirty
most promising brides-to-be for interviews, and settle on the best of the bunch
to court towards romance. It’s an admittedly deceptive and chauvinistic plot,
but Ishibashi plays such a good-hearted bloke, you can’t help but root for him
to succeed in this twisted dating game.</font></p>

taking the delicate girl out for dinner, even though his fellow executives sense
that something is amiss.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile,
job references don’t check out, while creepy, surreal scenes pop up of Asami
crouched on her wooden bedroom floor, leaning over a sinister cloth sack full

more about Asami than we’d like to know, before lowering its final blow with

unsavory circus of porn personalities, pot peddlers, short-fused palookas, and

exploitation draped with the cloak of art, or a real collection of the latter,
