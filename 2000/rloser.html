            <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Being
            rich has hardly ever been a good thing in the movies. Wealthy
            characters tend to be the villainous ones, insensitive and short
            sighted, ungenerous and fatuous, more concerned with their designer
            labels than with sending canned goods to earthquake victims. This
            isn't to say that poor characters don't aspire to be flush, but the
            moral ground usually belongs to those who are visibly working for
            their rewards. This way, the reasoning seems to go -- since way back
            at the creation of movies as an entertainment for the masses –
            viewers can identify with people they see on screen, even while
            knowing that, for instance, Meg Ryan or Jim Carrey make millions of
            dollars per picture. This is not a uniquely U.S. phenomenon, this
            simultaneous lust for and distrust of money, but it is pretty well
            established in Hollywood, ironically and predictably, one of the
            affluent areas on the planet. And so it was just a little refreshing
            when, in 1995, Amy Heckerling updated one of Jane Austen's several
            class-system-dissections, <i>Emma</i>, into <i>Clueless</i>, a
            delightfully self-conscious film which poked fun at the upper class
            but also acknowledged their vulnerabilities, aspirations and quirks:
            in a word, their apparent &quot;humanity.&quot;</b> <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            while <i>Clueless</i> certainly showed quick and generous wit
            regarding perennial class anxiety, its greater achievement may have
            been its respectful treatment of high schoolers: this isn't
            something you see every day. You may recall that reviewers
            especially compared Heckerling's romantic comedy favorably to Larry
            Clark's controversial <i>Kids</i>, which was released around the
            same time and also focused on young people. The protagonists in <i>Kids</i>
            are not nice or cute, and their pathologies -- sexual promiscuity,
            drugs, violence, petty crimes -- are attributed in the movie to
            their low class, a combination of poverty and poor parenting.
            Meanwhile, the kids in <i>Clueless</i> appear to be virtuous <i>in
            spite of</i> their class identities. Rather than being shallow and
            evil, like, say, the country club lollers in Mary Lambert's <i>The
            In Crowd</i>, Cher and Dionne are really good girls, with a
            comically inept sense of themselves in relation to the rest of their
            world, which, as it happens, don't include many homeless people -- or,
            for that matter, non-millionaires. <o:p>

            Heckerling says of her new movie, <i>Loser</i>, that it focuses on a
            class experience closer to her own experience, in that its
            protagonists are a couple of working class college students, trying
            to live in Manhattan. Paul (Jason Biggs) is a Midwestern boy through
            and through: he wears a winter cap with earflaps and plaid shirts
            that match his dad's (Dan Aykroyd). It's a big thrill for the family
            when, as the film opens, he is accepted by NYU. He's naive and
            trusting, and takes to heart his dad's advice that the &quot;secret
            of making friends&quot; is this: 'Interested is interesting.&quot;
            All this translates, in movie shorthand, to Paul's goodness.
            Needless to say, he runs into a series of obstacles and, at last,
            true love in the Big City. <o:p>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            former is embodied by his moneyed and morally-impaired roommates,
            Chris (Thomas Sadoski), Noah (Jimmi Simpson), and Adam (Zak Orth),
            who can only &quot;hit on girls who are unconscious,&quot; and
            torture Paul for studying instead of partying until they kick him
            out of the room altogether. The love interest is Dora (Mena Suvari),
            identified as such because she wears adorable clothes (torn
            fishnets, short skirts, and layered sweaters, a wardrobe which she
            ostensibly keeps her backpack: um, as if!), puts ice on Paul's knee
            when he falls down the lecture hall stairs, and is the only girl in
            the film with a speaking part. Complications ensue when it turns out
            that Dora, who is working nights at strip bar (where she <i>only</i>
            serves drinks!) and is plainly very bright, is sleeping with their
            supercilious English professor, Edward Alcott (a typecast Greg
            Kinnear). It's immediately clear, then, that Paul and Dora could
            both use a little emotional sustenance and that they are the perfect
            people to provide it for one another. It goes without saying that
            adults are invisible and/or useless, save for Paul's dad, who
            supplies the above-mentioned aphorism and one crucially supportive
            phone call, in which he sagely observes from afar that Paul really
            likes this girl.<o:p>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Despite
            Dad's insight, Paul and Dora's relationship is slow to gel, and must
            be helped along by a gimmick that writer-director Heckerling borrows
            from Billy Wilder's <i>The Apartment</i>: shared space and a guy so
            chivalrous that he supports the girl's obviously misplaced affection
            for an asshole, so that she'll be happy. When Paul's roommates –
            whose scenes emerging from a tanning salon, getting their hair dyed,
            drinking cocktails, and having their fingernails painted fashionably
            black clearly mark them as bad-rich – have him officially removed
            from their wannabe den of iniquity, he's reassigned to a
            veterinarian's office, where he sleeps and cleans the cages. It's
            here that he nurses the newly jobless and homeless Dora to health
            after she's slipped a rophynal by one of his increasingly sinister
            ex-roommates. Being surrounded by kitties and doggies (with whatever
            presumably accompanying odors left unremarked) affords the couple
            several chances to bond over charming pet tricks (including the most
            daring and successful, when they must cut a newborn kitten out of
            its membrane, potentially very yucky and yet, strangely winning.)
            Most painfully, they must do all of this under a curiously belated
            soundtrack, with songs by Elvis Costello and KC and the Sunshine
            Band backed up against old, already-over tracks by groups like
            Everclear (who appear briefly, during an irrelevant club scene), the
            Bloodhound Gang, and Fastball. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">What
            makes any of this work – and not a lot of it does – is
            Heckerling's ability to write and direct real-sounding but wholly
            unreal dialogue. Her work, including the quite brilliant <i>Fast
            Times at Ridgemont High</i> (written by Cameron Crowe) and <i>Look
            Who's Talking</i> 1 and 2 (for which scripts <i>she</i> is
            responsible), has never been much inclined to realism so much as a
            kind of hopefulness or maybe wishfulness. Her characters tend to
            speak more blithely, quip more sharply, and fall all over themselves
            more pleasantly than most real people might imagine doing. The fact
            that Paul and Dora master these comic rudiments and must also
            represent a saintly working class heroism set against the
            well-heeled infidels is almost too much. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">All
            this said, I'm inclined to like <i>Loser</i>, because it wants so
            badly to do well by its college-age heroes, and there are so many
            movies that have exactly the opposite intention. I'm not even so
            troubled by its trumped-up plot curves, presumably designed to throw
            Paul and Dora's goodness into high relief (roofie-poisoning and
            slimy professors sleeping with their students aren't real solid
            foundations for jokes, but whatever). What's most unfortunate about
            all this is the lack of imagination indicated by such stretches.
            Using class to mark morality is as old a trick as there is. If
            you're going to go there, you need to bring more than the clichés
            that everyone's expecting. <o:p>
