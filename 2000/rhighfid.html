<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="5"><b>F</b></font><font size="4">irst,
let's cut to the chase: <i>High Fidelity</i>, the new film starring John Cusack,
is wonderfully entertaining, has some great music, and has a beat. What more
could you ask for? <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Now
for the details: Cusack plays Rob, a vinyl-holdout who lives in his Chicago
apartment surrounded by banks of carefully-stored L.P.'s He can not only recall
when he bought them, but where and, depending on the album, why. At the record
store he owns, &quot;Championship Vinyl&quot; (the &quot;h&quot; has dropped out
of the sign, so that it reads &quot;CHAMPIONS IP VINYL&quot;), he comes up with
Top Five Lists -- such as, Top Five All-Time Killer Opening Album Tracks -- with
the two employees who, Rob informs us, were hired to work three days a week but
just started coming in every day. The two guys seem to be polar opposites, but
they get along. Dick (Todd Louiso) is almost preternaturally shy, but not shy
enough to start up a conversation with a girl (Sara Gilbert), over which bands
influenced Green Day, that leads to a relationship. The punchy, more aggressive
Barry (Jack Black), on the other hand, has no qualms about expressing his likes
and dislikes, and even drives customers out of the store if they come in asking
for what he considers to be the wrong record. The store is located --
&quot;strategically,&quot; Rob adds -- so that they get a &quot;dedicated&quot;
clientele. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As
the film opens, Rob is in a funk, composing and going over his Top Five All-Time
Greatest Breakups. There was the girl whom he caught kissing another boy at
school. The girl in college who would never let him get past second or third
base with her. The girl who was a Total Babe (and is played by Catherine
Zeta-Jones), so, therefore, her interest in him was bound not to last. A girl
(the indispensable Lili Taylor) whom he met and started seeing for all the wrong
reasons (so they were bound to fail, too). His Number Three choice is dispensed
with rather quickly (but gone into more deeply in the novel the film's based
on). And now his current girlfriend, Laura (Danish actress Iben Hjejle, who can
also currently be seen in <i>Mifune</i>), who abruptly breaks things off with
him, starting with her yanking Rob's earphone jack out of his stereo. Rob looks
back at each of these relationships in turn and tries to figure out why he could
not make any of these women happy. When that fails, he even starts contacting
them, and begins grasping desperately to any shred of evidence that proves that
the relationships failed for other reasons: it wasn't his fault, after all. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">This
all does not turn into just some story about some guy amusing himself by
thumbing through his old Little Black Book, found in the back of a desk drawer.
What emerges is something considerably more, that Rob is caught in a Moebius
strip of conceptual failure. That whenever he feels happy or contented,
something is bound to be lurking around the corner or in the shadows that is
going to end it all. Rob is always on the move, always active in some way
because he can't stand to be confronted with another disappointment, even to the
point where he precipitates a disaster. He has the sneaking suspicion that he
doesn't deserve lasting happiness. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
thing is, Rob does look like he deserves some lasting happiness. He comes across
as bright, witty, funny, observant, but he is on the point of becoming seriously
embittered, and one starts to yearn for him to seize an opportunity for
contentment when it presents itself and be able to find some stasis in life. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It's
about time that somebody began extolling the virtues of John Cusack, so I will
take a moment to do so. Cusack has provided many moments of pleasure as a
performance for many years, going back to his attention-grabbing performance in <i>The
Sure Thing</i>, in 1985. There was his intensely romantic Lloyd in <i>Say
Anything..., </i>who, at one point, tells Ione Skye that he's shivering not from
cold, but &quot;because I'm happy.&quot; There was his flawless portrayal of a
Louisiana-born attorney in <i>City Hall</i>, his humanistic F.B.I. agent in <i>Con
Air</i>, and the journalist in <i>Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil</i>
who refuses his editor's request for him to leave Savannah, Georgia and come
back to New York City (&quot;It's like <i>Gone With the Wind</i> on acid! New
York is boring!&quot;). He fumbled a bit in Woody Allen's <i>Bullets Over
Broadway</i> (which was really Dianne Wiest and Jennifer Tilly's show), but for
any really bum performance I have to go all the way back to <i>Tapeheads</i> in
1988, where Cusack tried, and failed, to play a sleaze. (He got it right a
little bit later, though, in the 1991 political drama <i>True Colors</i>.) <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">In
<i>High Fidelity</i>, Cusack, working once again with Stephen Frears, who
directed him in <i>The Grifters</i>, gives a performance that's nothing short of
virtuotic, delivering lengthy observations and confidences to the audience that
are beautifully shaped. They range from plowing the troughs of despair to
jubilation, a savoring of the finer points in life (Rob's list of Top Five
Things he most likes, and misses, about Laura), and mortifying moments of
self-realization. There are also quiet moments, such as when Rob, standing like
a captain on the quarterdeck of his ship behind the record store counter, puts
on a new album and watches while the customers around him start to successively
pick up on the agreeable sound and beat of the music. Another, when, after
putting on a Springsteen album, he seeks for, and gets, advise from the Boss
himself (worth having a look at the movie for, alone). And the multiple
scenarios that run through Rob's head when he finally meets the man whom Laura
has left him for, a specialist in &quot;conflict resolution,&quot; played by Tim
Robbins, who presses his fingertips together and speaks in a voice of crafted
modulation. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Told
from Rob's point-of-view, the story, given its subject matter, never lops over
into total male fantasy, although at times it seems like it's almost about to.
Rob meets, and goes home with, a beautiful local recording artist (played,
stunningly, by Lisa Bonet), but the episode has a cunning catch at the end about
exactly &quot;who's zooming who,&quot; so to speak. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
picture, adapted from Nick Hornby's novel (which was set in London), was
co-written, with Scott Rosenberg, by D.V. DeVincentis, Steve Pink, and Cusack,
who previously worked on the dazzling, and funny, black comedy <i>Grosse Pointe
Blank</i>. There is a sense of a group of artists getting together, here, and,
deciding that they want to do something different from anything else out there,
sitting down and doing so, only going about it with diligence, ferocious
insight, knowing how far to go and when to rein in, and figuring out where the
story should go and how to go about attaining a satisfactory conclusion. Cusack,
DeVincentis and Pink are also credited as &quot;Music Consultants,&quot; meaning
that when these guys speak about the Smiths, Sigue Sigue Sputnik, Ryuichi
Sakamoto, or the various issuings of Frank Zappa albums, they know of what they
speak. (One faux-pas, though: the title track of Springsteen's album <i>The
River</i> comes as the end of Side 2, not the beginning. I mention this only
because I played this record all the time in college.) The film has an
outstanding collection of songs, old and new -- like the compilation tapes that
Rob makes on his home stereo. The compilation tape ends up serving as a metaphor
for a most exquisite ending, one that represents a moving sea change in Rob's
character. By the time <i>High Fidelity</i> reaches its conclusion, the picture
ends up coming closest than any made in years to the classic domestic
comedy-dramas, such as <i>The Man Who Loved Women</i> and the later Antoine
Doinel films, of François Truffaut, in the way it plumbs to the very heart of
men's yearning for, and occasional bafflement towards, women, with humor,
delicacy and insight. <o:p>
