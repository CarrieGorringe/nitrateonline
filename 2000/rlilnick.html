            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>After testing the boundaries of
            physical humor (<i>Happy Gilmore</i>) and comedic taste (<i>Big
            Daddy</i>), Adam Sandler, in <i>Little Nicky</i>, initially appears
            to be testing the audience's ability over seeing him in anything, or
            as anything. As Nicky, son of the Horned One, he has a long lick of
            black hair that covers one side of his face, and he speaks out of
            the corner of his mouth on the other side that's visible, using a
            voice that comes out as a rasp. While on Earth, he wears mittens and
            a variety of quilted coats, including one that wraps him up from
            neck to toe so that he waddles when he walks and looks like a giant
            oven mitt. He gets hit by several moving vehicles, sending him back
            down to the Fiery Pit only to come right back up to Earth, again.</b></font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There seems to have been a
            party-like atmosphere on the set of this film, as all sorts of
            actors drop in and out of the proceedings: Jon Lovitz, Courtney Cox
            Arquette, Kevin Nealon, Quentin Tarantino (playing a blind street
            preacher who tells Nicky, upon first encountering him,
            &quot;You...make the Lord...very nervous....&quot;), Lewis Arquette,
            Carl Weathers, the Harlem Globetrotters, Dana Carvey, Regis Philbin,
            Michael McKean, Henry Winkler, Ozzy Osbourne, Rob Schneider, and, in
            a glorious appearance during the last third of the film, Reese
            Witherspoon. Rodney Dangerfield appears as Grandpappy Satan, wearing
            a long red velvet smoking jacket and saying at one point, &quot;Even
            in Hell, I get no respect.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Having said all that, once you get
            past the pee-pee jokes, vomit jokes, breast jokes, and some others
            that I'm probably not remembering at the moment, <i>Little Nicky</i>
            turns out to have an oddly ingratiating quality. In the film, Nicky
            is content to leave his &quot;dark side&quot; unexplored, playing
            air guitar in his room and steering clear of his two bullying older
            brothers (Tommy Lister, Jr. and Rhys Ifans). When Pappy (Harvey
            Keitel, in a perfectly fine performance) decides he's not going to
            abdicate his seat on the Infernal Throne for another thousand years
            or so, Nicky's brothers decide to go up to Earth and stake their own
            claim, disrupting the order of things and causing Pappy to,
            literally, fall apart. It's up to Nicky to save his dad and set
            things right, and he does so with the aid of a talking bulldog
            (outstandingly rendered by the same special-effects house that
            worked on <i>Babe</i>, and wonderfully voiced by Robert Smigel); an
            actor (Allen Covert) who's almost out of the closet (Nicky doesn't
            mind, making this the second movie where Sandler, to his credit,
            performs alongside gay characters who are not made the subject of
            mockery); two heavy-metalheads (Peter Dante and Jonathan Loughran)
            who think Nicky's origins are just the coolest thing; lots of
            Popeye's takeout chicken (this is probably not entirely a product
            placement, since, so I've been told, some people get addicted to the
            stuff -- but we do find out that they drink Diet Coke in Heaven);
            and a charming girl named Valerie (Patricia Arquette, in her most
            appealing performance in years), whom Nicky falls in love with,
            causing him at one point to float in mid-air because of it.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The relationship with Valerie, and
            Nicky's genuine determination and concern over<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>the fate of his father, not because he's the Devil but
            because he's his father, make up the heart of the picture, and both
            it and Sandler's performance are essentially very good-natured. In
            previous films, Sandler has tended to come off (to this member of
            the audience, anyway) as arrogant, even bullying, in what he wanted
            us to laugh at and how he wanted us to give our approval over what
            he was doing. Bellowing at characters, and behaving obnoxiously in
            other ways, he came off like the kid in the schoolyard who would
            stomp on your toes or kick sand in the sandbox just to get your
            attention, and it was very off-putting, but it was also done in a
            way that made you feel like a jerk if you didn't laugh.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Here, Sandler's character
            discovers, perhaps a little too obviously, that being benign has its
            strong points, too, and <i>Little Nicky</i> shows that Sandler can
            be sweet-natured on camera and still hold the attention of its gaze
            without being boorish or entirely vulgar. I was reminded of the
            performance that first got my attention, in the 1994 Nora Ephron
            film <i>Mixed Nuts</i>, where, trying to cheer up a distraught
            person camped out in the offices of a crisis center during
            Christmas, Sandler's character produces a ukelele and starts
            crooning a gentle, erstwhile song to lighten the mood. It was a
            wonderful moment, partly because it came about so unexpectedly, but
            it was also funny. I'm not saying that Adam Sandler should go all
            soft on us, now, but he has an appealing, and more giving, quality
            as a performer that he's been keeping hidden from us for a while.
            Maybe he should free it and see what happens for once, before he
            gets locked into becoming the world's oldest arrested child.</font>
