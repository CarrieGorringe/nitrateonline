            karaoke were an Olympic sport, this American entry would finish out
            of the medal round. Way out. If Disney wants to call this a comedy,
            then alligator wrestling must be an Olympic sport. There’s not
            much to laugh at, and, based on it’s measly $2 million opening
            weekend figure (in only fifty-plus markets, some of you will be
            fortunate), it’s way out of the competition. The rest of the
            country will have to wait for the home video release. If it’s
            playing at a theater near you, wait it out till it pops up on free

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It’s
            paltry Paltrow. Bruce as director and daughter Gwyneth as one of the
            stars, although the parallel story lines subjects her role to a
            fraction of the 112-minute running time. It’s been eighteen years
            since his last commercial feature, the dreary <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">A
            Little Sex</i>, but it does share the same reaction: What the heck
            is a made-for-TV film doing in movie theaters? With a career firmly
            set behind the little screen, he’d be better off looking for his
            next holy grail. He found it before with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The White Shadow</i> and, one of my all-time favorites, the marvelous
            hospital drama <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">St. Elsewhere</i>.
            Let’s pray he finds gold again. Unfortunately, with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Duets</i> everything’s leaden, especially Mr. Paltrow’s direction
            and the clichéd characters from screenwriter John Byrum (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Valentino</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Sphinx</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Razor’s Edge</i>, and a handful of other non-entities).<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times">The
            story pairs off threadbare characters who will eventually converge
            in Omaha, Nebraska for a $5,000 Grand Prize Karaoke Contest (press
            materials: “t</span>heir lives intertwine, revealing the funny,
            raucous world of Karaoke bars and chain hotels that link the
            interstates of Middle America.”) I heard one big sigh after
            another watching this unravel (alright, that was me), but the other
            ten people in the audience, scientifically polled and probed after
            the screening, confirmed that there was nothing funny or raucous in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Duets</i>. They preferred the post-viewing probing 9-to-1.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">There are some seasoned actors in
            the cast, particularly Andre Braugher and Paul Giamatti, but they
            have horrible, cardboard-thin characters written for them (oops,
            everybody does). The score card has gruffy Ricky Dean (singer/actor
            Huey Lewis) as a veteran karaoke hustler (honest!) stinging smaller
            bar singers with his poker face. When told that a long-estranged
            acquaintance has died, he inherits their only common possession: a
            daughter/third-generation Vegas showgirl (Paltrow) he’s never
            know. She’s sweet and sheltered; he’s a loner. They both have
            good voices at least.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Next up: frazzled traveling sales
            executive Todd Woods (Giamatti), who experiences burnout on the road
            (grievous angst for flaunting environmental laws and allowing a
            theme park water slide to wipe out the breeding grounds for some
            endangered turtles) and at home (wife Candy can’t talk now:
            she’s busy on the Internet; and he’s a ghost to their two
            uncommunicative kids). It’s a sad imitation of Kevin Spacey’s
            Lester Burnham character in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">American
            Beauty</i>. Very sad. Supposedly out in search of a pack of
            cigarettes (so what if he doesn’t smoke: it’s good for a running
            gag), he gets drugged and confused by a karaoke singer before taking
            up the microphone himself at the Pacific Inn hotel bar and belting
            out <i>Hello, It’s Me</i>. Oh boy, he’s hooked now! He picks up
            hitchhiking ex-con Reggie Kane (Braugher) and they hit the road
            stalling, mostly because none of the dumps they visit (caution:
            another running gag ahead) are willing to take his 800,000 frequent
            flyer miles for a free night’s stay. These new-found friends have
            some of the darker moments in the film, but I suspect Braugher
            couldn’t have had a gloomier time embodying his
            convict-with-a-heart-of-tarnished-gold role.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Who else: <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Felicity</i>’s
            Scott Speedman is here as Billy, the half-owner of an aging station
            wagon cab. When Billy find his balding partner in bed with Billy’s
            girlfriend, a reformed lesbian, he hops in his taxi and heads out of
            town. Destination? None other than the meaning of life. Instead he
            finds cute Suzi Loomis, an ex-waitress who offers a male-oriented
            oral barter payment plan in lieu of cash. Good for a paint job,
            hotel room, or trip to California.<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:

            drivel is about as upscale as a laminated karaoke menu. It’s a
