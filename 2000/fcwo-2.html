after he goes out is to go to the record store and pick up two girls who are

<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kubrick
and the film's production designer John Barry found actual locations and
buildings for almost all of the film's scenes, including the house for the scene
where the &quot;droogs&quot; pay a &quot;surprise visit&quot; to the writer
Alexander (Patrick Magee) and his wife (Adrienne Corri). Kubrick and the
performers rehearsed for 10 days before filming the scene, and while John Alcott
did the majority of the cinematography, some of the scenes were filmed with a
handheld camera by Kubrick himself, including this one. (<i>2001 </i>would be
his last film made in a Panavision format. The remainder of his work would be
filmed in a 1.66:1 ratio, because it would mean as little of the visuals would
be lost as possible no matter where the film was projected.) At one point, it
was decided that Alex should sing something. According to John Baxter's 1997
book on the director, Kubrick asked McDowell if he knew a song. McDowell replied
that he could do <i>Singin' in the Rain. </i>Kubrick immediately made some phone
calls, including one to Stanley Donen, and that became the song that was used in
the film. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Probably
the most provocative scene in the film is the one involving Miss Weber (Miriam
Karlin), a.k.a. the &quot;cat lady&quot; (she has lots of cats around the
house), whom Alex's &quot;droogs&quot; decide to rob. (Alex's uncomprehending
parents think that he earns his money doing night jobs, little things here and
there, &quot;helping people,&quot; which gives you some idea of what Alex's
parents are like.) Kubrick and John Barry decided that it was conceivable that,
in the near future, erotica would become a part of the pop mainstream and would
be commonly used in home decoration. The rooms in Miss Weber's house are hung
with huge, exhibitionist paintings done in a variety of styles. (Some of them
were done by Christiane Kubrick, whose paintings would later turn up in the
Hartfords' apartment in <i>Eyes Wide Shut.</i>) When Alex sneaks in and
confronts her, she takes a swing at him with a small, silver bust of Beethoven.
He takes a swing at her with a large, white, porcelain piece of erotic sculpture
(one of the more admittedly hilarious touches in the film, and a piece of set
decoration that was especially sculpted for the film). Later, the Minister of
the Interior (Anthony Sharp), inspecting Alex's jail cell, finds a small bust of
Beethoven -- this one in white. <o:p>
</o:p>

</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I
don't understand about the 'whys' and 'wherefores'.... I only know I want to Do
Good,&quot; Alex tells the prison chaplain (Godfrey Tearle), with whom he
ingratiates himself. Alex is a clever lad. He doesn't give cause for quarrel,
even when ordered to empty his pockets and disrobe while standing behind a white
line on the floor that's at least three feet from the desk where his personal
belongings are collected to be stored. Even though this is the near future, Alex
has to sign for everything in triplicate. Like many people in prison, Alex
figures that he can handle anything (&quot;I've done my very best, sir, I really
have!&quot;), even after having eye clamps placed on his &quot;glazzies&quot; in
order to watch the visual part of the &quot;Ludovico technique.&quot; (The
attendant who supplies the eye drops during these sessions is played by the
wonderful actor Murray Melvin, appearing uncredited; he had earlier played a
cleric in <i>The Devils</i>, and would play another cleric in <i>Barry Lyndon.</i>)
Alex forebears until part of the Ninth Symphony -- &quot;Ninth Symphony. Fourth
movement,&quot; Alex's voice-over precisely tells us -- accompanies some film
being shown during the treatment. Alex is not only going to emerge from the
treatment conditioned so that he will have adverse reactions to sex and
violence, but, now, he's also going to be unable to listen to his &quot;lovely,
lovely Ludwig van.&quot; The doctors response to Alex's panicky, utterly
horror-stricken entreaties with studied indifference. (&quot;Can't be helped.
Here's the punishment element, perhaps.&quot;) Some of McDowell's portrayals in
these sequences may also have their basis in the fact that the eye clamps fitted
on his face scratched the cornea of one eye, almost causing him to lose some of
his sight. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And,
on top of that, Kubrick almost drowned him in the scene where two policemen,
after he's released from prison, decide to drive him out to the country and give
him a good dunking in a horse trough. Much of &quot;Clockwork Orange&quot; is
done in long, continuous takes: this scene is one of them. Alex's head is held
underwater for about two minutes, long enough to leave him, weak and disoriented
and scrambling in the middle of nowhere, stumbling finally upon a house with an
illuminated sign in front that says &quot;HOME.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
colors red figures in <i>Clockwork Orange. </i>The stolen car that Alex drives,
the &quot;Durango 95&quot; that &quot;purred real horrosho,&quot; is red down to
the thin steering wheel that Alex drives it with. Adrienne Corri wears a red
body stocking which is stripped away from her, leaving her wearing only red
matching socks. One of the visuals in the &quot;Ludovico technique&quot;
features a girl wearing a vivid red wig. Joe (Clive Francis), the Stanley
Baker-like lodger who displaces Alex in his home with his &quot;P. and M.,&quot;
is wearing a (hideous) red knit pullover when he tells the prodigal son,
&quot;I've heard about you. I know what you've done. Breaking the hearts of your
poor, grieving parents.&quot; And the typewriter that Alexander is seen working
at when Alex stumbles, for a second time, into his home, is neutral gray; the
one he was using in the earlier scene was red. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Alexander's
bodyguard and, presumably, companion in the later scenes, Julian, is played by
David Prowse, probably the only guy in the country at that time who could do a
scene where he carries Patrick Magee in his wheelchair down a length of stairs.
Prowse's stature and performing abilities would come in handy later on when he
was asked to put on the black helmet and uniform of Darth Vader in <i>Star Wars.</i>
Here, he has a marvelously understated quality, with neat brown hair and
hornrimmed glasses. When he sits down on one side of Alex at a dinner table
while Alexander sits on Alex's other side, pouring one glass of wine after
another for the young man, Prowse says nothing but folds his powerful arms
across his chest, his gaze fixed on Alex, giving us a good enough impression
that Alex isn't going to be going anywhere just yet. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Alex
does jump out of a second story window, an effect achieved when Kubrick sent an
actual, operating motion picture camera flying out of a window. It wrecked the
camera, but Kubrick got the shot that he wanted.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
world that the story takes place in being what it is, it comes as no surprise
that authority comes off looking very badly. There are denigrators,
opportunists, and backpedalers. The chief prison guard barks at the inmates with
the classic high-pitched squall of a rigidly-trained Royal Marine. (&quot;Shut
your filthy hole, you scum!&quot;) There is the horrible Mr. Deltoid (Aubrey
Morris), Alex's correctional counselor, who, having long since written-off Alex
in his mind, uses their meetings as an opportunity to play kneesies and footsies
with the young lad (but always letting Alex know just who's in-command). The
warden at Alex's prison tells him that he believes in &quot;an eye for an
eye,&quot; but that the new government has informed him that their &quot;New
Vision is that we turn the Bad into Good.&quot; The Minister of the Interior,
responding to a complaint that the &quot;Ludovico technique&quot; reforms
criminals by merely removing all real choice while rendering them helpless and
self-abased, dismisses these points with a lame &quot;[T]hese are
subtleties...,&quot; adding, &quot;We're not concerned with motives, with the
higher ethics. We are only concerned with cutting down crime!&quot; He just
wants to meet the immediate public demand to do something about criminals.
Later, he will request Alex's cooperation in repairing the damage, in the press
and otherwise, made by such a hasty decision. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
there is a scene in Kubrick's film that has generally been overlooked, or
misread, in assessments of the film. When Alex asks the prison chaplain about
the new experimental treatment that's supposed to help prisoners get out
quicker, the chaplain is initially reluctant to endorse it. Rehabilitation isn't
something that can be immediately served-up, as if from a fast-food counter or
convenience store. &quot;Goodness comes from within. Goodness is chosen,&quot;
the chaplain tells Alex. &quot;When a man cannot choose, he ceases to be a
man.&quot; The character of the chaplain is generally lumped in with all the
other negative depictions of hapless authority in the film, or his relationship
with Alex is, incorrectly, reported as having homoerotic undertones, like the
one with Mr. Deltoid. Not so. Even though Kubrick directed the actor Godfrey
Tearle to deliver much of his dialogue in the same high-flown, declamatory
manner as the other actors portraying officials or politicians (possibly a
diversionary tactic on Kubrick's part), his character turns out to be genuine,
not hypocritical or corrupt, and the scene where he advises Alex on the nature
of goodness and, especially, choice is one that turns out to be a key point
around which the rest of the film, and one's reaction to the film itself, will
turn.</font></span></p>
