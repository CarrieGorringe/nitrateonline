            is the reason to see <i>Dancer in the Dark</i>, whether you usually
            like her or not. And she is a great and wonderful reason. Granted,
            any encounter with the ex-Sugarcube tends to be strange. She has
            demonstrated repeatedly her astonishing sense of timing and self, in
            her many performances on screens, on stages, and on audio
            recordings. She's equally adept at purring pop- ditties, big-belting
            show tunes, and technologizing her tremendous voice until it sounds
            not-quite- human. And then, she is witty concerning her own visual
            incarnation: in music videos especially, she spins and gesticulates
            and perpetually transforms -- like some sweet-natured and slowed-
            down whirling dervish. All that, and she's Tricky's ex-girlfriend,
            too. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Bjork's
            performance in Lars von Trier's mercilessly bleak, beat-you-down
            musical is a revelation, not so much because she demonstrates craft
            or creativity -- though she does show much of both, in raw, vibrant,
            sometimes unbelievable ways -- but because she exposes her near-
            otherworldly comprehension of music as a means of feeling, seeing,
            and being in the world. She is, in a word, a musician in a musical,
            a musician who has half-conceived and half-shaped a musical, and
            that in itself is a rare event, considering that, aside from Fred
            Astaire and Gene Kelly as dancer-choreographers, most musicals are
            produced by movie-people, not musicians. The Who's <i>Tommy</i> and
            David Bowie in <i>Absolute Beginners</i> would be comparably unusual
            &quot;musical moments,&quot; and Bjork's presence here works at that
            level of weirdness. And she has some to do some battling against two
            sets of well-enforced conventions to make that presence felt. That
            is, the movie adheres to 1) von Trier's own Dogme 95 edicts against
            &quot;tricks&quot; (which basically mean the cameras are handheld,
            colors dreary, lines sometimes improvised, and soundtrack -- aside
            from the dance numbers, of course -- more or less ambient); and 2)
            the excesses of Hollywood musicals, complete with a spectacularly
            melodramatic and implausible plot, interrupted by lavish, generally
            outrageous song-and-dance numbers. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            plot is actually pretty awful, sort of a <i>Breaking the Waves 2</i>,
            in which the female protagonist, here named Selma, is dreadfully
            beleaguered by her life circumstances, and yet maintains her faith,
            if not precisely in god (recall Emily Watson's Bess conversing with
            herself in god's voice), then in the moral codes she sets for
            herself, as these codes are revealed in her musical fantasies. Let
            me explain: Selma is a Czech immigrant eking out a living in rural
            Washington state in 1964. She's is as plucky as young Judy Garland
            ever was, resisting the grim fate that's been dealt to her. Except
            that Selma doesn't have Andy Hardy or a barn as back-up. At the time
            you meet her, Selma is fast going blind from some unexplained
            genetic imperfection that she has passed on to her ten-year-old son,
            the ominously named Gene (Vladan Kostic) (I read one review which
            suggested he was named after Kelly, but given the film's general
            dourness, it's more likely the kid is named for the horror
            afflicting his mom and awaiting him....) In order to scrape together
            the money she needs to pay for the boy's sight-saving operation,
            Selma works long days in a factory that presses metal plates, nights
            putting bobby pins in those little cardboards on which they're sold
            (10,000 cards at a time), and every in-between moment imagining
            herself into a miraculous, melodious world where endings are always
            happy. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">All
            this huge and metaphorical awfulness is too much to bear, of course.
            And so Selma has divined -- or better, created -- an outlet in her
            love of music. One of her precious few pleasures is rehearsing to
            play -- what else? -- Maria in a local theater production of *The
            Sound of Music* (and there's little as haunting as Bjork singing, so
            haltingly, so achingly, &quot;When the dog bites, when the bee
            stings...&quot;). Selma is supported in her many survival efforts by
            her best friend and co-worker, Kathy (Catherine Deneuve, so
            exquisite even in her factory overalls that she draws attention to
            the film's elaborate network of artifices and absurdities), who
            helps her cover up at work as her sight gives out (by working double
            shifts alongside Selma). Kathy also goes with her friend to Busby
            Berkeley movies and &quot;spells out&quot; the dance moves in
            Selma's palm and goes so far as joining the theater cast as an extra
            dancer, though it's plain she's not exactly comfortable singing <b><i>or</i></b>
            dancing.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            if to lay on the hardships, <i>Dancer in the Dark</i> also gives
            Selma a die-hard would-be suitor, the doting, if awkward Jeff (Peter
            Stormare) and a seemingly good friend in a local cop, Bill (David
            Morse). She rents a teeny housetrailer on Bill's property, and one
            late night, he comes by her place in a state, having suddenly
            realized that his inheritance has all been spent by his beautiful
            wife Linda (Cara Seymour). That this is only coming to Bill at this
            moment -- when the bank is threatening to take stuff from him --
            suggests that Selma is not the only character living in a dream
            world. Afraid that his meager salary won't keep the
            all-things-Jackie-Kennedy-obsessed Linda satisfied, he breaks into
            tears in front of Selma, who just can't help herself: she's
            sympathetic to a fault, revealing to Bill her own desperate
            circumstance by way of &quot;sharing.&quot; Unfortunately, when she
            tells him she's almost blind, she also gives Bill the opportunity he
            needs to do something terrible, namely, he stays after their
            conversation is over, and watches where she hides her candy-tin of
            cash. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Bill
            is, it tragically turns out, another version of Bess's husband Jan (Stellan
            Skarsgaard) in <i>Breaking the Waves</i>, inflexible, self-absorbed,
            and feeling like a victim. This translates to dire results for
            Selma, as Bill feels very white-guy-entitled, like someone,
            somewhere, owes him, big time. And Selma (like Bess before her) is
            at once too unwitting and generous, too confused and childish -- too
            blind, to extend that damn metaphor -- to refuse him outright. When
            cowardly Bill pleads with Selma to &quot;have mercy,&quot; she does
            the absolutely wrong thing, mistaking it to be the right one, or at
            least, the result of having no choice that she can see. And the
            movie spends the rest of its runnning time making you, if not Selma,
            regret her blindness to options, punishing her, devastatingly and
            repeatedly. The precise workings of this imbroglio are at once
            intricate and drudge-like, leading to a horrific, pathetic outcome,
            all premised on unlikely coincidences and a kind of willful
            ignorance on the characters' parts. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            all this hardly matters. Bjork -- or more precisely, Bjork singing,
            dancing, and imagining her way beyond the mundane business of making
            sense in a mere movie -- is astonishing. She make songs out of beats
            she hears in everyday events and objects: factory machines, railroad
            trains, air vents, her own heartbeat. Her sheer joy and even her
            self-identity, as it might be divined in all this music found and
            conjured, is inspired and gorgeous, even as the film around her
            abides by generic rules. Selma's flights into wacky fancy occur at
            the most desperate moments, when her eyesight completely fails, when
            she's confronted with a ghastly crime (here she sings and dances
            with a bloodied corpse), and then, when she finds herself in a
            courtroom with simultaneously earnest and creepy DA Zeljko Ivanek
            (the earnest DA in TV's <i>Homicide</i> and the creepy governor in <i>Oz</i>),
            as well as the chief prosecution witness, a Czech musical actor
            played by Joel Grey (this bit of casting in itself may be worth the
            price of admission). Everyone in the courtroom ends up dancing and
            swooning cartoonishly, in Selma's musicalized fantasy of events. And
            when she half-wails, half-sings from a tabletop, &quot;I'm
            in-no-cent!&quot;, you're inclined to think they <b><i>should</i></b>
            let her off, for being Bjork and cooking all this up, if nothing
            else. Equally incredible is Selma's can't-love-you duet with Jeff,
            &quot;I've Seen It All&quot; (on the album, <i>Selmasongs</i>, Bjork
            sings with Thom Yorke), a dance number coordinated with the sounds
            of a passing train and the tool-wielding laborers riding on it, as
            she insists that going blind is, in some make-believe grand scheme,
            unimportant: &quot;What is there to see?&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And
            this is the point: what is there to see, in a world so filled with
            misery and horror? Surely, the film itself has been cited as one of
            these terrible things: its generated controversy from day one, with
            reports of disagreements between Bjork and the notoriously contrary
            von Trier on the set (originally asked to compose and produce the
            score, she became so enraptured with Selma that she and von Trier
            agreed that she absolutely had to play her). Then came the booing at
            this year's Cannes Festival, when <i>Dancer</i> won the <b><i>Palme
            d'Or</i></b> and Bjork the Best Actress prize. And then, more
            recently, UK movie theaters have promised patrons their money back
            if they don't like the movie after at least 30 minutes of viewing.
            This peculiar policy suggests that you must <b><i>see</i></b> at
            least some of it before you make a decision as to its morality, its
            watchability, its legitimacy as art or politics or (admittedly
            extreme) entertainment. Such generous contracting with viewers is
            unlikely to become popular with theater-owners, but it does suggest
            an unusual faith in the power of seeing as a means to understanding.
            Though it's unlikely you would comprehend Bjork in all her
            strangeness and sensational self, you can still come close to
            understanding what music means, to her and maybe to yourself. <o:p>
