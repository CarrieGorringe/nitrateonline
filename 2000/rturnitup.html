            for some decent darkly-urban cinematography by Hubert Taczanowski
            and a brief appearance by singer Faith Evans, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Turn
            It Up</i> is a bit of a stiff. Its hackneyed story concerns an
            aspiring hiphop artist whose attempts to cut a record and get out
            the hood are blocked by white thugs and his best friend's mistakes.
            You know, it's the kind of movie that gets you thinking about your
            grocery list or what you're missing on TV while you're watching it. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            this case, my mind wandered to the trailers that preceded the film,
            what they might be saying about how someone imagined <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Turn
            It Up</i> would play, and to whom. First comes <i>Billy Elliot</i>,
            a movie about a little English boy who wants to dance ballet instead
            of box, much to the horror of his working class father. Number two, <i>The
            Legend of Bagger Vance</i>, wherein Will Smith is a magical caddie
            who teaches Matt Damon to play golf <i>and</i> win the white girl's
            heart. Next, <i>Ladies' Man</i>, where <i>Saturday Night Live</i>'s
            long-suffering Tim Meadows gets a chance at last to stretch his very
            own three-minute skit into an hour and a half. And finally, <i>Bamboozled</i>,
            Spike Lee's high profile return to fiction-filmmaking, a comedic
            critique of television's ongoing minstrel show, starring Damon
            Wayans, Savion Glover, and Jada Pinkett-Smith. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Imagine
            these trailers form a prism through which to make sense of the movie
            they precede. So, for instance, you might observe that, like the
            heartwarming English film, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Turn
            It Up</i> is a &quot;universal&quot; story about growing up, in
            which a young man (not precisely a boy, but often immature) fights
            social and economic odds to pursue his rap-star dream. Brooklyn-born
            Diamond (third Fugee Pras, best known for &quot;Ghetto
            Superstar,&quot; which hit-singled off the <i>Bulworth</i>
            soundtrack) is midway through cutting a record, which, the movie
            wants you to think, is off the proverbial hook. With an ailing
            mother and absent dad (this would be the other <i>Billy Elliot</i>
            connection, father-issues), D has a few clichéd chips on his
            shoulders, while seeking respect from his thuggish homeboys, as well
            as thuggish record industry suits (one label exec is called,
            ominously, Mr. White). Sadly, and no matter how you may judge his
            rhymes, D's not very imaginative when it comes to expressing
            himself. Too often, he's reduced to fending off the bad guys by
            saying, &quot;Don't fuck with my music!&quot;</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Of
            course, some folks do just that. The first is D's no-count daddy
            Cliff (Vondie Curtis-Hall), who shows up for D's mother's funeral
            (the word &quot;contrived&quot; doesn't begin to cover this
            plotting, and much of it is ripped off from <i>Purple Rain</i>, to
            boot). Cliff is a jazz pianist who left the wife and shorty in order
            to pursue his gigging dreams, then lapsed into alcoholism or
            whatever. His return (&quot;I'm sorry I messed up&quot;) coincides
            with D's creative crisis, and luckily, dad's versed in slick studio
            production, such that his insta-input improves the kid's record
            exponentially, or at least makes it sound more all right than the
            flat rhymes he'd been running just a few minutes before (his
            crackhead engineer --Chris Messina-- is definitely not feeling it).
            Soon enough, father and son are in the sound booth, nodding to the
            new-better beats, happy as hiphopping clams.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">All
            this studio time doesn't come free (even if the owner does believe,
            as he tells D, &quot;You've got the goods&quot;). And so, D's magic
            instigator and helper -- his sorta Bagger Vance -- is his longtime
            friend/financier/manager Gage (the energetic Ja Rule), who also
            happens to be a drug-runner for some slimy white British fellow
            named Mr. B (Jason Statham). Though Mr. B tries to entice D to work
            for him, the kid's not having it (something about scruples). Still,
            he's willing to go on runs with his friend. Gage is really a good
            kid (&quot;Do you really believe I enjoy pushin' weight?&quot;) and
            takes dutiful note of D's hypocrisy, in that he takes Gage's money
            to pay for his crib and studio time. But the guys are more bad than
            good for one another, their dog loyalty eventually making both of
            them vulnerable to Mr. B's excesses. One example will suffice: Mr. B
            learns that Gage has stolen money from another dealer, which in some
            long run belongs to Mr. B., and so he tortures him in the most
            retarded way, straight out of Movie Villainy 101: he asks Gage if he
            wants some &quot;roast beef,&quot; hauls out a meat slicer he has
            handy, then holds Gage's face against it -- shiny slicer-wheel
            a-whirring -- until the kid gives up the required information. This
            takes about half a second.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            indicated by this scene, Gage primarily serves as a foil to D. Where
            the eminently intimidate-able Gage is excitable and flashy, D is
            seething and earnest. But, the charismatic Ja Rule turns Gage into
            more than the usual sidekick: he's more resolute, funny, and
            energetic, and if not precisely Will-Smithlike, he's actually more
            appealing than Pras, who runs low on the affect scale. For instance,
            at the necessary moment when D performs at a local club, all dressed
            up in a slick white suit, his boy Gage steps up for one verse and
            basically blows him off the stage. But D reasserts himself when,
            during a shootout with a group of &quot;Asians,&quot; he's suddenly
            revealed as the two-guns equal of Chow Yun Fat (this ludicrous
            expertise is never explained). They have each other's backs, I
            suppose, but D's supposed sway is not very convincing.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            an apparent effort to bolster his role as hero, the movie makes D,
            like Tim Meadows, a &quot;Ladies Man&quot; who goes straight. Sort
            of. While it's clear that, if he wanted, D could outperform Gage as
            a player (Gage has scantily-outfitted women hanging round him at the
            clubs), he has a steady girl, Kia (Tamala Jones), who will
            eventually convince her man that he needs to set his priorities. She
            does this in two ways: at first, she disses him: &quot;When I first
            met you,&quot; she says when he's late for a date, &quot;you were so
            fine, you were mad cool.&quot; But now he's not living up to
            whatever potential she saw in him and, more specifically, is
            spending too much time with his boy Gage, &quot;running around like
            Batman and Robin&quot; (a description that suggests she may know
            something about their relationship that even they don't know). And
            later, after a sufficient number of professional mini-crises have
            beset D, she informs him that she's pregnant, and insists that he
            make a choice, be a man, do the right thing, and (insert your
            favorite cliché here). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At
            this point, it's surely obvious that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Turn
            It Up</i> is running most every ghetto stereotype available, from
            the sainted dead mama and long-gone-then-redeemed dad to the
            ambitious son, pregnant girlfriend, and doomed sidekick (this string
            of characters goes to the <i>Bamboozled</i> premise, in case you're
            counting). A lot of movies are predictable, of course, but this one
            seems inordinately determined to squash its characters (and
            performers) flat with its lack of imagination. I can recall the PR
            fanfare a couple of years ago, when Pras announced he was going to
            make the &quot;Ghetto Superstar&quot; idea into a movie (<i>Ghetto
            Superstar</i> was <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Turn It Up</i>'s
            working title), including the buzz that Guy Oseary, of Madonna's
            Maverick Records was producing. It's hard to say exactly what went
            wrong, or how responsible you might hold first-timewriter-director
            Robert Adetuyi, or how much of what's ended up on screen had to do
            with Pras or other more and less experienced movie-folks who had
            &quot;concepts&quot; about what corny plot devices a movie about
            &quot;rap&quot; or &quot;the ghetto&quot; should include in order to
            appeal to the widest possible demographic, or perhaps appeal to the
            various audiences targeted by four not-very-well-connected trailers.
            The result is a discombobulated generic hybrid, with precious little
            in it to interest anyone. <o:p>
