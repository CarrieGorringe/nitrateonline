            techno-chic mumbo jumbo, I expected a microbrew, not Budweiser), and

            chase montages suggest you do), this one barely passes muster and

            blast their way into a world ablaze with extreme sport. The opening
            sequence highlights ultra-XFL football quarterback Johnny Phoenix
            (Steve Bacic), complete with futuristic virtual helmet screen,
            suffering a seemingly back-breaking, career-ending injury. The
            ambulance ride brings a even darker fate, until the star later shows
            up apparently unharmed. What’s up? Who’s who? Who’s what? The
            filmmakers send in the clones early on, and their replacements, and
            then some more. Death don’t come easy for the henchpeople

            Drucker (Tony Goldwyn, borrowing from his <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Ghost</i>
            persona), an evil Bill Gates zigabillionaire tycoon ("the world’s
            second most important person") who owns sports teams and a big
            secret. Adam involuntary gets cloned and therein sets up a dilemma
            for the conglomerate that is moving up the food chain in replacement

            like "Try to stay dead this time, "Doesn’t anyone stay dead
            anymore?," and "We’ve all been killed before" are flattened by the
            moralistic meandering of the plot and the social implications of

            Rapaport as a wisecracking chopper chum whose home life is enhanced
            by the latest in cyberbabe technology. Michael Rooker, Sarah Wynter,
            Rod Rowland, and Terry Crews are the adequate goon squad, most of
            whom get bumped and bruised more than any second banana can bear. As
            for the continuity, Vancouver takes a beating and someone stumbled
            when I spotted a wedding ring on both Arnolds. Somehow I doubt one
            of those trinkets wasn’t part of the cyber-genetic, birthday-suit
