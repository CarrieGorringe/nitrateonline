            review by <a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 23 June 2000</i></font>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>As its title
            promises, Robert Iscove's romantic comedy features a number of boys
            and girls. Or, rather, it features a number of character sketches
            standing in as boys and girls, rendered by actors whom you'd expect
            to be more careful about selecting projects, including Freddie
            Prinze Jr., Claire Forlani (<i>Basquiat</i>), Monica Arnold (the
            excellent hiphop-pop singer), and Alyson Hannigan, who fortunately
            keeps a terrific day job as <i>Buffy's</i> enchanting Willow). Given
            the vagaries of film production, it's certainly possible that none
            of these appealing young performers could have anticipated the
            eventual shape this movie would take. Still, there may have been
            signs along the way.</b></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Take, for
            instance, the film's premise, that boys and girls by definition have
            trouble communicating with each other. While this is fine, as
            convenient plot-establishing truisms go, it's also tedious, as
            truisms tend to be. This may be the reason that the screenwriters,
            Andrew Lowery and Andrew Miller (a team of TV actors also
            responsible for writing the Dennis Rodman vehicle, <i>Simon Sez</i>,
            and who here go by the clever moniker, &quot;The Drews&quot;) have
            come up with a &quot;twist&quot; (which is in itself quite
            predictable). It's not going to surprise anyone that the two
            protagonists, Ryan (Prinze) and Jennifer (Forlani), are opposites,
            in their attitudes toward sex, in particular. But the gendering of
            their opposition is inverted: Ryan is nerdy, uptight, and concerned
            with commitment, and Jennifer is promiscuous. Most importantly, for
            central conflict's sake, she proclaims early on that she is loath to
            commit.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">You see how this
            is going to work out, which is, much as the film's precious tagline
            declares, &quot;Opposites attack.&quot; Ryan and Jennifer, though
            they begin as if they have nothing in common, will eventually fall
            into one another's arms and live happily ever clinched. That this
            entails her coming round to his point of view -- to drop her
            (admittedly nebulous) career goals in favor of their relationship --
            because, as Ryan puts it, no matter how &quot;weird&quot; their
            relationship feels, &quot;We're too good together to let that stand
            between us.&quot;</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">En route to their
            inevitable coupling, Jennifer and Ryan encounter the requisite
            obstacles, namely, other relationships, with individuals and peer
            groups (i.e., high school and college cliques). They meet first as
            children (played by Brendon Ryan Barrett and Raquel Beaudene), on a
            first airplane ride that unnerves Ryan and so allows the slightly
            older Jennifer a sense of superiority from jump. They meet again
            during a high school football game, where she's the homecoming queen
            and he's the visiting team's mascot, whose fake-furry head falls off
            and is squashed by the car she's riding in. And they meet for the
            final set of hurdles when they're at Berkeley. Here. They are
            assisted by &quot;best friends:&quot; his roommate is Hunter (Jason
            Biggs, who famously had his way with an apple pie in last summer's <i>American
            Pie</i>) and hers is Amy (Amanda Detmer, last seen -- or rather,
            heard -- being splatted by a city bus in <i>Final Destination</i>).</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When they first
            run into each other on campus, Ryan and Jennifer are dating other
            people. In fact, she's living with a rock singer, who breaks off
            their &quot;great&quot; relationship with a song he performs at a
            local club. And Ryan, thinking that he's happily in love with his
            now long- distance high school sweetheart Betty (Hannigan), receives
            a &quot;Dear John&quot; letter. He and Jennifer share their sorry
            breakup stories over designer coffee and she tearfully admits that
            she likes him, despite his annoyingly rigid ideas about committing
            and soul-mating. On the most obvious level, the film is now (some
            twenty minutes into the action) setting up Ryan and Jennifer's
            &quot;friendship&quot; as opposed to their &quot;relationship.&quot;
            As friends, they &quot;talk about stuff,&quot; ride the trolley,
            rollerblade, and go dancing at a bizarre retro club where everyone
            dances in synch -- like they're in a Backstreet Boys video -- while
            being doused with shaving cream. In other words, it's abundantly
            clear that they must move on in order to get to the moment you
            eagerly await, the film's end.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">But on another
            level, the film is setting up its most interesting and badly handled
            problem, which is, in a word, identity. And surprisingly, it's goofy
            boy Hunter who best embodies this problem. When Ryan first meets
            him, Hunter has inadvertently locked himself in his clothes trunk,
            in an effort to give himself a &quot;great story&quot; to tell
            &quot;chicks&quot; he's hoping to pick up. Hunter wears slightly out
            of style punkish hair that he colors variously -- yellow, pink, blue
            -- in his ongoing effort to &quot;find himself&quot; during his four
            years at college. When he reveals to Ryan that his name isn't even
            Hunter -- it's Steve, for anyone who cares -- he explains the
            deception by telling his woeful backstory. Woe is him: he's from the
            'burbs and his parents are still agreeably married. In other words,
            Hunter believes he has no identity because he's so typical and
            uninteresting. As a result, he plays at being a player, coming on
            with ridiculous lines and poses, and claiming the experience to be
            able to instruct Ryan in love and life. (His most preposterous
            escapade involves his telling a girl that he's just left monks'
            school, and needs her to teach him how to play this &quot;strange
            game of sticks and balls&quot;; i.e., pool.) By contrast, Ryan --
            though he's also white and suburban (we'll overlook that Prinze is
            notably not &quot;white&quot;) does appear to have an identity,
            because he's had trauma (his parents are divorced).</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And yet, Hunter's
            anxiety resembles the film's, which is that identity for well-to-do
            white kids is a fearful vacuum. (And to this point, it must be noted
            that the only black character with face time, much less lines, on
            this version of the Berkeley campus, is someone's friend's date,
            played by Monica. At least she looks closer to college age than the
            ever-stunning Li'l Kim did to high school age in <i>her</i>
            white-teens romantic comedy debut, <i>She's All That</i>, which, in
            a cosmic coincidence, also starred Freddie Prinze Jr.). Hunter
            speaks this anxiety at a crucial moment. Ryan comes back to the room
            in a panic because he hasn't been strictly honest with yet another
            in-between girlfriend (an airhead, flip-coifed, electrical
            engineering student, played by <i>Blair Witch Project's</i> Heather
            Donahue). Hunter observes, maybe even sardonically, &quot;Being
            yourself, not being yourself. Welcome to my world.&quot;</font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">That Ryan has no
            such ambiguities makes him the most boring character in the film.
            And so, you wonder frequently why Jennifer is even considering being
            in love with him. She actually has another option, for about fifteen
            seconds, when Amy comes on to her during a surprisingly heated
            moment on their couch. But this film, so nervous about identifying
            all its characters, isn't about to let Ryan's Intended go off on a <i>lesbian</i>
            tangent. So, Jennifer and Amy immediately deny what's happened.
            While Jennifer's path is clear and straight, Amy's declaration that
            the kiss was a function of her fear of &quot;losing&quot; Jennifer
            is only half-convincing, as is her last-minute hook-up with Hunter
            (now calling himself Steve). Moreover, Jennifer's self-certainty is
            short-lived, and she acts out her own identity-confusion quite
            hysterically in a scene she performs for Ryan (and several other
            customers in a coffee shop). After yet another breakup with another
            loser boyfriend, she launches into a sad and frantic speech: &quot;I
            don't think that any of us know who we <i>really</i> are,&quot; she
            announces. &quot;How do I <i>know</i> if he's Mr. Right? What if
            that something we're looking for doesn't really exist?&quot;</font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">What if, indeed?
            It's a good question, and one that the film can't answer. <i>Boys
            and Girls</i> can't admit that Jennifer is onto something when she
            sees that gender roles are unnatural, impositions we learnt to want.
            Instead, the movie sends her off into happy-ending-land with her
            designated boy. Problem solved.</font>
