            these winning voiced-over words, <i>Whipped</i> introduces its
            protagonist and primary object, Mia (Amanda Peet). And while she's
            waxing profound and cynical on human relations, you're watching one
            of the three guys who will be wooing her during the next
            eighty-eight minutes, Brad (Brian Van Holt). He's on the street in
            New York, unable to get a cab, becoming increasingly frustrated. Cut
            to a scene in a bar, where Brad addresses the camera: &quot;I can
            provide a woman with pretty much everything she wants,&quot; he
            says. &quot;Sausage included.&quot; <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Written,
            directed, and produced by first-timer Peter M. Cohen, <i>Whipped</i>
            is plainly pleased with its drippy, been-there-already cynicism. The
            premise is this: Brad and his three best friends -- Zeke (Zorie
            Barber), Jonathan (Jonathan Abrahams), and Eric (Judah Domke) --
            meet regularly for Sunday &quot;brunches,&quot; during which they
            brag and <i>kvetch</i> about their sex lives, what they call
            &quot;scamming&quot; (translation: getting over into girls' pants).
            Three of the guys are single, and so, while the make fun of chubby-geeky-whiny
            Eric's married status (you never see the wife, Lorraine), they also
            dream of the perfect girl, that special someone who's just waiting
            to be swept off her feet by the male's eminent charms, who's not
            merely a &quot;gorilla on Ecstasy&quot; (an especially aggressive
            lover) or Hoover Hannah (apparently famous for giving Brad a
            five-hour blowjob), but able to hold a conversation about the male's
            particular area of interest -- in these cases, stocks (Brad),
            screenplays (Zeke), and masturbation (Jonathan). Brad and Zeke take
            it on themselves to instruct their designated dork-boy, Jonathan, in
            attaining the &quot;untease-able dick,&quot; which means an attitude
            that allows you to &quot;f*ck and forget.&quot; In order to attain
            this nirvana of cynicism, you must be burned by some bad babe, and
            poor Jonathan simply hasn't been there yet. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            is because Jonathan has slept with only nine women in his life (when
            he confesses this to the camera, he hopefully describes himself as
            &quot;picky,&quot; but his big-talking pals obviously consider him
            more or less &quot;retarded&quot;). Jonathan's lack of experience
            somehow transforms into his one-joke characterization, i.e., daily
            masturbation. It's never clear what he does to pay rent (but then
            again, who cares?). Jonathan's buddies do have jobs, or rather,
            occupations which grant them means to scam. Brad is some kind of
            Wall Street person, though you never see him at work, just &quot;out
            with the guys from work.&quot; And Zeke is some kind of writer,
            though you never see him writing, hanging out in a &quot;beatnik café,&quot;
            reading books in a corner and affecting &quot;enigmatic,&quot;
            artiste-y mannerisms that somehow appeal to the chicks he thinks he
            wants to pick up (or who pick him up and then steal his stereo and
            TV: now isn't <i>that</i> a funny punchline!).<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            boys' diner meetings provide the film with a basic structure, such
            that the segments are numbered and titled, thusly: &quot;Week 3:
            Mayhem,&quot; &quot;Week 6: Whipped.&quot; You might think this
            device turns more tedious than clever, and you'd be right. But it's
            not only the structural and visual repetition that's annoying (they
            always meet in the same booth and the camera set-ups are all the
            same), it's also the characters' lack of -- for lack of a better
            word -- development. JonathanZekeEricandBrad's conversations cover
            and re-cover the same thematic ground, that is, who got some that
            weekend, how and where. I've asked around, and been informed that
            guys like this do exist, but no one I've spoken with admits to
            knowing one personally. They perform for each other (see also the
            requisite pickup basketball game, as the four demonstrate that white
            men can't jump or score or anything else: this would be the
            &quot;physical&quot; humor sequence). And, sigh again, this leads to
            the not very subtle suggestion that they share a certain homoerotic
            bond, of which they are deathly afraid. Whenever anyone -- for
            instance, the banal, domesticated, <i>Cosmo</i>-reading Eric --
            mentions something about achieving better performance (e.g.,
            drinking apple juice to make for a better tasting blowjob, using
            kitchen appliances to enhance a woman's pleasure) -- the others
            dismiss him immediately, as it's girly and/or gay to be too
            concerned with what a woman &quot;wants,&quot; except as this leads
            specifically to getting what you want. The goal, after all, is to be
            a perfectly self-fixated guy. &quot;Pleasing&quot; women is only a
            means to an end, that is, more &quot;tail.&quot; <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">No
            surprise, all this chatter-and-chest-thumping leads to competition
            over one girl, the aforementioned Mia. While the brunch routine
            ostensibly affords the guys a sense of security, it also wears a
            little thin for viewers who have already seen it in
            ensemble-boy-bonding movies like <i>Diner</i>, <i>Swingers</i>, or <i>The
            Tao of Steve</i>, not to mention that so-stale business where
            protagonists confess their bad or downright silly ideas about how to
            pork, bone, and spank their own monkeys to the camera, as in such
            classic films as, oh, <i>Body Shots</i>, which, coincidentally, also
            stars our girl Amanda Peet. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Peet's
            Mia is energetic and pretty and very special, even if this really is
            the boys' movie and she only shows up in order illustrate their
            anxieties, concerns, and &quot;issues.&quot; While the film's
            general organization -- three guys competing for one woman, all
            knowing about one another, all showing up at her apartment at the
            same time -- is pretty much directly ripped off from Spike Lee's
            groundbreaking <i>She's Gotta Have It</i>, here the focus is not on
            the she, but the three he's (who would be derived from <i>Diner</i>,
            <i>Swingers</i>, etc., etc.). Still, the film's marketing campaign
            is plainly focused on Peet, who has the box office clout to open the
            film. It appears that, since her &quot;breakout&quot; performance as
            Bruce Willis's buoyant hit person trainee in <i>The Whole Nine Yards</i>,
            Peet has generated enough buzz to have gotten <i>Whipped</i> off the
            shelf, where it has lingered for some time (and, no doubt, the fact
            that it is opening against the unpreviewed <i>Highlander: Endgame</i>
            likely has something to do with the choice of this particular
            weekend for its release). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mia
            appears in each man's fantasies and in person, telling them as a
            group, so very Nola-Darling-like, that she doesn't want to choose
            among them, that she fancies them all equally, though for different
            reasons. Blah blah blah: she shares an interest in Brad's stock
            quotes, Zeke's screenwriting, and Jonathan's masturbation, which
            leads to one lame <i>Trainspotting</i> ripoff, as Jonathan must
            recover Mia's vibrator from a shit-filled toilet (tired!). And Mia/Peet
            is, as the trailers underline, mightily cute and kinetic (though the
            much-rotated scene where she performs the &quot;Who's your
            daddy!?&quot; line for her girlfriends comes way late in the
            proceedings, and leads exactly nowhere). Mia's incredible ability to
            find something to enjoy in each of these idiots -- piled on top of
            her voice-over introduction to the film -- doesn't leave much
            suspense as to her own cynicism and performative prowess. Still, the
            movie pretends for a bit that she might be sincere in her
            affections, or at least it allows each of the male characters to
            think that he is the Chosen One, leading to their contemplations of
            marrying and/or shacking up with the lovely Mia, of making her his
            very own. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            distinction <i>Whipped</i> draws between possession and devotion is
            a fine one, and too often, a familiar one: possession is a guy thing
            and devotion is a pussy thing. Mia acts like a guy, strutting and
            self-possessed, so she &quot;wins.&quot; It would seem that the
            movie wants to comment shrewdly on the state of male-female, and
            more to the point, male-male, relationships. But its insights -- men
            and women lie to one another and themselves, women talk about penis
            size amongst themselves -- are pretty much played out. Jeez, can it
            be so interesting -- still -- to ponder the notion that women can
            play so-called guys' games better than men do? Is it amusing to
            watch men behave badly and be punished for it? And is it news that a
            very regular socio-political system -- &quot;Everybody f*cks
            everybody&quot; -- remains in place throughout all of these
            machinations? Actually, no. <o:p>
