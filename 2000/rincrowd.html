            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 21 July 2000</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>It starts out so-oo-o
            promisingly.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Obscenely intimate close-ups of a
            girl's furtive eyes. A group of people, seated behind a long table,
            examine a series of reports and evaluations. The camera floats over
            the word &quot;erotomane&quot; -- which I haven't heard used since
            the Peter Weiss play &quot;Marat/Sade? -- highlighted on one of the
            reports. All greyness, and somber. Is this a parole board meeting?
            An admittance exam? The group of people are doctors, deciding on
            whether to let Adrien (Lori Heuring) out on a work leave from the
            psychiatric institute, St. Anastazia's, where she's been staying.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Returning to her room, Adrien sees
            one of the other patients snatch a postcard with a picture of Andrew
            Wyeth's &quot;Christina's World&quot; on it off of her bulletin
            board. &quot;They'll see it on you!&quot; the patient cackles,
            hopping back and forth. &quot;And they'll send you back!&quot;
            Adrien retrieves the postcard from her in a way which suggests she's
            no cookie to get into a rumble with. The postcard -- and why someone
            would send a postcard with &quot;Christina's World&quot; on it to
            someone being hospitalized in an institution is beyond me -- has
            some sort of personal value, although what that is, along with the
            rest of Adrien's prior history, is deliberately withheld from us.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For a work leave, you'd think
            they'd send Adrien to some place which would be nice, quiet, and
            safe, like the Lancôme counter in a major department store,
            somewhere where she'd have a good chance at succeeding. But,
            nooooooo. She ends up at Glenmont, a seaside country club where all
            the rich, spoiled, arrogant kids are hanging out during summer
            vacation. They wear expensive leisure clothes or, on the beach,
            practically nothing at all. It's as if Adrien had been sent to work
            on Ganymede. The banter she overhears is priceless: &quot;You guys
            jonesin' for some golf?&quot; &quot;I think you were a lot more fun
            when you were doin' 'blow'!&quot; &quot;His parents bought him a
            brand new Hummer. It's for makin' it through rehab!&quot; (Note how
            they keep dropping the &quot;g&quot; off the end of their words.)
            &quot;Welcome to the Lifestyles of the Rich and Tasteless!&quot; One
            kid misses a shot during a pool game, and breaks his pool cue in
            two. They also shut the service elevator down, and laugh like crazy.
            And they're apparently ambisexual: Guy: &quot;I have never slept
            with my mother's boyfriend.&quot; Girl: &quot;I have never slept
            with my parents' au-pair.&quot; One gets the impression that, in
            reality, they actually had.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Before Adrien throws up her hands
            and goes down to fill out an employment application at the local
            Crispy Creme, she is taken under the wing of Brittany (Susan Ward),
            who has long dark hair and eyes that are alternately deep dark or
            have a silver flare in the irises. Brittany invites Adrien to
            parties, even though Adrien is the hired help. Adrien also gets
            annoyed looks from Kell (Laurie Fortier), as if Adrien was in the
            process of stealing her girlfriend, as opposed to friend-friend,
            away from her. Then, Brittany introduces Adrien to Tom (Ethan
            Erickson), an outrageously buffed guy who is first seen rising from
            the surf like an Olympian god who has just dropped down to have a
            quick swim. Tom seduces Adrien, while Brittany sits, just out of
            sight, to watch.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Is Adrien going along with all
            these shenanigans and capital head-games just to be nice, or does
            she really believe she can become a part of this group? Or does she
            have some other, ulterior motive? The main asset of <i>The In Crowd</i>
            is that it manages to keep us guessing for almost an hour or so as
            to who the real antagonist is -- Adrien, with her mysterious,
            possibly dangerous, past, or Brittany, who turns out not only to be
            treacherous but has some Dreadful Secrets of her own. Unfortunately,
            the picture suddenly loses its momentum and becomes more and more
            muddled as it goes along, until the story finally collapses
            altogether, with scenes where people start flailing about and
            jabbing and bashing each other with shovels and hedge sheers. Even a
            quick, glib plot point that's supposed to be a sly reference to the
            Monica Lewinsky farrago doesn't even register in your head until
            long after you're out of the theater.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There's some good work from Nathan
            Bexton, previously seen in Doug Liman's film <i>Go</i>; Kim Murphy,
            who, as Adrien's co-worker, turns out to be the best friend one
            could possibly want in your corner; and Lori Heuring, who has a
            graceful curve to her face and suggests the right note of submerged
            menace and unpredictability in her character.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The director Mary Lambert started
            out doing some distinctive music video work, for songs such as
            Sheila E.'s &quot;The Glamorous Life&quot; and Madonna's
            &quot;Material Girl&quot;, but after she was fired as director for <i>Under
            the Cherry Moon</i>, she made her feature film debut with the
            utterly screwloose <i>Siesta</i>, followed by the film version of
            Stephen King's <i>Pet Cemetery</i>, which, like this film, started
            out fine but then fell completely apart before the end. Expectations
            that <i>The In Crowd</i> could be this year's equivalent to <i>Wild
            Things</i> or <i>Cruel Intentions</i> are thoroughly dashed; and,
            while there is a terrific closing song by Tracy Bonham, the
            filmmakers don't even play the classic Sixties rock song with which
            this film shares the same title.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
