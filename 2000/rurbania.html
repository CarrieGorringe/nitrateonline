            any good stories lately? I got a good one, and this one really
            happened, I swear.&quot; Urban legends are those stories just creepy
            enough to seem unreal, but close enough to reality that you can
            imagine they happened, to someone, you know, that friend of a cousin
            of an acquaintance of an in-law. They typically involve some
            profoundly unsettling violence or violation, suggesting that the
            smooth surface of your life is ever on the verge of destruction. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Charlie
            (Dan Futterman) looks sort of like an average Joe, maybe a little
            more beset than most, disheveled, pale and slight. He's not getting
            much sleep lately, feeling besieged by his environment, unable to
            settle into a rhythm or sense of security. He lives in New York,
            where the streets are ever filled with possibilities, good and bad.
            As you watch him walking these streets as if he's afraid but also
            resentful that he feels that way, it's not long before you get the
            idea that he walks this way because he's had a particularly
            unnerving or traumatic experience. For all his manifest
            tentativeness, Charlie also exudes warmth and curiosity, like he's
            looking for something, something new or unknown, maybe even trouble.
            Whether he's making nice with a homeless guy outside his building (Lothaire
            Bluteau), or contemplating a sexual offer made by a
            high-powered-looking woman he sees on the street, Charlie carries
            himself as if he's expecting -- even looking forward to -- the
            worst. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Technically,
            Charlie lives inside the film <i>Urbania</i>, Jon Shear's debut
            feature, but metaphorically, he lives inside the City, as idea, as
            legendary place where bad things happen randomly, without logic or
            meaning. Based on Daniel Reitz's play, <i>Urban Folk Tales</i>, the
            film follows Charlie's struggle to make a narrative out of this
            chaos, shifting back and forth between his immediate and remembered
            experiences, interspersed with a series of &quot;urban
            legends,&quot; related to Charlie as stories that really happened.
            These stories provide a notoriously baleful notion of human
            interactions, ranging from the one about the lady who microwaves her
            poor little damp dog to the one where the poor schlub wakes the
            morning after a hot night of anonymous and unprotected sex, to find
            that his date has left a lipsticked message on his mirror:
            &quot;Welcome to the World of AIDS.&quot; Each of these stories
            speaks to some frightening aspect of living in the City, where dark
            alleys intimate certain disaster and strangers on the corner are
            harbingers of doom. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            film doesn't actually come together as a chronology of Charlie's
            recent past until its final frames, when the actual cause and effect
            of his own trauma -- which could be yours -- are revealed (though
            hardly resolved). Until then, the pieces of his disintegrating
            mosaic-self come at you with a kind of spastic stop-and-start speed,
            colliding, missing connections, and overlapping. It appears that
            Charlie is feeling acutely lonely, and that he's recalling his
            boyfriend Chris (Matt Keeslar). Literally, he's calling Chris'
            answering machine from pay phones on the street in order to hear his
            voice and leave rambling, pleading messages. Charlie is also longing
            for a moment from his own life that is forever gone, but somehow
            keeps feeling immediate and urgent, undeniable. He trawls the city,
            looking for experiences and affiliations, however brief, apparently
            tracking a guy he saw once, a guy with a
            snake-twisted-around-a-heart tattoo on his arm, a guy who looks like
            rough trade or worse. <o:p>

            is all about stories, how they're told and how they are received,
            who shares and who withholds, or what anyone might mean by telling a
            story. At a bar where he imagines this snake-tattoo guy will show
            up, Charlie has a chat with the friendly, nonjudgmental bartender
            (Josh Hamilton), who tells him a story by way, ostensibly to
            illustrate that he &quot;hold[s] no objections to human needs.&quot;
            This tale is one of those annoying ego-massaging urban legends, in
            which a woman &quot;in her forties&quot; (i.e., feeling needy and
            unloved) pays an unbelievable amount of money for just one look at
            our bartender's dick. After making a weak joke that he'd pay to see
            that very special penis (an offer that troubles our assertively
            straight bartender, no matter his previous declaration of &quot;no
            objections&quot;), Charlie moves on into the night. He stops by his
            friend Brett's (Alan Cumming) place, and into a scene from the past
            that approximates conventional &quot;gayness,&quot; the kind
            depicted in party scenes in movies like <i>Philadelphia</i> and <i>Broken
            Hearts Club</i>. Charlie can only negotiate this world from a
            distance, via bone-dry sarcasm: it's too much for him to revisit
            this happy past, too much self-reflection and nostalgia. Brett can't
            see Charlie's resistance, but you can. Though Charlie is far gone,
            the movie unapologetically follows him to where he is, doesn't try
            to recover him so that he's more easily understandable, more easily
            consumable. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></span></font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still,
            you glean enough of Charlie's story -- the central through-line of
            his story -- to know that his moments of intimacy are limited as
            means to survival. Even with Brett, with whom he obviously shares a
            history and community, Charlie maintains a brittle distance. By the
            time Charlie does hook up with Ron (Gabriel Olds), a pretty and
            self-absorbed soap opera actor, for a night of something that will
            definitely not be intimate, you're not so surprised to see Charlie
            act out aggressively. It's as if he's looking for a fight, a way to
            gamble with his own increasingly weird urban legend of a life.
            Leaning back on Ron's bed after Ron's told him to get out, Charlie
            dares his host to follow through, jutting his chin and behaving as
            if he's not afraid. But he is. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            strange and compelling as any of these moments (and others) might be
            on their own, <i>Urbania</i>'s real strength lies less in its
            narrative -- or more properly, narratives -- than in its formal
            turbulence, mimicking a journey into and out of someone's mind, a
            journey during which the disparities between past and present, fact
            and fiction become increasingly jarring. Charlie is afraid in the
            way that anyone might be afraid after being subjected to a
            particularly harsh violence, and yet he's also positioning himself
            to reclaim his faith in himself, to refashion himself as a man, a
            virile, angry, and brutal figure of masculine strength and resolve.
            At last, Charlie tracks down the object of what has seemed to be his
            desire throughout the film, that snake-tattoo guy -- whose name is
            Dean (Samuel Ball). But even then, it's hard to tell how the film,
            or Charlie, or your understanding of Charlie, will come together.
            It's hard to know even whether you want him to come togther, since
            that process involves violence and ugliness and becoming part of the
            City that so intrigues and repels him. Charlie and Dean spend an
            evening skulking about in a gay-cruising area, Charlie watching as
            Dean baits men and pulls out his blade so that it's only visible to
            Charlie (and you). The urban legend in which Charlie is lost, the
            one he can't stop and can't control, that's exactly the one that the
            movie won't quite nail down for you. The other stories are ghastly
            and strange, and briefly alarming for that. But they're also
            familiar, whether they really happened or not. This story that's
            coming together and apart in front of you, the one that Charlie
            might be making up as he goes along -- that's the one that's really
            scary. <o:p>
