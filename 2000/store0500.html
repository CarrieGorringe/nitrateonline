            the most unconventional, and comically pungent, films to be showered
            with multiple Oscars (Best Picture, Director, Actor, Original
            Screenplay, and Cinematography) since <i>The Apartment</i> (and the
            winners cited Billy Wilder in some of their acceptance speeches).
            Kevin Spacey plays a husband and father who gets knocked out of the
            resigned doldrums of his existence by the appearance of a beautiful
            girl (Mena Suvari) -- who also happens to be the best friend of his
            estranged teenaged daughter (Thora Birch) -- and the resultant
            reverberations change both his life and everyone around him. With
            exceptional performances by Annette Bening, as Spacey's wife, a
            realtor whose rigorously maintained façade keeps going askew on
            her, and Wes Bentley, as one of the most unusual boys-next-door in
            recent cinema. At this writing the film is available only as a tape
            for rental, and even that can be hard to find at one major chain due
            to an ongoing squabble over royalties.</font><span style="font-size:12.0pt"><o:p>

            review by <a href="../eddie.html">Eddie Cockrell</a></font></i></font>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">When Francis Ford
            Coppola famously predicted an auteurist future in which masterpieces
            would be made by &quot;fat girls from Ohio with camcorders,&quot; he
            might’ve been thinking about <i>American Movie</i>, which wasn’t
            made with a camcorder, in Ohio or by a fat girl but still qualifies
            as an astonishingly frank and ruefully funny record of art by
            accident that serves at once as both a cautionary fable and
            backhanded inspiration to D.I.Y. filmmakers everywhere. &quot;Dude,
            I see great cinema,&quot; is a typical pronouncement from
            motor-mouthed Milwaukeean Mark Borchardt, whose lifelong ambition
            has been to make movies as a ticket to the American Dream.
            Unfortunately, his idealistic energy is matched only by the weary
            yet lovingly tolerant ennui of those around him, from the ancient
            and scatterbrained Uncle Bill (who lends him money) to his best
            friend Mike, a genially inept ex-buddy who turns out to have an
            awesome talent for screaming. As Mark retreats from an ambitious
            feature, called Northwestern, and embarks on a full-court press to
            finish up his previously abandoned horror short Coven, director
            Chris Smith and producer Sarah Price are right there to show his
            transformation from gawky slacker to determined auteur (he even
            enlists his mother to help with eleventh-hour editing chores). One
            local video chain had but a single copy of <i>American Movie</i>,
            which is a pity: this brutally candid, often sad and ultimately very
            American movie should be required viewing for anyone who saw <i>The
            Blair Witch Project</i> and said, &quot;Hey, I can do that!&quot;
            The DVD includes a commentary track from Smith, nearly two dozen
            deleted scenes, interviews with some of the principles, production
            notes and, of course, <i>Coven</i>.</font>

            (Susan Sarandon) and daughter (Natalie Portman) hit the road
            together to find ever more elusive happiness and contentment. This
            film version of Mona Simpson's best-selling novel, directed by Wayne
            Wang from a screenplay by Alvin Sargent, tries to avoid the
            contrived and familiar and ends up finding no particular style of
            its own. Even Susan Sarandon seems a little stumped at times with
            her habitually flighty character, as if she can't rationalize why
            the woman doesn't just plunk herself down someplace and make
            something out of her life. Natalie Portman, though, gives a
            beautifully-conceived performance as her long-suffering daughter --
            as if, freed from the turkey-truss costuming she had to wear to play
            Queen Amidala for George Lucas, she received a flood of inspiration
            for the role. The VHS is priced to rent (there’s a Spanish
            subtitled edition as well), and the DVD includes a making-of
            featurette.</font></span>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">One of the best
            pictures of 1999, and one of the most surprising: the story is built
            around the premise that people can have life-altering experiences
            when they enter a portal that allows them to be inside the head of
            actor John Malkovich for a short period of time (after which they
            wind up on the side of the New Jersey Turnpike). John Cusack plays a
            frustrated puppeteer who goes to work at an office on the
            thirteenth-and-a-half floor of an office building; Catherine Keener
            (in a classic performance) plays his unobtainable object-of-desire;
            Cameron Diaz, in a career-making performance, plays the puppeteer's
            neglected wife, who at one point finds herself locked in a cage with
            an ailing monkey. John Malkovich also gets to play himself -- he
            gets to go into the portal at one point, too. Unmissable. The
            original- and Spanish-language VHS tapes are priced to rent, and the
            DVD sports various documentaries, interviews and a photo gallery.</font>

            iffy patient well into <i>Bringing Out the Dead</i>, Martin
            Scorsese’s raconteurish descent into nocturnal Hell’s Kitchen on
            board the ambulances that scrape society’s dregs off the streets
            and into the overcrowded and chaotic emergency rooms of New York
            City. Cage could just as well be speaking of the director’s
            success with films set in his hometown, from the crackling immediacy
            of <i>Taxi Driver</i> (1976) and <i>GoodFellas</i> (1990) to the
            dissipated focus of <i>After Hours</i> (1985) and <i>The Age of
            Innocence</i> (1993). Emotional elements of these and other Scorsese
            pictures<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(check out the
            jukebox full of popular songs used to typically sardonic effect)
            lurch out of the darkness like the skells on the street,
            underscoring the episodic approach of the narrative and the giddy
            mix of elements both sacred and profane (like <i>Taxi Driver</i>, <i>Raging
            Bull</i> [1980] and <i>The Last Temptation of Christ</i> [1988,
            newly available as a Criterion Collection DVD], the film was written
            by occasional Scorsese collaborator Paul Schrader -- no stranger
            himself to cinematic grapples between religious and secular issues).
            The movie’s best sequence comes at about the 74-minute mark, as an
            alarmingly dissipated Cage hallucinates the mass saving of the
            infirmed by literally pulling them from the slick cobblestones of a
            deserted backstreet. Yet as a whole the work feels uneven, with the
            absurd charisma of Ving Rhames’ fundamentalist ambulance driver
            nearly cancelled out by Tom Sizemore’s paint-by-numbers psycho
            colleague. Scorsese himself and Queen Latifah voice the dispatchers,
            the former making a firm connection with his psychotic walk-on in <i>Taxi
            Driver</i>. The DVD edition showcases Robert Richardson’s giddy
            camerawork and features some interview material tracing the genesis
            of the project. But don’t count the film out of the Scorsese
            oeuvre: it may look like a lesser work now, but you never know.</font>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Tim Robbins
            tries, and fails, to make a populist epic. Distantly based on a 1983
            screenplay by Orson Welles, about the attempts to stage a Federal
            Theatre Project production of Marc Blitzstein's proletarian musical <i>The
            Cradle Will Rock</i> in New York City during the 1930s, Robbins, in
            his first film since <i>Dead Man Walking</i>, revises and expands
            the scope to include everything from rising Fascism in Italy to
            homelessness, police brutality, and John D. Rockefeller. There's too
            much of everything, and nothing ends up working. The results are
            confusing, gratingly discordant, and sometimes just plain bad, with
            oafishly drawn characters and recurring ideas that are almost
            impossible to watch. Some of the performers stand out nonetheless:
            Emily Watson as an indigent street singer who finds work as a
            stagehand; Cherry Jones, who gives F.T.P. administrator Hallie
            Flanagan a fierce intelligence and concentration; and Hank Azaria,
            who almost makes the film's portrayal of Marc Blitzstein -- nearly
            driven mad by creative obsession, yet inexplicably haunted by the
            specter of Bertold Brecht -- work. As for the rest, approach with
            caution. The VHS tape is priced to rent, and the DVD includes the

            counting the swear words on the soundtrack, Kevin Smith's satire
            turns out to be four-square in favor of religious devotion,
            questioning only attempts to alter the basic premises of the Gospels
            to further individual or popular needs. Matt Damon and Ben Affleck
            play angels who would like to continue hanging-out on Earth for a
            little longer, even if it means wreaking irreversible havoc; Linda
            Fiorentino is a women's clinic worker who finds herself unwittingly
            chosen by Providence to carry-out a mission; and Jason Mewes and
            Smith himself, reprising their roles of Jay of Silent Bob from
            Smith's three previous films, are emissaries called to help her in
            her task (illustrating how anyone, from any walk of life, can find
            themselves capable of carrying out the Lord's work). And, no, I
            didn't have any problems with Alanis Morrisette's casting (when you
            see her plain-but-grave expression in the film, you can see why
            Smith chose her for the role). The Spanish-subtitled and
            English-language VHS tapes are priced to rent, and the DVD edition
            is curiously austere.<o:p>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Although she’s
            only made a handful of high-profile films to date (one of which,
            Woody Allen’s <i>Sweet and Lowdown</i>, garnered her an Oscar
            nomination), Nottingham-born Samantha Morton is among the most
            promising of new actresses, a quiet yet intense presence reminiscent
            of Jane Horrocks, Emily Watson and Rachel Griffiths. In the dreamy,
            moody and somewhat aloof melodrama <i>Dreaming of Joseph Lees</i>,
            she’s a woman in 1958 Somerset (the film was shot on the Isle of
            Man, where <i>Waking Ned Devine</i> was made) who is torn between
            her needy, increasingly self-destructive boyfriend, pig farmer Harry
            (Lee Ross) and the physically scarred second cousin of the title
            (Rupert Graves), for whom she’s carried a silent torch despite his
            long absence working as a geologist in Italy. Frank Finlay, who
            starred alongside the late Oliver Reed in that terrific pair of
            mid-1970s Musketeers films, has a distinctive supporting role as her
            forgetful father, and Lauren Richardson is fine as her precocious
            kid sister. Working from a script by Catherine Linstrum that takes
            an alarming turn towards the lurid in the third act, first-time
            director Eric Styles keeps the film in fine balance, wisely allowing
            Morton’s expressive presence to carry the film. Also worth seeking
            out is Morton’s first major movie, a lacerating 1997 British drama
            called <i>Under the Skin</i>. She’s a brave actress whose apparent
            fearlessness promises work sure to rise above the material, as it
            does in <i>Dreaming of Joseph Lees</i>. At this writing the film is
            available exclusively as a priced-to-rent video.</font>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">All glossy and
            sophisticated in the best tradition of British melodrama, Neil
            Jordan’s remake of the classic 1955 weepie <i>The End of the
            Affair</i> (itself out in a new DVD edition May 16) benefits
            enormously from the luminous, Oscar-nominated performance of
            Julianne Moore, which almost props up another wooden turn by Ralph
            Fiennes and propels the film through it’s time-shifting structure,
            which is less complicated than just plain annoying. Based on a
            semi-autobiographical novel by Graham Greene (<i>The Third Man</i>),
            the movie tells of the pre-World War II affair of the married Sarah
            (Moore) and novelist Maurice (Fiennes), and the five-year aftermath
            of the writer’s increasing bitterness. Full of the minutiae of
            adultery (hotel bars, furtive assignations and the like), the film
            is nevertheless a listless and dour, uh, affair -- particularly
            since the leads have proven track records with sexually frank
            material and Jordan’s best work (<i>The Company of</i> <i>Wolves</i>,
            <i>The Crying Game</i>, <i>The Butcher Boy</i>) proves him a keen
            and inventive storyteller. Yet the provocative issues of faith and
            destiny which arise as the war intrudes on their forbidden love
            never really grab the imagination, and the players come across more
            surly than noble. Ian Hart is good as a private detective, and
            Jordan regular Stephen Rea brings an unreasonably plausible gravity
            to a character conceived as a cuckolded dolt. Costume designer Sandy
            Powell (who won an Oscar for <i>Shakespeare in Love</i>) may be the
            true star of the film, as these conflicted lovers look as good, if
            not better, in their clothes than out of them. In a logical yet
            unique arrangement, the film is available either on the standard VHS
            and feature-packed DVD editions, or as a DVD double feature with
            Edward Dmytryk’s 1955 version -- presented in its original
            widescreen black and white.</font>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The director of <i>The
            Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert</i> would not seem to
            be the likeliest first choice to make a film of Marc Behm's
            fearlessly bleak 1980 novel, about a washed-out, middle-aged
            detective who starts to believe that the young woman whom he's been
            surveilling, and who turns out to be a pathological serial killer,
            may be the daughter from whom he's been separated for years. In
            fact, Stephen Elliott does both a good job of updating the material
            while remaining faithful to elements of the original story --
            although you may need to have read Behm's novel to fully understand
            everything that's going on in the film. Ewan McGregor is too young
            to play the part of the detective -- though he's given him a weary,
            tinged-with-Cockney accent that comes across as a nod to Michael
            Caine's Harry Palmer in the espionage thriller <i>The Ipcress File</i>
            -- but Ashley Judd is just right as the girl, Joanna, capturing the
            alternating menace and pathos of the character in a way that makes
            sense, and k.d. lang does a perfectly fine job playing the
            detective's contact person, with whom he only communicates through
            fiber-optic linkups and satellite communication. Look also for Lizzy
            Gardner, the costume designer who won an Oscar for her work in <i>Priscilla</i>,
            who plays a coffee shop waitress in several scenes in the film. The
            VHS tape is currently priced to rent, and the DVD includes a
            commentary track by Elliott, a making-of featurette and production
            notes.&nbsp;</font>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Atom Egoyan's
            film of the William Trevor novel, about a runaway Irish girl (Elaine
            Cassidy) whose path crosses that of a respectable Birmingham man
            (Bob Hoskins), an institutional chef, who just may or may not also
            prey on young, restless girls. The picture works quite well for
            about nine-tenths of the way -- before it suddenly falls to pieces
            just prior to reaching its conclusion. Definitely have a look at it,
            though, for Hoskins' outstanding performance in a very difficult
            role -- among other things, his character tries to maintain the
            disrupted relationship he had with his mother by playing the
            carefully-stored video tapes made of her old T.V. cooking show. And
            watch for the utterly chilling part where Hoskins, just for a bit,
            acknowledges Egoyan's camera in one scene. The VHS tape is priced to
            rent, and the DVD features Egoyan’s commentary, production notes

            have a tough time sustaining momentum through feature length, even
            if the conceit is as inspired as the one at the heart of <i>Galaxy
            Quest</i>: the actors in a swashbuckling outer space television
            program, long since cancelled, are propelled from shopping mall
            openings to saving the universe when enlisted by a sweet but naïve
            race of aliens to stave off an evil warlord. The film’s big
            surprise -- particularly in light of the extensive and elaborate
            special effect work -- is its almost improvisational feel, a hunch
            buttressed by the DVD edition’s outtakes, which hint at very
            different directions for key sequences. As the Shatneresque captain
            Peter Quincy Taggart (and the egotistical Jason Nesmith, the actor
            who plays him), Tim Allen continues a big-screen career of much
            mugging and little distinction, while Sigourney Weaver does a nice,
            if unacknowledged, spoof of her Ridley character from the Alien
            franchise. Alan Rickman’s character, the unfortunate Shakespearean
            actor who found success wearing a rubber head, has the most
            opportunity for laughs, followed closely by Sam Rockwell as the bit
            player with a not entirely irrational fear of being offed before the
            first commercial. Director Dean Parisot keeps things moving at a
            clip that leaves little time for reflection, which is just as well:
            as ephemeral as the phenomena it spoofs, <i>Galaxy Quest</i> is at
            heart an amiable television program that somehow acquired a largish
            budget and a conspicuous holiday theatrical release. The English and
            Spanish-subtitled VHS tapes are priced to sell and there are two
            separate feature-laden DVD editions.</font>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Until he hooked
            up with screenwriters Scott Alexander and Larry Karaszewski, emigree
            Milos Forman had not made a misstep in a career that began in
            occupied Czechoslovakia with such sublime cultural comedies as <i>Loves
            of a Blonde</i> (1965) <i>Fireman’s Ball</i> (1967), and continued
            in America with the likes of the multi-Oscared triumphs <i>One Flew
            Over the Cuckoo’s Nest</i> (1975) and <i>Amadeus</i> (1984). But
            in both <i>The People vs. Larry Flint</i> (1996) and now <i>Man on
            the Moon</i>, Forman is working with material from the duo that
            profoundly misunderstands the periods in which they’re set and the
            people they’re attempting to portray. So while Woody Harrelson is
            fun to watch as Larry Flynt and Jim Carrey’s impression of bizarre
            comic Andy Kaufman is technically interesting, each film becomes
            lost in a jumble of period set and costume design, lacking any of
            the broadly painted nuance of character and emotional passion so
            fundamental to Forman’s work. That Kaufman’s central theme was
            that there was no there there -- that is, at the core of the comic
            -- is of no help, robbing the film of the illumination that
            presumably attracted the mainstream to the real-life conundrum in
            the first place (cultists could care less whether it was all a
            put-on or not, and are content to keep the mystery alive with a
            blind faith that borders on the messianic). Let’s hope Forman can
            surmount these frustrating misfires and return to the kind of
            intuitive, freewheeling movies upon which his stellar reputation,
            still defiantly intact, continues to rest. As for the dubious duo of
            Alexander and Karaszewski (who, to be fair, also wrote <i>Ed Wood</i>),
            recent evidence suggests the best they can come up with when freed
            from historical misrepresentation is the woeful caper
            &quot;comedy&quot; <i>Screwed</i>. How apt is that? The VHS tape is
            priced to rent, and the DVD is packed with interviews, outtakes,
            commentaries, a documentary on Kaufman and other features.</font>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The first half of
            <i>Mystery, Alaska</i> is as emotionally shrewd and kinetically
            funny as any American film of the year, positing a remote and
            quirky-yet-comfortable American village populated by an amiable
            cross-section of average folk as endearing as anything in the canon
            of Milos Forman or Jiri Menzel. The sweet little village of the
            title, nestled in a spectacular mountain range, is all a-dither over
            the imminent arrival of the New York Rangers, making the trek to
            play the long-standing town team in an exhibition pond hockey match
            being tirelessly flogged by the NHL (the gig was arranged by a
            former resident who left and became a TV producer in the big city).
            Among those affected by the visit are sheriff John Biebe (Russell
            Crowe), Judge Walter Burns (Burt Reynolds), Colm Meaney), and local
            Lothario &quot;Skank&quot; Marden (Ron Eldard). Employing the same
            casting strategy as his other 1999 release, the equally quirky but
            far less satisfying <i>Lake Placid</i>, prolific co-screenwriter
            David E. Kelley (who was the captain of his hockey team at Princeton
            some two decades ago) has massaged the mood by again assembling a
            pleasing mix of television actors, international stars and
            established Hollywood vets. Things flag alarmingly in the second
            half, however, as the game itself supplants the character-driven
            narrative and swamps the good will with sports clichés.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>There’s a strong Canadian seam running through the
            proceedings: a heavily prostheticized Mike Myers does an uncredited
            cameo as a hockey commentator (director Jay Roach helmed the two <i>Austin
            Powers</i> movies), that’s Canadian-born Maury Chaykin as a
            rumpled lawyer, and the film itself was shot in Alberta. The
            newly-released DVD (which follows last October’s VHS edition) is a
            bare-bones affair sporting only a theatrical trailer and paltry
            making-of featurette -- but it does showcase Peter Deming’s
            letterboxed images and Carter Burwell’s evocative music.</font>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The eighteenth
            James Bond film, and Pierce Brosnan's third time out as the
            character, makes an attempt to be a very spruced-up affair, but
            after a while you begin to feel like you've seen everything in it
            before: the chases, shootouts, explosions, odd villains (Robert
            Carlyle, playing a rogue espionage agent who feels no pain, and has
            a bullet in his skull to prove it), even the exotic torture devices.
            The opening chase, though, is a beaut, and Sophie Marceau brings a
            great deal of finesse to what turns out to be a magnificently
            perverse character. Denise Williams received a great deal of
            unnecessary flak as the film's requisite Bond Girl, a nuclear
            physicist named Christmas Jones (it's not her fault that she's
            miscast, but someone like Holly Hunter would have really made
            something out of the role); Judi Dench also returns to the role of
            &quot;M,&quot; and Desmond Llewellyn puts in one final (and
            splendid) appearance as gadget-maestro &quot;Q.&quot; (The director,
            Michael Apted, stages his scenes with an almost tender
            gracefulness.) Available as a sell-through VHS, with Spanish
            subtitles, or as a feature-laden DVD (note: this is not one of the
            five titles in the new James Bond DVD gift set volume two. See <i>On
            Her Majesty’s Secret Service</i>, below).</font>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">One particularly
            gratifying benefit to consumers who never adopted the laserdisc
            habit is the appearance of that favorite title in the DVD format.
            Chief among those movies for fans of a certain age is the 1969
            western <i>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</i>, which emerges in
            a pristine widescreen transfer after a generation of ugly,
            pan-and-scan videotape copies. The pleasures of this disc are many,
            from the still-fresh tones of Conrad Hall’s cinematography (his
            two Oscars are for this and last year’s <i>American Beauty</i>
            [see above, and <i>Visions of Light</i>, below]), to the remarkably
            candid narration of director George Roy Hill in the production
            featurette. The latter packs a particular punch, as viewers slowly
            realize that the director’s commentary, a nice blend of practical
            filmmaking hints, set gossip and techie jargon, was recorded months
            prior to the movie’s theatrical release (&quot;If audiences
            don’t dig it I think I’ll go out of my fucking mind,&quot; he
            concludes with typical candor). Well, the moviegoing public did dig
            it, primarily due to the chemistry between leads Paul Newman and
            Robert Redford, who, along with many of the principles, are seen in
            a mid-1990s documentary remembering the production. And while
            Hill’s gamble to blend traditional western elements with a
            contemporary feel and spin on the fabled tale of the outlaws
            doesn’t always pay off (dig that crazy scat singing during one of
            the montages), the film as a whole fits in snugly with such elegiac
            late-1960s American genre successes as <i>Bonnie and Clyde</i> and <i>The
            Wild Bunch</i> while retaining a certain mainstream whimsy and
            sparkle absent from the general mood of the era.</font>

            dilapidated Quonset huts on an abandoned U.S. Army barracks outside
            the capital city of Reykjavik, three generations of the eccentric
            Tomasson family endure triumph and tragedy in 1950s Iceland as
            American culture -- big cars, rock’n’roll -- invade their lives
            via precocious teenager Baddi (Baltasar Kormakur), who returns from
            a trip to America dressed like Elvis and spouting fragments of song
            lyrics and pop culture slogans. As he did in his acclaimed sophomore
            feature <i>Children of Nature</i> (1991), director Fridrik Thor
            Fridriksson shows clear affection and compassion for disenfranchised
            outsiders and their struggle for dignity and fulfillment.
            &quot;These outsiders,&quot; he has said, &quot;reminded me of my
            favorite film -- <i>Rocco and His</i> <i>Brothers</i> [Luchino
            Visconti, Italy, 1960]. With this film I hope to reveal a hidden
            world that very few people knew existed in Iceland.&quot; It’s
            worked: one of only two Icelandic films produced in it’s year,
            Devil’s Island was seen by nearly a third of the country’s
            inhabitants and has received international festival acclaim
            (including the international critics’ FIPRESCI award at the 1997
            Karlovy Vary festival in the Czech Republic). The beauty of
            Fridriksson’s films comes not only from the rugged landscapes of
            Iceland, but the durability of his characters, individuals who,
            through shrewd planning or at least an inarticulated drive to
            survive, hurtle towards -- and often reach -- a kind of peace. On
            top of his calm, deliberate style in the face of often oafish chaos,
            the joy of <i>Devil’s Island</i> is the journey.</font>

            from the Jackie Chan catalogue to see the light of day in the United
            States is his 1982 period actioner Project A, and it’s one of the
            best: in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, Jackie’s idealistic
            Hong Kong Coast Guard cop Dragon battles corrupt officials and the
            local mob. Joining Jackie is sidekick Sammo Hung (TV’s <i>Martial
            Law</i>) as Fats, looking for all the world like a cross between
            Ringo Starr and John Belushi but matching his real-life pupil stunt
            for stunt. This is the Jackie Chan movie with the terrific bicycle
            chase through narrow alleyways, the clock stunt in direct tribute to
            Harold Lloyd’s 1923 silent classic <i>Safety Last</i> (1923), and,
            of course, those great outtakes under the closing credits. One Jack
            Maeby, who is credited with &quot;English Adaptation and Dialogue
            Direction,&quot; has overseen a skillful and seamless dubbing
            process in which the dialogue is peppered with Americanisms such as
            &quot;say what?,&quot; &quot;figure it out&quot; and &quot;let’s
            do it!,&quot; to the point that one very nearly forgets the movie
            wasn’t shot in English. And while the DVD is a skimpy on the
            extras, it’s great to have a wide-screen transfer (from the
            original Technovision) of the movie many fans consider to be Jackie
            Chan’s best. Newcomers dazzled by <i>Rush Hour</i> and the even
            better <i>Shanghai Noon</i> are encouraged to begin the process of
            catching up with <i>Project A</i>.</font>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The folks at the
            Criterion Collection have done it again, this time with a visually
            stunning and feature-laden edition of Martin Scorsese’s most
            controversial film, <i>The Last Temptation of Christ</i>. It’s
            difficult to imagine the agitation that surrounded the initial 1988
            release of this film, as religious and conservative groups around
            the country refused to watch it yet aggressively picketed the
            theaters in which it opened (in Washington DC, Joe Gibbs, then the
            coach of the Redskins football team, put his name on a flier
            discouraging people from buying a ticket -- while admitting he
            hadn’t seen the movie himself). A faithful realization of the
            Nikos Kazantzakis’ novel on which it is based, the movie preserves
            the rationalist Gnostic reading of Christ’s passion to the extent
            that the decidedly uncharismatic Christ (Willem Dafoe) has sex with
            Mary Magdalene (Barbara Hershey) and is sorely tempted to shuck
            martyrdom in favor of a normal, secular life. Yet it is this very
            temptation, mirrored through the life and passions of Scorsese,
            which charges the film with a zealous urgency. A devout Catholic,
            Scorsese’s career is an all-too-evident struggle between the
            sacred and profane, the lure of the flesh and the calling of
            spirituality himself (see <i>Bringing Out the</i> <i>Dead</i>,
            above). Seen in this light, the film is brave, bold, and ultimately
            uplifting. The extras include commentary from Scorsese, Dafoe,
            screenwriter Paul Schrader and critic Jay Cocks, research materials
            and on-set footage filmed by the director himself, and a Scorsese-approved
            digital transfer with newly-mixed Dolby Digital 5,1 channel
            soundtrack. Those blind to the struggles of contemporary artists
            might not be swayed by all this (wonder if Gibbs even has a DVD
            player), but future generations now have the tools with which to
            make an informed, ultimately personal decision.</font></p>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The Douglas Sirk
            who made the splendid black and white period thriller <i>Lured</i>
            in 1947 was still some years away from his 1950s success as a
            director of genre-defining melodramas (<i>Magnificent Obsession</i>,
            <i>All That Heaven</i> <i>Allows</i>, <i>Written on the Wind</i>, <i>Imitation
            of Life</i>), and the Lucille Ball who starred in the picture was in
            the midst of an uneasy freelance period following successful
            contract work with RKO and MGM, still four years away from the
            creation of <i>I Love Lucy</i> for that new, smaller screen in an
            increasing number of American living rooms. Thus, while <i>Lured</i>
            itself can’t approach the more high-profile work of either artist,
            it remains remarkably fresh today and fairly leaps from the screen
            in Kino Video’s new exclusive-to-DVD transfer (joining the 1951
            Technicolor drama <i>Pandora and the Flying Dutchman</i> [see below]
            under the banner &quot;Hollywood’s Leading Ladies&quot;). In
            turn-of-the-century London, feisty young American &quot;taxi
            dancer&quot; Sandra Carpenter (Ball) is enlisted in the search for a
            killer whose calling cards include bizarre poems inspired by
            Baudelaire (the film is a remake of Robert Siodmak’s 1939 French
            production <i>Pièges</i> [<i>Snares</i>]). The meticulous
            production and costume design -- a Sirk hallmark -- give the film a
            palpable immediacy, while the mix of melodrama and thriller creates
            a uniquely effective mood supported by the intense performances of
            smooth George Sanders, fatherly Charles Coburn and crazed clothier
            Boris Karloff (the supporting cast is stuffed with vaguely
            recognizable character vets). A satisfying glimpse into Sirk’s
            transition from European styling to American stories, <i>Lured</i>
            is a splendid example of post-war studio filmmaking for the beginner
            and a critical footnote for the Sirk and/or Ball enthusiast. Kino
            promises Sirk’s previous film, <i>A Scandal in Paris</i> (VHS
            only) June 6.</font>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Let us now praise
            George Lazenby. Lost in the shuffle once again, this time amidst the
            hubbub surrounding the DVD release of the James Bond Giftset Volume
            2 (they’re available individually and, sans extras, on tape as
            well), this pristine new transfer of the eternally misunderstood <i>On
            Her Majesty’s Secret Service</i>, one of the five discs in the
            box, makes a fresh case for the man who stepped into Sean
            Connery’s shoes (&quot;this never happened to the other guy,&quot;
            is Lazenby’s self-deprecating introductory bon mot). And a
            persuasive case it is: not only is this the Bond film with Telly
            Savalas as Ernst Stavro Blofeld, the tremendous ski chase through
            the Alps and that car stunt on the ice rink (director Peter Hunt
            pulled the bulk of his crew from the recently wrapped <i>Chitty
            Chitty Bang Bang</i>), this is the movie where Bond marries, then
            loses, the love of his life (Diana Rigg, then in the midst of her
            fame following her stint in <i>The Avengers</i>). From all
            appearances the David Duchovny of his day, the Australian Lazenby, a
            model with acting ambitions but only a few television commercials on
            his resume, was coached on everything from fake fisticuffs to the
            reigning in his down-under swagger. The resulting performance brings
            a new rawness to Bond’s legendary suavity, a tension that suits
            the character well but remained elusive after Lazenby’s departure
            until Timothy Dalton’s two-film stint in the role (Connery’s
            immediate post-Lazenby return in 1971’s <i>Diamonds Are</i> <i>Forever</i>
            isn’t yet available on DVD and is out of print on VHS). The
            copious extras on <i>Majesty’s</i> disc include a detail-packed
            forty-three-minute Patrick Macnee-narrated production featurette, a
            tribute to the late Desmond Llewelyn’s Q (both expertly directed
            by John Cork and written by Bruce Scivally), and an eight-page
            booklet that should be the model for every DVD package that dares
            calls itself special. Bond never happened to Lazenby again, but his
            one stint in the super agent's shoes remains a unique in this
            durable series.</font>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The extraordinary
            Technicolor location photography of Jack Cardiff (three years
            removed from his Oscar for the gorgeous Michael Powell/Emeric
            Pressburger collaboration <i>Black Narcissus</i>) is among the many
            joys of <i>Pandora and the Flying Dutchman</i>, a vivid and romantic
            adaptation of the legend that tells of a mysterious sea captain
            (James Mason) cursed to roam until he finds a woman whose love is so
            strong she’ll die for him -- in this case nightclub singer Pandora
            Reynolds, whose life in the Mediterranean coastal port of Costa
            Brava is disrupted by the arrival of the seaman. Although not as
            well known in the pantheon of Hollywood studio directors, Albert
            Lewin produced and directed a series of stylized romances that
            include <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> (1945) and <i>The Private
            Affairs of Bel Ami </i>(1947). While the rap on him has always been
            his pretentiousness, Lewin can be appreciated for the often stylized
            performances he coaxed from his actors and a flamboyant and often
            surreal eye for composition and camera movement. With this in mind, <i>Pandora</i>
            actually feeds off of its own self-consciousness, building towards a
            torrid climax in perfect sync with the absurdity of its story
            (it’s a bit reminiscent of Anthony Minghella’s recent misfire <i>The
            Talented Mr. Ripley</i>). And Kino Video is to be applauded for
            offering up a first-rate transfer that preserves the sunset hues of
            Cardiff’s palette, a remarkable example of a now-extinct filming
            process in which artificial gloss was all.</font>

            exuberantly surreal than it did when first unleashed on an
            unsuspecting public, Pee-wee’s Big Adventure remains among the
            most unsung Hollywood releases of the 1980s, presenting as it did
            the raw and uncategorizable talents of both director Tim Burton and
            star Paul Reubens in a cross-genre riot of character-driven
            goofiness. Sort of a candy-coated spin on the neorealist touchstone <i>The
            Bicycle Thief</i> (with which it makes a great double bill,
            incidentally), the movie tells of Pee-wee’s indefatigable search
            for his beloved two-wheeled conveyance. The journey takes him from
            the Alamo in Texas (clearing up confusion over the existence of a
            basement) to a roadside biker bar (and the impromptu
            &quot;Tequila&quot; dance) to a Hollywood backlot wonderland that
            features not only a brief glimpse of the original Batmobile but the
            spectacle of James Brolin deadpanning &quot;I know you are. But what
            am I?&quot; Warner’s letterboxed DVD is a joy to behold, massaging
            Victor J. Kemper’s images to a neon sheen and enhancing the
            package with numerous deleted scenes, production notes, a dedicated
            music track (with an accompanying track featuring composer Danny
            Elfman) and among the warmest and most whacked-out commentary tracks
            in recent memory, a low-key skip down memory lane during which the
            soft-spoken Reubens and the giggly Burton speculate on the fates of
            those one-of-a-kind props, compare notes on the movie’s rocky
            gestation and, in the case of Reubens, shed light on the
            contributions of the legendary Groundlings comedy troupe (whose
            members include co-scripter Phil Hartman, seen briefly as a reporter
            near the end). &quot;I wonder what the Warner Brothers executives
            thought when they saw this?&quot; asks Burton in one of a multitude
            of queries he poses throughout the commentary track (another sample:
            &quot;I wonder if Speck is still alive?), and, from the perspective
            of a decade and a half, the answer might well be &quot;the future of
            American comedy.&quot; &quot;I never had so much fun shooting
            anything,&quot; says Burton wistfully, and it shows.</font>

            of 1999 Cesars (the French Oscar) for Best Cinematography (Eric
            Gaultier), Supporting Actress (Dominique Blanc) and Director
            (Patrice Chéreau), <i>Those Who Love Me Can Take the Train</i> is
            an exhilarating blend of epic emotions and stuttery style, melding
            the two into a journey to love set against the pilgrimage of a group
            of friends from urban Paris to far-flung Limoges for the funeral of
            flamboyant painter Jean-Baptiste (Jean-Louis Trintignant). As the
            train hurtles towards its destination, the lives of the mourners
            become increasingly complicated, as the powerful hold exerted over
            them by the dead artist manifests itself in myriad ways. Correctly
            described by one New York critic as &quot;a gay, more operatic <i>Rules</i>
            <i>of the Game</i>,&quot; the film thrums with the nervous energy of
            modern life while at the same time reveling in the quirks and sexual
            gamesmanship of groups united in a single goal. Kino Video’s
            letterboxed edition (both VHS and DVD are available) preserves
            Gaultier’s meticulous camerawork, underscoring the intuitive grasp
            of cinema as art form that Chéreau brings to his work in opera and
            theater.</font></span>

            new to the DVD format or already groaning under the weight of discs,
            the collector’s library is incomplete without <i>Visions of Light</i>.
            This tremendously informative documentary on the history of
            cinematography uses exquisitely preserved film clips (each in its
            proper aspect ratio) to explore and illustrate the development of,
            and philosophy behind, the last century’s most celebrated art
            form. From the earliest pioneers, who usually thought of their work
            as simply &quot;a job, a craft,&quot; through the breathtaking and
            passionate contemporary achievements of Conrad Hall (<i>In Cold
            Blood</i>, <i>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</i>, <i>American
            Beauty</i>), Gordon Willis (who earned the nickname &quot;Prince of
            Darkness&quot; for his work on the <i>Godfather</i> trilogy),
            Vittorio Storaro (<i>The Conformist</i>, <i>Apocalypse Now</i>, <i>The
            Last Emperor</i>) as well as numerous other masters, the movie
            pieces together the different approaches and results of a veritable
            who’s who of cinematography. The candor of these men (yes, a few
            women are glimpsed as well) springs from the probing interviews
            conducted by Variety Chief Film Critic Todd McCarthy, who wrote and
            directed the film as part of a team with producer Stuart Samuels and
            editor Arnold Glassman. The film was produced in 1992 by The
            American Film Institute and the Japan Broadcasting Corporation
            (NHK), and remains to this day among the most dignified historical
            assessments from the former organization (now apparently committed
            to moving videotapes off shelves with their glibly subjective series
            of <i>100 Years</i> promotional TV specials and merchandising
            tie-ins). Buyer beware: block out plenty of time to revisit the
            movies glimpsed here, and prepare to add to the weight of that
            burgeoning DVD collection.</font></span>
