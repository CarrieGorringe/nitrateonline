            the verge of the World Series between the Amazing Mets and their
            cross-town rivals, the Yankees, the boroughs of Queens and The Bronx
            have their own backyard heroes and all New York City is shouting,
            fully aware that when the last out is made, the Big Apple will have
            professional baseball’s bragging rights, win or lose. But the city
            already has a world-class winner in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Two Family House</i> and a lovable loser in Buddy Visalo, a perpetual
            dreamer stepping up to the plate in Raymond DeFelitta’s poignant
            grand slam story of ambitions lost and gained among ethnic outcasts
            of 1956 Staten Island. It’s been that same forty-four years since
            New York had its last Subway Series, back when Italian-Americans and
            Irish immigrants were having their own battles in this forgotten
            borough. The writer-director’s romantic flashback to the decade
            before then-Richmond County would boast longest-in-the-world honors
            with the Verrazano Narrows Bridge, he brings together lovers in
            search of the American Dream, heartwarming us with a tale of desire
            spanning two floors in a dilapidated house, where an open window
            might have offered its inhabitants a hint of the crowd’s roars
            wafting over from Brooklyn’s Ebbets Field. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Two
            Family House</i> has little to do with baseball (and with the way
            sports pictures are performing at the box office, that’s a plus),
            although there are angry bats in the hands of those with little
            racist minds that Buddy needs to tame.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            World Series is actually two seasons away when we first meet Buddy
            in the Spring of 1956. His wife and in-laws have already shackled
            his career as a entertainer, when Arthur Godfrey spotted him in the
            aftermath of World War II and offered him fame and fortune. Instead
            he’s stuck with his wife, her parents, ten years of Perry Como,
            and a dead-end job in a baked goods factory, while someone else
            (Julius LaRosa) got the singing gig. For Buddy, life is just a
            string of missed opportunities: a limousine service with no
            customers, a house-painting business that succumbs to the wallpaper
            design sensation, and a disastrous pizza-delivery stint years ahead
            of its time. All his earnest dreams turn to nightmares until he
            moves, with his reluctant wife Estelle, into a broken-down home that
            he envisions as home and hearth to a prosperous downstairs tavern.
            But through the quirks of the city’s antiquated tax and housing
            laws, upstairs resident Mary O’Neary, a pregnant young Irish woman
            fresh off the boat, and her abusive, alcoholic husband Jim, are
            proving tough nuts. And when a handful of Buddy’s wise-cracking
            Rheingold-guzzling friends decide to take an intolerable swing at
            intimidating the Irish, Buddy has a change of heart. A very strong
            change.<o:p>

            Jaffe and Georgianne Walken are the casting directors for the film
            and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Sopranos</i>, and
            although <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Two Family House</i>
            doesn’t feature any wiseguys, there are quite a few familiar faces
            that one might call this <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Sopranos
            Lite</i>. </font></span><font face="Verdana" size="2">Michael
            Rispoli, Katherine Narducci, Vincent Pastore, and Sharon Angela all
            switch over from the celebrated HBO series to offer fine
            performances. Rispoli is especially effective with the lead,
            twisting his imperfect character (who buys a toy gun for Mary’s
            child) through emotionally charged moments and ultimate personal
            triumph, while Narducci packs a nice wallop as his heartless wife, a
            vengeful gorgon who retreats to the bosom of her equally
            unenlightened parents. As the evicted couple, Kevin Conway gives a
            marvelous, albeit stereotyped, spin as the ever-drunken Irishman
            with a dash of unexpected aggressiveness, with Kelly MacDonald (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Trainspotting</i>)
            glowing as his proud Catholic wife (with a brief lapse or two)
            struggling against double ostracism.<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Filmmaker
            Raymond DeFelitta seems to have an affinity for New York and the
            1950s. His Oscar-nominated short <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Bronx
            Cheers</i> covers similar themes (post-WWII dreams), while his <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Café Society</i> (1997) is an ode to the real-life Fifties tabloid sex
            scandal at a swank Manhattan watering hole. So he’s back in his
            half-century-old element directing his second feature and making a
            fine go of it. He maneuvers solid performances from his cast and
            paints an often radiant romance of what is perceived as a misguided
            relationship by cynical &quot;friends&quot; that border on being
            card-carrying McCarthyites.<o:p>

            only problem I had, and people not familiar with Frank Whaley and
            the color of his skin won’t consider this all that questionable,
            is his uncredited narration (he starred in DeFelitta’s other
            feature) as the voice of Mary’s grown son.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">DeFelitta’s
            film is a bright little blue-collar morsel (especially the
            production design) in an otherwise nearly forgettable year at the
            movies. He succeeds by sticking with what he does well and offers up
            an intelligent crowd pleaser. Heck, it won a well-deserved award for
            that (the audience award for dramatic feature at Sundance). One
            moment bookmarks the graciousness of the film: Mary’s fortifying
            demeanor calms Buddy on a peaceful afternoon in her sunlit
            apartment, curtains fluttering in an late day breeze while birds
            beckon away the couple’s pretensions. It’s as warm as someone
