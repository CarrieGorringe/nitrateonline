            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Check
            the fabulous pictures of Natasha Lyonne and Clea DuVall in the
            recent cover story for <i>Out</i> magazine. These hip young film
            stars appear to have it all, though not in a traditional sense. To
            promote their participation in <i>But I'm a Cheerleader</i>, one of
            the few plainly lesbian movies to have even limited mainstream
            distribution this year, the magazine's photo spread has them showing
            off new glamorous blond hairstyles and tastefully luscious sexy
            outfits, posing seductively while chatting openly about their
            straightness and whatever deals they've been cutting with Hollywood
            in order to make interesting movies at the same time that they're
            making a living. Ask anyone in the business: this is no small feat. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So
            far, the girls have enjoyed close-to-charmed careers, landing
            respectable-yet-attention-getting start-up roles -- Lyonne in <i>The
            Slums of Beverly Hills</i> and <i>American Pie</i> and DuVall in <i>The
            Faculty</i> and <i>Girl, Interrupted</i> -- and, happily, they're
            demonstrating healthy self-confidence and appropriate lack of
            respect for ancient industry rules for starlets, like &quot;don't
            leave the house without makeup,&quot; or &quot;don't play a
            lesbian.&quot; In fact, they're just fine with their girl-on-girl
            action in <i>Cheerleader</i>; though, according to director Jamie
            Babbit, she agreed to tone down the sex scene via judicious shadows
            and cuts, so they wouldn't have to show too much of their naked
            bodies and still create an erotic and emotional few moments in the
            midst of a lot of campy excess. But what Babbit and her crew
            considered toned down was apparently not so for the MPAA ratings
            board, which famously -- at least in indie film circles -- slapped
            an NC-17 on the picture for its salaciousness. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Compare
            <i>But I'm a Cheerleader</i> to popular R (or even PG-13) rated
            films featuring heterosexual teens having fairly explicit sex with
            each other -- and apple pies -- and it's clear that the fact that it
            was two girls having sex that troubled the ratings people. Truth be
            told, it probably didn't help matters that the movie is a broad
            satire of anti- and ex-gay proselytizing, or that it suggests
            masturbation is a fine thing, that girls not only have desires, but
            can also articulate and act on them without men, or that makes
            ruthless fun of the rigidity of straight culture all around. In
            fact, given ratings troubles endured by other filmmakers, including
            Tamara Jenkins, who made <i>Slums of Beverly Hills</i>, the anxiety
            can be generalized to sexualized independent-minded young girls more
            generally, not only baby dykes. As is illustrated in <i>American Pie</i>'s
            gender-sex categorizing, boys are still encouraged to engage in
            &quot;risky business&quot; and girls are still supposed to wait. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            addition, the movie features a terrific performance by DuVall and a
            refreshing, <i>Citizen Ruth</i>-like fairness in its satirical aim
            (the Christian Right gets theirs, but so do those folks who buy <i>everything</i>
            Rainbow -- cups, curtains, kitchen accessories -- to decorate their
            homes). It's a great thing, then, that <i>But I'm a Cheerleader</i>
            challenges such hoary thinking. However, the film -- written by
            Brian Wayne Peterson and based on a story by Babbit -- also makes it
            points in some graceless, even reductive ways, and so, viewers are
            left with a dilemma: do you support a film with its heart in so many
            of the right places even though it's not consistently excellent as
            art? <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Billed
            -- rather clumsily -- by Lions Gate (who picked up the film after
            New Line dropped it at the last minute) as &quot;A comedy of sexual
            disorientation,&quot; <i>But I'm a Cheerleader</i> begins by
            introducing its titular hero, Megan (Lyonne), a small town high
            school cheerleader, whom you first see wearing her short orange
            skirt, leaping and splitting above the camera in lovely slow motion.
            Her parents (Mink Stole and Bud Cort) have become concerned that
            she's not very interested in kissing her boyfriend, eats vegetarian
            and keeps a Melissa Etheridge poster on her bedroom wall. And so,
            they devise an intervention with the help of camp counselor Mike (RuPaul
            playing a man), and send her off to True Directions, an Exodus-style
            camp where she will learn how to be straight once and for all. At
            the camp, Megan meets Graham (DuVall), also in training to be a good
            wifey, but it's clear from jump that they are meant to be together,
            at least as a way to end the film. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            camp is run by Mary Brown (Cathy Moriarty), a clean-and-tidy freak
            with a son, Rock (Eddie Cibrian), who spends his time raking leaves
            and posing with his chainsaw -- for Jack, who wears a &quot;Straight
            is Great&quot; t-shirt, slamming home the joke -- in tiny little
            short shorts. Mary believe him to be the bastion of straightness,
            and uses him as a model for righteousness when she's teaching her
            charges, teens (among them, <i>What Lies Beneath</i>'s Katharine
            Towne, <i>Heavenly Creatures</i> Melanie Lynskey, Dante Basco, Joel
            Michaely, and Richard Moll) whose self-concerned parents have sent
            them for a month-long regimen that resembles deprogramming. This
            process includes learning to abide by social conventions, like blue
            is for boys and pink for girls (production designer Rachel
            Kamerman's bright color scheme is cartoonish and, after a while,
            pretty ghastly), men chop wood and look at car engines, and girls
            make tea and diaper babies. Needless to say, the kids don't want (or
            need) to be so &quot;healed,&quot; though some have reasons, such as
            Graham, whose wealthy dick of a dad threatens (abetted by her silent
            mom) to cut her off unless she does the straight thing. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            order to survive, Graham is learning to do the closeted thing.
            During the day, she's a darling diaperer, and at night, she leads
            the True Directions inmates on excursions to the local gay bar,
            Cocksuckers. Here the lights are low and the music is loud, and
            everyone can act out. And here you see what the film might have
            been, without the spoofy expansiveness, and that is, a comic
            consideration of first love, namely, between Graham and Megan. Their
            initial attempts to connect are tender, pleasurable, and awkward,
            like any teen romance worth its salt. If only. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            instead, the film leans too hard on its bubble-gummy look and
            non-scary send-ups of homophobes, making everything so huge that no
            one who is phobic might recognize himself in the film. Babbit's
            previous experience -- directing independent shorts, as well as
            episodes of the WB's <i>Popular</i> and MTV's <i>Undressed</i> --
            shows that she has a savvy, combinatory sense of style and politics.
            But <i>Cheerleader</i> doesn't tap into either of those strengths.
            Its most appreciative audience will likely be the converted (the
            film has been selected to close the gay and lesbian film festivals
            in Philadelphia and San Francisco, and appeals to teen girls,
            according to pre-release tests). But the audience who might benefit
            most from watching it either won't see the film or won't see the
            point. They can come away thinking that <i>Cheerleader</i> is retro
            and simplistic, that its concerns don't apply to their
            neighborhoods, but instead, those faraway outbacks where depraved
            individuals murder gay people (as in the case of Wyoming's Matthew
            Shepard or West Virginia's Arthur Warren) or the Boy Scouts win
            court cases allowing them to keep out gays out (closeted gays, of
            course, have always been part of the Boy Scouts, as they have the
            U.S. military, but, well, don't get me started). Sadly, the
            caricatures let everyone off the hook, making Megan's and Graham's
            emotional development look trivial because it's so couched in camp
            (though the film doesn't strike me as John-Waters-ish, several
            critics have made the comparison, perhaps because there are so few
            models for combining homosexuality and broad comedy in multiplexes).
            What gets left out of such criticism of the film is the important
            fact that homophobia and strict either-or gendering practices <i>do</i>
            prevail in today's &quot;civilized&quot; cultures, liberal and
            tolerant as they may seem to those who don't have to worry about
            such things. <o:p>
