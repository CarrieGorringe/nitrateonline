<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="5"><b>R</b></font><font size="4">ecently,
I saw Michael Clarke Duncan -- newly Oscar-nominated supporting star of <i>The
Green Mile </i>-- on <i>The Ainsley Harriot Show. </i>The scene was remarkable:
two large bald black men giggling and cavorting with one another on a morning
talk show, talking about their dear and wise mothers, wearing aprons and
shimmying their hips while flipping vegetables in fry pans, in front of an
in-studio audience who looked a lot like the one you might expect for such a
venue and activity: mostly white, youngish to middle-aged women, visibly
delighted with the proceedings. This wasn't Oprah or Roseanne or even Queen
Latifah's kind of daytime television. This was something else. </font><o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Of
course, Michael Clarke Duncan is himself something else. He's as unlike a
regular movie star as he can be. This isn't to say that he doesn't engage in
very regular movie star activities: doing promotional tv stints, riding in
limos, staying in four star hotels, and charging all his expenses on company
plastic. But he's a very unusually happy movie star, a congenial former bouncer
and bodyguard who, as a child, imagined being a football player. He has a
booming laugh and travels on press tours with a small entourage of efficient and
amicable people, whom he treats as friends rather than employees. And he's the
first one to tell you that he can remember not so long ago, when he was worried
about making the rent on his LA apartment. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">He's
doing press these days because of two movies, 1999's <i>Green Mile </i>and this
year's <i>The Whole Nine Yards. </i>In the first, he plays a gentle giant of a
man convicted of murdering two little white girls and sentenced to die, circa
1935. He spends his last days in a small Louisiana prison where he's overseen by
Tom Hanks and other white guards. Blessed with a miraculous healing touch,
Duncan saves some lives (a mouse and the warden's wife), shows remarkable
dignity, generosity, and humility, then dies in the electric chair. His Oscar
nomination has catapulted Duncan to the realm of A-list movie stars, an
exceptional achievement for a guy who's 6'5&quot;&quot; and 315 pounds, that is,
a huge black man, most obviously suited to playing thugs, bodyguards, and
buddies for white guys. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">In
fact, the part Duncan plays in <i>The Whole Nine Yards </i>is one you might
expect him to get: he plays Frankie Figs, amiable sidekick to Bruce Willis's
Jimmy &quot;the Tulip&quot; Tudeski, a former hitman. As the film opens, Jimmy's
turned state's evidence against his former employer, a Polish-born Chicago
gangster named Janni Gogolack (Kevin Pollack, whose jokey accent turns
&quot;Jimmy&quot; into &quot;Yimmy&quot;), and the feds have relocated him to
the Montreal burbs. Eager -- or more precisely, willing -- to fit into his new
environs, Jimmy makes friends with his nerdy-joe neighbor, a dentist named Oz
Oseransky (Matthew Perry). This being a trendy mob-comedy (following in the
footsteps of <i>Analyze This </i>and <i>Mickey Blue Eyes</i>), the situation is
immediately complicated: Oz's bitchy French-Canadian wife Sophie (Roseanna
Arquette) blackmails him into going to Chicago to rat out Jimmy and collect
snitch money from Janni. Once there, Oz falls for Jimmy's gorgeous estranged
wife Cynthia (Natasha Henstridge in Grace Kelly drag), who has access to a $10
million stash: this means that Oz is set on a course to betray his new friend
Jimmy and get into assorted other dangers. The rest of the film involves much
pratfalling (sight gags include Perry smashing into a sliding glass door and
vomiting), with everyone trying to kill everyone else. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">For
all its physical hijinking, the film -- written by Mitchell Kapner and directed
by Jonathan Lynn (<i>My Cousin Vinny</i>) -- is also a romance, but less
screwball than you might guess. The primary relationship is Oz and Jimmy's, a
couple who is clearly mismatched and so, clearly destined to work it out. Their
romance is, of course, ritually interrupted by female competitors for their
affections, namely, Sophie, Cynthia, and Jill (played with pizzazz by Amanda
Peet, she's Oz's dental assistant and Jimmy's number one fan; that is, she's
followed his career and aspires to be a hitperson like him). The women
characters are, sorry to say, predictably routed toward their designated
partners: upwardly mobile Oz wants a classy beauty, set-in-his-ways Jimmy wants
an adoring firecracker, and as for Sophie, well, suffice to say, she pays a
conventional price for her treachery and meanness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The wrench in all this business is Frankie, Jimmy's fellow &quot;Gogo&quot;
crime family employee. Initially, it appears that Frankie might be torn between
loyalties, to Janni and Jimmy (an ambivalence that makes him a threat to our boy
Oz, either way). But this ambiguity is quickly dispelled: Frankie is Jimmy's
boy. And this is the rub, because, given that the film is formulated to pair off
Oz and Jimmy, something must be done with (or to) Frankie; he must be handled.
And that suggests that Frankie's position as the only black man in the middle of
all this white folks business is not simply a function of &quot;colorblind&quot;
casting (whatever that might mean). His blackness makes him stand out, as
different from everyone around him, but also as the buddy in an interracial
buddy dynamic. It's just too bad for Frankie that <i>The Whole Nine Yards </i>is
not, in the end, an interracial buddy movie. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Frankie's
position, in other words, is both awkward and instructive. He's pleasant and
professional, patiently putting up with Oz's ridiculousness and instrumental in
executing Jimmy's sneakiness. Frankie, following Jimmy's lead, appears to like
Oz (or so he says), because the guy is moralistic and well-intentioned (despite
the fact that he sleeps with his friend's wife). And Frankie loves Jimmy
because, well, that's what he's supposed to do. Even aside from the fact that
Duncan and Willis are offscreen friends (Willis picked him for <i>Armageddon </i>and
recommended him for <i>Green Mile</i>), the two hitmen in <i>The Whole Nine
Yards</i> share a history and worldview: some people deserve to die, some have
to die, and some are expendable. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">And
this brings me back to that image of Duncan on <i>The Ainsley Harriot Show, </i>where
he's so obviously affable and eager to please, so unlike the bruiser-bouncer
stereotype that his size and muscle would seem to signify. He's so something
else that <i>The Whole Nine Yards </i>can't -- or won't -- figure out how to
deal with him as something other than a stereotype that might be easily
discarded, not a character you might care for enough to fret over his
evacuation. The film can't -- or won't -- sustain Frankie's relationship with
Jimmy, because its comedy is premised on Oz's standard-issue success, his
marriage, his romance, and Frankie is too other, too &quot;something else.&quot;
The film's inability to imagine another resolution is hardly surprising, but it
is disappointing. <o:p>
