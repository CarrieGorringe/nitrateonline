            Dragons</i>, or <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Vertical Limit</i>.
            All three will have a hard time fighting for the few box office
            dollars likely to be scattered among them, and the holiday shoppers
            will be invading the malls and forgoing the cineplexes in the case
            of these latest wide releases. In the case of Martin Campbell’s
            excruciating rescue effort up the world’s second highest peak, the
            distinguished director of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Mask of Zorro</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Goldeneye</i>
            has tripped and fallen. Even The Clapper™ can't get him up to his
            earlier standards. All that sweeping majestic scenery, terrific
            swooping camerawork, and awesome CGI effects are dashed to the rocks
            below by acting that left me colder than K2 at 24,000 feet. Brrrrr.
            Frozen fingers get pointed, too, at the writers (Terry Hayes and
            co-producer Robert King) for not developing the rag-tag characters
            beyond stick figures in a script weaker than a ten-day-old teabag.<o:p>

            Illustrated</i> covergirl sister (Robin Tunney) are reluctantly
            reunited at a base camp at the foot of the Himalayans. Their
            relationship is lukewarm, their filial baggage heavy, and Annie’s
            eyebrows just a tad too perfect. Enter Elliot Vaughan (Bill Paxton)
            a &quot;bloody good climber&quot; and ugly American entrepreneur, a
            top dollar miscreant -- the friendly Pakistani militia berates the
            industrialist for paying dirty U.S. dollars to ferry Texas BBQ to
            the remote locale at the expense of preciously needed medical
            supplies. Everyone’s aghast that Vaughan is climbing merely as
            part of a promotional stunt his new airline, Majestic Air, but that
            doesn’t disallow their interest in jumping on board if there’s a
            few bucks in it for them. As the race to the top is disastrous;
            fickle computers, weather models (that’s Izabella Scorupco as
            Monique, a shapely French-Canadian medic), and Frosty the
            Snowman’s evil twin conspire to doom the trapped climbers.
            Spanning three separate paths up, a motley band of emotional,
            spiritual, gnarly, and comic types pair off to save what’s left of
            the original team.<o:p>

            Rasputin still mourning the death of his wife years earlier under
            suspicious circumstances. He bears a deep, simmering grudge against
            Vaughn, spends the entire film focusing on some dark revenge, and
            spouts moan-inducing dialogue (&quot;Up there you’re not dying.
            You’re dead.&quot;). For Peter, his partner, one has to wonder if
            this is the best sort of attitude to take on such a daring,
            foolhardy mission. Along for the ascent are the Australian brothers
            Cyril and Malcolm Bench (Steve Le Marquand and Ben Mendelsohn), the
            Cheech and Chong comic relief of mountain-climbing. Monique’s
            there too, for feminine flavor, as is Alexander Siddig (Dr. Bashir

            Campbell to cross-cut his suspense during the last half of the film

            Annie, Vaughn, and the remnants of their expedition; the
            computerized base camp and its concerned downtrodden denizens; the
            three emaciated rescue teams as the rush toward the summit (although
            they all manage to take extended pit stops and tell an anecdote or
            two). Why they are ferrying unstable canisters of nitroglycerine,
            other than to blow something up, is never developed properly. It
            just throws another variable, stolen from <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
