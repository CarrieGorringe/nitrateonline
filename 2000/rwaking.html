<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><b><font size="5">W</font></b><font size="4">aking
the Dead </font></span></i><font size="4"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">opens
with a television image. In 1974, young Fielding Pierce (Billy Crudup) is
watching the news, when he sees that his girlfriend Sarah (Jennifer Connelly)
has been killed in a terrorist car bomb explosion. Fielding watches the TV for
what seems like a long time, while likenesses of Sarah come to him, maybe from
the screen, maybe from photos framed in their apartment, maybe from his head.
You might begin to wonder how much of what's happening is taking place in
Fielding's mind and how much is reality, such as it is. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Co-produced,
directed, and adapted (without credit) by Keith Gordon, <i>Waking the Dead </i>is
all about the scrambling of fantasy and fact, the ways that individual
perspective shapes truth. This scrambling is reflected in the film's structure
-- which in turn reflects its source:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>Scott (<i>Endless Love</i>) Spencer's novel. It's fractured and
eccentric, even difficult. For the most part, the narrative approximates
Fielding's point of view but it also reveals, at times, how characters around
him react to his emotional displays, his assertions that he &quot;sees a dead
person,&quot; namely, Sarah. This is the film's best trick, the way that it
makes you doubt the reality that you've seen on screen, on TV no less, which is,
of course, the most effective gauge of reality that you, well, know. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">From
its opening, the movie jumps ahead to the present -- or the future, as the
film's base time probably isn't fixed, exactly -- 1982, when Fielding is living
in Chicago with his socialite girlfriend Juliet (<i>Kissed</i>'s incredible
Molly Parker), and running for Congress, handpicked by Juliet's mucky muck
uncle, Governor Isaac Green (Hal Holbrook). Born into (straight-white-male, and
photogenic to boot) privilege, Fielding might be fulfilling his destiny when he
enters politics. But he's troubled by the compromises he's making, the hands he
has to shake and the ideals he has to give up in order to &quot;win.&quot; And
then, just when you think the film is going to be another <i>Candidate</i>, it
returns to Fielding's/its weird obsession with Sarah. She's everywhere for
Fielding and so, for you. He begins to think she's not dead, that her death all
those years ago was staged, part of her group's activist scheme at the time.<o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">When
he starts relating his Sarah-sightings, or even more hysterically, worrying that
he hasn't sighted her after all, Fielding provides the movie with a fascinating
representational problem: how do you show a subjective state while not
necessarily judging it to be &quot;real&quot; or &quot;unreal&quot; (or more
pressingly, without assigning it the moral weight usually attached to reality
and unreality)? As a means to introduce such intense and sometimes difficult
subjectivity, the film's opening feels both unusual and right, as this mundane
and impersonal experience -- watching TV -- turns into something specific and
horrific, too intimate, dreadful and romantic at the same time. As <i>Waking the
Dead</i>'s visual register becomes increasingly complicated -- in its
representations of Fielding's experience, with jump-cuts, harsh or confusing
lighting, wide-angle screwy perspective shots, even some images (of Sarah across
a street, of a woman looking a lot like Sarah across the street, recalled by
Fielding's well-intentioned but not-very-interesting sister, played by Oscar
nominee Janet McTeer) -- that seem available only to you and one other
character, the narrative becomes increasingly convoluted. You begin to think
that Fielding is crazy, or more charitably, that he's distraught by his loss, or
even more charitably, that she's a metaphor for his own straggling-behind social
conscience. Her purity -- forever frozen in time -- leads him to want to do the
right thing. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">But
this is too easy. And the movie, for all its sweeping cinematic romanticism and
individuals-do-make-a-difference political optimism, is not really easy. True,
in Fielding's mind and the film's story line, Sarah occasionally reduces to an
emotional cipher and ideological emblem, too pure in her commitment to mores
that Fielding abandons (or never quite understands). But the film's
time-bouncing, often awkward story structure also makes this abstraction more
complex than it sounds: Sarah is, more than anything else, a function of
Fielding's desire, obsession, and really, his self-image. And in this sense,
she's like a TV image, part commercial contrivance, part cultural paradigm: the
Indian-skirted, gauzy-bloused girl who'd sell you some crunchy-granola ideal or
maybe deodorant. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As
<i>Waking the Dead </i>takes you through Sarah and Fielding's early courtship,
their differences look insurmountable and simplistic: he's destined to rule,
she's discouraged by all rulers. They fight after she tells off some fat cat at
a swank party; they fight when he tells off her righteous Chilean sanctuary
coworkers. All right already, you're thinking: they're opposites. And indeed, if
you take this reading too far, it might feel like an ethical or political
cop-out that she dies so tragically, an event that looms gigantically in
Fielding's (and the film's) emotional scheme. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
problem with Sarah as a character is Fielding, or rather, your dicey
relationship to him, is this: you can't trust what he sees, much less what he
says. When he's not moping about his contamination by the political process,
he's acting like a wuss or some corny dreamer. He's not so much corrupt as he is
naive and damaged, and when Sarah comes back as a figure running just ahead of
our hero through the streets, a series of dark-haired girls who look vaguely
like her, or a telephone call late at night that can't be quite real (whatever
that means), she's looking like the return of a major repressed. But she's not
Fielding's psychological repressed (about which you tend not to care so much,
because his dilemmas are so mundane, in movie-land, anyway: he wants to do well,
he wants to win, he wants to please people, he wants to get his life back,
etc.). Instead, she's the return of a cultural and political repressed, and
she's haunting everyone who had (or maintains) some nostalgia for the '60s and
'70s, who lament the Reagan Era and its continuing me-me-me fallout. <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">As
such an idealized vision of a past (that may only have existed in some
participants' minds), Sarah might be better understood <i>as </i>and <i>of</i>
TV, spectacular and quaint, familiar and beguiling. History is preserved and
constructed and rewritten on and as TV: you see it happening daily. This is the
film's greatest insight. It's too bad that <i>Waking the Dead </i>doesn't go the
next step, and see TV's transformation in Fielding and his career, the ways that
TV can do other kinds of good work, communicate feelings, disseminate
information, and create communities, even as it also -- rightfully, too often --
might be criticized for being too simple, commercial, and superficial. And in
all these senses, TV reflects its viewers as much as it does its makers. <o:p>
