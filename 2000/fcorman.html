<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">C<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">orman
and his wife Julie (herself a successful film producer) came to Duke University
recently to host a retrospective celebrating Corman's 50th (yes, 50th!) year in
the &quot;B&quot; movie business.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As
a connoisseur of horrid movies, I couldn't pass up the chance to meet one of the
legends of the genre.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As I made my
way through the chilly night air and into Page Auditorium, I was unsure what to
expect--would Corman be a stuffy auteur, full of resentment for those who didn't
worship his movies?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Would he be a
blathering idiot, blindly convinced (as Wood reportedly was) that he was making
Great Art?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Would he be full of
arrogance over his talent scouting abilities? (Robert De Niro, Jack Nicholson,
Dennis Hopper and director Martin Scorsese all got their start by working with
the celebrated schlockmeister.)</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I<span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">’m
happy to report that Roger Corman is none of these things -- I found him to be
laid-back, articulate, and a perfect gentleman, quick to laugh at himself and
the desperate shooting methods he's famous for employing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Corman loves making movies, and one gets the impression that his
enthusiasm for filmmaking, which remains undiminished even after half a century,
is what allows him to shoot complete films in only a couple of days, often under
adverse weather conditions, with no budget whatsoever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>His drive and eagerness are apparent: he’s been known to shoot entire
movies with only the barest hint of a script, simple because he doesn't wish to
wait for a re-write or draft completion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
hearing him lecture, the thing that strikes me most about his work is not how
bad it is, but how he managed to make movies even <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">this</i>
good while employing such techniques.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">But
say what you will about his unorthodox working methods, the fact remains that
Roger Corman gets the job done.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All
the Corman films I've seen possess a cheerful eagerness to deviate from
Hollywood convention and the slow, expensive shooting methods employed therein.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Lacking the funds to shoot an elaborate car chase, for example, Corman
once filmed a car driving down the same stretch of road multiple times, from
multiple angles, changing the placement of the background scenery with each
shot, to foster the illusion that the car was actually going somewhere.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>This trick gave him enough footage to construct a chase scene in the
editing room.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">That's
not to imply that Corman's work is entirely devoid of merit, however.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>A number of his films, particularly his numerous adaptations of Edgar
Allan Poe's work, have become bona fide cult classics.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Such titles as <i>The Pit and the Pendulum</i> (1961) and <i>The Masque
of the Red Death</i> (1964) show Corman at the height of his skill and
creativity; indeed, Leonard Maltin compared the latter to the work of Ingmar
Bergman.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>It's a high-water mark the director has not reached since,
but one has to admire the enthusiasm with which he keeps trying.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Corman
opened his lecture with a remembrance of his sci-fi monster flick, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">It
Conquered the World</i> (the first of his films to be featured on <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Mystery
Science Theater 3000</i>, incidentally).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
director conveyed the not-entirely-serious atmosphere on the set with an
anecdote: since the monsters in the film were from a large planet (either
Jupiter or Saturn; he couldn't remember which), Corman naturally assumed that
they would be very short creatures, due to the increased gravity exerted by
their homeworld.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Not everyone on
the cast shared this belief, however: Corman laughingly recalled how Beverly
Garland, the film's star, casually walked over and began kicking one of the puny
monsters as a form of protest when Corman showed it to her.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;I immediately called my prop man over and told him I wanted the
monster to be twelve feet tall by one p.m.,&quot; he explained, thereby creating
one of his guiding rules of film: &quot;Always make sure your monster is taller
than your leading lady.&quot;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">The
lecture was preceded by a public reception for Corman at the University Lounge.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Much to my surprise, only twenty or so people showed up to meet him,
despite the fact that the event was well publicized.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The director took it all in stride, however, and chatted pleasantly with
everyone there, mingling with the small but loyal group of fans who'd braved the
chilly temperatures to say hello.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(I
was particularly impressed by the way he made it a point to learn everyone's
name during the conversation.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When
it was my turn to chat with the filmmaker, I couldn't resist the obvious
question:<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<blockquote>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Joe
  Barlow: &quot;So, what's your opinion of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Mystery
  Science Theater 3000</i>?”<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></p>
  <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">RC:
  &quot;Mystery what?&quot;<o:p>
  </o:p>
  </span></font></p>
</blockquote>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">I
described the show for him, and he nodded in recognition almost immediately.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>&quot;Oh, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">that!</i>&quot; he said
with a laugh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;To be honest,
[my opinion is] not that high.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They're
just guys, looking to make a quick buck late at night.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>When I replied that <i>MST3K</i> (as the show is known to its fans) was
the reason I'd discovered his work in the first place, Corman seemed genuinely
intrigued.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Apparently he never
considered the fact that by poking fun at his movies, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">MST3K</i> is in fact helping promote awareness of his work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Hopefully I gave him some food for thought.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Corman
was also kind enough to answer, at significant length, my inquires into the fate
of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Fantastic Four</i> movie he
produced several years back, which, although completed, was indefinitely
shelved.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I've always heard that the
movie was not released because the studio detested the final cut.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Corman neither confirmed nor denied this report during out chat, but he
did mention that &quot;a major studio&quot; is currently developing an $80
million <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Fantastic Four</i> movie of its
own.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Corman's plan, revealed with
an impish wink: &quot;After the new movie comes out, I'll release my film
direct-to-video, as the prequel!&quot;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Roger Corman
will never have the respect of a Spielberg or a Kurosawa, but I'm not sure he
wants it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As he reveals in his
book, <i>How I Made a Hundred Movies in Hollywood and Never Lost a Dime</i>, the
director long ago decided to eschew the studio system and its slow, wasteful
methods of shooting.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He doesn't
seem to want respect so much as the ability to continue making movies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>That's a healthy attitude, worthy of admiration.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
</span>I, for one, wish Mr. Corman another fifty years of happy filmmaking.</span></font></p>
