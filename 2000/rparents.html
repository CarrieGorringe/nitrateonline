            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Because of the
            inherent terror involved in meeting one’s future in-laws, the
            comic possibilities are endless. Somehow director Jay Roach, who’s
            behind the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Austin Powers</i>
            flicks, almost blows it in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Meet
            the Parents</i>. With Ben Stiller and Robert DeNiro in the leads,
            it’s a can’t-miss proposition. But a needless reliance on toilet
            gags almost derails a simple but potent setup.</b></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Stiller stars as
            Greg Focker (it takes no effort to imagine what the writers come up
            with for that surname), a male nurse who’s deeply attached to an
            elementary school teacher named Pam Byrnes (Teri Polo). Greg would
            like to use the long weekend to pop the question to his beloved.
            But, Greg’s affections and his sanity are put to the test when he
            joins her for a trip from Chicago to Upstate New York to meet her
            parents, Jack (DeNiro) and Dina (Blythe Danner).</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The trip begins
            disastrously when the airlines lose Greg’s bag. If that situation
            in itself wasn’t bad enough, the bag contained Pam’s two-carat
            engagement ring. The two of them arrive safely at their destination,
            and Jack and Dina live in a nicely furnished, two-story house.
            Still, something seems wrong. Maybe it’s the way that Jack has
            trained his beloved cat to use the toilet. Another possibility could
            be that Jack almost violently dislikes people who prefer dogs over
            cats. The fellow also writes morbid attempts at poetry and has
            installed an elaborate surveillance system throughout his house.
            Greg’s discomfort mushrooms to the point that he feels compelled
            to lie about himself. This is a stupid move because it increases
            Jack’s suspicions about Greg.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Greg quickly
            discovers that Jack has strong reasons for distrusting anyone, much
            less a potential suitor. Jack’s hair trigger temper and constant
            paranoia arise from spending thirty years as a CIA interrogator. If
            surviving Jack’s third degree weren’t enough, Greg finds himself
            enlisted to help out with the wedding for Pam’s sister and
            enduring the discomfort of hanging out with Pam’s old flame, a
            chronic overachiever named Kevin (Owen Wilson, from <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Shanghai
            Noon</i>).</font></p>
            <font face="Verdana" size="2">Just about all of these factors can
            lead to good nervous chuckles, but Roach and screenwriters James
            Herzfeld and John Hamburg (working from a story by Greg Glienna and
            Mary Ruth Clarke) handle the story with the subtlety of a nuclear
            explosion. There's a lot of choice gags. For example, try to keep a
            straight face as Greg, a Jew who obviously spends little time in the
            synagogue, tries to say grace before a meal. Nonetheless, it’s
            much more fun watching Stiller and DeNiro riffing off each other
            than it is to see a seemingly endless series of sequences devoted to
            a faulty septic tank and its impact on the home. To be fair, some of
            the excess works in spite of itself.;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>the sight of Stiller in a Speedo is hysterical despite the
            actor’s buff physique. As it stands, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Meet
            the Parents</i> is an entertaining comic nightmare, but like most
            bad dreams, it disappears once the lights come up.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
