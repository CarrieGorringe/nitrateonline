            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
            <b>Mel Gibson might as well
            make &quot;vengeance&quot; his middle name. Oh, sure -- fellow
            Aussie beefcake Russell Crowe took an admirable stab at one-upping
            mighty Mel as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Gladiator</i>’s
            justice-seeking hero. But Gibson’s been playing a score settler
            since way back in 1980, when his leather-clad <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Mad
            Max</i> kicked serious biker butt after seeing his family run down
            and killed. Gibson continued this revenge theme with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Lethal
            Weapon</i>’s wild-eyed cop, Martin Riggs, who staggered through
            four films as a jittery crackpot who withstood inhuman torture and
            punishment, only to rise up and crush his tormentors. But why stop
            there? We haven’t even touched on <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Ransom</i>,
            <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Conspiracy Theory</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Braveheart</i>,
            and -- inevitably -- <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Payback</i>,
            all of which featured this deliverer of retribution doing what he
            does best. Indeed, it would be entirely appropriate for Gibson to
            name his production company after the Metallica song, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Damage,
            Inc.</i></b>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The plight of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Patriot</i>’s Redcoat-slashing hero, Benjamin Martin, isn’t much
            different than those of other screwed-over loose cannons he’s
            played, aside from the Revolutionary War acting as a backdrop. The
            story is laced with early-American politics and historical
            flourishes, but at its core, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Patriot</i> is a revenge melodrama... again. Nix the ponytail, and
            Benjamin could be William Wallace, sporting a kilt as he dodges
            Britain’s arrows, or Martin Riggs running down drug smugglers in
            Los Angeles. Same old song and dance? Perhaps. Yet, what a
            sensational jig this Gibson dances! The eyes blaze. The teeth gleam.
            The nostrils flare. With the possible exception of Al Pacino in his
            prime, there’s not another thespian alive that can match this
            commanding star’s fury as he’s downing the enemy with musket,
            sword, and hatchet. It works, so Gibson isn’t about to fix it.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            Patriot </font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">begins with long,
            panoramic scenes of colonial-era South Carolina. Eight of the
            thirteen American colonies have formed militias to fight against the
            invading British armies, and mobs are burning a likeness of King
            George in Charlestown. Meanwhile, an assembly has convened there,
            with Colonial soldiers encouraging locals to establish their own
            military force. Martin, however, rejects the notion. A legendary
            warrior from the French-Indian Wars, this father of seven children
            has his reservations about returning to combat. When a comrade
            questions Martin’s principles, the retort is blunt and assured:
            &quot;I’m a parent. I don’t have the luxury of principles.&quot;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But there’s something bothering
            Martin about the Revolution that extends beyond his paternal concern
            for family safety. The inevitable war is forcing him to re-evaluate
            past deeds and agonize over a colonial
            post-traumatic-stress-disorder. Looking into a rear view mirror with
            an old and wiser eye, this mellowed dad doesn’t like what he sees.
            When one of his sons peruses through an old war chest, finding and
            donning his dad’s military uniform, Martin gives him a
            disapproving glance. &quot;Put it away,&quot; he instructs coldly.
            Later on in the film, we learn the full extent of this man’s past
            wartime deeds. It’s not pretty.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Before long, Redcoats and Colonial
            soldiers are exchanging gunfire outside the Martin homestead, where
            Benjamin is acting the role of pacifist by tending to the wounds of
            both sides from his porch. The reluctant warrior is jolted into
            action, however, when a cruel British colonel named Tavington (Jason
            Isaacs) shackles the eldest of Martin’s sons, Gabriel (Heath
            Ledger), and yanks him off of the family farm to be hanged. As one
            of his younger boys attempts to rescue Gabriel, the remorseless
            colonel shoots him in the back. Following this cold-blooded offense,
            Mel becomes <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Payback Patriot</i>.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Lord, make me fast and
            accurate,&quot; Martin prays before leading two younger sons to a
            swampy crossing and ambushing Gabriel’s captors. It’s a
            horrifying sequence, as the father instructs his prepubescent boys
            to kill on sight and joins them in a bloody, savage rescue involving
            guns and hatchets. The eerie executions, juggling slow motion with
            gritty, up-close battle, echo Michael Mann’s gorgeously gory war
            scenes from <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Last of the
            Mohicans</i>, and Steven Spielberg’s unsparing carnage from <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Saving
            Private Ryan</i>. In subsequent battles, where the stakes are raised
            and thousands of troops charge each other with cannons and musket
            fire, heads and limbs are removed en masse by speeding, metal
            projectiles. As with Gibson’s Academy-Award Winner <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Braveheart</i>,
            <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Patriot</i> is
            distinguished by riveting, realistic, and rousing battle scenes.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meanwhile, there’s more than just
            gore and grue. Robert Rodat’s complex script weaves together a web
            of details that often seem like throwaways until they evolve into
            more crucial plot points later on. And there are surprises. After
            the rescue of Gabriel, for instance, Martin is shocked to hear one
            of the participating sons relishing the memory of his killings.
            &quot;I’m glad I killed them,&quot; the boy proclaims with
            complete conviction. It’s scary to hear the youngster process
            combat not as trauma, but as liberation.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There are clever scenes involving
            Martin’s attempts to recruit militia members, after he’s finally
            committed himself to the Colonial cause. Interrupting a church
            service, his pushy recruiters convince a minister to enlist. &quot;A
            shepherd must tend to his flock,&quot; says the inspired clergyman,
            &quot;and sometimes fight off the wolves.&quot;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">On the downside, there are also
            sappy moments, including a tacked-on romance between Gabriel and a
            peppy romantic interest named Ann: the two mischievous lovebirds
            lace each other’s tea with ink and giggle lovingly with
            black-toothed smiles. By film’s end, this dumb courtship ritual
            has become a tired gag. Equally overstated are <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Patriot</i>’s many, unending scenes of people coming to mutual
            understandings and exchanging knowing glances, while John
            Williams’ feel-good score pounds forth annoyingly. For instance,
            there’s the token African American slave who continues to fight
            with Martin’s troops even after being granted his freedom.
            &quot;It’s a pleasure to serve with you,&quot; offers a white
            soldier when the slave announces; &quot;Now I’m here on my <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">own</i>
            accord.&quot; More knowing glances and soaring strings follow.
            Ho-hum.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ultimately, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Patriot</i> boils down to a confrontation between Martin and
            Tavington, and it’s fortunate that this adversarial relationship
            anchors the movie. Isaacs plays the British Colonel as a fiendish
            monster equal parts Captain Hook, Hannibal Lector, and Sgt. Barnes
            of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Platoon</i>. Wielding a
            crooked sword and painting the battlefield as red as his uniform,
            this mannered, sneering thug isn’t beyond burning a church full of
            worshippers or impaling fresh-faced Colonial recruits just for the
            ugly fun of it. When he lets down his waist-length mane during the
            final bloody battle, Tavington resembles a charismatic rock frontman
            strutting for a crowd. Carnal, cunning, and wicked, Isaacs’
            Tavington is one of the best screen villains of the past decade.&nbsp;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Another star of <i>The Patriot</i>
            is its unlikely director Roland Emmerich. Previously known for such
            all-hype, no-substance formula blockbusters as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Stargate</i>,
            <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Independence Day</i>, and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Godzilla</i>,
            Emmerich has coupled the wide-screen, larger-than-life feel of those
            movies with a personal touch that they lacked. When he gives
            characters time to breathe, as when Martin finally comes clean with
            Gabriel about his French-Indian War past, it’s riveting.
            Emmerich’s association with this ambitious historical epic is also
            an encouraging sign that big-budget filmmakers are willing to get
            beyond aliens and tired, futuristic sci-fi, and dig into the
            archives of history for their projects. Commend <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Saving
            Private Ryan</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Titanic</i>
            for this welcome trend, and embrace a future where the high-tech
            filmmaking of the new millenium brings history into a sharper, more
            colorful focus.</font>
