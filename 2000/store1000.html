<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The great Peter Cushing
stars in this 1969 film produced by Tigon, which attempted to give Hammer Films
a run for their money in the scarefilm genre back in the late Sixties-early
Seventies. Cushing is in his stalwart defender of humanity mode, here, and the
creature who is wantonly terrorizing the countryside this time is supposed to be
some sort of giant moth. This is not really giving very much away, as the film
exists in a giddy state which alternates between torpor and confusion. Robert
Flemyng plays the mysterious research scientist, and Wanda Ventham his equally
mysterious daughter. Previously appeared on video in a grainy version which
looked like it had been tampered with by other hands. The DVD has no additional
features.</font></p>

to continue his research into human transplanting at a secret mountain retreat,
driven and risk-taking surgeon Bill Cortner (Herb Evers) has a fiery road
accident, in which fiancée Jan (Virginia Leith) is accidentally decapitated.
Ever resourceful, he hooks up her noggin to some tubes and wires on a folding
table in his basement laboratory. While the suave doc’s out trolling the local
bars and beauty pageants for a new body (hubba, hubba!), Jan plays mind games
with loquacious and tightly-wrapped assistant Kurt (Leslie Daniel), whose
withered arm is testament to failed transplants thus far. Kurt’s deathly
afraid of a monster in the closet across the room (a by-product of more
experiments gone awry), and, sure enough, when Bill returns with a suitable
victim, Jan coaxes the thing out and all hell breaks loose. Kudos to a
Bloomington, Indiana-based outfit called Synapse Films for restoring <i>The
Brain That Wouldn’t Die</i> to its full cheesy glory, restoring some of the
black-and-white gore to this late night TV staple, which scared horror fans of a
Certain Age witless back in the day but can now be appreciated for the talky yet
creepy genre laff riot it is. Author Bryan Senn’s liner notes document the
struggles of first-time writer-director Joseph Green, whose low-budget triumph
ranks alongside Stuart Gordon’s <i>Re-Animator</i> (1985) as the best
head-in-a-dish movie ever made.</span></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Available
for years via grainy, abridged film prints and tapes, the influential American
independent horror film <i>Carnival of Souls</i> makes a triumphant debut on DVD
via The Criterion Collection. After emerging from the Kansas River three hours
after the car in which she was drag racing hurtled off a bridge, Mary Henry
(Candace Hilligoss) returns to her job at a Lawrenceville organ manufacturer,
only to be offered a position playing in a Salt Lake City church. On her way
there by car, the icy and distant Mary is haunted by the image of "The Man"
(director Harold "Herk" Harvey) a white-faced and wide-eyed apparition who acts
threateningly towards her without actually attacking her. In Salt Lake City she
spurns the advances of housemate John (Sidney Berger) and is drawn inexorably to
a huge abandoned lakeside amusement park, where she is ultimately sucked into a
netherworld of dancing ghouls. The film was shot on location in and around the
spectacular Saltair pavilion (since destroyed by fire), and Harvey’s odd yet
gentle eye combines with John Clifford’s elusive yet solid screenplay to
create a mood that’s been compared to <i>Wild Strawberries</i>-era Ingmar
Bergman and the dreamstates of Jean Cocteau. For the special 2-DVD edition of <i>Carnival
of Souls</i>, Criterion’s outdone themselves, creating a set not so much to be
looked at as lived with. Disc one features a pristine transfer of the
seventy-three-minute theatrical cut of the film; a positively surreal
forty-five-minute block of outtakes and rushes (accompanied by Gene Moore’s
haunting organ score); an illustrated history of Saltair; a locally-produced TV
documentary on the 1989 reunion of the cast and crew (the film was reissued to
some acclaim that year); and a 1999 tour of the Kansas locations. Disc two
includes the director’s cut of the film (restoring five minutes of
non-essential yet interesting footage); printed interviews with Harvey, Clifford
and Hilligoss; and, as a crowning jewel, an hour of excerpts from films produced
by Centron Corporation, the Kansas-based industrial and educational film company
for which the director and writer worked for over three decades (and which are
alone worth the price of admission).</span></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">In an
immaculately creepy 1980s Toronto, twin brothers Elliot and Beverly Mantle
(Jeremy Irons) let their gynecological practice slip away as they compete for
the love of flaky actress Claire (Genevieve Bujold) and sink slowly into an
abyss of pills and jealousy. David Cronenberg’s adaptation of the book "Twins"
by Bari Wood and Jack Geasland (itself based on a true story) is at once cold
and seductive, a fascinating game of cat and mouse between bipolar doppelgangers
that is finally suffocated by its own fascination with technology and formalism.
Irons’ performance(s?) as the aggressive Elliot and timid Beverly is/are
spectacular, convincing the viewer within moments that two people occupy the
same frame. Criterion’s DVD edition (which is apparently becoming somewhat of
a rarity in the marketplace) is a pristine digital transfer, featuring the
electronic press kit, demonstrations of the "twinning" effects, a still gallery
of the bizarre instruments and commentary from Cronenberg, Irons, editor Ronald
Sanders, production designer Carol Spiers and Suschitzky (whose extensive genre
credits<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>include <i>The Rocky Horror
Picture Show</i>, <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i>, <i>Krull</i>, <i>Naked Lunch</i>,
<i>Crash</i> and <i>Mars Attacks!</i>). Although not issued by Criterion, a new
DVD edition of Cronenberg’s <i>The Dead Zone</i> (from the novel by Stephen
King) was released September 19.</span></o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Variety
called it "the strangest film ever offered for theatrical release," while
Preston Sturges assessed it "a work of art," hastening to add that "it stirred
my blood and purged my libido." Walter Winchell urged moviegoers to "take the
kids! (the ones you want to get rid of)," while the normally staid French <b><i>cinéaste</i></b>
journal <i>Cahiers du Cinéma</i> concluded "to what degree this film is a work
of art, we are not certain but, in any case, it is strong stuff." "It" is the
long-unseen 1953 psychoshocker <i>Dementia</i>, and if one can conceive of a
world where avant-garde filmmaker Maya Deren (<i>Meshes of the Afternoon</i>)
had directed <i>Touch of Evil</i> then one would be in the right ballpark. A
young woman, "The Gamin" (Adrienne Barrett, writer-producer-director John
Parker’s secretary) wanders a mysterious urban netherworld—actually the same
Venice, California main drag where Orson Welles would later shoot the
aforementioned <i>Touch of Evil</i> -- tortured by an overweight man (Bruno Ve
Sota, looking a lot like Welles) and her own bizarre thoughts. George
Antheil’s music features the atmospheric wailings of Marni Nixon (then-wife of
music director Ernest Gold), who later dubbed, among others, Audrey Hepburn’s
singing voice in <i>My Fair Lady</i>. Rejected by censors no fewer than ten
times, the <i>Dementia</i> was trimmed slightly and subsequently released with a
ghoulish, meaningless voiceover narration by a young Ed McMahon; Kino Video’s
new edition pairs the two versions with exhaustive background information in a
remarkably stylish collection, considering this source material couldn’t have
been stored very well to begin with. A bonafide curio in the history of the
horror genre, the fifty-seven-minute <i>Dementia</i> is an ideal choice to have
on a monitor in the background of that swingin’ Halloween party.</span></o:p>

for Frankenstein</i>, the single-minded baron (Udo Kier) conducts experiments in
his hangar-like basement laboratory while the frustrated baroness (Monique van
Vooren) entertains a New Yawk-accented shepherd (Warhol mainstay Joe Dallesandro)
in her parlor. <i>Blood For Dracula</i> finds Kier as the Count -- surrounded by
much of the same cast -- wandering the countryside in search of virgin blood.
Yes, those are directors Vittorio de Sica and Roman Polanski in the latter title
as, respectively, an aristocrat and peasant. At once shallow and hypnotic, Paul
Morrissey’s pair of Hollywood genre spoofs combine ineptly enthusiastic acting
with often very funny tongue-in-cheek situations, larded over with lush
production values and turgid, repetitive orchestral scores by Claudio Gizzi that
are quite funny in and of themselves. The remarkably good special effects are by
Carlo Rambaldi, who went on to create the alien being in Andrzej Zulawski’s <i>Possession</i>
(see below) and the much cuter title traveler in <i>E.T.</i> Although billed
initially as &quot;Andy Warhol presents…,&quot; there have been theories
floated over the years that both movies were directed not by Morrissey (a Warhol
disciple) but by Antonio Margheriti, who under the name Anthony Dawson directed
1984’s <i>Code Name: Wild Geese</i> and others. Criterion’s editions are the
complete letterboxed versions, each with commentaries by Morrissey and Kier.
Both <i>Flesh</i> and <i>Blood</i> were first released in 3-D, which explains
some otherwise odd blocking choices and camera placements.</span></font></p>

technically accomplished yet dramatically manipulative imitation of the already
clichéd Steven Spielberg-helmed big lizard movies on which many of its key
personnel toiled (and for which special effects-whiz-turned director Michael
Lantieri won an Oscar), <i>Komodo</i> is a good example of the modern B picture,
a good-looking yet cheaply produced and relatively humorless <i>Jurassic Park</i>
knockoff for the undiscriminating video (or DVD) hound. Jill Hennessey stars as
a psychologist who accompanies a traumatized young man (Kevin Zegers) back to
the island where the title dragons ate his family, only to find a whole mess of
‘em ravenous from the lack of food due to a rapacious oil company. Shot in
Australia, the film’s general level of concentration can be summed up by the
lack of accuracy in the story: the DVD case says it takes place off the coast of
Florida, a title card on the print says North Carolina, and one of the producers
in the production featurette says South Carolina. No matter, for the real stars
of the picture are the dragons themselves, a cross between Phil Tippett
animatronic creations and computer imagery that slither and drool and are
lightning-fast when the story calls for it and slow as molasses when a principal
cast member is endangered. As glossy as the finished product is, at some point
the astute viewer will wonder, &quot;she left <i>Law and Order</i> for
this?&quot;</span>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Winner of the Special Jury Prize at the 1965
Cannes Film Festival (though passed over for the next year’s Foreign Film
Oscar in favor of Czechoslovkia’s <i>The Shop on Main Street</i>) , <i>Kwaidan</i>
is a meticulous, gorgeous and spellbinding realization of four traditional
Japanese ghost stories from the writings of Greek-Irish author Lafcadio Hearn,
who became a naturalized Japanese citizen in 1895 and changed his name to Yakumo
Koizumi. Its director, Masaki Kobayashi, told an interviewer at the time that he
was after an &quot;exploration of formal beauty… [my] main intention in the
film was to explore the juxtaposition between man’s material nature and his
spiritual nature, the realm of dream and aspiration… I also enjoyed conveying
the sheer beauty of traditional Japan.&quot; Kobayashi’s first color film in a
successful career begun in 1952, the ultra-stylized <i>Kwaidan </i>was filmed
slowly and deliberately (sometimes only three finished shots a day) entirely on
sets constructed in an abandoned airplane hangar and painted by the director
himself. In &quot;Black Hair,&quot; a fickle samurai receives a comeuppance,
while &quot;The Woman of the Snow&quot; tells a cautionary tale of secrets and
fate. Most critics agree the third segment is the keeper, a gory tale of singing
and ghosts called &quot;Hoichi the Earless.&quot; The film concludes with a
story about stories,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;In a Cup
of Tea.&quot; Again, The Criterion Collection has performed an invaluable
service to the collector, presenting a widescreen digital transfer from original
35mm material with new English subtitles. Breathtaking packaging of a
breathtaking film. On a related subject, the great Toru Takemitsu’s score for <i>Kwaidan</i>
is available on CD, although actually locating a copy may take some effort.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The
vampire legend gets a novel twist in <i>Martin</i>, which stands today as
writer-director George A. Romero’s best movie without a zombie in it (and that
includes the upcoming <i>Bruiser</i>). The title teenager, played by John Amplas,
has the killing of pretty young women and the drinking of their blood down to a
science, complete with a travel bag that includes lock picks and syringes. But
when he moves to Pittsburgh to live with his uncle Cuda (Lincoln Maazel) and
cousin Christina, his lifestyle is put to the test: is Martin a real vampire or
just a very sick young man? Still a year away from his masterpiece to date, the
incredible <i>Dawn of the Dead</i>, Romero exhibits much of the same eye for
detail and rhythmic on which that classic relies. Anchor Bay’s full-frame DVD
edition (it looks to have been shot that way) includes a trailer and commentary
track featuring Romero, Amplas and Savini (working with the director for the
first time and making his screen debut in a small role).</span></font></p>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt"><font face="Verdana">Far
from what one critic describes as &quot;the first snuff film we’d seen,&quot;
Michael Powell’s bold and chilling <i>Peeping Tom</i> -- certainly the most
pure work of cinematic art on this list -- destroyed the director’s
illustrious career when first released three months prior to Alfred
Hitchcock’s <i>Psycho</i> but stands today as among the most fearless and
perceptive psychological horror rides ever filmed. Cameraman Mark Lewis (Carl
Boehm) stalks and kills women, filming them at the moment of their death. As
sweetly naïve Anna Massey slowly uncovers his secret, she learns that his
behavior was the result of treatment by his doctor father (played by Powell and
real-life son Columba in Mark’s supposed home movie footage) on the nature and
meaning of fear in children. Criterion’s excellent DVD issue, struck with some
additional tweaking off their 1994 laserdisc restoration, includes an audio
commentary by filmmaker and theorist Laura Mulvey (reprinted in the meticulous
liner notes) and the original theatrical trailer. But the real value-added
attraction is the inclusion of Christopher Rodley’s probing and respectfully
whimsical 1997 British television documentary <i>A Very British Psycho</i>,
narrated by Saskia Reeves, that profiles World War II coding
whiz-turned-screenwriter Leo Marks and the gestation, making and aftermath of <i>Peeping
Tom</i> in the British film industry. Highlights include Marks’ remembrance of
the first press show (&quot;critics saw the film mid-morning…some of them were
sober&quot;) and an interview with the now-grown Columba, who can’t seem to
face the camera and dismisses the furor by saying &quot;it’s only a movie,
isn’t it?&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Featuring
appearances by Boehm and Massey cleverly juxtaposed into clips from the film,
it’s among the better behind-the-scenes documentaries yet made. <i>Peeping Tom</i>
is a must for any serious film collection.</font></span></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In an early 1980s Cold War Berlin both spotless
and seemingly deserted, married couple Anna (Isabelle Adjani) and Mark (Sam
Neill), in the throes of a messy breakup, sink further into psychosexual madness
when he discovers that her affair with tanned fop Heinrich (Heinz Bennent) is
really a cover for regular liaisons in a deserted Kreuzberg flat with a
blood-soaked alien. There’s nothing quite like Andrzej Zulawski’s gory,
overheated and -- believe it or not -- faintly autobiographical cult item (just
listen to his illuminating commentary), yet the <i>Possession </i>seen in
America has always been a pale reflection of itself, more of a glimpse of a
movie than a movie proper. Anchor Bay’s stunning DVD edition of this cult
curio restores nearly forty-five minutes to the truncated and radically
re-edited version released stateside, clearing up much of the narrative
murkiness, fleshing out the astonishingly bold performances of the two leads and
giving the image a clarity unseen at any point in its troubled, stormy life
(Michael Feisher’s sleeve notes chart some of the before-and-after edits).
Bennent, whose son David played the lead in Volker Schlondorff’s Oscar-winning
<i>The Tin Drum</i>, comes across like a crazed Anthony Hopkins, while Margit
Carstensen (a regular in Rainer Werner Fassbinder’s stock company) plays a
friend of Anna’s who meets an untimely end. While not for all tastes (fair
warning about the electric knife and subway corridor scenes), <i>Possession</i>
is strong and uncategorizable stuff.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The third in the series of three-tape box sets
celebrating, uh, some sort of &quot;Year of the Simpsons&quot; promotion, this
collection is not -- repeat, not -- a compendium of the much-anticipated annual
&quot;Treehouse of Horror&quot; episodes aired each Halloween. Having said that,
tape one has the <i>Treehouse of Horror III</i> episode from 1992 (&quot;A Clown
without Pity, &quot;King Homer,&quot; and the great George Romero tribute
&quot;Dial ‘Z’ for Zombies&quot;) and <i>ToH V</i> from 1994, the one with
that spoof of <i>The Shining</i> called &quot;The Shinning&quot; (&quot;shhh,
you want to get sued?&quot; someone says). Tape two has &quot;Black
Widower&quot; and &quot;Cape Feare,&quot; both featuring the sinister antics of
&quot;Sideshow Bob&quot; Terwilliger (voiced by Kelsey Grammer). Tape three
includes &quot;Bart Sells His Soul&quot; (the one where he tricks the church
organist into performing Iron Butterfly’s &quot;In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida&quot;) and
&quot;Lisa the Skeptic&quot; (she finds the angel fossil). Dubious choices
aside, other than the pinpoint social satire of each and every episode, much of
the fun comes from being able to freeze-frame every minute or two to catch the
visual pun or verbal aside. At the front of each tape is a two-minute compendium
of the opening credit &quot;couch gags&quot; that manages to slip in another
Stanley Kubrick gag. Second anniversary note to producers: why not put all the
&quot;Treehouse of Horror&quot; episodes on one DVD -- and speaking of DVD’s,
when can we expect each season on its own disc…?&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">A
crusading young reporter (Jennifer Salt) thinks she witnesses a murder in the
apartment of beautiful model Danielle (Margot Kidder). One of the benefits of
being out of circulation for many years is that a film (which, of course,
doesn’t change) can have a new impact on critics and the public (who, of
course, are constantly changing). Such is the case with Brian De Palma’s <i>Sisters</i>,
his first high profile feature, which was jeered at the time as a slavish
rip-off of Alfred Hitchcock but impresses today as a remarkably fresh and
inventive stylistic exercise in its own right (the plot summary above is vague
on purpose). Sure, the movie owes more than a passing nod to <i>Psycho</i> and <i>Rear
Window</i> specifically (aided by Bernard Herrmann’s fine score), but De
Palma’s exhilarating use of that split-screen technique as well as Margot
Kidder’s creepy performance add up to a genuinely frightening experience. The
new DVD edition from The Criterion Collection features a handsome digital
transfer (the movie didn’t look this good a quarter century ago); the 1966
&quot;Life&quot; magazine article about Russian Siamese Twins that inspired the
director; a huge gallery of production stills; De Palma’s period &quot;Village
Voice&quot; essay on working with Herrmann; and an unfortunately pompous 1973
print interview with the filmmaker (&quot;By and large it makes me angry to see
a good, major director subordinate the content of an expository scene to style
so that you can’t tell what’s going on and who’s doing what to whom,&quot;
he says, thus predicting his recent misfire <i>Mission to Mars</i>). It’s good
to have this pivotal early 1970s horror film back in circulation.&nbsp;</font></span></p>

be said for Maddin’s first feature, the sinister and surreal 1988 <i>Tales

completely envelops the viewer in the turn-of-the-century title town, reeling
from the effects of a smallpox epidemic (&quot;a Gimli we no longer know,&quot;
someone says), that the melodramatic competition between two patients becomes a
life-and-death struggle comparable to the meditative and visually striking works
of David Lynch, Luis Bunuel and F.W. Murnau. A blend of the new and old,
complete with Icelandic traditions both accurate and invented, <i>Tales From the
Gimli Hospital</i> is also available in a DVD edition that includes Maddin’s
1986 short <i>The Dead Father</i> and 1988 work <i>Hospital Fragment</i>. For
those hooked on Maddin’s unique worldview, Kino Video’s day-and-date DVD
release of his subsequent <i>Careful</i> (to be reviewed in the October video
column) includes an hour-long documentary on the director and his career.</span></font></p>
