<p><big><strong><big>T</big></strong>his is a more than mild laughter &#150; on par with
and what many viewers and critics will compare to last year's <a href="rbfwedding.html" target="_top"><i>My
Best Friend&#146;s Wedding</i></a> &#150; peppered with brief, finely drawn, and genuinely
hilarious performances by numerous characters that pop in and out of a scene here ... a
scene there. I'll comment further on some of these actors a little later, but let me say
now that they certainly helped push the picture above the run-of-the-mill original 1987
novel by Stephen McCauley. The screenplay, nurtured and now born after ten-year incubation
at the hands of Wendy Wasserstein, is, incredibly, her first produced film script after a
ever-growing career as an accomplished playwright, having won the Pulitzer Prize and a
slew of other trophies for her play &quot;The Heidi Chronicles.&quot; She adds numerous
theatrical references throughout the film, including a elementary school production of The
Little Mermaid and a modern verse adaptation of Shakespeare.</big></p>

<p><img src="images/robject-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="133" HEIGHT="200">Jennifer Aniston
stars in her second starring vehicle for Fox after <a href="rpicperfect.html" target="_top"><i>Picture
Perfect</i></a>, her lame debut film with that studio. She's continues to grow as an
actress in the several films she's tackled (but don't dare consider renting <i>'Til There
Was You</i>, a stinker that defines the genre). Here she's Nina Borowski, a mussy-haired
community center counselor, a free spirit that gets involved in a tale of unrequited love.
Girl meets Boy. Boy is Gay. Oy Vay. Er, I mean (and she thinks), that's okay. But ... what
is a poor Girl to do? Well, if you're Nina, you get lots of advice, including from first
grade teacher George Hanson (Paul Rudd), the titular character who becomes her closest
friend, sharing her secrets, her Brooklyn walk up, her Haagen-Dazs, and a never-ending
string of dance lessons. George's sexual leanings on the surface do not seem to phase
Nina, but if the tension didn't mount, the movie wouldn't be very interesting.</p>

<p>Nina and George carry on a great relationship until she becomes pregnant by attorney
boy friend Vince McBride (John Pankow, a.k.a. Cousin Ira from <i>Mad About You</i>), an
arrogant, jealous homophobe who Nina deserts in a moment of enlightenment. She asks the
temporarily unattached George to become a surrogate parent to the unborn child, but their
plan for a marriage without sexual foundation crumbles when George's heart goes out to
another.</p>

<p><img src="images/robject-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">Director Nicholas
Hytner, one of Britain's most lauded stage directors, made a truly remarkable film debut
with <i>The Madness of King George</i>, starring Nigel Hawthorne, who has a small but key
role in <i>Object</i> as an aging drama critic whose significant other Paul (Amo
Gulinello) becomes his ex-s.o. and the object of George's affections. Hytner's third
outing, after a brilliant film adaptation of Arthur Miller's <i>The Crucible</i>, is,
obviously, his lightest work to date, yet it still retains the director's interest in
dealing with themes of dignity and conflict. The film floats along for nearly two hours,
with Hytner displaying a keen eye for intercutting scenes, until the picture arrives at a
too contrived ending. Yeah, it's feel-good, but it's more coincidental than it is
rational. The pacing is right on and the camerawork by Oliver Stapleton (a longtime
collaborator with Stephen Frears) is fresh and appealing. Five-time Oscar-nominee George
Fenton provides a light score that perhaps slightly overplays the 1929 standard &quot;You
Were Meant for Me&quot; (as seen in a clip from <i>Singin' in the Rain</i> with Gene Kelly
and Debbie Reynolds).</p>

<p>The supporting cast is headlined by Allison Janney and Alan Alda as Sidney and
Constance Miller, Nina's upscale step-sister and her nearly-oblivious agent husband,
forever dropping celebrity names (King Hussein, Norman Mailer, Colin Powell, to name a
few) at their Hampton estate and providing Nina with an endless barrage of wacky advice.
Tim Daly (fresh from the final season of Wings) is Dr. Robert Joley, a self-obsessed
delusional who dumps George as the film begins and becomes an easy foil with each
additional sighting.</p>

<p><img src="images/robject-3.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">But it's the small
pop-up appearances that flutter about the film that really make this an enjoyable feature.
Quirky characters all, from Mrs. Sarni (Marilyn Dobrin), Nina's nosey downstairs neighbor;
to Madame Reynolds (Joan Copeland), a red-haired, eye-patched dance instructor; to Dr.
Jonathan Goldstein (Bruce Altman), an ear-nose-and throat man who is more interested in
leather than skin; to Mrs. Ochoa (Antonia Rey), the proud mother of a latino lesbian
daughter; to Carmelita (Iraida Polanco), the Miller's latino housekeeper who gets
gardening hints from Martha Stewart.</p>

<p>You'll have no objection if you let this movie steal your affections for a pleasant two
hours in the dark.</p>
