<p><big><strong><big>&quot;T</big></strong>hat rocks!&quot; says scruffy gearhead Lamont
(Jack Black) to icy assassin Jackal (Bruce Willis) as the latter fiddles with an enormous
computer-controlled Gatling gun that fells trees and blows softball-sized holes in
automobiles and scruffy gearheads. It is this very blend of hipness and mayhem that <i>The
Jackal</i> aims for and routinely hits, but while there's no denying the visual power of
director Michael Caton-Jones' loud and shiny remake of Fred Zinnemann's subtle and steely
1973 British-French procedural <i>The Day of the Jackal</i>, the need for and value of
such a thing &#150; particularly in this absurdly illogical incarnation that has no
interest in respecting the original &#150; is decidedly questionable.</big></p>

<p>When the arrest of a prominent underworld figure in a Moscow discotheque goes awry, the
dead hood's brother hires the legendary Jackal to avenge the death by taking out a
prominent American official. As the assassin travels around Europe and North America in
elaborate disguises making preparations for the event, he is tracked by FBI deputy
director Carter Preston (Sidney Poitier) and Russian intelligence office Valentina Koslova
(Diane Venora). They, in turn, enlist the aid of imprisoned IRA operative Declan Mulqueen
(Richard Gere), one of only two people who can identify the Jackal by sight. Once aligned
in this shaky axis the hunt is on, with the killer zeroing in on his still unknown prey
while the authorities &#150; and the audience &#150; scramble to identify and second-guess
his plans. The eventual sweaty showdown pits the Jackal one-on-one against Mulqueen, who
has unfinished business with the psychotic assassin and his personal taunts.</p>

<p><img src="images/rjackel-1.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" WIDTH="166" HEIGHT="171">For the second
time in as many weeks, Hollywood presents an interesting example of market-dictated
adaptation for those willing to do a little research (Universal has helpfully made
Zinnemann's film &#150; sadly, panned and scanned instead of letterboxed &#150; available
once again on tape). A close reading of the new credits yields a first, crucial clue: the
&quot;Screen Story and Screenplay&quot; is by Chuck Pfarrer, who has specialized in
hollow, cartoonish action scripts such as <i>Barb Wire</i> (1996), <i>Hard Target</i>
(1993) and <i>Darkman</i> (1990). Tellingly, the title cards avoid Frederick Forsyth's
original novel entirely, preferring to credit the Golden Globe-nominated &quot;Motion
Picture Screenplay&quot; of Kenneth Ross, who followed his original adaptation with
interesting work on <i>Brother Sun, Sister Moon</i> (1973) and the international caper
films <i>The Odessa File</i> (1974), <i>Black Sunday </i>(1977) and <i>The Fourth War</i>
(1990).</p>

<p>As you might imagine in these days of spiraling costs and overblown action, dramatic
inflation has taken a sad toll on Zinnemann's modestly revered original: the Jackal's
price has jumped from $500,000 to $70 million, the guns have grown almost laughably
larger, the screwdriver Edward Fox uses to adjust the sight on his custom-built rifle has
been replaced by a keypad and internet service provider (the film doesn't even have the
wit to give Willis the occasional busy signal), and a spray-painted sports car has been
replaced by a chameleon-like minivan. Even the inventive soundtrack by Carter Burwell (<i>Conspiracy
Theory</i>, <i>Raising Arizona</i>) is thundering with contemporary offerings from Massive
Attack, Primal Scream, Bush and more of that sort of thing &#150; which sounds pretty cool
now but may not have as much of a shelf life as Georges Delerue's score for the original. </p>

<p><img src="images/rjackel-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">Even more alarming,
in retrospect, was Pfarrer's decision to eliminate both the legitimate motivation of the
original and the identity of the target. A band of French military extremists (OAS)
passionately committed to overthrowing the government of aloof leader Charles de Gaulle
for granting independence to Algeria is one thing, but a Russian gangster's
vendetta-fueled selection of a prominent American to be killed purely for retribution
marks a crucial shift in the focus of the film. Without a plausible hook &#150; political
or emotional &#150; the tension of the film, which is built on the same rough framework as
the original, moves from the question of &quot;How is the Jackal going to pull off this
seemingly impossible hit?&quot; to &quot;What precisely is going on here and why should I
care?&quot; &#150; a fatal flaw in a story built around an efficient enigma instead of a
three-dimensional person. </p>

<p>Ironically, it is the character of Mulqueen that carries the emotional weight of the
film and Richard Gere who emerges as the surprise focus of <i>The Jackal</i> for his
crafty portrayal of a man actually committed to something. His first meeting with Preston
and Koslova in the exercise yard of a prison is a modest triumph of expressive acting and
crafty blocking, one of a few scenes in which director Caton-Jones exhibits an original
approach to wide-screen composition and a firm adherence to Zinnemann's craftsmanlike
approach to picture making (there's an excellent article on the director, who died this
past March firmly opposed to the remake, in the September-October issue of &quot;Film
Comment&quot;). So too the subplot of Mulqueen's supposed inability to &quot;protect his
women&quot; has unexpected emotional resonance in a film that is elsewhere satisfied to
have shady figures drink from heavy tumblers and characters say things like &quot;A man
like this doesn't make mistakes&quot; and &quot;What's her story then?&quot;. </p>

<p><img src="images/rjackel-3.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">Only Diane Venora
as the steely operative Koslova makes a lasting impression among the supporting cast,
using a withering stare, languid way with a cigarette and a Garbo-ish accent to elevate
her character above cliche. As for Willis, he's competent if not particularly distinctive,
admirably masking that annoying smirk but failing to give his Jackal the charisma and/or
panache of Fox's laconic, almost rakish original. Whereas an unknown could've brought
genuine, unexpected menace to the part, Willis is, well, never not Bruce Willis. He
probably got the movie funded, but the baggage of his persona certainly impedes any
momentum the story builds.</p>

<p>Technically, the film is a marvel of sharp edges and diverse locations, with the
Panavision cinematography of Karl Walter Lindenlaub (Gere's other new movie <i>Red Corner</i>,
<i>Independence Day</i>, Caton-Jones' previous film <i>Rob Roy</i>) underscoring the
baker's dozen main locations and the production design of Michael White (<i>The Rock</i>, <i>Crimson
Tide</i>) providing a neat twist on the climactic set piece inspired by Washington's Metro
Center subway station that posits a more pedestrian-friendly and dramatically lit space
than the one that was actually built.</p>

<p>In the end, <i>The Jackal</i> is a cynical, heavy-handed imitation of a unique thriller
that is technically impressive but makes the all-too-common mistake of assuming that
bigger is better. While it may in fact rock, it does so to no discernible purpose and
won't for very long in the fickle pre-holiday marketplace.</p>
