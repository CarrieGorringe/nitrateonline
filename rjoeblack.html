Producer/Director Martin Brest has unleashed other lengthy (and better) efforts such as <i>Midnight
Run</i> (122 minutes) and <i>Scent of a Woman</i> (157), but I can&#146;t understand why
he blatantly stretched this film past it&#146;s breaking point by at least 60 minutes
(some might even say 180 minutes), unless he felt it was necessary to narcissistically
show off more of this $90 million production than anyone else cared to watch.</big></p>

<p><img src="images/rjoeblack-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">The story, about
death embodied in the body of a mortal man, is a (very) loose remake of 1934&#146;s <i>Death
Takes A Holiday</i>, a better (and shorter!) picture, thanks to the deft direction of
Mitchell Leisen, who understood the words &quot;pacing&quot; and &quot;budget&quot; much
better than Brest. The average Joe (heartthrob Brad Pitt) is clueless about how to deport
himself as a human. And what gives with making his favorite food peanut butter?
Pitt&#146;s character is sketched as a dead fish out of water and is more stiff rather
than comical. Which makes sense, as the man the grim reaper is externalizing was rammed by
several cars earlier that morning (in one of the film&#146;s more horrendously gruesome
moments). You&#146;d be stiff too if you had that kind of day.</p>

<p>Bazillionaire Parrish (Anthony Hopkins), on the verge of his 65th birthday, gets an
unwelcomed gift when death drops in for a vacation. On a whim (Death has whims? For the
first time in eternity?), Death moves into the Parrish home as best bud to the chairman of
the board of the family&#146;s media empire, in exchange for a few more days among the
living. The oddly drawn character jumps right into the thick of a corporate takeover
battle at the New York City headquarters, fending off Drew, an aggressive heir to the
empire and possible loveless son-in-law via Dr. Susan Parrish (Clair Forlani), a resident
in internal medicine with a voice like Mia Farrow. She&#146;s a novice in love who
ultimately gets screwed by Death (Likely sequel: Joe Black, Jr.), but she&#146;s still
dad&#146;s preferred over sibling Allison (Marcia Gay Harden), whose deeply involved with
daddy&#146;s overwrought birthday bash that covers the film&#146;s last 45 minutes.
Jeffrey Tambor as Quince, Allison&#146;s weak minded but well intentioned husband, does a
riff on his Emmy Award nominated character Hank Kingsley, Garry Shandling&#146;s sidekick
on the late great HBO series The Larry Sanders Show. Tambor and Hopkins come off best in
this sinking ship.</p>

<p>There is a vestige of a decent movie under the hefty bulk, but it demands a
butcher&#146;s touch to get there. Chop, chop, snip, snip. Too many scriptwriters (four
get credit; others, the lucky ones, don&#146;t) wreck any iota of sense in the characters,
and Brest&#146;s directorial pace suggests that if he had made Titanic, it would have been
a six-hour nap. Instead his Joe is the ultimate cure for insomnia.</p>

<p><img src="images/rjoeblack-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">The only thing
going -- at all -- for this fat slab of bloat are the production values. Emmanuel
Lubezki&#146;s cinematography is bright and straight on, although I much prefer his work
on <i>The Little Princess</i> and <i>A Walk in the Clouds</i>. Joe is closer in pictorial
tone to his camerawork on <a href="rbcage.html" target="_top"><i>The Birdcage</i></a>. Production design
by Dante Ferretti (who worked on <i>The Shawkshank Redemption</i>, one of my favorite
films) makes media magnate William Parrish&#146;s Poughkeepsie estate look excessively
palatial and is used to pretty effect during a fireworks display at film&#146;s end.
It&#146;s good placement, though, to wake up those dozing in the crowd.</p>

<p>It&#146;s the &#146;90s version of <i>Heaven&#146;s Gate</i>, that over-budget,
over-long 1980 release that was the last time it&#146;s director Michael Cimino ever got
final cut (and five years before he landed work in Hollywood again). Perhaps as punishment
for the Universal Pictures executives who green-lighted Joe and allowed Brest to
over-extend his picture, they&#146;ll chain them to the studio screening room seats and
force them to watch that earlier 219-minute self- indulgent fiasco a few times over.
Unless, by some marketing miracle, star</p>

<p>Brad Pitt has some mystically drawing power and brings in the masses. My teenage
daughter, despite my warnings, is off with her buddies to catch this film (and<i> I Still
Know What You Did Last Summer</i>) at the local multiplex this weekend, so I suspect this
actually might have a decent opening weekend, probably at the expense of larger inner city
houses in older neighborhoods, unless they&#146;re pulled in by Anthony Hopkins. My words
to you: Send Joe back.</p>
