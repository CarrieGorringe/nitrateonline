<p><font size="5"><strong>V</strong></font><font size="4">ic Deakins (Travolta) is a
rather urbane individual, in a wry sort of way, somewhat like a James Bond for the
scofflaw set. Always calm and collected under (almost) any crisis, he even finds the time
to instruct his henchmen on the finer points of criminal equitette. &quot;Would you mind
not shooting at the thermonuclear weapons?&quot; he chides one overeager assistant in a
tone of barely-restrained disapproval that is usually reserved for the parvenu dinner
guest who is vulgar enough to mistake his vichysoisse for the finger bowl. Ah, yes, the
thermonuclear weapons ... Roughly some ten to twelve hours earlier in screen time (forty
minutes or so in real time), Deakins was actually Major Vic Deakins, a maverick bomber
pilot with an axe or two to grind against a military establishment which he believed was
not sufficiently appreciative of his considerable talents to provide him with a promotion.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">One night, while he and his co-pilot, Riley Hale (Slater) are out on a
top-secret war games flight, Deakins hijacks the B-3 stealth bomber in which he and Hale
are flying, complete with the aforementioned thermonuclear weapons. Deakins ejects Hale
from the cockpit over a vast stretch of desert, confident that Hale will die of exposure
before he can ever file a report. Moreover, Deakins, in his final transmission to Colonel
Max Wilkins (Lindo) at Ground Control, makes it seem as if the plane is going to crash and
places the blame on Hale. After Wilkins reports to Washington that the Air Force has a
&quot;broken arrow&quot; on its hands (military jargon for the loss of nuclear weapons),
search teams are sent out to recover the weapons; their members are trapped in a ruse and
killed. Meanwhile, Hale does not die as expected; the area over which he has been ejected
is a U.S. National Park, and his flight did not go unnoticed by a park ranger named Terry
Carmichael (Mathis). Gradually, after a series of scuffles, some of them quite
interpersonal in nature, Carmichael comes to believe Hale's story, and the two of them
team up to thwart Deakins' attempt to blackmail the U.S. Government, nearly getting
themselves killed several times in the process. After reentering civilization, they learn
from Wilkins and others that Deakins' destination for the second bomb has changed, and
Wilkins, Hale and Carmichael head out after Deakins and his gang.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">As might be expected from a John Woo film, <em>Broken Arrow</em> has all
of the requisite action and excitement. Woo is ably assisted by Yost, the screenwriter
behind last year's action hit, <em>Speed</em>. Yost obviously borrows extensively from his
former work, contriving action sequences aboard moving vehicles which are sufficiently
heart-stopping. But, for all of this, the overall impression of <em>Broken Arrow</em> is a
lot like the description of war: moments of boredom, punctuated by moments of sheer
terror. It is the former element which at times threatens to prevail; Yost's screenplay
doesn't give the characters much to do or say in between the elaborately-choreographed
action sequences. Consequently, there's so much narrative torpor that the characters seem
to be running a cross-country pursuit through a viscous fluid to get to the next bit of
SFX. Speaking of SFX, there are some fairly implausible plot devices utilized in their
favor, including an underground nuclear explosion, the results from which will tax most
sorely the credibility quotient of anyone familiar with the laws of nuclear physics;
hasn't Yost ever heard that fallout travels quite capably through rushing water, thank you
very much? Depicting individuals getting up and running away unharmed from the results of
a multi-megaton blast involves such a degree of wish fulfillment that one could be
forgiven for assuming that Yost had some ghostwriting help in this affair from someone who
did time at the Pentagon in the 1950s. The explanation provided in the film is barely
adequate to sustain belief, and will, no doubt, not survive the rigors of even the most
basic post-screening beer-and-bull session. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">Fortunately, the ensemble acting is extremely good, with Travolta as the
film's very able and necessary fulcrum. Travolta's performance is essentially a
continuation of his work as &quot;Chili&quot; Palmer in <a href="rgetshrt.html" target="_top"><em>Get
Shorty</em></a>, but he gives Deakins less loose-limbed hipness than was given to Chili
Palmer and more of a pressurized cool and wit; it's a role that's informed by a fair
amount of remaindered and corrupted Hegel, thus bordering at times on camp, and Travola,
bless his heart, plays up the role of sociopathic stoic for all it's worth (a worth that
should not be underestimated). In his role as the solidly upstanding military officer,
Slater provides the likeable counterpart to Deakins. Lindo, demonstrating more facets to
his acting ability (after having kept Spike Lee's execrable <a href="rclock.html" target="_top"><em>Clockers</em></a>
barely afloat almost single-handedly), provides a deft admixture of military bearing and
human compassion. As Carmichael, Mathis displays more feisty courage than is usually
permitted to most heroines of action films, whose usual modus operandi consists of
standing around and screaming for help while the hero tries to fight off three thugs
simultaneously; this spunky young lady actually possesses the wherewithal to pick up
reasonably weighty objects and to clonk the baddies over the head with them whenever it is
deemed necessary to do so (usually quite often), and, moreover, she can climb a mean
moving train. If only <em>Broken Arrow</em> had tapped into all of this energy, the result
could have been much different.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">One might have expected more from Woo in his American film debut. Blame
it on the special effects budget or the meddling of Hollywood (not known for trusting a
sure commodity after having purchased it), but <em>Broken Arrow</em> isn't quite up to
par. Admittedly, the film has its moments, but not many of them. The film isn't really
bad, but it isn't really great, either, and the waste of so much talent in the pursuit of
mediocrity has to be the worst crime of all. </font></p>
