<meta name="description" content="Out to Sea - The title of this poor excuse for a comedy should have been Up the Comedic Creek Without a Credible Hook. Ever since the Grumpy Old Men franchise took off, there seems to be a plethora of horrid films filled with lame jokes about incontinence, impotence, and flatulence, and, admittedly, the original GOM had some touching moments, especially when the two rivals for neighbor Ann Margret are forced to acknowledge their loneliness, impending mortality and the costs of egotistical infighting. There is no such insight here; screenwriter Jacobs decided to excise the charm and fill in the blanks with more blank, tedious comedy. It seems that setting a film on a ocean liner inspires insipidness in screenwriters (Speed 2 being offered up as prima facie evidence of said syndrome) and this film is no exception. Everyone in the highly talented cast displays no charm whatsoever ? an amazing feat for director Coolidge, who put considerable charm into Ramblin? Rose but has descended beyond the aptly-named Clueless territory that she earlier set for herself into something far more insipid ? and anything more insipid than Clueless is a genuine, if dubious, achievement. Out to Sea, in fact, is Clueless on the senior circuit, possessing the same inane, self-satisfied, self-evident sarcasm that passes for wit these days; the only joke in Out to Sea that inspires a modicum of laughter has as its basis a deliberate misunderstanding between steaming pants and steaming lobster. Since that &quot;joke&quot; occurs close to the beginning of the film, you know that it is heading straight for the iceberg by reel four, and, in this only instance, alas, Out to Sea does not disappoint. Not even Donald O? Connor?s fancy footwork can allow him to two-step his way out of a comedy that it would be no exaggeration to describe as abusive, insofar as it degrades the considerable reputations of all participants.

<p><font size="5"><strong>T</strong></font><font size="4">he title of this poor excuse for
a comedy should have been Up the Comedic Creek Without a Credible Hook. Ever since the <i>Grumpy
Old Men</i> franchise took off, there seems to be a plethora of horrid films filled with
lame jokes about incontinence, impotence, and flatulence, and, admittedly, the original <i>GOM</i>
had some touching moments, especially when the two rivals for neighbor Ann Margret are
forced to acknowledge their loneliness, impending mortality and the costs of egotistical
infighting. There is no such insight here; screenwriter Jacobs decided to excise the charm
and fill in the blanks with more blank, tedious comedy. It seems that setting a film on a
ocean liner inspires insipidness in screenwriters (<a href="rspeed2.html" target="_top"><i>Speed 2</i></a>
being offered up as <i>prima facie</i> evidence of said syndrome) and this film is no
exception. Everyone in the highly talented cast displays no charm whatsoever &#150; an
amazing feat for director Coolidge, who put considerable charm into <i>Ramblin&#146; Rose</i>
but has descended beyond the aptly-named <i>Clueless</i> territory that she earlier set
for herself into something far more insipid &#150; and anything more insipid than <i>Clueless
</i>is a genuine, if dubious, achievement. <i>Out to Sea</i>, in fact, is <i>Clueless</i>
on the senior circuit, possessing the same inane, self-satisfied, self-evident sarcasm
that passes for wit these days; the only joke in <i>Out to Sea</i> that inspires a modicum
of laughter has as its basis a deliberate misunderstanding between steaming pants and
steaming lobster. Since that &quot;joke&quot; occurs close to the beginning of the film,

would be no exaggeration to describe as abusive, insofar as it degrades the considerable
reputations of all participants. </font></p>

<p>Everyone involved here is in desperate need of the acid wit of Billy Wilder and I.A.L.
Diamond, co-authors of the hilarious Matthau-Lemmon collaboration, 1966&#146;s <i>The
Fortune Cookie</i>. <i>Fortune</i> <i>Cookie</i> gave Matthau one of his best moments --
and his only Oscar -- as the ambulance-chasing lawyer, &quot;Whiplash Willie&quot;
Gingrich, out to defraud an insurance company to the benefit of himself and his hapless
brother-in-law, Harry Hinkle (played by Lemmon). Not that Wilder&#146;s film didn&#146;t
contain moments of bedpan humor &#150; such as when Gingrich offers up &quot; a quarter of
a million [dollars] on a silver platter&quot; while offering Hinkle the aforementioned
sanitation device&#150; but the vulgarity of the situation underscored the brashness of
Gingrich, becoming a metaphor for his sleazy demeanor. Not to put too fine a point on
things, but Wilder and Diamond made certain the gag was significant, unlike the sludge
proffered by Coolidge and Jacobs. If Diamond and Wilder exist, disputably, the penthouse
of comedic screenwriting, the script for <i>Out to Sea</i> is indisputably in the bargain
basement the day after a clearance sale. It&#146;s a sad sequel for everyone, but
especially for Lemmon and Matthau, who are capable of and deserve much better treatment.
Perhaps, before taking on this sorry film, they should have remembered the quotation from
Abe Lincoln included in Hinkle&#146;s fortune cookie &#150; something about not being able
to fool all of the people all of the time. </p>
