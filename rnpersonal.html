<p><font size="5"><strong>T</strong></font><font size="4">he time is 1975, and Belfast is
in its sixth year of what would soon be known to history as yet another eruption of the
euphemistically-named, &quot;Troubles&quot;. Kenny (Frain), a Protestant paramilitary who
is in charge of a group of terrorists, is dispatched by his boss (Gambon) to find and take
care of the Catholic terrorists who planted a bomb in an Ulster-controlled pub. Among his
compatriots is Ginger (Hart), a henchman who has been so poisoned by ideology that his
hatred for the &quot;other&quot; borders on the psychopathic. Meanwhile, Liam (Lynch), the
Catholic father of two children, has gone to the Protestant sector because he is in need
of a drink and the pubs are closed on his side of the street. When the lives of Liam and
Kenny intersect, surprises and tragedy await. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><img src="images/rnpersonal-1.gif" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="220" HEIGHT="146">O&#146;Sullivan
and Mornin are a brave pair of collaborators, not least of all because they choose to
speak the obvious in a most unromanticized fashion; unlike earlier films, such as <i>In
the Name of the Father</i>, this film chooses not to depict acts of terrorism as a noble
calling, and the actors involved as martyrs. Indeed, as <i>Nothing Personal</i> unfolds,
it becomes more than apparent that any legitimate grievances (and there were many) that
spurred the fighting in Northern Ireland have simply degenerated into a criminal
enterprise not unlike that of the American Mafia. When Kenny tells Liam, after
Kenny&#146;s &quot;assistants&quot; have beaten Liam nearly senseless, that it&#146;s
&quot;nothing personal&quot;, the urge to conclude Kenny&#146;s phrase with another
borrowed from the Corleone family&#150; that all of the brutality visited upon Liam is
&quot;just business&quot; &#150; is absolutely irresistible, and undoubtedly not
coincidental. Forget the outrages such as Battle of the Boyne, the Potato Famine and the
continuing provocations of the &quot;King Billy&quot; parades; in this film, it is clear
that a rigid adherence to ideologies has become mere window dressing for those at the very
top of both organizations. The heads of the Ulster and IRA factions are old friends who
settle turf wars with a little convivial &quot;understanding&quot;; as their faces, lined
with the ugliness of their cynicism and self-loathing at the recognition of it in the
other&#146;s face, meet in close-up to agree that the bomber&#146;s actions were wrong
only because unsanctioned, the justification for their co-existence transgresses into the
realm of the obscene, and hits the audience like a bucket of cold water across the face.
Their profiles may meet like those on two Roman coins placed side by side, but the
currency they peddle is worthless. </font></p>

<p><font size="3">The film effectively and damningly demonstrates how terrorism, stripped
of its usual defense of pretending to act in the name of a higher cause, has degenerated
into a mere profession, and its general practitioners are nothing more than violent street
thugs whose uniform of choice, like that of their American gangster counterparts, is the
requisite black leather jacket, and/or the ill-coordinated, ill-fitting suit. Those who
take the &quot;game&quot; too seriously, as Ginger does, are the troublemakers, because
they have the potential to interrupt the flow of money. If the IRA&#146;s MO is
illustrated by the proverb, &quot;the enemy of my enemy is my friend,&quot; <i>Nothing
Personal</i> illustrates how difficult it is to distinguish between the two. In fact, the
entire film is more reminiscent of another proverb, namely the one about not needing any
enemies with &quot;friends&quot; like these. There&#146;s no need to shed tears for either
side in this so-called struggle for freedom; the only victims in this horrible farce are
the unfortunates, both inside and outside the organizations, who realize the fraudulence
of everybody&#146;s claims, but soldier onward grimly anyway, mainly because the
unrelenting guerilla warfare has sapped initiative from their minds and replaced it with
fear. </font></p>

<p><font size="3"><img src="images/rnpersonal-2.gif" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="162" HEIGHT="200">With
this analogy framework in place, the characters involved therein need only represent
themselves as stereotypes for the film to effectively convey its message. Fortunately, the
three main performers &#150; Lynch, Frain and Hart &#150; give much more of themselves, to
the film&#146;s benefit. Lynch and Frain gradually and skillfully unfold their
character&#146;s secret pains and dreams in pace with the film&#146;s unfolding of plot
and their synchronization only empowers the sense of madness about it all. Speaking of
madness, Ian Hart, who gave a flawless performance as the disillusioned revolutionary in
last year&#146;s <i>Land and Freedom</i>, takes on the flip side of quiet revolution in
the eponymous Ginger, and fills him with overpowering levels of cruelty and rage that
Ginger acts as the id to the Ulsters&#146; superego; he evolves into an uncomfortable
reminder of what the organization uses to fight for and should be fighting for now. He is
certainly an anachronism, one that can be tolerated, as long as he is useful, and there
are times when a little superfluous violence keeps everyone in line. But such usefulness,
as Ginger is soon to discover, has its limits.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">This is not to say that <i>Nothing Personal</i> is without problems. The
ending is maudlin enough to nearly overplay the skillful hands dealt by the director and
screenwriter throughout. Closely related to this point is the symbol of the blond-haired
innocent &#150; Liam&#146;s daughter &#150; who seems to float though the film as a
remonstrating counterpoint to the brutality around her. In contrast to the uncompromising
world around her &#150; cinematographer Dick Pope has subtly washed the daytime skies with
a touch of greyness and the night with hard, garish light to drive the point home &#150;
she may be the oasis in the midst of misery, but her presence is also too overwhelming The
film&#146;s pace is also interminably slow; arguably, this pacing is supposed to
approximate the real lifestyle of a terrorist as it alternates between long stretches of
boredom and short bursts of terror, but the speed at which this film unfolds is far too
leisurely, as if it has gotten caught up in its good intentions far too much; the effect
on the audience may leave its members with the impression that the film has too little to
say and far too much space in which to say it. More information about the main
characters&#146; backgrounds would have alleviated these problems considerably. Such are
the problems with <i>Nothing Personal</i>, but they are minor points compared with the
hard and bitter truths the film reveals to those who would care to see them.</font></p>
