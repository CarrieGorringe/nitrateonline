still with me so far?</font></p>

<p>Uncomplicated the plot is not, and Mann (and the audience) have to juggle these
sometimes disparate narrative fragments for the better part of a running time of nearly
three hours. The length may sound off-putting, but the effect on-screen is not. Amazingly,
Mann succeeds in making this seemingly unwieldy contraption get up and spin smoothly, with
very few interruptions in movement. It helps that Mann knows the pedigree of the crime
film genre and mines it to great effect: the script borrows elements from such great films
as <em>Criss Cross</em> (1948), <em>High Sierra</em> (1941) and <em>Rififi</em> (1955),
among them the fatal love connection (from <em>Criss Cross</em> and <em>High Sierra</em>)
and the big score that goes horribly wrong (from <em>Rififi</em> and <em>Criss Cross</em>).
What separates Mann from other filmmakers who indulge in these extra-textual borrowings is
that Mann has an instinct for knowing exactly when the borrowing has to stop so that his
own creativity can take over. Mann gives the audiences nuances of what came before rather
than entire scenes replicated whole cloth, with scant reinterpretation save for updating
the time and place; he has reverence for the past, rather than seeing it, as certain
unnamed filmmakers do, as a source from which they can shamelessly plunder, relying upon
either the inside knowledge of film buffs or a perceived ignorance of contemporary
audiences in order to operate with impunity. Brilliantly-executed rapid-fire editing makes
<em>Heat</em> move like an exquisitely engineered machine, but Mann uses his extra screen
time for constructing expositions about the characters, and this personal information is
absolutely fascinating and hardly perfunctory. Rather, Mann makes each nugget of
information absolutely essential to the narrative. He manages to be economical with
excess, and that&#146;s a difficult thing to do.</p>

<p>It helps that Mann&#146;s cast is one that many directors would kill for. Pacino and De
Niro literally command attention when they are on the screen, although they do so in
entirely different ways. De Niro&#146;s Neil alternates effectively between a life of
crime carefully orchestrated to the nth degree and a feeling of ennui which seems to have
no boundaries; he seems not to know what he is looking for, until he finds Edie. As the
ennui breaches the previously unassailable dike between his private and personal lives,
Neil breaks the cardinal rule by which he has lived most of his life: &quot;Have nothing
in your life that you cannot walk out on in thirty seconds flat if you see the heat coming
round the corner.&quot; Neil&#146;s love for Edie is one that will kill him, and it is De
Niro&#146;s gift to invest Neil&#146;s personal demeanor with an eerie ambiguity that
suggests that Neil really doesn&#146;t care if he lives or dies now that he has loved. For
his part, Pacino goes to the opposite end of the spectrum, opting for bombast, and
sometimes it works. Mostly, however, Pacino&#146;s take on Vincent is almost
embarrassingly reminiscent of his role in <em>Scent of a Woman</em>. But even Pacino is
saved from himself. De Niro and Pacino have only two scenes together in the entire film,
and only one allows them to actually interact. It does not occur until halfway through the
film, but it is worth the wait. Their subtle sparring in a coffee shop has all the
hallmarks of an elegantly-staged pissing contest. Both contestants project a wry demeanor
about their shared fate, but each is also deadly serious about his goal and determined to
best the other, even if one of them must die. The meeting is short (less than fifteen
minutes), but the scene establishes beyond any doubts why De Niro and Pacino, under the
right circumstances, are the best screen actors of their generation and of all time.</p>

<p>The rest of the cast rounds out De Niro&#146;s excellent performance and Pacino&#146;s
sometimes-excellent performance nicely. Kilmer guides his character deftly within the
confines of a love that threatens at any time to fall into real self-abnegation. Yet,
Kilmer&#146;s Chris has a patina of dignity surrounding him; no matter how angry Charlene
makes him, Chris knows that there is no one else, so he must do whatever it takes to make
her happy, regardless of the cost. Chris has no illusions, but he is strained; his every
act of crime could potentially separate himself from what he needs most. At times the
restrained but unmistakable sense of irony in Kilmer&#146;s performance nearly cause him
to walk away with the picture. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, the women in the cast don&#146;t fare as well in this
testosterone-driven genre film -- like most action directors, Mann has never been
traditionally adept at crafting roles for his female actors, but they do reasonably well
with what they&#146;re given. Edie wants so badly to believe in Neil at any cost, and
Brenneman gives her just the right combination of vulnerability and strength. Judd, in her
much-touted debut, doesn&#146;t live up to the hype, (she spends much of her on-screen
time in a state of terminal petulance) but she has enough presence to show promise,
especially when Charlene is forced, under the threat of losing her child, to betray her
husband. For just one moment, and a beautifully-rendered one at that, Judd lets the
audience see Charlene&#146;s complex vulnerabilities and fears. Unfortunately for Venora,
her character is the least sympathetic of the three; the third Mrs. Hanna is nothing more
than a self-absorbed whiny wife who can&#146;t understand why Vincent has to deal with the
&quot;detritus&quot; of society The word &quot;detritus&quot;, uttered rather
incongruously at a cocktail party, is Mann&#146;s cue to the audience that Justine is an
effete &quot;artiste&quot; who is simply unsuited to be the wife of such a vital like
Vincent. As the film progresses, Mann constructs the relationship between Vincent and
Justine as a series of binary oppositions, all of which are designed to make the
work-obsessed Vincent Hanna into Saint Vincent the Domestic Martyr. He doesn&#146;t use
Prozac (although he seems to need it badly); she does. He cares about his stepdaughter;
she seems indifferent to her daughter&#146;s fate. Incontrovertible proof of her
unworthiness comes when Vincent breaks the news of her daughter&#146;s suicide attempt to
her, and Justine cries out, &quot;How could she do this to us?&quot; True, Justine&#146;s
relationship with Vincent has lots of heat, but it&#146;s of the self-immolating variety.
It&#146;s a really ugly role, and Verona, understandably enough, doesn&#146;t seem
comfortable enough with it to play it for what little it&#146;s worth, so regrettably she
becomes the weak link in this film through no fault of her own. </p>

<p>It has its weaknesses (&quot;detritus&quot; isn&#146;t the only example of laughably
tendencious language in this film) but <em>Heat</em> generates enough of its own to keep
you entertained. Certainly the stunning cinematography by Dante Spinotti (he was also
responsible for the super-saturated. literally scintillating, images in Mann&#146;s <em>Manhunter</em>
in 1986) should be enough to keep your eyes glued to the screen. Disregard Neil&#146;s
advice, and don&#146;t run when you see <em>Heat</em> coming round the corner.</p>
