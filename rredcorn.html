<i>

<p>Red Corner</i> is ineluctable proof of the premise that the first casualties of
ideological rigidity, however well-intentioned its underpinnings, are logic and reason.
Richard Gere is so justly concerned about the menacing nature of the Chinese hierarchy
that he has fallen off the entertainment deep end. <img src="images/rredcorn-1.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" WIDTH="90" HEIGHT="120"><i>Red Corner</i> has all the subtlety of nails
sliding down a blackboard, as its insistence upon dividing individuals into such extremes
of caricatured good-versus-evil behavior so aptly demonstrates. Gere himself is unbearably
flinty in his portrayal of martyrdom; it is so one-dimensional, in fact, that Demi Moore
may find herself with some really stiff competition (or, competition for the award for
emotional stiffness, if you prefer) if Gere doesn&#146;t turn back the clock to some of
the more nuanced work he did some twenty years ago in films such as <i>Days of Heaven</i>.
Those actors stuck with the thankless task of portraying the Chinese officials alternately
glower and bellow with what one has to presume are appropriate levels of menace, but they
convey less an air of danger than a badly-felt need for a tea break. Only Bai Ling
survives the onslaught of earnestly bad acting that surrounds her, but even she can&#146;t
hold up this film&#146;s rickety structure for very long.</p>

<p>Moreover, the script has the bad taste to attempt to counteract the maladroitness of
characterization by giving Jack Moore a deliberately maudlin past, one so pathetic as to
conjure up a conception of D.W. Griffith&#146;s Victorian melodramas as souls of veritable
restraint by comparison. We are supposed to sympathize with Moore&#146;s plight. Instead,
he seems more like just another naïf abroad, whining as soon as his slightly louche
conduct has unintended consequences and then demanding to be treated according to American
legal standards (you would think that a lawyer, of all people, would have known something
about the legal system in a country he planned to visit). <img src="images/rredcorn-2.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="left" WIDTH="90" HEIGHT="120">Moreover, what was wrong with operating with a little
discretion in a foreign country, instead of allowing his
&quot;if-it-feels-good-do-it&quot; mentality to place himself at risk? But, of course,
Moore was a victim of circumstance before he ever got on that intercontinental flight, so
he feels entitled to transcend any sort of law and the film tacitly, and incredibly,
agrees with him, to the detriment of all plausibility. At one point in the trial, Moore
angrily demands of the judge who wants to place him in contempt of court, &quot;Are you
going to shoot me twice?&quot; After having endured nearly ninety minutes of a ludicrously
convoluted plot line, it took considerable willpower not to suggest that many of us in the
audience would have been happy to settle for just one, well-aimed, shot. Perhaps all
concerned with this miserable enterprise should have heeded the words of Mark Twain, who
once suggested that people can stand up to hostility, but they can&#146;t tolerate being
laughed at for one minute. As a satire, <i>Red Corner</i> might have been more effective
in finding its mark, and at least it wouldn&#146;t have taken so many careers with it for
so little result. </p>
<i>

<p>Red Corner</i> has the dubious honor of being able to overcome ideological objections
along most of the political spectrum; <img src="images/rredcorn-3.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="90" HEIGHT="120">only extremists at either end will find any semblance of legitimacy
in this bizarre exercise in Hollywood agit-prop, and it&#146;s unlikely that Avnet and
Gere intended to preach to the converted, so this film will go down as &#150; well, it
will just simply go down in box-office flames. This fate is especially inexplicable in the
case of director Avnet, who was able to flesh out the idiosyncrasies of plot and
characters in <i>Fried Green Tomatoes</i> into well-crafted revelations concerning
cultural behavior in the South of the 1940s, and the consequences for the present that
resulted from it. His success rate here in cultural explication is non-existent. As noted
in the review of <a href="r7years.html" target="_top"><i>Seven Years in Tibet</i></a>, Gere is to be
commended for his long-term support of Tibet, however bizarre the manifestation of that
support has been at times. With <i>Red Corner</i>, he has demonstrated that he is one of
the few Hollywood types who has been willing to put his money where his mouth is;
nevertheless, it is very bad form for your feet to follow your money.</p>
