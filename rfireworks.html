<p><big><strong><big>P</big></strong>ain, and the internal management, external uses and
deleterious effects of it, are central themes of this brooding, placid film from Japanese
hyphenate Takeshi &quot;Beat&quot; Kitano in which an outwardly impassive but inwardly
grief-stricken ex-cop tries to set right the wrongs &#150; some assumed, some arbitrary
&#150; in his life. Inspired by, of all things, a motorcycle accident (more on that
later), <i>Fireworks</i> is, in the spirit of it's original Japanese title <i>Hana-Bi</i>
(more on that later too), a hybrid of styles that juxtapose to create a powerful emotional
aura that isn't soon shaken.</big></p>

<p>At the urging of his partner and childhood friend Horibe (Ren Osugi), Tokyo Police
Inspector Yoshitaka Nishi (&quot;Beat&quot; Takeshi) skips a stakeout to visit his ill
wife Miyuki (Kayoko Kishimoto) in the hospital and learns from the doctor (Kenichi Yajima)
that her condition is terminal. Meanwhile, Horibe is ambushed by a young thug and left for
dead. <img src="images/rfireworks-1.gif" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="149">Paralyzed as
a result of his gunshot wounds, he is abandoned by his wife and child and moves to the
seaside where he spends his days in virtual solitude. After leaving the police force,
Nishi borrows heavily from a yakuza loan shark (Yasuei Yakushiji) to buy art supplies for
Horibe and send money to the widow of a colleague killed in the line of duty. Seemingly
uninterested in paying back the loan, Nishi concentrates instead on keeping Miyuki
comfortable and entertained &#150; until a painful memory prompted by a trip to a junkyard
near Tokyo Bay (the owner is played by Tetsu Watanabe, the warrior in Akira Kurosawa's <i>Ran</i>)
prompts him to plan and execute a bank robbery that will allow him to repay the debt and
take his wife on a trip to the Japanese countryside. Yet Nishi cannot escape his past, and
pursuit by yakuza hitman Tojo (rocker-turned-actor Hakuryu) and dogged newlywed detective
Nakamura (Kitano regular Susumu Terajima) leads to an oceanside showdown that is eerily
predicted by the paintings of the increasingly suicidal Horibe.</p>
<i>

<p>Fireworks</i> is a multileveled movie that demands rigorous attention: edited 14
different times under Kitano's supervision, it is presented in a complex series of
flashbacks and flash-forwards that metes out important narrative information in
tantalizingly brief increments (presumably guaranteeing the movie's perpetual popularity
on tape, disc and DVD) &#150; with much of the action of the film occurring off-screen and
important bits of information hinted at in passing or avoided altogether (how did Nishi's
daughter die? When and how did he quit the force?). </p>

<p>Yet vigilance is rewarded, as the narrative is distilled into Nishi's nearly wordless
quest for redemption in a bland world of urban sprawl, a journey made somewhat more
colorful during the vacation sequences late in the film that begin with the snows of Mt.
Fuji and conclude at the seaside (the latter is an ongoing Kitano obsession; his 1991 film
is called <i>A Scene at the Sea</i>).</p>

<p>The dualities of the film &#150; love and violence; deadpan humor and abrupt gunplay;
rusted junk and bright, imaginative art &#150; is explained by the original Japanese title
<i>Hana-Bi</i>. Separately, the words mean flower (&quot;Hana&quot;) and fire
(&quot;Bi&quot;), while unhyphenated it is the word for fireworks. &quot;I wanted to
portray life and death subjectively through the characters, who took on life and death
without escaping from them as they were confronted with cruel realities, when unexpected
events suddenly befell on them,&quot; Kitano explained. This tension, heightened by Joe
Hisaishi's lush, unabashedly sentimental score, gives the film much of it's power, as what
isn't said propels what is. Viewers never learn what exactly compels Nishi to do what he
does, but the viciousness of his temper, combined with the tenderness of his impulses, are
conflicting character traits with which everyone can empathize &#150; and which make for
great drama.</p>

<p><img src="images/rfireworks-2.gif" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="left" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="145">A huge media
personality in Japan (a 1995 Spy! magazine poll there anointed him the country's
best-liked man), he appears on around a half-dozen weekly TV shows on all the Japanese
networks (including &quot;Super Jockey,&quot; &quot;Takeshi's Book of Genesis&quot; and
&quot;Takeshi's 'Anyone Can Be Picasso'&quot;), has published upwards of 50 books of
criticism, poetry, essays and fiction (a recent title: &quot;Why They All Hate Me&quot;),
has since 1989 directed seven films that have been met with varying degrees of critical
acclaim (prompting one prominent critic to compare him simultaneously to Jean-Luc Godard <i>and</i>
Jerry Lewis), and has appeared in 17 more (including Nagisa Oshima's <i>Merry Christmas,
Mr. Lawrence</i> in 1983, Robert Longo's <i>Johnny Mnemonic</i> in 1994 and Toshihiro
Tenma's 1993 adaptation of his satirical novel about Japanese cults, <i>Many Happy Returns</i>).
</p>

<p>He first entered the public eye in the 1970s as half of a comic duo called <i>Tsuu
Biito</i> (&quot;The Two Beats&quot; &#150; the name Kitano acts under to this day) that
performed in the <i>manzai</i> style which closely resembles the vaudevillian interplay
between a suave straight man and his disheveled partner. </p>

<p>In the early 1980s he struck out on his own in an ensemble show called <i>Oretachi
Hyokinzoku</i> (&quot;We Are Wild And Crazy Guys&quot;) with a persona that suggests a
Japanese blend of Don Rickles' scabrous confrontational comedy with George Carlin's often
absurdist social criticism. At the same time he began the long-running late-night radio
show &quot;All Night Nippon,&quot; which featured his unique views on the world.</p>

<p>After a night of revelry in 1994, Kitano drove a moped into a Japanese Jersey Barrier.
The resulting skull fracture left him with facial paralysis that, in a final irony, lends
his often silent protagonists an enhanced air of sinister concentration (it was during his
convalescence that Kitano took up painting and had the idea for what eventually became <i>Fireworks</i>
&#150; that's his distinctive artwork in the film). </p>

<p><img src="images/rfireworks-3.gif" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" WIDTH="135" HEIGHT="200">In addition to
that expressive silence, a central component of Kitano's style is the vacuum of action,
each episode of violence occurring either in silent slow motion or with the jagged
abruptness of lightning during a particularly bad storm. &quot;Hollywood films used to be
able to shock you,&quot; the director told journalist Makoto Shinozaki. &quot;Those were
the times. The audience loved it back then. But then it became bigger and bigger, and we
got used to the most amazing explosions. None of it shocks us anymore. It's like a
fireworks show. It gets old fast to be told that they're going up and then seeing them
explode. If you don't expect it, a little firecracker can scare you. I think that's the
way to do it.&quot; More recently, he told the New York Times &quot;I believe that even
the most normal-seeking people have the capacity for violence.&quot; Thus Nishi can spend
time helping Miyuki assemble a simple yet deceptive wooden puzzle (a neat metaphor for the
movie itself), but still has the capacity to jam a chopstick into the eye of an offending
thug &#150; and cryptically apologize for it later.</p>

<p>The subject of articles in recent editions of such disparate publications as
&quot;Pulse!,&quot; &quot;Atlantic Monthly,&quot; &quot;Box Office,&quot;
&quot;Detour,&quot; &quot;Vogue,&quot; &quot;Wired&quot; and &quot;Film Comment&quot; (the
cover story), Fireworks &#150; winner of the Golden Lion best film award at the 1997
Venice Film Festival &#150; is the must-see movie of the moment for those interested in
the newest and most vivid developments in film language and style. And deservedly so:
along with his 1993 yakuza film <i>Sonatine</i> (coming soon to an art-house theater near
you courtesy of Quentin Tarantino's Miramax-funded distribution imprint Rolling Thunder), <i>Fireworks</i>
heralds the arrival in America of a talent who blends the conflicting emotions of his own
life into stylized morality plays in which characters win some and lose some &#150; and
maintain a kind of inarticulate dignity in the process. There is enough pain &#150; of
recent and impending loss, of ideals, of messy wounds and fists, of face, or respect
&#150; in <i>Fireworks</i> to make the emotion almost palpable, but it is offset by a
brooding, fragile beauty that ultimately balances the grief. And that's a duality that
makes for great and memorable art.</p>
