<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>After all the film
screenings, after all the deal-making, after
all the parties, after all the hoopla, and from the relative comfort of one's own
Macintosh (yes, back home with my loved ones), how to analyse the success or failure of

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The first issue is, of course, the most subjective. Generally speaking, global
productions seem to be more plentiful and focused of late, an indication that good stories
are finding newly-stimulated production funds. And while one had to look closely to find
new films from Latin America and Eastern Europe in Berlin (they were there, but mostly in
the International Market section - perhaps the titles weren't up to programming
standards), the Asian boom continues apace and high-profile German films, particularly
Matthias Glasner's <em>Sexy Sadie</em> (in the Panorama), Rainer Kaufmann's <em>Talk of
the Town</em> (New German Films) and Detley Buck's <em>Jail Bait</em> (International
Market), prove thal big, box office comedies are not beyond that industry's grasp.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In terms of the unusually large number and quality of Hollywood movies attracted to the
main competition section, Berlin Festival director Moritz de Hadeln (he of the &quot;Let's
wait, we'll see&quot; school on the festival's potential success way back on February 15th
- see <a href="fberlin96-1.html" target="_top">first report</a>) seemed satisfied with the reception of
the twelve US films in competition. And well he should be.</font> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For Hollywood gloss, little in
this day and age can beat a stogied John Travolta and Emma Thompson sharing a table in the
V.I.P. lounge of the opening night reception, Bruce Willis entertaining the A-list crowd
(including wife Demi Moore) at an R&amp;B concert following the German première of <a href="r12monky.html" target="_top"><em>12 Monkeys</em></a>, or director Robert Rodriguez'<i> </i>presiding
over a dead-of-night post-première blow out for <em>From Dusk Till Dawn</em> in a
ballroom rigged to evoke the ambience of the film's sleazy south-of-the-border saloon. Add
such high-profile personages as Jodie Foster, Danny De Vito, Holly Hunter, Robert Downey
Jr, Jack Lemmon, Terry Gilliam and Oliver Stone to the mix, and that says something to the
world about this festival's ability to attract, promote and entertain Hollywood stars.</font> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><img src="images/fberlin96-9.gif" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="144" HEIGHT="213">On the 10th anniversary of their organised presence in Berlin, American
independent films continue to generate strong interest. Todd Solondz' <em>Welcome to the
Dollhouse</em>, the grand prize winner at this year's Sundance Film Festival, sold to four
major territories - including Artificial Eye in the United Kingdom - after an enthusiastic
reception in the International Forum of Young Films. In the documentary category, Forum
audiences gave good marks to <em>The Battle Over Citizen Kane</em>, <a href="fccloset.html" target="_top"><em>The Celluloid Closet</em></a> and <em>The Gate of Heavenly Peace</em>.</font>
</p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In a particularly inspiring success
story from the International Market, Eve Annenberg's hip American comedy <em>Dogs: The
Rise and Fall of an All-Girl Bookie Joint</em> - which was rejected by Sundance but shown
in competition at the Rotterdam Festival shortly before its Berlin bow - apparently has
attracted the interest of buyers (traditionally, deals for American distribution are
initiated in Berlin, but not formalised and announced until the American Film Market -
from February 29th in Santa Monica, California - which most buyers and sellers left Berlin
early to make a beeline for).</font> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><img src="images/fberlin96-10.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="129" HEIGHT="180">The British industry
also fared well: although <a href="fberlin96-2.html#Restoration" target="_top"><em>Restoration</em></a> and <em>Mary Reilly</em> came
away empty-handed in the competition section (no surprise on the latter), the critical
success of <a href="fberlin96-2.html#Richard III" target="_top"><em>Richard III</em></a> (Maggie Smith
pictured) resulted in a Golden Bear for director Richard Loncraine - the jury usually sits
on the press show. <em>Brothers in Trouble</em>, Udayan Prasad's feature debut about the
adventures of a newly-arrived Pakistani immigrant, generated a buzz, as did Hettie
Macdonald's first film, the gay themed <em>Beautiful Thing</em>, which proved so popular
in the International Market (after reportedly being turned down by both the Panorama and
Forum) that extra screenings were hastily arranged to accomodate buyer demand. Offers,
apparently, are now flooding in.</font> </p>

<p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And finally, festival organisation.
After
five or six years of geographic and administrative changes resulting from 'the wall's'
demise and subsequent, seismic budgetary shockwaves, the event is once again perhaps the
smoothest-running and healthiest of the international lot. On a personal note, all or part
of 50 films in 12 days (including 35 features in their entirety) is about par for the
Berlin course, as their are those who see less (buyer/seller types, mostly) and those who
view significantly more (those never seen at parties or pubs and must be waylaid at
breakfast, of all things, for significant face time).</font> </p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The logistics of such a schedule require precision and this is entirely made possible
by a programming staff that, baring acts of God, shows what's on the schedule where it is
supposed to be shown and at exactly the right time. Not even a major 36-hour snowfall in
the middle of the festival had a significant impact, as each and every show went on as
scheduled (OK, one film in the market had to be postponed, but that was before the snow
and due to a shipping snafu).</font> </p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">So while for obvious reasons Berlin 1996 will be remembered as a pivotal year in the
festival's history for attracting Hollywood movies and stars, it continues to be a cinema
lover's paradise as well, providing ample opportunity for the appreciation of film art and
the conducting of movie business. That these two often strange bedfellows meet and
co-exist with such success is what makes for the continuing world class status of the
Berlin International Film Festival.</font> </p>
