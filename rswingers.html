American independent films can often be refreshing in spite of themselves. Now that such
powerful specialty distributors as Fine Line, October, Fox Searchlight and especially
Miramax Films are buying, enhancing and releasing low-budget independent fare (<em>Clerks</em>
and <em>The Brothers McMullen</em> being perhaps the most pervasive recent examples) in
significant numbers, the average American moviegoer has a sterling opportunity to sample
what young, motivated filmmakers are doing away from corporate control. Both engaging and
self-indulgent, <em>Swingers</em> is one of the most recent examples of this new indie
largesse and a splendid case study of what is good and bad about the boomlet.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Written by and starring a struggling young actor
named Jon Favreau (who shed 75 pounds since appearing as Sean Astin's classmate D-Bob in
1993's Rudy), <em>Swingers</em> illuminates the Los Angeles singles scene in which a
struggling young actor must rise above his remorse over a busted relationship back east to
live and love again. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">He sets about this task in a half-hearted way,
goaded on by his hyperactive young hipster pal Trent (Vince Vaughn, a pal of Favreau's who
was also in Rudy), with whom he cruises various L.A. bars. But while Trent is always
looking for &quot;babies,&quot; (women, according the film's half real, half invented
slang), Mike can't get over his girlfriend and is anxious to talk about her to
anyone--particularly the women they do manage to buttonhole on their various wanderings.
The resolution of this slender conflict, while ironic, is more the result of luck than
skill.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">On the plus side, <em>Swingers</em> has the energy
and earnestness that marks dependable up-and-coming talent. First-time director Doug
Liman, who bought the film rights from Favreau for a pittance after the actor refused to
sell out to studios looking for a star vehicle, served as his own cinematographer and
stages the action with wit and imagination. And the film serves as a fine primer for some
of the more spectacular retro watering holes to be found in the City of Angels,
particularly the semi-legendary fifties decor of the Dresden (where Jack Nicholson also
staged some of the action in The Two Jakes).</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">But Favreau the writer favors Favreau the actor to
the detriment of the material. Just when the leisurely pace seems to promise raunchy
insights on male bonding and mating rituals, the film bogs down in Mike's moping. Worse
still, Trent's immaturity and obnoxiousness undercuts any audience sympathy for him. And
after the first few reels, the jargon wears thin (Nadset this ain't). </font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Finally, while fluidly made and enthusiastically
played, like an eager young single with one too many martoonis under his belt, <em>Swingers</em>
isn't nearly as cool as it imagines itself to be. And while Mike himself is the subject of
a potentially good film about shy, decent guys trying to make it in a city where there's
much more emphasis placed on sizzle than steak, the frat-house sensibility of <em>Swingers</em>
never gives that story room to breathe. Unfortunately, it seems to be content to be an
affable, drawn-out, post-modern episode of &quot;Love, American Style.&quot; While that
may be fine for a low-budget debut -- the film was produced for a quarter of a million
dollars -- it is to be hoped that the subsequent careers of those who made <em>Swingers</em>
reveals the film for what it is: an overeager, slightly naive calling card. Nothing to be
ashamed of, certainly, but nothing to write home about, either.</font></p>
