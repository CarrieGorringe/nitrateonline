<p><big><strong><big>M</big></strong>ulan</i> is the latest Disney goldmine to hit
thousands of screens and millions of Happy Meals. I can&#146;t vouch for the food (well,
the fries are heavenly), but the film will quench your animated thirst for once upon a
time during the hot summer days ahead. Nearly 700 artists, animators, and technicians have
created one of the studio&#146;s more memorable efforts and certainly the finest animated
feature since <i>The Lion King</i>. Twentieth Century-Fox and Warner Bros., both rumored
to be on the verge of shuttering their animation units, particularly the latter after the
abysmal reception of its <i>Quest for Camelot</i>, may find <i>Mulan</i> to be the stake
through their hearts. The conspicuous success of this cartoon masterpiece will assure the
Mouse&#146;s continued reign over Toon Town.</big></p>

<p><img src="images/rmulan-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="224" HEIGHT="162">Stunningly
photographed and epic in scope, this creative retelling of one of China&#146;s most
popular legends has been modernized with hip American slang and a wealth of visual and
verbal humor, forged from the hands of six (credited) screenwriters and enhanced by an
uplifting score by Jerry Goldsmith and a handful of immensely hummable songs by composer
Matthew Wilder and lyricist David Zippel. It works amazingly well, quite beyond what I was
expecting. This admirable chronicle of a young woman who masquerades as a man in the
Imperial army brings both heroic and comic characterizations into play. Yes, a Disney
formula, but the chemistry performs wonderfully. The brave free-spirit Mulan, voiced by
Ming-Na Wen (<i>The Joy Luck Club</i>, <i>E.R.</i>, and <i>The Single Guy</i>) and sung by
Lea Salonga (who provided Princess Jasmine&#146;s musical side in <i>Aladdin</i>), plays
the straight man/woman to Eddie Murphy&#146;s wise-cracking and pint-sized dragon Mushu, a
runt of a beast ushered back into reluctant service by Mulan&#146;s ghostly family
ancestors. The voiceless cricket Cri-Kee inspires some of the many sight gags that
populate the film (including the early incapacitation of a local Matchmaker), obviously
enlivened by the little critter&#146;s designer, Disney veteran Joe Grant, who created the
Witch/Queen in <i>Snow White</i> and wrote <i>Dumbo</i>.</p>

<p>As the first feature primarily produced at Disney&#146;s animation facility in Florida,
the Southern production team is to be commended for a thoroughly enjoyable tale that might
just make most of America&#146;s young female audience forget their infatuation with
Leonardo DiCaprio. While <i>Mulan</i> is indeed a family picture, there will be those late
teens and twenty- and thirty-somethings who will pass it by in favor of Fox&#146;s <i>X-Files</i>.
Well, their loss. Those of you with kids &#150; either they&#146;ll beg you to take them,
or you be sure to bring them along if you breach the subject of heading off to the movies
this weekend. As a cautionary note, this is a tale of cross-dressing and, although told in
a totally innocuous manner, the filmmakers go overboard with hilarious exuberance during a
climactic battle scene that is remindful of <i>Priscilla, Queen of the Desert</i> and <a href="rtowong.html" target="_top"><i>To Wong Foo, Thanks for Everything, Julie Newmar</i></a>.</p>

<p><img src="images/rmulan-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="224" HEIGHT="132">The cast of offbeat
army recruits surrounding Mulan is an animated amalgam of Dirty Dozen misfits, the Seven
Dwarfs, and the Three Stooges, including Chien-Po (Jerry S. Tondo), a gentle giant
oriental version of Baby Huey; the temperamental and gruff Yao (Harvey Fierstein); and
Ling (Gedde Watanabe), a gangly troublemaker. Their fearless leader is the handsome,
brawny Captain Shang (B.D. Wong, sung by Donny Osmond), the quintessential Disney love
interest of the secretive Mulan. Of course, every Uncle Walt film has to have its nasty
and Shan-Yu (Miguel Ferrer) is one Hun-ey of a hunky bad guy. His menacing army is drawn
in drab grays and browns, offsetting the colorful brights of the Imperial forces, often
set against minimalist backgrounds.</p>

<p>Freshman co-director Barry Cook credits his inspiration to Charlie Chaplin and David
Lean. The latter influence is particularly evident in the Hun mountainside advance of
2,000 soldiers on the Imperial troops and a later crowd sequence of 30,000 in the Imperial
City. These sequences were made possible by advances in computer generated imagery
overseen by co-director Tony Bancroft, also making his directing bow. And while <i>Mulan</i>
uses more computer imagery than any previous Disney effort, its addition benefits the
movie without detracting from the charm of the old fashion style of traditional hand-drawn
character animation.</p>
<i>

<p>Mulan</i> is imaginative beyond your wildest dreams. It&#146;s stunning visuals &#150;
be it a watery reflection or a soft snowfall &#150; and verbal barbs will have you
watching in awe and rolling in laughter. You&#146;ll root for the good guys and howl with
delight when the gray meanies get their rightful comeuppance. Whoopee!</font></p>
