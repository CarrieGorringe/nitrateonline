<p><font size="5"><strong>B</strong></font><font size="4">efore <em>The Rock</em> even
opened this June, there was an elegiac air about the film, an impression created even
before the death of producer Don Simpson on January 19 of this year, midway through the
film's production. The team of Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, best known as the
producers of testosterone-laden hits such as <em>Top Gun</em> and <em>Bad Boys</em> (and
flops like <em>Days of Thunder</em>), had been dissolved a month or so beforehand, for
reasons most intimately related to Simpson's lifestyle choices, the least flagrant of
which were an addiction to yo-yo dieting and a use of recreational drugs that was
considered profligate, even by Hollywood standards. So, as the final Simpson-Bruckheimer
co-production, <em>The Rock</em> carried with it the burden of being the final nail in the
coffin, if you'll pardon the metaphor, of both Simpson's career and the partnership.
Paraphrasing Proust, the film carried the remembrance of things already past. It was the
ultimate paradox: a museum piece fresh off the assembly line, but one with a subtext of
scandal surrounding it. In this era of &quot;rediscovering&quot; moral values, Hollywood
must have been holding its breath somewhat.</font></p>

<p>Fortunately for all concerned, Simpson's notoriety did not extend beyond the environs
of LA, and <em>The Rock</em> is a worthy successor to others in what might be described,
with some stretching of imagination, as the Simpson-Bruckheimer oeuvre. Within the
confines of Alcatraz prison, sits Francis X. Hummel (Harris), a spit-and-polish Marine
general who has decided to stop polishing his medals and boots and begin spitting on the
US Government. This hero of Vietnam and the Gulf War is hopping mad because the government
refuses to pay any benefits to the families of the covert operatives that General Hummel
had commanded, or to acknowledge their contributions in making the world safe for
democracy and Coca-Cola. So the General and his rogue forces have commandeered Alcatraz
and demanded recognition and benefits, plus $100 million as an up-front fee for their role
as coercive consultants. If the Government does not settle the account to his satisfaction
within forty hours, General Hummel has some hostages that he can eliminate, and, if this
threat is insufficiently persuasive, then the back-up plan involves several missiles
containing very deadly VX gas with enough homicidal force to eliminate several major
cities on the West Coast, but especially San Francisco and its environs. </p>

<p>Naturally, the government doesn't take too nicely to being threatened by a renegade
general, even if he is a hero. So the government brings in Dr. Stanley Goodspeed (Cage) an
FBI agent who is an expert in chemical warfare. It also reclaims one John Patrick Mason
(Connery) from thirty-some-odd years of penal mothballing. Mason, a former MI-5 agent, was
committed to Alcatraz for having stolen microfilmed copies of J. Edgar Hoover's covert
files on anybody unfortunate enough to fall within his paranoid purview. More importantly,
official stories to the contrary, Mason is posited as the only individual to have escaped
from Alcatraz (as anyone who has ever toured the forbidding, island-based structure, or
who has stood in the prison's exercise yard in the wake of the icy winds coming off the
even icier waters of San Francisco Bay knows, this would not be an inconsiderable
accomplishment). Mason's knowledge of the prison's underbelly is invaluable, since
available blueprints have long since dwindled into irrelevance. A car chase and several
personal angles later, accompanied by a contingent of Navy SEALS, Mason and Goodspeed
hasten to Alcatraz to settle the general's hash, free the hostages and disarm the
missiles. </p>

<p>Assessing the effectiveness of a typical Simpson-Bruckheimer offering is never really
easy, for the simple reason that their films are not so much the type to which someone
reacts as they are the type of film that specializes in audience shakedown. It's passive
filmgoing with a vengeance: through machine-gun editing, 120-decibel sound and
overwhelming special effects, these films push you further and further back into the
padding of your seat in retreat until, confronted by the hard seat back, you wave a white
flag and capitulate to your pummeling like a good little attendee, ignoring such
trivialities as plot lines so full of faults they could pass for the San Andreas and
dialogue that alternates between some degree of prescient wit and lines that belong to the
category of first-class groaners (Poor Sean Connery gets the worst of this: Mason starts
out with urbanely clever dialogue, with a sly reference to Connery's Bondian past -- at
his first meeting with Goodspeed, Mason utters a line borrowed verbatim from <em>Diamonds
Are Forever</em> -- only to be reduced to making asinine declarations such as &quot;heroes
get to f--- the prom queen&quot; by the film's halfway point). </p>

<p>This is not to say that such films are not entertaining, merely that the audience
members can only react to them in the way that they might react to a tidal wave. And <em>The
Rock</em>, for all of its faults, is entertaining. It helps that director Bay has followed
the most important dictum in making this type of film: keep the action moving, stupid. And
he does, even to the point where keeping subjects within the frame is a more high-risk
proposition than the stunts themselves. A most notable offender in this case is the
car-chase sequence through San Francisco, in which Nicholas Cage's head is often bisected
perpendicularly too many times for visual comfort. This is nothing more than permitting
style to overcome basic rules of visual content. Instead of attempting to outdo such car
chases as those in <em>Bullitt</em> and <em>The French Connection</em>, Bay (the director
of <em>Bad Boys</em>, TV commercials, and music videos) should have reviewed them for
their ability to keep actors in frame at speeds of over 100 miles per hour. All the action
in the world won't help if the audience can't make head or tail of it.</p>

<p>However, the real saving grace in <em>The Rock</em> is the marvelous pair of
performances from Connery and Cage, both of whom seem to have set their irony quotients on
a setting high enough to get the audience over the most improbable portions of the film,
but not so high that the enterprise at hand falls over into the realm of self-parody. It's
a balancing act of almost exquisitely-painful proportions, and part of the fun comes from
watching the two actors shifting around in their roles and pulling back just at the brink.
In particular, Cage gives a performance that is a pleasure to watch from beginning to end;
usually I find the underlying goofiness of his typical on-screen persona a little much to
bear at some point in a film, but it works here, probably because it accentuates the
film's unspoken dictum that you would have to be more than a little unbalanced in the
cranium to make chemical weapons your life's work. Harris's portrayal of duty and honor
run amok is at times a bit too rigidly stereotypical, but works well enough most of the
time to act as an effective counterpoint to the Connery/Cage teaming. But, a note to
Messrs. Weisberg, Cook and Rosner for your next screenplay: we could do without the whiny
women such as Goodspeed's fiancée, Carla (Marcil), who rediscovers her religion's stance
on unwed motherhood at about the same time as she discovers her unplanned pregnancy
(apparently she neglected to ascertain beforehand that fornication was also on her
religion's list of proscribed activities). If her unmarried state was meant to engender
some sort of narrative tension, it provided no payoff; there would have been greater
tension (and more pleasure on my part) had she been securely fastened to a VX missile.</p>

<p>In sum, Bay and company have chiseled out a relatively solid action-adventure offering,
one of the best being proffered so far this summer. Unlike so many others in its genre, it
does not sink like a stone, and has enough facets to project a reasonably high-wattage
glow. </p>
