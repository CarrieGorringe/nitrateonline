<p><big><strong><big><a name="Big_Chill" target="_top">The Big Chill</a></i> (1983) (January 26)</big></strong></big></p>

<p>There's no new footage added to the 15th anniversary re-release of this seminal comedy
drama about seven college friends reuniting at a funeral from writer-director Lawrence
Kasdan, meaning that on the tape, anyway, there's still no sign of Kevin Costner, who
played the dead college buddy in flashbacks that were cut before the film's release (the
DVD offers a new 56-minute &quot;Making Of&quot; documentary as well as nine minutes of
outtakes and the letterboxed trailer for <i>Silverado</i>, the movie Kasdan subsequently
wrote for Costner). Still, the film continues to carry an undeniable emotional punch, as
much now for the youthful look of the soon-to-be all-star cast (including Glenn Close,
Kevin Kline, Tom Berenger, William Hurt, Jeff Goldblum and Jobeth Williams) and remastered
Motown oldies soundtrack as for the message: &quot;I had written the film not just from my
view of the issues,&quot; remembers Kasdan, &quot;but also in reaction to <i>Body Heat</i>,
where I'd been cloistered with two actors in a terribly claustrophobic movie. I'd
determined that my next film would have a lot of actors and that I wouldn't be stuck in an
airless world.&quot; Thankfully, <i>The Big Chill</i> still breathes. The video edition
includes a CD soundtrack sampler.</p>

<p><strong><big><big><em><a name="Disturbing_Behavior" href="rdisturbing.html" target="_top">Disturbing
Behavior</a></em> (1998)</big></big></strong></p>

<p>Marginally more interesting than the teen slasher movies now in vogue, <i>Disturbing
Behavior</i> updates both <i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</i> and <i>The Stepford Wives</i>
by positing a world where exasperated parents have taken drastic measures to keep their
rowdy high school-aged children in line (think mad scientists). When hunk-with-a-past
James Marsden moves into the idyllic Cradle Bay, he immediately notices that the usual
clashing of cliques seems to be a deadly serious sport, made all the more harrowing by the
nearly bionic Blue Ribbons. Taking on this squeaky clean juggernaut with the help of bad
girl Rachel (Katie Holmes), they soon find the town's horrible secret. Made more
atmospheric by the production values of director David Nutter and what looks to be a large
chunk of the &quot;X-Files&quot; crew (back when they were filming in the Vancouver area),
the movie is at its best when Nick Stahl's stoner Gavin (Stahl can currently be seen in
The Thin Red Line) and his buddy U.V. (Chad E. Donella) are describing and analyzing the
intricate caste system found in high schools everywhere. Also featuring Bruce Greenwood,
from Atom Egoyan's <a href="rhereafter.html" target="_top"><i>The Sweet Hereafter</i></a>, as the
mustachioed bad guy and the all-purpose William Sandler (the heavy in <i>Die Hard II</i>, <i>Death
in Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey</i>, the unfortunate astronaut in <i>Rocket Man</i>) as
the sinister but sincere custodian. Also available on DVD, where the film is accompanied
by 11 deleted scenes, Nutter's commentary and the music video for The Flys' &quot;Got You
Where I Want You&quot; featuring both Marsden and Holmes. </p>

<p><strong><big><big><a name="54" href="r54.html" target="_top">54</a></i> (1998)</big></big></strong></p>

<p>The legend of the hot New York City disco of the late 1970s and early 1980s certainly
lends itself to a flashy movie treatment, but other than a few moments of wit and a
terrific performance by Mike Myers as impressario Steve Rubell -- constantly high and
flirting with every boy in sight -- <i>54</i> isn't that movie. Ryan Philippe is Shane, a
bargain-basement Tony Manero selected by Rubell from the surging crowd outside the fabled
velvet rope to be a lowly, barechested busboy at the fabled club. Parlaying his body and
his luck into a plum bartending job, Shane befriends a married couple whose union is being
torn apart by the pressures of emulating the jet-set life while toiling at the club. Other
than Myers' courageous performance (like Robin Williams and Jim Carrey before him, he'll
be thrilling when he finally gets a drama worthy of his talents), the film has few moments
of genuine interest, the best of which is probably Salma Hayek's wistful Anita trying to
teach disco moves to a hopelessly lead-footed bunch. Beset by script problems and all-out
warfare during the editing process, this obviously sincere effort from writer-director
Mark Christopher (who was there and apparently remembers much of what went on) has none of
the rhythm of the music it glorifies, and precious little of the panache. For a more
verisimilous look at this bizarre chapter in American pop culture, try <i>Saturday Night
Fever</i> (New York edition) and <a href="rboogie.html" target="_top"><i>Boogie Nights</i></a> (west
coast chapter).</p>

<p><strong><big><big><a name="How_Stella_Got" href="rstella.html" target="_top">How Stella Got Her
Groove Back</a></i> (1998)</big></big></strong></p>

<p>Forty-year-old workaholic San Francisco stockbroker Stella Payne (Angela Bassett,
luminous and in great shape), &quot;stuck on stale&quot; in her love life, follows up on
her young son's admonishment to &quot;have some fun while I'm gone&quot; by finding
fulfillment in the arms of 20-year-old Winston Shakespeare (Taye Diggs) during an
impulsive vacation in Montego Bay, Jamaica. But once the interlude is over, she's got to
deal not only with her skeptical friends but his disapproving parents in Jamaica, her best
friend's failing health in New York and her own conflicted feelings -- and sudden
unemployment -- as well. <i>How Stella Got Her Groove Back</i> is a glossy, tastefully
done melodrama that expands on Terry McMillan's autobiographical novel (she co-scripted
with <i>Rain Man</i> writer Ron Bass) with the addition of Whoopi Goldberg as Stella's pal
Delilah Abraham, a sort of Greek chorus whose often profane and up-to-the-minute
wisecracks (including &quot;Miss Thing,&quot; &quot;fly,&quot; and &quot;don't go
there,&quot; which gets said a lot) are as funny as they are ephemeral (&quot;if he's
almost of age then it's almost not a felony,&quot; she says reasonably). Director Kevin
Rodney Sullivan keeps things smooth, although at two hours plus the film's leisurely pace
and episodic nature becomes wearying. The star-studded soundtrack, produced by Jimmy Jam
and Terry Lewis, features tunes by Big Punisher featuring Beenie Man, Mary J. Blige, Boyz
II Men featuring Chante Moore, Kevin Ford featuring Rufus Blaq and more. Also available on
DVD. </p>

<p><strong><big><big><a name="Love_and_Death_on_Long_Island" target="_top">Love and Death on Long Island</a></i>
(1997) </big></big></strong></p>

<p>One of the best movies of 1998 that nobody saw, Richard Kwietniowski's crowd-pleasing <i>Love
and Death on Long Island</i> features the part of a lifetime for John Hurt (<i>Contact</i>,
<i>The Elephant Man</i>). The great character actor is charmingly eccentric as Giles
De'Ath, a reclusive and fussy intellectual British Luddite who falls head over heels for
Ronnie Bostock (Jason Priestley), the shallow young American movie star currently
appearing in <i>Hot Pants College II</i> (De'Ath mixed up the theaters on his way to the
latest Forster adaptation, an easy mistake to make in a multiplex -- especially if you've
never set foot in one) . Making a sheepish pilgrimmage to the Long Island house of his
hero after collecting clippings from teen magazines in a dossier he labels
&quot;Bostockiana,&quot; De'Ath ingratiates himself into the actor's life but discovers
that the path of his heart is not without its perils. Adapted for his first feature by
Kwietniowski from the novel by Gilbert Adair, <i>Love and Death on Long Island</i> also
features a heroically selfless performance by Priestley as the poster boy of celebrity
dimwits; any actor capable of playing that role straight demands to be taken seriously.
And as for Hurt, if his name is called out among final five Best Actor Oscar nominees come
February 9, well, you read it first on <em>Nitrate Online</em> over a year ago --
following the film's premiere at the <a href="ftiff97-3.html#Love_and_Death" target="_top">1997 Toronto
International Film Festival</a>. </p>

<p><strong><big><big><a name="Mafia!" href="rmafia.html" target="_top">Mafia!</a></i> (1998)</big></big></strong></p>

<p></i>When only tasteless, stupid and 90 minutes tops will do, <em>Mafia!</em> is a
can't-miss rental choice, a proudly and profoundly goofy riff on gangster movies from
Airplane! co-director Jim Abrahams that manages to send up <a href="rcasino.html" target="_top"><em>Casino</em></a>,
<em>The Wizard of Oz</em> and <em><a href="rtwister.html" target="_top">Twister</a></em> before the
opening credits are even over but also finds time to spoof <em>The Godfather</em> trilogy,
Sergio Leone's <em>Once Upon a Time in America</em>,<em> Il Postino</em>, <em>The English
Patient</em>, <em>Cocktail</em>, <em><a href="rlostworld.html" target="_top">Jurassic Park: The Lost
World</a></em>, <em>Forrest Gump</em>, and Hollywood's then-current obsession with
literary adaptations (the original title, which steal appears on screen, was <em>Jane
Austen's Mafia!</em>). Lloyd Bridges (to whom the film is dedicated) is featured as
Vincenzo Armani Windbreaker Cortino, scion of the great American crime family taken into
modern times by Jay Mohr (in the Al Pacino role) at the famous Las Vegas landmark
Peppermill Casino (where one game is called &quot;You Absolutely Can't Win&quot;).
Although fun, there is one caveat: even for the genre this wild, the movie has a few
scenes -- the cattle prod in the casino bit and the mass funeral regurgitation sequence
chief among them -- that are almost uncomfortably gross. At this writing the DVD is
scheduled to be released February 9.<i></p>

<p><big><strong><big><a name="Wild_Ride" target="_top">Mister Toad's Wild Ride</a></i> (aka <i>The Wind
in the Willows</i>) (1996)</big></strong></big></p>

<p></i>Barely released theatrically under its original title (the sad result of a lawsuit
that shifted theatrical rights from Disney to Columbia, which decided not to spend
promotional funds to hype this eventual Disney video release), this merry new live-action
version of Kenneth Grahame's beloved kiddie classic &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot; is
nothing less than an unheralded Monty Python reunion of sorts: directed by and starring
Terry Jones as the intrepid but quite daft Toad, the movie features Eric Idle as Rat,
Michael Palin as the Sun and John Cleese as Toad's lawyer (Graham Chapman is dead and
Terry Gilliam was probably too busy with <em><a href="rfllv.html" target="_top">Fear and Loathing in Las
Vegas</a></em>). Also starring British comedian Steve Coogan (who does various voices on
the animated cable show &quot;Bob and Margaret&quot; and is fictitious sportscaster Alan
Partridge on the legendary British series &quot;the Day Today&quot;) as a fine Mole, Nicol
Williamson as Badger (the actor seems to be turning into Darren McGavin) and Antony Sher
as the leader of the larcenous Moles, the film takes that sort of Victorian fantasy era
look favored by the Pythons and fits it snugly around a by-and-large faithful reading of
the story and atmosphere of the book (itself a cautionary tale of the Industrial Age),
which is in turn supplemented by some pleasant music-hall influenced production numbers.
One of the genuine video finds of the month, and highly recommended for sophisticated
children and adults alike. <i></p>

<p><strong><big><big><a name="Out_of_Sight" href="routsight.html" target="_top">Out of Sight</a></i>
(1998)</big></big></strong></p>

<p></i>Although written about extensively on <em>Nitrate Online</em>, those who missed
this earthy yet elegant caper adapted from the Elmore Leonard novel can now catch up with
it on tape and DVD (the latter of which features lots of extras and goodies, including
deleted scenes and the obligatory director's commentary -- and the gorgeous photography of
Elliot Davis is alone worth the price of switching to the new format). George Clooney and
Jennifer Lopez have the year's hottest and most improbable relationship as the career
recidivist who can't quite make that big score and the federal agent who is attracted to
him -- despite their professions. Both on its own and as a companion piece to Quentin
Tarantino's sadly under-appreciated <em><a href="rjackieb.html" target="_top">Jackie Brown</a></em>
(they even share a few marginal characters) this is a movie that rewards repeated viewing,
not the least of which for Scott Frank's extraordinary screenplay structure (he also
adapted <em><a href="rgetshrt.html" target="_top">Get Shorty</a></em>) and the precise, canny direction
of Steven Soderbergh (sex, lies &amp; videotape). although probably too steeped in genre
to factor in at Oscar time, Out of Sight is one of 1998's best movies and a template for
how Leonard's books should be treated by filmmakers. <i></p>

<p><strong><big><big><a name="Return_to_Paradise" target="_top">Return to Paradise</a></i> (1998)</big></big></strong></p>

<p></i>Suffering from a fundamental dramatic contradiction -- thriller or moral tract? --
this cautionary tale of two buddies who reunite at the incessant goading of a lawyer to
try and spring a barely-known pal from a Malaysian jail seemed ripped from the headlines
when it opened theatrically in August (remember those American students detained in
Myanmar?). Vince Vaughn and Anne Heche, seen later in the year in Gus Van Sant's
provocative remake of Psycho, give taut performances and the direction of Joseph Ruben (<em>True
Believer</em>) is smart and brooding. As the focus of their efforts, Joaquin Phoenix,
who's in <a href="rclaypig.html" target="_top"><em>Clay Pigeons</em></a> with Vaughn, brings a harrowing
anguish to his role. Yet the whole is less than the sum of the parts, probably due to the
tension between the unvarnished story original writer Bruce Robinson (<em>The Killing
Fields</em>) wanted to tell and the more melodramatic elements injected by Wesley Strick,
who wrote that remake of <em>Cape Fear</em> for Martin Scorsese. In fact, <em>Return to
Paradise</em> is itself a drastically altered remake of the 1989 French film <em>Force
Majeure</em>, which is even more remorseless than this version's decidedly un-Hollywood
ending. Made with undeniable commitment but done in by a fatal compromise, <em>Return to
Paradise</em> can't find the strength within itself to sacrifice sensationalism for
straight-ahead storytelling. At this writing the DVD is scheduled for an April 27 release.<i>

<p><strong><big><big><a name="The_Truman_Show" href="rtrumanshow.html" target="_top">The Truman Show</a></i>
(1998)</big></big></strong></p>

<p></i>Among the most subversive mainstream Hollywood films in recent memory, Peter Weir's
<em>The Truman Show</em> was an early year critical favorite that was that rare thing: a
box office success too. In the seriocomic role he'd been searching for, Jim Carrey is
Truman Burbank, an average guy on the island of Seahaven whose life, unknown to him, is
the subject of an immensely popular globally broadcast television show. Everything around
him is fake and everyone in his life and in Seahaven is an actor, hired and coordinated by
the show's creator, Cristof (Ed Harris, looking improbably smart in a beret and those
little accountant glasses that are all the rage). Movies that satirize the media are a
dime a dozen in this self-referential age, but what lifts <em>The Truman Show</em> to the
rarified heights of such groundbreaking meditations on cinema and self as <em>Citizen Kane</em>
and<em> O Lucky Man!</em> is the fortunate confluence of clever script, Weir's assured
direction (anyone less seasoned couldn't've sustained the concept through an entire
feature), the imaginative photography of Burkhard Dallwitz and the cheery, selfless and
grateful performance of Carrey, who seems to be so happy to have a movie of substance --
with no fart jokes! -- that he fairly busts out of nearly every scene. Although the
reformatted rental video ruins the essential joke of the movie (5,000 hidden cameras
record his every move), the shimmering and properly framed DVD makes up for it<i></p>

<p><strong><big><big><i><a name="Buffalo_66" target="_top">Buffalo 66</a></i> (1998)</big></big></strong></p>

<p></i></i>As vibrant, original, cryptic, self-conscious and raw a film as any released in
1998, the directorial debut of co-writer and composer Vincent Gallo stars the actor as
Billy Brown, a recently paroled felon who kidnaps Christina Ricci's waifish Layla from a
tap-dancing class to bring home to the bizarre parents (Ben Gazzara and Anjelica Huston)
who have no idea that their son's been behind bars. When their reunion proves less than
cathartic, the two embark on a shambling tour of Buffalo (the title refers to Billy's year
of birth) that brings them to a series of bowling alleys, bars and strip joints as the
wound up but clueless Billy works up the nerve to shoot Scott Wood, the Bills place-kicker
whose missed field goal cost the team a Super Bowl victory. Featuring pungent cameos from
Mickey Rourke, Rosanna Arquette and Jan-Michael Vincent (raspy-voiced and light year's
from The World's Greatest Athlete) Gallo's minimalist, formal directorial approach is
scored to Gazzara's lip-synching of Vincent Gallo Sr.'s version of &quot;Fools Rush In
(Where Angels Fear to Tread),&quot; King Crimson's &quot;Moonchild,&quot; &quot;I Remember
When&quot; by Stan Getz and two tunes by Yes, &quot;Sweetness&quot; and the immortal
&quot;Heart of the Sunrise&quot; (don't miss the eye-catching trailer, which is scored to
the latter and featured on both the tape and DVD). Among others, the movie is dedicated to
&quot;the beautiful city of Buffalo and all the wonderful Buffalonians&quot; Give it time
and Buffalo 66 might pull you in. Then again, it might not.<i><i></p>

<p></i></i>And speaking of quirky: although not for every taste, Hal Hartley's
eccentrically plotted movies also yield tangible rewards for the patient moviegoer. In his
latest droll opus, newcomer Thomas Jay Ryan stars as the eponymous drifter, a character
Hartley says was drawn from &quot;Faust and Kasper Hauser.&quot; Henry has an explosive
effect on the lives of shy garbageman Simon Grim (James Urbaniak) and his disfunctional
family, which includes his morose mom (Maria Porter) and earthy sister (Parker Posey).
Henry's been working on an epic handwritten poem called &quot;Confession,&quot; and at his
urging Simon begins to write too -- in the process upstaging the mysterious stranger.
Fuelled by beer and smokes, Hartley's band feel their way towards some sort of peace.
&quot;I wanted to tell a story about influence,&quot; he explained. &quot;both artistic
and personal. I considered this possibility: what happens if your most profound influence
is somebody whom you're kind of ashamed of or you'd be embarrassed to admit?&quot; Video
is peculiarly suited for his leisurely stories (which include <em>The Unbelievable Truth</em>,
<em>Trust</em>, <em>Simple Men</em>, <em>Amateur</em> and <em>Flirt</em>), making
Hartley's theatrically cold stories oddly warm in the comfort of the home viewing
environment.<i><i></p>

Stranger</i> (1991)/<i>Nobody's Business</i> (1996)</big></big></strong></p>

<p></i></i>In the mid-1980s, documentary filmmaker Alan Berliner made an hour long film, <em>The
Family Album</em>, that uses found footage and audio collage to examine the struggles and
joys of relatives and relationships. In 1991, Berliner followed that with <em>Intimate
Stranger</em>, which explored the odyssey of his grandfather, a Palestinian Jew who was as
successful in his post-World War II business dealings in Japan as he was wretchedly inept
at raising his family in America. In 1996, Berliner completed the saga with <em>Nobody's
Business</em>, in which the filmmaker drags his bitter and reluctant father Oscar kicking
and screaming in front of the camera to examine how a life of such promise, honor and
drive could be described by the man who lived it as &quot;nothing.&quot; Seen together,
the cumulative effect of these remarkable movies is both exhilarating and devastating, as
the doggedly determined Berliner chips away at his father's facade to find the idealistic,
now elusive young man within -- and in the process reminds the viewer how deceptive and
fragile recorded history can be. This extraordinary trilogy is available individually or
at a discount for the set from Milestone, the same folks who distribute &quot;Beat&quot;
Takeshi's <em>Fireworks</em> (Hana-Bi), and is highly recommended.<i><i></p>

<p><strong><big><big><a name="Kurt_Courtney" target="_top">Kurt &amp; Courtney</a></i> (1997)</big></big></strong></p>

<p></i></i></i>Moviegoers unfamiliar with or just plain uninterested in the saga of late
musician Kurt Cobain, his band Nirvana, outspoken wife Courtney Love and the now-quaint
grunge movement that sprang from Seattle in the early years of this decade (the kids wore
flannel, the hot bands all sounded like faster versions of Deep Purple? No?) will probably
react to the controversial documentary Kurt &amp; Courtney by avoiding the Pacific
Northwest, which comes off as wet, wild and profoundly weird. It isn't, of course, and
that's sort of the point: in the scattershot oeuvre of filmmaker Nick Broomfield, who in
the past has inserted himself into documentaries supposedly about Margaret Thatcher, Heidi
Fleiss, Lily Tomlin and serial killer Aileen Wuornos -- see a pattern here? -- accuracy
takes a back seat to mood, as the perpetually befuddled filmmaker runs around in his
trademark headphones, waving a boom microphone and trying to puzzle his way through
another project that he seems to be making up as he goes along (&quot;reeaallly...&quot;
is one of his favorite responses to an interviewee's statement). </p>

<p>Anybody with an emotional involvement in this vivid chapter of rock and roll history
will be initially fascinated by Broomfield's controversial premise. Did Love kill Cobain,
or pay someone else to do so? What -- if anything -- Love had to do with it is never
properly explained, much less verified. Kurt &amp; Courtney is hard to watch, an almost
painful story that ends -- perhaps as it must -- with Broomfield's favorite home movie
image of the dead rock star, frozen on an out-of-focus long shot that gives him an
unintentionally ghoulish death's head mask. Oh, and due to a tiff with the widow there's
no Nirvana music in the entire film. <i><i><i></p>

<p></i></i></i>One of the most spectacular misfires in the annals of recent American
independent film -- the so-called horror film <em>Office Killer</em> is the directorial
debut of celebrated photographer Cindy Sherman. When Constant Consumer magazine suffers a
downsizing at the hands of a ruthless editor-in-chief (Barbara Sukowa), meek copy editor
Doreen (Carol Kane) goes quietly over the edge and begins stalking her officemates
(including Molly Ringwald and Jeanne Tripplehorn). Not nearly as ribald as it thinks it
is, the movie squanders an intriguing cast on annoyingly strident characters and manages
its supposedly celebrated gore effects with a self-consciousness that negates their power.
Famous for her bizarre self-portraits and work that might be called Gothic Irony, Sherman
must've spent all her time in the darkroom, because she clearly has no idea what makes a
horror film tick. <i><i><i></p>

<p><strong><big><big><a name="Pi" href="rpi.html" target="_top">Pi</a></i> (1998)</big></big></strong></p>

<p></i></i></i>Winner of the Best Director award at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival,
writer-director Darren Aronofsky has made a debut feature that is an absorbing, cerebral
black and white thriller about obsessive, headache-plagued mathematician Maximillian Cohen
(Sean Gullette) and his quest to confirm and apply the mythical 216-digit number (3.14 is
the generally accepted abbreviated value of the title) to both stock market figures and
the Hebrew-language Torah using his homemade supercomputer Euclid. While plausibly written
and played, perhaps the real star of the film is cinematographer Matthew Libatique, who
shot it on notoriously hard-to-handle reversal film and, along with Aronofsky, developed a
number of technical innovations (dubbed the &quot;Heat-Cam&quot; and the
&quot;Vibrator-Cam&quot;) that allow the look of the film to precisely mirror the
protagonist's deteriorating mental state. As a bonus, the rental version screened was in
the increasingly popular letterboxed format, which allows the image to be reproduced in
the same ratio as the theatrical presentation (that's what those black bars above and
below the image are for). The goodie-packed DVD includes music videos, production notes,
the theatrical trailer, behind the scenes footage, deleted scenes and Aronofsky's
commentary. <i><i><i></p>

<p><strong><big><big><a name="Slums" href="rslums.html" target="_top">Slums of Beverly Hills</a></i>
(1998)</big></big></strong></p>

<p></i></i></i>On the eve of her entrance to Beverly Hills High School in 1976, Vivian
Abramowitz (Natasha Lyonne) has more than her share of challenges: in addition to
developing rapidly for her age, she's the middle child in a motherless, nomadic and barely
functional family lead by struggling salesman Murray (Alan Arkin). Alighting at the
rundown Casa Bella apartment complex south of Santa Monica Boulevard in the flats of
Beverly Hills, Vivian navigates her siblings, wild cousin Rita (Marisa Tomei) and stoner
neighbor Elliot (Kevin Corrigan) with a kind of shellshocked, world-weary, pigeon-toed
aplomb. Perpetually shrill, often crude and cursed with a heavy-handed soundtrack that
tries for ironic whimsy but succeeds only in telegraphing nearly every punchline well in
advance of its arrival, this vaguely autobiographical first feature from Tamara Jenkins
nevertheless generates a quirky rhythm that in script form earned it a Guggenheim grant in
1995 and subsequent development at the Sundance Institute's screenwriting lab (which
explains Robert Redford's executive producer credit). Chief strength: the slyly funny and
authentic production design of Dena Roth. <i><i><i></p>

<p></i></i></i>&quot;It's a good day to be indigenous,&quot; says the disc jockey at
Idaho's remote Coeur d'Alene Indian Reservation -- &quot;Population: Variable&quot; and
dubbed &quot;the rez&quot; by locals -- and <em>Smoke Signals</em>, the first
feature-length dramatic film to be written, directed and co-produced by Native Americans,
is a fine calling card for indigenous American filmmaking. Winner of the Audience Award
and the Filmmakers Trophy for Best Dramatic Film at the 1998 Sundance Film Festival, the
movie charts the bittersweet, comic odyssey of stoic Victor Joseph (Adam Beach) and nerdy
raconteur Thomas Builds-the-Fire (Evan Adams), who travel from the Salmon Indian
Reservation to Phoenix to retrieve the remains of Victor's estranged father Arnold (Gary
Farmer), seen in flashbacks as a good but deeply conflicted provider whose drunken mistake
during a Bicentennial celebration begins the drama. As their journey progresses, Thomas'
stories serve to soften Victor's gruff exterior and provide ironic commentary on the state
of the American Indian in 1998. <em>Smoke Signals</em> is an assured debut for director
Chris Eyre and screenwriter Sherman Alexie, who adapted his 1993 collection of short
stories &quot;The Lone Ranger and Tonto Fistfight in Heaven.&quot;<i><i><i></p>

<p><strong><big><big><a name="Vanishing_Point" target="_top">Vanishing Point</a></i> (1971)</big></big></strong></p>

<p></i></i></i>This cult film, newly restored in a letterboxed version, can probably best
be described as an existential chase movie: during a 15-hour drive from Denver to San
Francisco in a souped-up Dodge Challenger, pill-popping ex-Marine Kowalski (Barry Newman
-- hands up if you remember TV's &quot;Petrocelli&quot;) encounters a cross-section of
American types of the era who pitch in to help him make the trek. The police are after him
for a host of high-speed misdemeanors, racists want him for listening to the navigational
advice of blind disc jockey Super Soul (Cleavon Little, soon to star in Mel Brooks'
landmark comedy <em>Blazing Saddles</em>) and Delaney and Bonnie &amp; Friends are, well,
just, you know, around, man (yes, that's Rita Coolidge with them -- hands up if you
thought she and Kris Kristofferson were a cool couple). Dig that period lingo: &quot;only
if you make war on war will you overcome it,&quot; someone says sagely. And any movie that
features both Dean Jagger and Charlotte Rampling in cameos as a grizzled prospector and
comely hitchhiker -- guess which is which -- demands a certain amount of respect. Film
restoration is a wondrous thing.</p>
