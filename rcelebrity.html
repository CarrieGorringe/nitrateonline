<p></font><strong><font size="5">Y</font></strong><font SIZE="4">es, Leonardo DiCaprio is
in this film, we'll get to him in a little bit. </p>
</font>

<p><font SIZE="4">At the beginning of <i>Celebrity</i>, Woody Allen's new film, we see
Kenneth Branagh as Lee Simon, a writer who is doing hack-work entertainment journalism,
meeting an actress named Nicole Oliver (Melanie Griffith) to do a story on her. Nicole
takes him to the house where she was born in (now tenanted by someone else, who, with some
bewilderment, lets them in), goes upstairs to the room that used to be her bedroom when
she was a kid, flops on the bed and tells Lee how she &quot;used to lay here and watch my
body develop&quot;. She and Lee buzz around each other, but she keeps teasing him, telling
him that her body is reserved for her husband -- the camera teases us, too, frames her
compact little body, in a short white dress, from the neck down in several instances --
until finally she says, &quot;What I do from the neck up is another thing.&quot;</font></p>

<p>Cut to Robin (Judy Davis), Lee's ex-wife, staying at a Catholic retreat after her
contentious break-up with him. In between complaining that the beds are too hard or her
meat for dinner isn't done the right way, she is counseled by a priest (played, in what is
now a bit of mind-blowing casting, by Dylan Baker) to get more in-touch with the elements.
What she gets in touch with is her break-up with Lee, during which she fled into Central
Park at night and then turned on him for sleeping with her best friend. Then she finds out
there were other women, as well. Branagh's Lee stammers out bits and pieces of
explanations and justifications, while Davis -- for the third time in an Allen movie --
unleashes vicious outbursts of fury, spitting curses at him as if they were chewed
bullets.</p>

<p>It seems that Lee, who has turned 40 and has been married to the same woman for many
years, feels that he has been &quot;ladling his life out, by the spoonful&quot; and wants
the chance now to see what it would be like to be with, for instance, that &quot;sleazy
blonde&quot; whom his high-school chum got hitched up to. That opportunity first comes in
the form of a young, beautiful girl (Charleze Theron) whom Lee first spots modeling
lingerie on a fashion show runway, her legs pumping as they carry her body forward with
determination, as if her engine were perfectly firing on all points. After introductions,
she drapes herself around Lee and informs him that she is &quot;polymorphously
perverse&quot; -- every part of her body is capable of giving her an orgasm. The nebbish
is in heaven. What happens next turns out humorously, but then Lee is shown attaching
himself to another young, beautiful woman. And then another. It's as if he doesn't realize
that the &quot;sleazy blonde&quot; he covets is a trophy wife, an arrangement, not some
sort of salvation.</p>

<p>The film ostensibly states that it is supposed to be about how society chooses the
people that it wants as its celebrities, and what the celebrities in turn say about
society itself. But what the picture's really about is what all of Allen's films for the
last several years -- with the exception of <i>Manhattan Murder Mystery</i>, a diversion
made during his fractious off-screen crises -- have been about: female rage, and late life
crisis.</p>

<p>At first, watching Kenneth Branagh replicating the nattering, conflicted, desperately
stricken style of Allen's gestures and speech is the weirdest thing, but it's a
performance, not an impersonation, for which Branagh deserves much credit. Judy Davis,
though, seems genuinely conflicted and concerned -- the woman seems to be singing around
the edges after dredging up so much anger from within -- and her character is flung from
one situation after another by the story. At a cosmetic surgery salon where she is about
to get a makeover, she meets a TV producer, Tony (Joe Mantegna), who gives her a job and
becomes romantically involved with her. In between scheduling guests on afternoon shows
with themes like &quot;teenage obesity&quot; and skinheads-meet-Jewish rabbis, Mike pulls
her into his office for lovemaking at every possible moment. Robin meets with a
professional prostitute (Bebe Neuwirth) to get pointers on how she can improve her sexual
skills and keep up with Mike. The scene with Neuwirth's character has a couple of moments
which, admittedly, made me laugh out loud, but this was another instance where the context
made many of the laughs stick in my throat, even when what was going on on-screen was
funny. Does Allen realize how humiliating this must be for a middle-aged woman to feel
that she must go to these lengths to hold onto a man? Allen doesn't dramatize any of this;
it's as if he weren't even interested in Robin's character with that regard.</p>

<p>Neither, for that matter, is there much insight provided on any of the other young
women who Lee gets involved with during this time. He picks up one woman (Famke Janssen,
who looks smashing), but she is scarcely dramatized as a character, and seems here
primarily so that the film can stage a spectacularly mistimed attempt by Lee to break up
with her. He then moved on to a stage actress named Nola, with whom he has his first
rendezvous with in what is supposed to be a romantic place with romantic musical
accompaniment on the soundtrack. But Nola turns up in the form of Winona Ryder, with
bedraggled black hair, dark and almost sunken eyes, and a cold, hard stare. Ryder's
appearance in the film <i>The Age of Innocence</i> is one of the most radiant depictions
of womanhood seen in any recent film -- the moment when the camera alights on her, at a
formal ball, and she suddenly turns and bursts into a smile, seemed to reach out from the
screen and touch you. Ryder has been completely deglamorized in this picture. She seems
murky, common, even coarse; the latter two aspects would seem to be the only reasons Lee
would respond to her.</p>

<p>Allen's last three films have all had women characters in them who have been common as
women, in a sexual manner, or both -- Jennifer Tilly in <i>Bullets Over Broadway</i>
(although Tilly's comedic talent took the edge off her character and made her appealing),
Mira Sorvino in <a href="rma.html" target="_top"><i>Mighty Aphrodite</i></a>, and Hazell Goodman in <a href="rharry.html" target="_top"><i>Deconstructing Harry</i></a>. Tilly and Sorvino's characters were
presented as squeaky-voiced, fluffy-headed creatures; Goodman's came across as stronger,
but also much more unsophisticated, and the film had her accompany Allen's character, as
he took a <i>Wild Strawberries</i>-type journey into the countryside, to an academic
event, still dressed as if she were going to work on the street corner. This is the same
artist who gave us <i>Annie Hall</i> and <i>Hannah and Her Sisters</i>. Men turn to
prostitutes when they want sex without commitment; it can also be seen as a way for men to
act-out a fear of commitment. Allen's current presentation of women in a contemptible
light seems, on second thought, to be his fear of women, and setting this film in the
entertainment medium not only gives the character of Lee the chance to meet a lot of young
women but also gives Allen the chance to comments on how he sees the women who work there
as actresses or models as being pretty and vacant and unschooled and unknowable.</p>

<p>About 50 minutes into the film, Lee has a walloping encounter with a spoiled, immature
little beast of an actor named Brandon Darrow (Leonardo DiCaprio), who is first seen
beating up on his girlfriend (Gretchen Mol) for some petty offense and trashing his hotel
room at the same time. He is hauled off the premises by the police, but not only does he
manage to finesse his way out of an arrest, while teenyboppers squeal and hop about on the
sidewalk, but his girlfriend throws on a coat and hurries after him. He goes directly into
a waiting limo with his girlfriend, a DiCaprio-esque &quot;posse&quot;, and Lee, and they
all end up in Atlantic City, where, after some gambling, they finally come to earth in a
hotel room with some girls, and Lee, looking sideswiped, reluctantly finds himself in bed
with a young female who says she writes, too, &quot;like Chekhov&quot;. Lee has been
trying to talk to Brandon about appearing in a tripish script Lee has written, and Brandon
keeps acting non-committal; the young actor is only interested in whatever hijinks he has
gotten himself into at the moment. The sequence plays surprisingly well, and DiCaprio
performs with genuine verve, but the only reason it's in the picture is to provide Lee's
character with an excuse to drop everything and get on to something more
&quot;serious&quot;, like finishing a novel he's been trying to write.</p>

<p>Why has Woody Allen made this picture? Photographed in alternately creamy and
eggshell-smooth black-and-white by the great Sven Nykvist, it ends up having nothing of
any import to say about our current celebrity culture, or about celebrities themselves.
Instead, it is more about the concerns and preoccupations of Allen as an artist and,
daresay, as a person: he can't seem to get rid of them, and he can't seem to move beyond
them. He still has his sense of humor, and the ability to surprise us with a particularly
good comic moment or bit. But in many other ways he seems to be getting a bit lost,
himself. The film's distressing not just in its treatment of some of its characters and
situations, but also in seeing a fine comedic talent and filmmaker like Allen wrestling
with a quandary, one that could ultimately lead him into a dead-end. At the end of this
film, he seems to see us all going down on the same ship. And he's going down with us.</p>
