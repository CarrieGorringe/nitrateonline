            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">As underwater ghost stories go, <i>
            Below</i> casts its spooky net out into the Atlantic Ocean and spits 
            it back, grizzled and charred, somewhere northwest of the Bermuda 
            Triangle. Compared to the other creepshow entertainment (the 
            dreadfully predictable <i>Abandon</i>, the aging <i>Red Dragon</i>, 
            and Dreamworks' passable Americanized nightmare <i>The Ring</i>) 
            trying to scare up some pre-Halloween business, and despite some 
            lapses in logic, both in the script and by the distributor, <i>Below</i> 
            rises above the rest of its horror compatriots. It ain't half bad.
            <i>Das Boot</i> it isn't. Too bad Dimension Films has such little 
            faith in its World War II horror tale that it's releasing it in just 
            a handful theaters throughout the Washington, DC metropolitan area.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Director David Twohy, a strong 
            visualist who scared the bejeebers out of us with <i>Pitch Black</i>, 
            his B-movie, outer space homage to things-that-go-bump-in-the-night 
            (and brought a then relatively unknown actor named Vin Diesel out of 
            the dark), now takes us back to August 1943, when the U.S.S. Tiger 
            Shark dives under the blood red skies as a seemingly standard issue 
            cat-and-mouse caper and surfaces 105 minutes later with a severe 
            case of what the director calls <i>submarine noir</i>.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Darren Aronofsky (<i>Pi</i>, <i>
            Requiem for a Dream</i>) has his name attached to the project, as 
            author (with Twohy and Lucas Sussman) and producer (with Sue 
            Baden-Powell and Eric Watson), but this looks and feels like a Twohy 
            show, laden with technically competent computer and visual effects 
            (supervised by Peter Chiang), strong, creative photography (Ian 
            Wilson), terrific production design (Charles Lee), and crisp editing 
            (Martin Hunter), not to mention a tense score by Graeme Revell.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With a less-than-full crew 
            commanded by the edgy Lieutenant Brice (Bruce Greenwood) and 
            assisted by Lieut. J.G. Steven Coors (<i>Felicity</i>'s Scott Foley) 
            and Gunner's Mate Loomis (Holt McCallany), three survivors of a 
            torpedoed British hospital ship find themselves the unwelcomed 
            guests aboard the Tiger Shark. Nurse Claire Page is the wrench in 
            the sub's secret equation, a serious nurse fearful of revealing too 
            much about her half-dead patient and the sunken ships' second mate 
            Kingsley (Dexter Fletcher).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With the Germans bearing down on 
            them, any mysteries surrounding the scuttled ship's destruction are 
            temporarily put aside by Ensign Odell (Matt Davis), on his first 
            extended mission, for a CGI barrage of depth charges, which do 
            indeed shake, rattle, and roll the boat halfway across the Equator 
            and back, including one gravity-defying stunt where the cast finds 
            itself momentarily stuck to the TOP of the boat. The tension is 
            ratcheted up one escalating level after another every few minutes, 
            first by the Germans chasing them (including one of those depth 
            charges that eerily bounces along the deck of the boat before 
            stopping mid-ship, balanced on a guide wire) and then by a series of 
            mysterious occurrences that befuddle the crew and their guests.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Despite the script's shortcomings, 
            the film sports a steady, increasing edge albeit encased in a heavy 
            dose of Shakespearian melodrama. At one point, a copy of <i>The 
            Tragedies of William Shakespeare</i> is spiritually tossed at 
            Claire. She's also the unknowing brunt of a funny game of telephone, 
            wherein she's announced to the crew by a variety of synonyms 
            (female, skirt, woman, bazooma, filly, bleeder, and another piece of 
            rotten luck).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The cinematography is aggressively 
            claustrophobic, cold, and steely blue, including a good portion of 
            the last half-hour that is shot in near darkness. One gorgeous shot 
            features Greenwood's upper face close to the periscope, his eye 
            reflecting an approaching enemy vessel. Another nice effect features 
            one of the officers playing catch up with a recalcitrant reflection. 
            The mirror wins.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As for that half-dead patient, he 
            ends up worse off, but as the sub's hydrogen levels rise, its 
            periscopes and sonar are destroyed by huge grappling hooks, and the 
            crew's morale sinks, all efforts at practical joking (especially 
            Jason Flemyng as Stumbo, who finds himself listening to a dead 
            German) end with deadly earnest. There is some exceptional mise-en-scene 
            that starts with a dropped hammer and ends a half-minute later with 
            a leaking fountain pen. But this lovely snippet is stranded in the 
            middle of a sluggish haunted house, and that's where the screenplay 
            starts to exhibit &quot;hydraulic failure.&quot; It needs a bigger boost in 
            that thing we call plot.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As an underwater spook fest, with a 
            crew of sailors anxious to live another day, there are precious few 
            places to hide these shortcomings in <i>Below</i>, but Twohy (who 
            makes has cameo as a British captain at the film's end) nonetheless 
            keeps you emotionally entangled. His technicians have crafted an 
            impressive shell. Too bad the shell-shocked script, stopping way 
            short of the twilight zone, couldn't have been sharpened to match 
            the glossy exterior.</font></td>
