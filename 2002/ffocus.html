A Conversation with Jacqueline Liebman</font><font face="Verdana" size="6"><br>
</font><i><font size="1" face="Verdana">interview by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan 
Lybarger</a>, 
28 June 2002</font></i></p>
<p>
<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Regardless of their gender, filmmakers have 
often had a difficult time balancing their careers and their families. South 
Africa native Jacqueline Liebman's documentary <i>In and Out of Focus</i> 
ingeniously combines both factors. The film is a chronicle of her own motherhood 
that actually opens with the moment she discovers that she's pregnant. </font>
</b></p>
<p>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Much of <i>In and Out of Focus</i> looks like a 
home movie, and this actually makes the movie interesting. However, the 
on-camera discussions have a frankness that most people don't share on the 
videotapes they'd show to their friends. For example, while the tape is still 
rolling, she and her future husband, Lance Gentile (a physician who is also an 
Emmy-winning writer and producer for <i>ER</i> and <i>Third Watch</i>) mull over 
whether to continue with the pregnancy. It's this sort of unflinching intimacy 
that makes <i>In and Out of Focus</i> more than a simple family album spanning 
seven years.</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">Liebman also pointedly comments about how 
Americans (and particularly Angelinos) view pregnancy. While roaming through a 
shopping mall, she contrasts the flashy, but skimpy clothes available at a 
Frederick's of Hollywood outlet with the drab offerings at a maternity store 
down the hallway. </font></p>
<p>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">In the documentary, Liebman uses her own 
experiences (working on films such as <i>Full Tilt Boogie</i> and Beeaje Quick's
<i>Real Stories of the Donut Men</i>) compares them with those of other female 
filmmakers like director Mimi Leder (<i>The Peacemaker</i>, <i>Deep Impact</i>), 
producers Elizabeth Avellan and Tamara Smith-Zimmerman (<i>Spy Kids</i>) and 
legendary editor Anne V. Coates (<i>Lawrence of Arabia</i>, <i>Out of Sight</i>).\</font></p>
<p>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">The cable channel Oxygen first aired <i>In and Out 
of Focus</i> in May of 2001, and the film has become oddly prescient as the 
months have gone by. I contacted her as she was presenting the film as part of 
the Women in Film Symposium at the Kansas City Filmmakers Jubilee last April. 
Before she showed the film, she pointed to that week's issue of <i>Time Magazine</i>, 
which featured a cover story about the challenges of balancing parenthood and 
work. It's a topic that she's been exploring for the last seven years.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Dan Lybarger:</b> At the beginning of the 
film, you say that you came to L.A. as a teenager to become an independent 
filmmaker. What made you want to do that at such a young age?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Jacqueline Liebman:</b> You know, I always 
knew I was going to end up in the United States. Always. I did come here when I 
was fifteen. It's a very weird thing. It's almost like there was an invisible 
hand pushing me here my whole life. I always knew I would eventually end up 
living here. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the documentary, I say that I came here to 
make movies. On some level, yeah, I came here to make movies. The reality was 
that I was still a high school student. I also knew I'd eventually make movies 
because I was obsessed with them. I'd be going to tons of movies. I'd be 
watching a movie, and I would rewrite the ending if it was bad. I'd go, &quot;They 
should have done this; they should have done that.&quot; I think it's one of those 
things where it's almost unconscious, but it's there inside of you. You know 
that somehow -- you don't know how -- you'll end up doing that kind of stuff.

<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>DL: </b>I loved the home movie footage from 
your childhood where you're a little girl at a wedding who just isn't going with 
the program. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>JL</b>: It's so funny. There was always this 
story as I was growing up about this footage of me at this wedding where the 
entire wedding was completely captivated by this little three-year-old. I was 
dressed in my little three-year-old flower girl [outfit]. They told me where to 
stand. They told me what to do. I was supposed to hold these flowers. I just 
would not cooperate. I had my own agenda. Actually, what you don't have [in the 
clip] is the audience, who were hysterically laughing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">They put me in this box, which you see. And I 
climbed out of it. [Laughs] &nbsp;I had always heard of this footage. It wasn't as 
demonstrative as I thought of what was really going on. I found it and put it 
in, and hopefully, people get it.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>DL:</b> You see this little girl, and the 
idea is that she now is going to continue breaking with the program.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>JL:</b> She's my inner child. It's fun when 
you discover &quot;I'm not this weird person. I've <i>always</i> been this weird 
person.&quot; Actually, I was thrilled to discover that. As an artist, you're 
discovering who you are, what makes you tick and your journey. To be able to 
find that footage and use it appropriately was amazing. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>DL: </b>Making a film about yourself is a 
challenging task because you have to look at things about yourself that you 
don't want to see. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>JL:</b> I have to tell you something that 
that is the hardest thing. I kept wanting to make a movie about everyone else 
going through my experience but keep myself out of it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I did have an editor at one point. The 
relationship didn't work out because she had another vision of what the movie 
was about. Early on it didn't have the women [filmmakers] in it. It was just me 
and my husband. I didn't want to just make that. I told her that the two fused 
together, and she couldn't see it. The one thing she did give me was that I 
needed to put more of myself in it. I had a ton more footage of my husband in 
it. I also realized that I had to take it out even though it was fabulous, 
hysterically fabulous.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>DL:</b> As a guy, I found it refreshing that 
your husband comes across as three-dimensional.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>JL:</b> Believe me, he's actually 
four-dimensional. I had to cut him down a bit. He's very honest. He's very 
comfortable on camera. Starting to make a movie, not [necessarily] <i>this</i> 
movie, was his idea. He was very open to having the camera on him. He liked 
being on camera. He's a ham [chuckles].</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>DL:</b> What's fascinating is your older 
son's reaction to the camera is so different. For him as a toddler, the camera 
seems like this weird, foreign device.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>JL:</b> He really did not like the camera. 
It's still painful for me, the one part where he's saying, &quot;Off. Off.&quot; I said, 
&quot;Do you want to go to the beach?&quot; He's trying to walk around the camera to find 
where I am. He's trying to find &quot;Where's Mommy?&quot; The reality is that I didn't 
switch the camera off. I walked him down to the beach, and he was so upset with 
me that he wouldn't look at me. Every time I see that footage, and I remember. I 
feel like I betrayed him because I was working. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When I watch the movie, it's like [Harold 
Ramis's] <i>Groundhog Day</i>. There's a lot of hidden pain in this movie.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This movie is really a coming-of-age story or a 
rite of passage. You see a woman grow up. The movie's cut like that. The reality 
is you grow up when you grow up. In seeing it again, there's stuff that's 
painful, and you go &quot;My God. How could I have been so clueless?&quot; That's part of 
the fabric of what the film is, and I'm O.K. with that. I actually did grow up. 
I do feel secure in many things, and I have arrived in a much stronger place in 
my life. So, actually it's kind of cool. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>DL:</b> As a film geek, I was excited to 
finally see what [editor] Anne V. Coates looks like. Did you notice any 
difference in the attitudes between filmmakers who are Anne Coates's age vs. 
someone who would be Mimi Leder's age?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>JL:</b> Anne Coates is really from the old 
school. The things that are in there about Anne -- and I specifically chose not 
in there because I didn't feel like it supported the idea of what I'm trying to 
say -- is that Anne had mentioned to me that she doesn't belong to any women's 
groups. [In the film], you did hear her say that feminists were the kind of 
women who were a little bitter and had gotten strident. She has a very strong 
feeling about the fact that she's part of the boys' club. She's modeled herself 
very much to be in that club. She sort of dresses in a very unfeminine way. 
She's comfortable with that. I think she needed to do that at that time because 
there really weren't any women around. That was fine that's what she did. I 
think women today can sort of reclaim their femininity and their sisterhood a 
little bit more. It's OK to be women in film.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>DL:</b> I think your selection of filmmakers 
was rather interesting because you feature Mimi Leder, a woman who's best known 
for directing gritty TV shows like <i>ER</i> and action movies like <i>The 
Peacemaker</i> and <i>Deep Impact</i>. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>JL:</b> You know what's amazing is that I 
wrote a paper in film school that said, &quot;Who's going to be the first woman 
director to do the big action feature?&quot; because women up until that point had 
been kept out. I know Kathryn Bigelow had done [<i>Point Break</i>], and that 
was the first big action feature for a woman, but that was nothing as huge as 
what Mimi did. We actually ended up talking about that on the set [of Leder's <i>
The Peacemaker</i>] that day. She said Kathryn Bigelow had done it before, but I 
said this is bigger. And she said, &quot;Yup. This is pretty big.&quot; She was pretty 
freaked out by it. She did action on <i>ER</i>. She did a lot of action stuff. 
[Steven] Spielberg thought she was great, so that's how she got the job.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>DL:</b> Women might actually have some 
advantages in directing because more men tend to be colorblind.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>JL:</b> Look at what Sofia Coppola did with
<i>The Virgin Suicides</i>. It's just phenomenal. The colors in that are 
incredible. You're struck by that, and it's a perfect contrast with such a dark 
story. I think women haven't been given the opportunity to experiment enough. I 
think if we saw more women directors we might see more women directors taking 
chances and being incredibly creative. I think the fact that they're there, 
they're thrilled. [Laughs] Maybe we don't see enough of that. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>DL:</b> You could argue that some women 
already have. In <i>Europa Europa</i>, which was directed by Agnieszka Holland, 
you have a movie about the Holocaust where the hero is going through a hell like 
no one else's. He's a Jewish boy successfully passing as a German. He can never 
be himself because he can't reveal that he's been circumcised. Some have said 
&quot;Only a woman would make a movie where the whole things centered around the 
guy's penis.&quot; Her movies have male protagonists, but the lines between good and 
evil aren't as clear. I wonder how many male directors would have thought of 
that angle.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>JL:</b> [Laughs] I can't comment because I 
haven't seen it, but that's interesting because one would think only a guy would 
make a movie that was centered around a guy's penis. I think what you're 
bringing up is plotlines. Women naturally are creatures that really analyze 
things. So I think in general you're going to get a more analytical view of a 
character, not that men can't write incredibly involved characters. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I think that women really dissect a situation. 
You go to a party, someone says something and a woman might go home and speak 
for three hours about it. &quot;What did it mean?&quot; &quot;How This?&quot; and &quot;How That?&quot; You're 
going to get stories where the storylines are going to be fairly complicated and 
the characters are complex because women are just organically more complex. Men, 
not that they're simple, tend to want their lives a little bit simpler. At least 
I really believe that, having been surrounded by quite a few men. They can get 
complicated if they like, but I think they'd prefer more complicated effects and 
explosion scenes than characters.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>DL:</b> You did this in stages. Where do you 
get the confidence to decide whether something needs to be shared?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>JL:</b> That was the biggest thing that 
bothered me the entire time. I really doubted that this was something that 
needed to be shared. I nearly abandoned the project so many times. Number one, I 
was embarrassed to share it. Number two, who's interested? What does this have 
in common with anyone? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Again and again people would just come out of 
nowhere and be blown away. They would have such extreme reactions, not that 
lukewarm or &quot;we kind of like it.&quot; Extreme, like, &quot;Oh, my God!&quot; They'd be hanging 
on my arm and saying, &quot;What is this?&quot; It was sort of bizarre, like, &quot;This says 
something to you?&quot; They'd say, &quot;You've got to finish it. You've got to!&quot; I said, 
&quot;O.K. I'd guess I'd better continue.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I still was terrified. I'd wake up and think, 
&quot;Oh, my God. What am I going to tell my children? Are they going to watch this?&quot; 
I'm still a little freaked out about my oldest son watching it and having a 
conversation about it because we have the abortion conversation right at the 
beginning. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I adore my son, and the fact that we even had 
the conversation freaks me out. I obviously didn't want to have an abortion. It 
scares me a little, and I don't know how he's going to interpret that.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>DL:</b> Early in the film when you mention 
your pregnancy, some of your acquaintances look at you as if you have told them 
that you're a leper.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>JL:</b> Absolutely. It was like pregnancy 
equals leprosy, definitely. And I'm afraid of that, and what I'm afraid the most 
is for my son. I think, though, what he'll get in there is that I was so 
immature and so freaked out that I didn't equate being pregnant with him. It was 
like I was so scared. In the end, he'll benefit from the fact that I was that 
honest. The reality is that when I screened it, there was more than one woman in 
there [watching the movie] crying her eyes out. There was a woman in the dark 
saying, &quot;I hadn't seen this movie. I was four months pregnant when I got 
married, and my daughter is twelve. This movie's making me cry so much because 
it brings back everything.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I think we need to be more honest with children 
and let them know what it's really all about and not paint this like, &quot;and then 
you know it was forever after, and then we got divorced.&quot; Kids understand.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I'm a very big advocate for people not having 
children because a lot of people rush into it and they're so not prepared. 
They're like, &quot;We're going to have a baby, and it's going to be a little dolly 
that you dress up.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">People need to understand that what you are 
raising is you, and you know how complicated and screwed up you are. You are 
raising a little one of that. It's not a little pet. It's complicated, complex, 
needy. It's everything you are as a human being in miniature. We don't realize 
that.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>DL:</b> You had a little diversity among the 
other female filmmakers because some of them like Ms. Smith-Zimmerman chose not 
to have kids while others did. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>JL:</b> I made a decision early on not to do 
research and say, &quot;Who would be a good person to interview?&quot; I had access to all 
these people. There were only two people I didn't know but I had been told about 
and had easy access to them were Anne Coates and Claudia Weil. Coates was not a 
friend, but she had worked with a director I had worked with. He said, &quot;You 
should interview Anne Coates.&quot; I said, &quot;Give me her number.&quot; It was one phone 
call, and she was amazing. I'd been told by three people to interview Claudia 
Weill.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I ended up taping Weill's bat mitzvah. She 
decided to have a bat mitzvah when she turned fifty. She had me do that first 
before she did the interview. With Claudia, I did a B-roll in the studio, which 
I used some of that footage, and almost a year later, I got the interview. I did 
a LOT of work on Claudia. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>DL:</b> Your background seems unique because 
you live in Los Angeles, and you're a South African Jew. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>JL:</b> It gets even better because I'm also 
a Jewish Gentile because my married last name -- even though I use the name 
Liebman -- is Gentile, which is Italian, so it's even more freaky. There are a 
lot of Jewish South Africans in Los Angeles, though. I don't really know many of 
them because I left home. I'm not part of any enclave of people. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>DL:</b> Do you think that you've been 
dealing with a forbidden subject?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>JL:</b> Oh, yeah. People are starting to 
talk about this, but there's nobody else doing this. I don't think women talk 
about [the ambivalence toward motherhood] enough to the detriment of everybody. 
It's like it's a sacred secret. I feel on some level like I'm telling the 
secret. I'm so bad. Actually, what I'm hearing from women is &quot;Thank God someone 
is finally saying that we are ambivalent, and that we sometimes have no idea of 
what to do with our children? I can't be the mother, and when is the mother 
coming?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Women don't tell that. Motherhood is this very 
sacred ground. I think I have opened the issues a little bit, but it's in a very 
positive way. I don't like to throw bombs in places and destroy things. I'm all 
about empowerment and fixing and building and remodeling. </font></p>
