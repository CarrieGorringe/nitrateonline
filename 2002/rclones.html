            in <i>Attack of the Clones</i>, Obi-Wan Kenobi (McGregor) turns to
            Annakin Skywalker (Christensen) after a particularly harrowing and
            magnificently choreographed chase through an unnamed city and tells
            him that someday &quot;you'll be the death of me.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Cruel irony and ironic self-reflexiveness aside, the
            circumstances and the statement set the tone for the film itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>It's ten years later and Annakin Skywalker (Christiansen), is
            smarting under the tutelage of Obi-wan Kenobi (McGregor), whom he
            believes is deliberately holding him back out of jealousy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Annakin and Obi-wan have been assigned to protect the
            Princess Padme Amadala (Portman).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Her life has been placed in danger by extremist elements on
            the outer fringes of the Republic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The reckless Annakin, fuelled by resentment, defies several
            orders, just as his attraction to the Princess seems to be taking
            shape.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Meanwhile there
            are questions concerning<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>mysterious Count (Lee) and some clones that were ordered long
            ago under questionable auspices.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Who's running what, where and why is clouded in an ambiguity
            which threatens to destroy an already besieged Republic.</b><o:p>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Summed
            up, <i>Clones</i> contains brilliantly-conceived images coupled with
            -- and it's no exaggeration --some of the most ill-conceived and
            outright asinine dialogue dreamed up within the last fifty years of
            cinema.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Throw in a love
            story that's saccharine enough to make a Harlequin Romance seem like
            classic literature and two young actors who are both singularly and
            collectively incapable of making this amatory drivel convincing, and
            you have exposed the very weakness of the film:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>it has a fragile, if nimbly constructed, frame which is being
            forced to carry more weight than possible.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">You
            might have thought that co-writer/director Lucas might have sensed
            these problems earlier and addressed them in this second chapter, or
            maybe there was no real incentive to improve the structure of a
            cash-cow franchise like the <i>Star Wars</i> films (<i>Phantom
            Menace</i>, after all, has grossed over $924 million, and the
            original -- now Chapter Four -- over $774 million).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>It's especially shocking that co-writer Hales (responsible
            for the storyline for <i>The Scorpion King</i> and several scripts
            of the &quot;Young Indiana Jones&quot; TV series) didn't improve
            some of the grade-z dialogue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Regardless
            of any point in particular, there's no excuse for what's on the
            soundtrack.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">It
            doesn't help matters much when the two protagonists -- those most
            crucial to the film's structure and credibility -- can't convey any
            emotional range whatsoever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
            audience is supposed to believe that Padme and Annakin are willing
            to violate their sense of duty in order to fall in love.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The problem lies in the inability of Portman and Christensen
            to convincingly portray that love.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>When Annakin tells Padme that he has dreamed about her every
            night since he met her, her face and voice reflects an unconvincing,
            almost lacquered response, even when she acknowledges that love,
            Portman's delivery of her lines is stiff, and unrealistic, and
            Christiansen's is on the same level. The dialogue is made remarkable
            only by the alternating thuds the audience hears as each groaner
            after another traipses forth from the actors' mouths.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">This
            sudden rush of passion is credible only if the audience members are
            willing to accept the concept of an instant , and enduring
            attraction between two pre-teens which was, presumably, established
            in Episode One (and it’s a premise that doesn't seem likely, since
            they display absolutely no affection for each other during the
            course of that film -- in fact, quite the opposite).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span><i>Clones</i> now provides the explication for this
            Romeo-and-Juliet romance, one that we know will end in similar
            grief, thanks to what has now been designated <i>Episode Four</i>,
            but the script stretches the audience's patience for so long that
            there's a real danger of indifference kicking in. Only the
            exquisitely designed special effects (partly created by Lucas
            stalwart Dennis Muren) for this supposedly life-altering experience
            compensates for, and makes barely tolerable, these hideously risible
            scenes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">As
            for the other, and obviously more talented actors, they can do
            nothing but fill space and articulate their share of threadbare
            aphorisms until the final sequence kicks in. Poor Ewan McGregor and
            the always delightfully sinister Christopher Lee can do only so much
            to keep credibility and buoyancy alive in the characterizations,
            especially since no one else in the cast is given enough screen time
            to do so.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>This approach works
            well in the case of Jar Jar Binks, many will be happy to hear
            (although he does end up becoming a senator of the Republic --
            perhaps this is the Republic's way of kicking him upstairs where he
            can do the least harm), but not so well anywhere else.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">In
            Lucas's defense, it's too simplistic to complain that Clones is
            suffering from a bad case of narrative bloat, as did <i>Phantom
            Menace</i>. It does seem, on the surface, that the use of two films
            (and eventually three, when the next installment rolls out next
            year), as an excuse for an overly long prologue when the original <i>Star
            Wars</i> was able to achieve a rational and discrete narrative unit
            in a little over two hours could lead to that conclusion. Moreover,
            the final powerhouse of a sequence, with every Jedi in town, even
            Yoda, engaging in a massive attack against the clones, almost makes
            up for everything else, but why did the audience have to wade
            through two hours of mediocrity for the final payoff? Is the
            audience for the <i>Star Wars</i> series being made to pay three
            times over for one-third the material in this case? <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The answer to
            the last question hopefully might end up being &quot;not
            necessarily&quot;, particularly if Lucas can made the third film a
            coherent and effective bridge between Episodes Two and Four.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>If not, what might have seemed like a leisurely, and
            entertaining exercise in expository development -- Episodes One and
            Two -- just might come to seem like self-indulgence of the most
            annoying kind.</font></td>
