            <span style="color: black; font-weight: 700">In a world that is too 
            often catering to the habits of today's teenagers and 
            twentysomethings, it's a shame that <i>The Kid</i> <i>Stays in the 
            Picture's </i>only appreciative audience might be those of us with 
            memories deep enough to recall the rise and fall and rise again of 
            one of the industry's true crap-shooting visionaries.</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;There are three sides to every 
            story: my side, your side, and the truth. And no one is lying. 
            Memories serve each one differently.&quot; -- Robert Evans</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Life, and feature documentaries 
            about it, fall somewhere within that learned Evansism. Often 
            cinematic outcasts in a big screen world of oversized action flicks, 
            family comedies, and teenage angst melodramas, cinematic &quot;realities&quot; 
            generally get lost in the boxoffice shuffle. It's generally only 
            when the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences offers the 
            public what it thinks are the &quot;best of the best&quot; in this category -- 
            something it's done with more than an occasional misinformed hiccup 
            -- that any filmgoer will even learn these films exist. Then finding 
            them at your local theater is akin to the search for the holy grail. 
            Generally you'll wait a few months and find them playing on PBS or a 
            premium cable network. Thank god for the growing popularity of the 
            DVD.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">No, I'm not going to get on my 
            soapbox and urge any of you to rethink your film-going habits, at 
            least not after the next sentence or three. For those readers 
            inclined to waste their dollars on <i>Goldmember</i>, <i>The</i> <i>
            Master of Disguise</i>, or <i>feardotcom</i>, don't! As penance if 
            you snookered a date, a friend, or your mother to any of these 
            films, get thee to a documentary. Get thee to <i>The Kid Stays in 
            the Picture</i>.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Academy-Award nominated filmmakers
            <span style="color:black">Brett Morgen and Nanette Burstein (1998's
            <i>On the Ropes</i>) have not only tackled a bigger-than-life 
            subject, Hollywood producer Evans, but have made it gamely 
            entertaining. In a world that is too often catering to the habits of 
            today's teenagers and twentysomethings, it's a shame that <i>The Kid</i>'s 
            only appreciative audience might be those of us with memories deep 
            enough to recall the rise and fall and rise again of one of the 
            industry's true crap-shooting visionaries.</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color:black">Yet 
            Morgen and Burstein's move from the <b><i>cinéma-verité</i></b> 
            style of their earlier feature to a stock footage-based subject has 
            allowed them to experiment with some well-blended, kitschy sound 
            tricks and even more exciting visuals and some amusing CGI effects, 
            something I've not seen heretofore in this genre.</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color:black">Based on 
            Evans' wildly anecdotal 1994 book and its extremely successful 
            six-hour audio version, in which the author adds his own notoriously 
            nuanced delivery, Morgen and Burstein made the only appropriate 
            decision in adapting the material to film -- making sure Evans was 
            on board as the non-stop, self-depreciating raconteur with the brick 
            memory.</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color:black">They 
            begin the chronological tale with Evans as the pretty-boy partner 
            with his brother in Evan-Picone, the family women's clothing 
            business, to his pool-side discovery by actress Norma Shearer, who 
            picks him to play her late husband, legendary Hollywood producer 
            Irving Thalberg, in the Lon Chaney biopic <i>The Man of a Thousand 
            Faces</i>. It was his next role, as a matador opposite Ava Gardner 
            in <i>The Sun Also Rises</i>, that earned his autobiography and this 
            film its title. Seems Hemingway and the rest of the cast was furious 
            at Evans appearing, but it was the celebrated Darryl Zanuck who 
            insisted that &quot;the kid stays in the picture.&quot;</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color:black">While his 
            acting career floundered following his lead in <i>The Fiend Who 
            Walked the West</i>, his greater sense of impeding importance within 
            the film industry, thanks to a <i>New York Times</i> profile of 
            Evans. Gulf+Western (then owner of Paramount Pictures) chief Charlie 
            Bludhorn anointed Evans with a prime position within the studio. 
            Before he could say &quot;Hollywood, here I come,&quot; he was head of 
            production. Box-office hits and lovely anecdotes follow. <i>
            Rosemary's Baby</i> and Mia Farrow. <i>Goodbye, Columbus</i>. <i>
            Love Story</i>. <i>The Godfather</i>. Ali MacGraw, a.k.a. Mrs. 
            Robert Evans then the ex-Mrs. Robert Evans. And on the soundtrack a 
            hilariously mimic: Evans as Farrow, as MacGraw, as Bludhorn.</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color:black">It's all 
            quite amusing, Evans' courtship and 1969 marriage to Miss Snotnose. 
            The near-collapse of Paramount (rescued by a product reel directed 
            by Mike Nichols for the G+W board featuring Evans as a flashier 
            version of Rod Serling). The <i>Cotton Club</i> scandal. Murder. 
            Money. Drugs. The fall of grace for the reigning king of the 
            Paramount mountain.</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color:black">Even 
            during the end credits, the filmmakers had tacked on a truly 
            hilarious post script featuring twenty-five-year-old footage of 
            Dustin Hoffman (perhaps some entertainment originally intended for 
            the wrap party of <i>Marathon Man</i>?) doing his crazed 
            got-to-be-seen impersonation of a legend in his own mind.</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color:black">Evans' 
            bigger-than-life struggle through success, tragedy, and ultimate 
            reinvention of self is a perfect story for the big screen. The 
            public's fascination with all things Hollywood makes this a bonafide 
            attention grabber; Evans' story and storytelling attributes and 
            filmmakers' Morgen and Burstein's stylish approach to the subject 
            makes this a reel crowd-pleaser. Of course it ends with Evans back 
            on top, right where he expects he should be (and, yes, he's still at 
            Paramount). Should the sometimes strangely fickle Oscar voters deem 
            this worthy of a statue next spring, Evans will be back right where 
            he belongs. Center stage.</span></font></td>
