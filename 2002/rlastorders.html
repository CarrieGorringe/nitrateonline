            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>At
            the beginning of <i>Last Orders</i>, three old friends gather at a
            pub in South London to pay homage to one of their own, recently
            deceased and set on the bar -- as ashes in an urn. They toast, they
            laugh, they remember good times. And then they drive off to fulfill
            Jack's &quot;last orders,&quot; that his ashes be scattered at
            Margate Pier. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            men's expedition is at once literal and figurative, a day's worth of
            driving to the well-known working class vacation spot, and a journey
            back in time (the present here is 1989). During the trip, they hand
            off Jack's urn, chortling, &quot;Jack in a box!&quot; while also
            trading stories about their mostly shared pasts. As they recall how
            they came to know Jack (played in flashbacks by Michael Caine and,
            in his earlier years, by JJ Feild), you come to understand the
            shifting, fraught friendships between Vic (Tom Courtenay), Lenny
            (David Hemmings), and Ray (Bob Hoskins), as well as Jack's son,
            Vince (Ray Winstone). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Adapted
            by producer-writer-director Fred Schepisi from Graham Swift's novel,
            the film's nonlinear structure includes flashbacks -- sometimes
            instigated by external events, like their brief stops at the Chatham
            war memorial (reached by a long walk up a hill that leaves those who
            are unfit quite winded) and the cathedral at Canterbury -- that
            don't always attach clearly to a single character. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            men's memories include happy gatherings at the pub (singing -- or
            more like wailing -- Jack's favorite tune, &quot;Blue Bayou&quot;),
            as well as more intimate moments, alone or shared by two members of
            the group. So, you see Ray and Jack's meeting during WWII, when both
            were stationed in North Africa; Ray's impractical inclinations
            (gambling, buying a camper), that end up ruining his marriage;
            Lenny's anger at young Vince for impregnating and then abandoning
            his daughter; Vince's decision to sell cars rather than take over
            Jack's butcher shop (Jack claims proudly that he refuses to sell the
            business and be better paid by a supermarket because he must be
            &quot;my own man&quot;). Though these scenes reveal diverse emotions
            and even some surprising bits of history (betrayals and secrets
            kept), they also appear refracted, from multiple points of view and
            often, layered inside one another. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Adding
            to this structural complexity, the film simultaneously follows
            another journey, by Jack's widow Amy (Helen Mirren, played in her
            younger incarnation by the arresting Kelly Reilly). Refusing to go
            to Margate with the fellows, Amy instead enacts the same ritual that
            she has for fifty years: alone, as always, she boards a bus to go
            see her institutionalized autistic daughter, June (Laura Morelli).
            June is unable even to acknowledge Amy, who in turn has struggled
            for years with Jack, who, in an early flashback, tells Amy they must
            &quot;forget&quot; their daughter, whom he describes as not having
            &quot;all her marbles.&quot; Amy remembers wistfully, &quot;It's
            easy to believe, when you're eighteen, that you can make a 'fresh
            start.'&quot; But of course, neither of them can just forget. And
            so, though Amy knows that &quot;He always loved me,&quot; Jack's
            inability to love June irrevocably changes the shape of their
            marriage. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">All
            this reminiscing might easily turn melodramatic, but for the most
            part, <i>Last Orders</i> avoids tear-jerking and grand emotional
            revelations. Instead, it focuses on structural complexities and the
            layering of perspectives. This structural puzzle makes the movie an
            ideal project for Schepisi, whose work does tend to be more
            emotionally reserved and understated than sentimental and obvious.
            Perhaps the subtlest illustration of affection and strain involves
            Ray and Amy, as they discuss Jack's death. Set a week before the
            drive to Margate, the scene is cut into other flashbacks throughout
            the film, gradually exposing efforts they made to be loyal to Jack,
            whom they both loved but also resented, for his single-minded
            efforts to survive tragedy.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">While
            the movie is certainly about looking back and coming to terms with
            long-held secrets and thorny life choices, it is also, in the end,
            about looking forward. As a hospitalized Jack advises his buddy Ray,
            &quot;If you ever get the option, you go first. It's the carrying on
            that's hard. Ending, it ain't nothing.&quot; And in this context,
            and for all the focus on the men's quarrels and make-ups, it is Amy
            who has the most to lose and to create for the future. Her
            relationship to Jack has been most clearly about a box, a shared set
            of expectations and laments, as well as a set of impositions by her
            husband, so loving and so unable to love. This explains in part why
            her journey must be separate from the men's, and also why, in what
            is the film's most conventional move, she must also &quot;find&quot;
            herself in a second romance. <o:p>
