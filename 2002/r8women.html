            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">French director Francois Ozon 
            surfaces from the thematic sea of ghosts, middle age and denial of 
            his elegant <i>Under the Sand </i>(<i>Sous le Sable</i>), with a 
            fluffy bon bon temptation titled <i>8 Women</i>. Here is hommage to 
            Sirk and Cukor and the over-saturated Technicolor melodramas of the 
            '50s and '60s - with a touch of the essence of <i>The Parent Trap</i> 
            sifted over the souffle for a treat. And what a souffle of actresses 
            line this cake pan: Catherine Deneuve, Isabelle Huppert, Emmanuelle 
            Beart, Fanny Ardant, Danielle Darrieux, Virginie Ledoyen, Firmine 
            Richard and Ludivine Sagnier form the ensemble and a great deal of 
            the joy of the film is in watching the French cinema's reigning 
            elder stateswomen shed their imperious diva-esque masks and shake, 
            rattle and roll instead. </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The women sing, swoon, sway, spar 
            and sob through Qzon's demi-musical murder mystery, set in the 
            requisite snowed in, desolate chateau and based upon a play by 
            Robert Thomas - and the result is fluffy fun meshed with Agatha 
            Christie that is more memorable for what it asks of its lovely octet 
            and its ravishing fashion parade rather than substance. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Deneuve plays Gaby, a greedy, 
            poised and perpetually raised-eyebrow matron who is celebrating the 
            return of her oldest daughter Suzon (Ledoyen), from school for the 
            winter holiday. The time is the late 1950's and the rules of 
            propriety and morality are still in place; appearances mean 
            everything. But behind the closed doors of the massive estate lie 
            many secrets, thwarted desires, and - on the day of Suzon's return - 
            the murder of the only man in the household, Gaby's husband Marcel.
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Was the killer the housekeeper, 
            Madame Chanel (Richard), the spinster sister-in-law Augustine 
            (Huppert) or the saucy personal maid Louise (Beart)? Perhaps 
            tippling mother-in-law Mamy (Darrieux) held the knife. Or maybe it 
            was the dead man's slinky, wanton sister Pierette (Ardant), who has 
            suddenly appeared out of the mist of the past wanting money. Or - 
            just what if Marcel was murdered by his cool wife or one of his two 
            daughters, Suzon or wily filly of a teenager, Catherine (Sagnier)?
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The fun is in the frolic that 
            ensues with secrets spilling over a mile a minute and innermost 
            desires revealed to frenetic, comedic ends. And the extraordinary 
            cast is game to try anything for Ozon, who complies by defrosting 
            their veneers with relish and zest. <i>8 Women</i> divided viewers 
            and critics at the Berlin Film Festival with some complaining of the 
            script's fusty and musty old fashionedness, slow pace, over-decor 
            and slight ending. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But you'd have to be a crusty crab 
            to take any of this seriously and one has to wonder if, after the 
            exquisite <i>Under the Sand</i> which Ozon directed in 2000, the 
            sniffing elite weren't expecting a more elusive effort from this 
            woman-loving Frenchman. It should be remembered he's never been 
            quiet over the fact that he adores Sirk and Cukor and there have 
            been hints of stylized, tinted emotives in earlier films like <i>
            Water Drops on Burning Rocks</i>. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And you have to give him credit for 
            giving great roles to women over 40. Charlotte Rampling turned in 
            the performance of the year in <i>Under the Sand</i> and in <i>8 
            Women</i>, icons Ardant, Deneuve, Huppert and Darrieux are released 
            from their own corseted iconography and made strangely earthy and 
            accessible in a film that pokes fun at their perceived image. It's a 
            welcome sigh to find a film that celebrates women, despite 
            heightening the gossipy, bitchy cliches. Ozon mines their beauty 
            with campy humor and finds a little bit of soul, especially in 
            Isabelle Huppert and Firmine Richard's outsider characters. Besides 
            Todd Haynes upcoming <i>Far From Heaven</i>, which also bows to the
            <i>Imitation of Life</i> school-of-thought of Douglas Sirk, <i>8 
            Women</i>, for its faults may be the closest we get to a 
            contemporary &quot;women's picture.&quot; </font></td>
