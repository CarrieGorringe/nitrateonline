            review by <a href="../kj.html" target="_top">KJ Doughton</a>, 20 December 2002</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Joe Carnahan’s <i>Narc </i>smacks
            viewers alongside the head like a desperate junkie hunting down his
            fix money.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Its initial chase scene is all frantic, hand held camerawork,
            a jittery home movie of undercover officer Nick Tellis (Jason Patric)
            as he descends into Hell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A
            recovering substance abuser himself, Tellis is tailing a homicidal
            dope dealer through a playground.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>After his panting query jams a needle into the neck of an
            unsuspecting bystander, the mad-dog offender takes a pregnant woman
            hostage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The harrowing
            showdown ends with Tellis accidentally shooting the captive and
            causing the loss of her baby.</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yeah, <i>Narc</i> is that kind of
            movie.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It joins <i>Rush</i>
            (which also starred Patric), <i>The Onion Field</i>, <i>Serpico</i>,
            <i>Seven</i>, <i>The French Connection</i>, <i>Traffic</i>, and <i>Prince
            of the City</i> as a grimy, hyper-real exploration of the emotional
            and psychological prices paid by cops. Carnahan’s film is more
            sober than Quentin Tarantino’s jive-talking, caffeinated approach
            to the streets, and less sexy than the pumped-up, comic book style
            of John Woo.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If
            Tarantino is a celluloid double espresso and Woo is a dry martini,
            Carnahan serves up black coffee – hold the cream and sugar.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Eighteen months have passed since
            Tellis’ botched drug bust. He has lost his badge in the
            shootout’s tragic wake, and spends his days watching the paint
            peel at home with a wife and child.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Unpaid bills merely increase the frustrated burnout’s
            post-traumatic anxieties.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </span>Looking haggard and unkempt, an overgrown moustache hiding
            the handsome contours of his face, Tellis resembles a jaded war
            veteran who hates what he’s observed on duty, but can’t
            acclimate to anything else. Despite his apprehensiveness – and his
            wife’s insistence that he abandon policework – Patric’s
            brooding crime fighter is itching to return to the streets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>After being called upon by his review board and given a
            chance to rejoin the Detroit Police Force, Tellis reluctantly
            accepts the offer.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Another narcotics officer has been
            shot dead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Tellis is
            asked to track down his seedy underworld connections and discover
            who committed the murder.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
            assignment hits frighteningly close to home – the slain officer,
            Michael Calvess (Alan Van Sprang), appeared to be another lost soul
            who’d dug himself in too deeply into the drug scene before his
            lifeless corpse was pulled from a tunnel by partner Henry Oak (Ray
            Liotta).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Tellis is ordered to team up with
            Oak, a short-fused, embittered bruiser who has seen his own share of
            loss. Not beyond a bit of good ol’ police brutality to extract
            information from criminal vermin, Oak is a towering bear of rage,
            too tired for bedside manners and too angry to give a sh*t.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>What fuels Oak’s simmering fire pit, Tellis asks himself,
            and exactly what are the volatile man’s motives for resolving this
            case?<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Between scenes of the expected
            shakedowns and interrogations, Carnahan stages a delicate, telling
            scene where the two weathered officers converse from the front seats
            of a parked patrol car.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Oak
            lets his guard down and explains to Tellis that his wife recently
            died of cancer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
            sting of sorrow left its emotional scars, and unleashed a
            crime-fighting monster.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </span>“I became a much better cop the day she died,” confesses
            Oak, acknowledging that the absence of this personal beacon only
            adds to his reckless abandon on the job.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Perhaps beneath his gruff exterior, Oak has a death wish, and
            is merely expediting the arrival of his own demise by taking on the
            dangerous crooks inhabiting Detroit’s drug trade.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Narc</i> tosses its viewers
            several crumbs of knowledge concerning the Calvess shooting. Such
            flashbacks surface like colorless, grungy daydreams, returning us
            repeatedly to the dark tunnel where the crime took place.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Turning to <i>Rashomon</i> for inspiration, Carnahan forces
            us to see the ambiguous scenario unfold from different perspectives,
            hiding the ultimate truth until his movie’s final frames. This
            approach brings to mind the centerpiece sequence from Christopher
            Nolan’s <i>Insomnia</i>, in which Al Pacino wanders through the
            Alaskan fog, vainly searching for an elusive killer. Culminating in
            a nasty, no-holds-barred interrogation of two dealers (Busta Rhymes
            and Richard Chevolleau) who interacted with Calvess before the
            shooting, <i>Narc</i> drops us into the abandoned, industrial
            innards of an urban chop shop.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Oak has shackled the duo of gangsters, and is attempting to
            extract a confession for his dead partner’s murder through a
            relentless physical and psychological drilling.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Meanwhile, Tellis must dissect the case using his own cunning
            and instinct, even if it means confronting the intimidating Oak.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In their depictions of men warping
            and twisting under enormous pressure, Patric and Liotta have never
            been better.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As the
            more subtle and understated Tellis, Patric is all internalized
            torment as he tears each layer off of the Calvess mystery using a
            detective’s silent savvy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Countering
            his co-star’s evocation of quiet desperation, Liotta lets it rip
            as the physical, impulsive Oak.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>It’s to Liotta’s credit that his complex creation can
            keep the audience guessing as to Oak’s ultimate role in the
            puzzle.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Appearing shifty and suspicious one minute, as when he
            reprimands Tellis for questioning Calvess’ widow about the case,
            Oak can be admirably straightforward and heroic the next.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meanwhile, director Carnahan
            deserves accolades for resurrecting crime films that put substance
            over style. By intentionally bleaching out <i>Narc’s</i> color
            scheme and creating a grainy canvas reminiscent of Steven
            Soderbergh’s <i>Traffic</i>, the filmmaker keeps his focus on
            character development.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And
            unlike other recent thrillers that present violence as a throwaway
            punch line, <i>Narc</i> emphasizes the irreparable damage done to
            men who live life in the trenches of crime.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>When Oak and Tellis question a mangy, sore-covered junkie
            scratching his nether regions and begging for a fix, the image is
            hard to endure. But somewhere out there, the narcs of our cities
            cope with such cringe-worthy images on a regular basis, and seldom
            emerge unscathed.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Narc</i>
            reminds us of the price that they pay.</font><hr size="1">
