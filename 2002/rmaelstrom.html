            review by <a href="../paula.html" target="_top">Paula Nechak</a>, 5 April 2002</i></font><p>
            <span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">It's ironic that 
            we're neighbors and yet glimpse so few films birthed from the 
            creative and iconoclastic cinematic bed of Canada. Besides Atom 
            Egoyan and David Cronenberg, Bruce McDonald, Patricia Rozema and 
            David Cronenberg often find distribution and Don McKellar, Lea Pool 
            and Guy Maddin attain limited release. But many other director's 
            works are never seen here and it's left to DVD to bring them home. 
            You can't &quot;blame Canada&quot; for lack of product because it's out there 
            and DVD, with its universal accessibility, is better than nothing at 
            all.&nbsp;</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">We never got to 
            see Denis Villeneuve's apocalyptic 1998 film, <i>August 32nd on 
            Earth</i>, despite the presence of international star Pascale 
            Bussieres. And Villeneuve's <i>Maelstrom</i>, which won five 
            Canadian Genie Awards, including best film, direction, 
            cinematography, screenplay and actress, is only now crawling onto 
            half-a-dozen American rep house screens.</font></span></p>
            <p><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Maelstrom</font></span></i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
            is a unique entry from Canada. It opens with visual strains sifted 
            from the absurdist surrealism of a Caro and Jeunet film. A crusty 
            old fish (voice by Pierre Lebeau) sits on the butcher's block; it 
            begins to narrate, &quot;Our story begins with someone leaving. It's an 
            old story,&quot; and introduces us to Bibiane Champagne (Marie-Josee 
            Croze), women's couture shop manager and daughter of a mythic 
            celebrity, who is in the midst of an abortion. Bibiane leads a 
            wasteful life, carousing, drinking, picking up men until one night 
            as she caroms home drunk, she accidentally crashes her BMW into a 
            man crossing the road. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">&quot;He who has 
            killed will be killed,&quot; interjects the fish, about to be beheaded by 
            a cleaver. But so happens the cathartic act that will shake up 
            Bibiane's life forever. <i>Maelstrom</i> is about cataclysmic 
            change, shedding the materialism and legacy of having too much 
            rather than self-knowledge and worth. Bibiane, in misery over her 
            carelessness, decides redemption will come by driving her car into 
            the waterway. If she lives &quot;she will begin to live&quot; and indeed, she 
            does survive her self-induced punishment.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">As might be 
            expected, <i>Maelstrom</i> is saturated with scenes of surging, 
            gushing water - the shower, a car wash, the ocean:&nbsp;water is the 
            cleansing, purging, purifying entity that washes away demons and the 
            destructive impulse. The manner in which water is used throughout 
            the film lends to a visual feast as well. The film begins its first 
            half hued with sterile whites and blues, and only erodes into warmer 
            tones as Bibiane comes into some sense of place, purpose and 
            awareness and is finally able to shed the sterile, confining chains 
            of a privileged existence and begin, in shucking off the legend of a 
            famous parent, to fathom her own heart and moral compass.</font></span></p>
            <p><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Maelstrom</font></span></i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
            is not a total success as a film, however, despite its wit, visual 
            prowess and intriguing premise. The third act sinks into a morass of 
            clichés and an attempt at cleverness in the final frame falls flat. 
            Yet for the first two acts Villeneuve has crafted a movie that 
            contains a message and metaphor. Bibiane is a symbol for our 
            cultural emptiness, wealth of material possessions, obsession with 
            youth and beauty and the ease and lack of conscience with which we 
            dispose of our guilt and troubles. It is only through an ultimate 
            tragedy that she can wake up from her malaise and begin the process 
            of reevaluating her life.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Actress Marie-Josee 
            Croze, who backslid by co-starring in the fiasco, <i>Battlefield 
            Earth</i>, after the success of <i>Maelstrom</i>, and who has the 
            lead in <i>Ararat</i>, the new Atom Egoyan film, is perilously 
            wonderful as Bibiane. She's a fearless actor, versatile and 
            dimensional and with a strength of will that belies her exterior 
            beauty. She gives us access to the dark and light within Bibiane and 
            isn't at all afraid to be unlikable and hard. It's fun to watch her 
            wake up and open herself to her own vulnerabilities and wants.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Yet even she 
            cannot quite rescue the anticlimactic effect that <i>Maelstrom</i> 
            suffers under. After so much marking of her intimate journey to 
            wholeness, that pesky final act is a slap in the face to the 
            carefully choreographed chaos that has made her trip so compelling. 
            The DVD edition is spare, few frills rather than the usual cast and 
            crew biographies and subtitle selection, but it is pristine and 
            crisp and the color is perfectly balanced despite its second-best 
            status to the movie-theatre experience.</font></span></td>
