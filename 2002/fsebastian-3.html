OK, now you're wondering how can any of the seven New Directors Jury members 
keep track of 1) the films we have to see, 2) the films we want to see, and 3) 
making sure you're at the right theater at the right time.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color: black">Unfortunately we had 
very little guidance from our supervisors, other than providing us the Festival 
catalog (348 glossy pages), the official carry bag, the handy day-planner, and 
two young professional volunteers (Ana Londaiz and Amaia Cag) to assist with 
ironing out any scheduling conflicts, tourist agendas, and festival demands. 
Priorities commanded we cordon off at least one of the only three or four 
screenings of the contending titles, although for the few jurors (myself, Bryony 
Dixon) who spoke preciously little Spanish, we had to make sure the prints we 
viewed had either English sub-titles or that nasty spoken dialogue (translated 
on the fly) piped in via wireless headphones. Parameters were set at an 
introductory dinner the evening before the festival began (a meeting missed only 
by Peter Scarlet, who was house-hunting with his wife back in my adopted town, 
Bethesda, Maryland).</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color: black">Heading back to the 
hotel that evening, several of us were determined to sidestep the logistical 
minefield that lay ahead. My approach was to pop open my portable PowerBook, 
fire up Microsoft Excel, and enter both the Official Section and Zabaltegi 
titles, plus any supplemental films I would like to catch in my spare time (fat 
chance), with all screening times and locations (most located within a ten to 
fifteen minute walk from each other) shown on one table. The most obvious 
problem was that two of the required features would not even be presented until
<i>after</i> we were scheduled to hold our final vote. Wherein we demanded 
previews of some of the features during the only open time frame available -- 
lunch. The best laid plan was that we meet at 1:30 on the 21st and head off for 
lunch and a movie. Unfortunately, you can't cram a leisurely lunch <i>and</i> a 
movie into a two-hour time slot. After ordering appetizers and entrees, the jury 
collectively decided to devour the former and skip out on the latter, instead 
dining on <i>Mina ja Morrison</i>. The ensuing mid-day <i>siesta</i> sessions, 
presented in the screening room at the nearby Cinemateca Vasca, were accompanied 
by finger sandwiches and bottled water.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color: black">The daily tug-of-war 
often began sometime between 9:00 and 10:00 a.m. After a marvelous buffet 
breakfast at our hotel, I often found myself not dining again until well into 
the evening hours. Fast food was out (although there is a McDonald's in town), 
so I'd opt for a cup or two of coffee in the Festival Sales Office. Aside from 
the screening commitments, there were several night time programs that required 
my attendance, and others (special awards to Dennis Hopper, Jessica Lange, and 
Bob Hoskins) which I wanted to catch. I ended up only finding time for Jessica, 
where my wife hoped to ogle a glimpse of Sam Shepard, her significant other. 
Jessica lashed out against American imperialism and President Bush's 
war-mongering agenda; Sam never made the trip.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color: black">OK. So much for the 
logistical nightmare. We made it work, although it took a really large shoehorn. 
How about the films?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color: black">Let's start with the 
bottom-dwellers. The definite clunker (well one of the judges mounted a failed, 
unofficial effort to make the rest of us think otherwise) was Rodrigue Jean's 
Canadian film <i>Yellowknife</i>, a tedious, poorly paced road trip about two 
siblings' journey into Northern exposed depravity and badly written dialogue. 
Our bad luck -- it was the longest (at 116 minutes) of the eligible films. The 
audience was breaking out in bouts of unintentional guffaws as the film dragged 
on. This was also one of the few entries that didn't sport English subtitles; 
the Festival-hired translator who did simultaneous translations from the Spanish 
subtitles, a seriously-toned woman giving us the English lines, also found 
herself struggling to contain her laughter.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color: black">Next up the ladder 
was director-writer-star Marina de Van's <i>Dans Ma Peau</i>, a French entry 
opening this December in Paris about a young office worker's deranged obsession 
in literally getting to know her inner self. She cannibalizes herself with an 
array of metal objects, peeling away her skin as her mental condition spirals 
downward. With each shocking, blood-filled surgically disgusting sequence the 
audience's stomach turned and left with an ever-increasing number of bodies 
streaming for the safety of daylight. &quot;You are what you eat,&quot; &quot;Eat Me,&quot; and 
&quot;Things go better with Coca-Cola&quot; (there's a can of Diet Coke in one scene) are 
three absurdist poster taglines that come to mind.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color: black">Best Bets?</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color: black">Aside from the three 
films (<i>Vylet</i>, <i>Jibeuro</i>, and <i>Hukkle</i>) the New Directors Jury 
honored, kudos to Michael Moore's <i>Bowling for Columbine</i>, his most 
accomplished and disturbing work (winning the Pearl of the Audience Award), and 
the equally powerful <i>Bloody Sunday</i>, Paul Greengrass' <i>Cops</i>-style 
damning of the 30-year-old British Army massacre in Derry, Northern Ireland. 
Stephen Frears' <i>Dirty Pretty Things</i> is an absorbing underworld thriller 
featuring <i>Amelie</i>'s Audrey Tautou and Chiwetel Ejiofor. Carlos Sorin's 
Patagonian <i>Historias Minimas</i> was one of the few lighter-hearted features, 
recounting three interconnected stories about a man and his dog, a woman and her 
quiz show, and a traveling salesman. This feature received a Special Jury Award 
from the Official Jury. <i>Lugares Comunes</i>, another Spanish-Argentine entry, 
garnered Best Screenplay honors for Adolfo Arisarain and Katy Saavedra's tale of 
an aging college professor (Federico Luppi) prematurely retired because of his 
political affiliation. Mercedes Sampietro received a Silver Shell prize as best 
actress for her role as the teacher's respectful, devoted wife.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color: black">Niki Caro's <i>Whale 
Rider</i>, which copped the audience award at the Toronto International Film 
Festival, will be opening here in the U.S. soon. This charming, well crafted 
interpretation of a Maori legend was extremely well received at its premiere 
screening. Chinese director-writer Chen Kaige's feature <i>Han Ni Zai Yiki 
(Together)</i>, which earned him the Best Director award, follows the life of a 
13-year-old child prodigy whose uneducated but doting father takes him to 
Beijing and maneuvers a prominent teacher to take on the lad as a protégé.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color: black">Also very worthwhile 
were Neil Jordan's <i>The Good Thief</i>, his gritty remake of Jean-Pierre 
Melville's <i>Bob le Flambeur</i>; Aki Kaurismäki's energetic Helsinki-based 
love story <i>Mies Vailla Menneisyyttä (The Man Without a Past)</i>, a Cannes 
festival winner featuring Markku Peltola and Kati Outinen as a displaced 
amnesiac and his shy Salvation Army savior; Roman Polanski's <i>The Pianist</i>, 
a color desaturated Warsaw Ghetto drama about well-known Polish pianist 
Wladyslaw Szpilman's miraculous survival; and <i>Lost in La Mancha</i>, the 
latest documentary from Keith Fulton and Louis Pepe, an enthusiastic diary of 
the un-making of Terry Gilliam's ill-fated adaptation of <i>Don Quixote</i>. The 
Youth Jury, comprising 350 youngsters, gave its nod to American entry <i>Real 
Women Have Curves</i> from director Patricia Cardoso. <i>Raising Victor Vargas</i>, 
a coming-of-age tale about New York City Lower East Side Latinos, from 
Brooklyn-born director Peter Sollett, amazingly won the <i>Made in Spanish</i> 
award.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color: black">As for old 
favorites, I regret not having more time for the Michael Powell's or &quot;50 from 
the 50s,&quot; a selection of some of cinema's best classics. Having promised myself 
I would catch a single Powell, I again fell in love with his stunning 
Technicolor romantic fantasy <i>A Matter of Life and Death</i>, in which David 
Niven misses an appointment with death (thanks to a dense British fog), falls in 
love with Kim Hunter, and then presses his case against reclamation of his life 
before a heavenly court presided over by Raymond Massey. A true gem.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color: black">What did I miss? A 
new restoration of <i>Lola Montes</i>. The Russia feature <i>Lubovnik (The 
Lover)</i>, which won the best photography award and shared the screenwriting 
prize. The Spanish-French-Italian co-production <i>Los Lunes al Sol</i> with 
Javier Bardem (but I did catch his <i>The Dancer Upstairs</i>, John Malkovich's 
feature directorial debut). That adaptation of <i>Balzac et la Petite Tailleuse 
Chinoise</i>. Hey, there are only so many hours in the day.</span></font></p>
