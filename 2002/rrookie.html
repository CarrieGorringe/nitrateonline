            review by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 5 April 2002</i></font><p>
            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jim Morris was a kid who dreamed of 
            playing baseball in the major leagues and actually did it for two 
            seasons. Few athletes reach such lofty heights and even fewer do so 
            when they've reached thirty-five. In most other lines of work, 
            that's the age when most begin to hit their strides. But the 
            punishment that playing sports takes on a body, sends baseball 
            players into retirement well before they've become senior citizens. 
            Morris could throw a ninety-eight-mile-an-hour fastball at an age 
            when most ballplayers are long gone from the game.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In <i>The Rookie</i>, first-time 
            director John Lee Hancock, who also wrote the scripts for Clint 
            Eastwood's <i>A Perfect World</i> and <i>Midnight in the Garden of 
            Good and Evil</i>, treats Morris's career like a kind of visual folk 
            tale. He and screenwriter Mark Rich (<i>Finding Forrester</i>) play 
            up the larger-than-life elements of Morris's quest, making the 
            unlikely nature of tale seem more palatable. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The movie opens with a sepia-tinged 
            prologue in which two nuns discover that prayer can make seemingly 
            foolish decisions, like loaning money to a wildcat oil driller, can 
            later turn into acts of providence.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Similarly, young baseball 
            enthusiast Jim Morris (played as a child by Trevor Morgan) devotes 
            considerable energy to baseball even though his family is never in 
            one place long enough for Jim to join a team. Naturally, his dad 
            (played by the redoubtable Brian Cox), a Navy man with little time 
            for sports, wants the lad to try more obviously practical pursuits. 
            As Jim gets older, he and his family move to a small Texas town 
            ironically named Big Lake where baseball is almost non-existent. 
            Even Jim's arm betrays him. Some injuries prevent him from ever 
            advancing beyond the minor leagues.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As an adult, Jim (now played by 
            Dennis Quaid) has abandoned his childhood fantasies completely. He's 
            now teaching high school science classes and has married a guidance 
            counselor named Lorrie (Australian actress Rachel Griffiths). With 
            three kids of his own, the only time Jim has for baseball is for 
            coaching a fairly sorry team at his school. Unbeknownst to Jim, 
            years of keeping himself in shape and off the pitcher's mound have 
            left him with an arm that can toss lightning.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the heart of football country, 
            the only beings willing to attend the baseball diamond are the deer 
            that graze on the outfield at night. The team's performance doesn't 
            help. The kids, however, notice the heat that's left in Jim's arm, 
            so they make a bet with Jim that if they can make the state finals, 
            he will try out for the majors. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Both events come to pass, and 
            Hancock and Rich somehow manage to keep things interesting. It helps 
            that movie readily acknowledges the difficulties that a 
            thirtysomething player would have in the minors. Jim may be in 
            better condition than his younger peers, but he has far more 
            obligations than they do. AA ballplayers, unlike their brethren in 
            the majors, earn wages more akin to a fry cook. The movie also, 
            thankfully, depicts Morris' home life in an unflinching manner. 
            Jim's family is happy that he can still intimidate on the mound, but 
            they can't decide if his efforts to make the pros are brave or 
            foolish.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There are a fair amount of cornball 
            touches here and there (do we really need to hear the ball go 
            &quot;whoosh&quot; every time Jim throws it?), but Quaid's performance proves 
            to be a solid anchor. He might be a good decade older than Morris 
            was at the time, but he does look convincing on the mound. As he has 
            matured, a look of resignation has accompanied his trademark grin. 
            This diffidence gives <i>The Rookie</i> a dramatic weight it 
            wouldn't have had otherwise.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ron Shelton, the writer-director 
            behind the classic baseball flick, <i>Bull Durham</i>, stated that 
            in order to for a sports movie to work, the cameras have to be able 
            to go where a TV network crew can't. Because <i>The Rookie</i> 
            manages to go deep inside&nbsp; Jim Morris's heart, the inevitable 
            clichés don't seem like that much of a problem.</font></td>
