            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Veteran director Brian Levant
            borrows all the predictability he previously cast upon us (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Jungle
            All the Way</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas</i>, and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Beethoven</i>)
            in guiding Disney's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Snow Dogs</i>
            down the post-holiday family movie chute. There's not much to like
            or dislike in this ride; it's the kind of all-season, live-action
            amusement that the Disney studio has been churning out for decades,
            involving all manner of animals (lions, and tiger, and bears…oh,
            my!) pitted against a likable nebbish-out-of-water role model. Cuba
            Gooding, Jr., fresh from last year's madcap <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Rat Race</i>, is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Snow Dogs</i>'
            leading victim -- a yuppified Miami dentist who inherits a team of
            Siberian huskies and a cuddly sheep dog -- as he soon finds himself
            on the receiving end of the animals' short leash. As a thickheaded
            tenderfoot cast adrift in the snows of Alaska, Gooding is the
            amiably flustered Ted Brooks, a plucky, ever-smiling owner of a
            Florida dental franchise caught unaware when he learns Amelia (the
            original <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Star Trek</i>'s
            Nichelle Nichols), his charmingly sweet-as-sugar-cookies mother, has
            hidden the dark secret of adoption from him. As his real mom has
            died and left him her frozen assets, he's curious to discover his
            roots and abandons the sunbelt for the icebound hamlet of Tolketna
            to deal with his rascally inheritance, attend to the wacky
            (demeanor) and decayed (teeth) denizens on that edge of
            civilization, and uncover the identity of his father.</b><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Wherein he find himself caught in
            the mongrels' bit, the acceptor of numerous windswept pratfalls,
            puppy love, and a just a smidgeon of danger. Just the right amount
            of PG-rated fun to bring the kids into the theater for 99 minutes of
            film fun and wholesome self discovery, wherein a poodle-hater
            becomes a dog-lover and all the tykes go home happy. It's tamed
            down, borderline Jack London for the masses, set against a
            breathtaking, snow-capped backdrop. White Fang-less.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What director Levant does have
            going for him is a wonderful supporting cast. Irascible James Coburn
            comically snarls his way through most of the film as the grizzled
            Thunder Jack, but his torment of the city slicker Ted turns to mush
            when the foreigner discovers his true blood lines. M. Emmet Walsh is
            his usual smarmy self as George Murphy, Ted's rugged pilot to the
            outback. Back home mom and her semi-dunderheaded nephew Rupert
            (Sisqo) are minding the store while Ted is caught in his dogs'
            crosshairs and the playful eye of Barb (Joanna Bacalso), the local
            barmaid in a town seemingly adrift of any other young and lovely
            mademoiselles. As for Gooding, he's ok in a role that would have
            been filled years ago by Dean Jones or Fred MacMurray. He can do
            single- and double-takes just fine and maintains a cheerful
            disposition despite the prankish abuse heaped upon him by man and
            beast. The role's no career-maker or vocation-breaker, but an
            easygoing example of Gooding's exaggerated comedic focus these days.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With a handful of writers, the
            story isn't the selling point. Jim Kouf might have the proven track
            record (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Stakeout</i>), but Michael Goldberg and Tommy Swerdlow provide that same
            comedic championing of the human spirit found in their <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Cool
            Runnings</i>, wherein men from a tropical climate find themselves
            contesting in a snowbound, world-renown sports classic. Hmmm. Yeah,
            well it's not the winter Olympics this time, but the Arctic
            Challenge, a 400-mile dogsled race, that garners ESPN's attention.
            The first hour is a lead-up for that contest, wherein the aging
            Thunder Jack makes his final quest for fame and glory, with a
            determined Ted throwing in the expected last-minute heroics.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Snow
            Dogs</i>, the dogs do have their day, playing a few CGI practical
            jokes on their mother's son before showing their noble brow. There's
            plenty of heartwarming mush to swirl around here, and those parents
            with a handful of pre-teens will find their youngsters enjoying the
            wisecracking huskies (occasionally voiced by Jim Belushi) as Ted
            finds himself asleep in a comically nightmarish landscape. It's as
            harmless as yellow snow. Just don't fall into it too far.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"></o:p>
