            <p><b><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            beauty of the three-hour epic, <i>Les Destinées</i>, is that it is
            directed by Olivier Assayas, the Frenchman who so exquisitely
            comments upon contemporary society through the examination of its
            relationships. The 1998 film <i>Late August, Early September</i> is
            one of my favorite Assayas efforts, languishing on dramatic events
            born out of everyday occurrences among a group of thirty-something
            Parisians who are linked by their friendship with a generation-older
            writer (Francois Cluzet). Gabriel (Mathieu Amalric), Jenny (Jeanne
            Balibar) and Anne (Virginie Ledoyen) weave through Adrien's chaotic
            life, searching for happiness and attempting to discern their place
            in the world's scheme. Only Adrien's inevitable death -- and the
            discovery that he has left behind an adolescent girlfriend named
            Vera (Mia Hansen-Love) -- allows them to find a fragment of footing
            on the slippery slope of circumstance.</font></span><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">
            <i>Late August, Early September</i> is a beautifully crafted film,
            teeming with small moments and observations. Those cinematic
            intimacies are Assayas' trademark as well in other films like <i>Irma
            Vep</i> and <i>Cold Water</i> and the director reaps a harvestful of
            human poignancies and riches in that which is not easily discerned
            in the haze and haste of urban bustle, impersonality and
            brusqueness.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></b></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It
            made sense then that Assayas might do wonders with <b><i>Les Destinées
            sentimentales</i></b>, a dense turn-of-the-century tome by Jacques
            Chardonne that chronicles the interwoven doings between two
            prominent French families. The film, which played at Cannes in 2000,
            is Assayas' first period piece and, as expected, pays lavish
            attention to detail and the delicate nuance of time and place. The
            Barnery lineage includes Jean (Charles Berling) a remote minister
            married to the wayward Nathalie (Isabelle Huppert). The film begins
            with a door closing and another opening as Jean dismisses his wife
            and young daughter to another town because he suspects she has been
            unfaithful. His prim and inaccessible mind wishes to avoid a scandal
            within his parish so, despite his concern for his child, he allows
            her to be taken and his already dour personality absorbs the loss
            like a sponge. He retreats further inside himself, believing he has
            a harbor in his faith. And though he is the family's saviour, he
            refuses to listen to their urgings to leave the ministry and take
            over operation of the family porcelain factory.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            Pommerels are another story. They're earthy and rebellious --
            especially the women. While the men tend to the manufacture of
            family label cognac, twenty-year-old Pauline (Emmanuelle Béart)
            returns from Paris where she has been educated in a
            &quot;modern&quot; way. But upon meeting upright, uptight Jean
            something melts inside of her. She understands that this staid,
            sensible man is her destiny and no obstacle (and there are many in
            the forty year expanse that the film frames) -- not divorce, poverty
            or war -- can keep them interminably apart.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There
            is so much visually right and new and thrilling in <b><i>Les Destinées</i></b>
            that it's a damned shame Assayas' usually reliable heart, as far as
            human instinct and behavior is concerned, fails him. For sure, his
            eye is on target: a ballroom dance sequence is reinvented from the
            morass of the usual wide angle it's been cursed with and emerges as
            intense and spellbinding as the opening tracking shot in <i>Goodfellas</i>.
            So it may be that the scope of a massive source text has blinded
            him, or he's gotten hung up in the minutae of making a movie that
            demands so much exhaustive research and restoration that he
            neglected the key components that have made his films great --
            narrative cohesiveness, passion and access into the minds and
            motivations of his characters.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's
            a misstep for Assayas, no matter how courageous, and I can only hope
            he'll have shaken off the desire to mine the mysteries of the past.
            While I admire innovation and attempting something new, Assayas
            belongs to the here and now. If he's gotten it out of his system and
            acknowledges that he tried a film that has been done many times in
            spirit -- <i>Sunshine</i>, <i>Jerusalem</i>, <i>The Age of Innocence</i>
            -- then perhaps he'll return to his generation -- one which
            desperately needs his brilliant vision.</font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
