            in 1765 France and based on the historical legend of the Beast of Gévaudan,
            Christophe Gans' <i>Brotherhood of the Wolf</i> (<i>Le pacte des
            loups</i>) is a huge, ballsy spectacle, especially by French
            standards. As such, it's a welcome rejoinder to the <i>Amelie</i>
            juggernaut -- a movie with big, messy politics, lots of action and
            anger, and a wide-ranging disdain for the &quot;French&quot; clichés
            so gaily embraced by Jeunet's film. For its anti-<i>Amelie</i>
            attitude alone, <i>Brotherhood</i> is cause for celebration: vive
            les loups. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There are other reasons to like <i>Brotherhood of the Wolf</i> (its
            slambanging fight choreography, Vincent Cassel's disquieting turn as
            a villain), as well as reasons to complain (its conceptual laziness
            regarding gender and race stereotypes), but its most striking aspect
            is its crazy mishmash of generic and cultural fragments -- French
            costume drama, monster movie mayhem, murky hallucinations, Hong-Kong
            action, kung-fu wirework, swords and flintlock rifles, busty whores
            and peasant girls looking after lambs. And oh yes, lots of blood and
            heaving bosoms, as the plot centers on the hunt for a horrible
            wolf-like monster that kills some 100 women and children (this part
            of the legend speaks to social and political circumstances, no
            doubt). The film's $29- million cost (meager by Hollywood standards)
            is everywhere on the screen: in the vast landscapes, lush interiors,
            detailed costumes, elaborate animatronic and digital beasties (by
            Jim Henson's Creature Shop, but entirely uncuddly), and speedy,
            extremely mobile camerawork. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Along
            with its splashy surface, <i>Brotherhood</i> also cooks up a bit of
            class analysis, with the Beast signifying the brutality and
            decadence that brought on the French Revolution. Like the Hughes'
            brothers' <i>From Hell</i>, <i>Brotherhood</i> indicts the
            privileged folks in rather elaborate fashion. Not only are they
            selfish and clueless, they're also generally dismissive of the poor,
            starving peasants who are the Beast's primary targets. Apparently,
            this has to do with access and vulnerability -- the farmers and
            herders are out in the open, easy prey. It also has to do with a
            baleful plot involving the cultish and grand-robe-wearing
            &quot;Brotherhood.&quot; (Think: <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i> or <i>The
            Ninth Gate</i>. Been there already, and recently.) In other words,
            the Beast makes the systemic abuses of the time literal, as well as
            sensational and legendary. Such abuses were, of course, already
            fairly literal and sensational, but the Beast ups that fantastic
            ante, being gigantic and alarmingly agile, with razor-sharp scales
            on its back and iron fangs. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            in most horror films, the details of the monster's form don't become
            visible until about ninety minutes in. And until then, you hear a
            lot <i>about</i> the Beast, in the form of survivors and witnesses'
            testimonies, and recollection by the narrator, Thomas Age (Jacques
            Perrin). As the film begins in 1794, Thomas, an aristocrat, is on
            his way out the door to be guillotined, courtesy of the French
            Revolution. This metaphorical point (linking the Beast and the
            guillotine) isn't quite so blunt-instrumental as it sounds, for
            Thomas is a &quot;good&quot; aristocrat (the real life figure on
            whom he's based was apparently saved from death by his servants).
            More importantly here, Thomas -- or rather, his younger self, played
            by Jeremie Renier (<i>La Promesse</i> and <i>Criminal Lovers</i>) --
            is one of the Beast's well-intentioned hunters. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thomas's
            story begins spectacularly, as the Beast ravages a voluptuous woman
            out in the countryside, and though the Beast remains a sinister,
            Jaws-like shadow, the tearing flesh and breaking bones are plenty
            explicit. Enter the hero, a specialist dispatched by Louis XV to
            take care of this increasing blight on his reputation (it can't look
            right to have your subjects splattered about the land). The dashing
            Fronsac (Samuel Le Bihan) is a &quot;naturalist,&quot; which means
            he's sort of a philosopher, sort of a scientist, and equally skilled
            in weaponry, taxidermy, and affairs of the boudoir. Fronsac's many
            talents make him an immediate target for the effete men who make up
            Gévaudan's authorities and kibitzers, including the requisite
            sneaky priest (Jean-Francois Stevenin) and the one-armed, resentful
            young aristocrat Jean Francois (Cassel). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Fronsac
            conducts his investigation with the help of his loyal buddy, Mani
            (Hawaiian-born martial arts star Marc Dacascos). A mystical-minded
            Iroquois warrior whom Fronsac picked up during his adventures in the
            New World, Mani is something of a novelty in France, where everyone
            assumes he's Fronsac's valet. Their ignorance enhances Fronsac's
            cool quotient, since he appreciates and even practices some of
            Mani's hallucinogenic rituals. The men are clearly devoted to one
            another, but the film makes specific use of Mani. Not only is he the
            token Other of Color and Emblem of America (wild, innocent,
            confident), he's also the smoothest ass-kicker in sight. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Just
            so, Mani must deal with the doubters. As in any Steven Seagal movie,
            the local overweening goons (here, cops or gypsies) challenge the
            foreigner, but Mani repeatedly outclasses them in technique and
            manner. With such obviously debauched opponents, Mani doesn't have
            to do much to win your sympathy, but he goes through the &quot;noble
            savage&quot; routine anyway, communing with nature and running about
            nearly naked so as to show off his excellent tats. As a party trick,
            he intuits guests' animal &quot;totems.&quot; His own is the wolf,
            which means that he's less than pleased by a massive hunting
            expedition that results in a pile of wolf corpses -- poor Mani looks
            so sad. This affinity for wolves aligns Mani with the Beast (who is
            sort of a tricked-out wolflike animal), as they are both victims of
            and outsiders to the European &quot;civilized&quot; culture. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mani
            exhibits his own kind of civility, with his graceful (hard) body and
            long flowing hair highlighted in several running-through-the woods
            shots. Mani's hyper-virility -- so lean, so inscrutable, and so dark
            -- eventually provides a model for Fronsac's climactic battle with
            the Beast. But until then, Fronsac displays his potency in the more
            usual ways -- shooting his gun and chasing skirts. When he's not
            busy wooing Jean Francois's sister Marianne (Emilie Dequenne), who
            is truly a vision in her smart red hunting outfit, astride her big
            steamy horse, he's down at the brothel, letting the mysterious
            Madame Sylvia (Monica Bellucci) play with her knife all over him. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yet,
            for all his hetero activity, Fronsac and Mani's buddy bond is
            paramount, and young Thomas observes it keenly, eager to get a piece
            of the Beast-killing action. If <i>Brotherhood</i> doesn't quite
            explore all the possibilities of this lively homosocial dynamic,
            suffice it to say that pursuing the Beast involves frequent
            penetrations and spurting fluids. Fronsac, being the hero, is
            destined to be with Marianne, of course (though not until she
            suffers a very, very nasty episode herself). But the happily ever
            after part is not even shown on screen, as the film is obviously
            much more interested in the transformation Fronsac must undergo to
            fit into such a sanctioned relationship.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            transformation occurs in his encounter with the Beast, as it enables
            Fronsac to see variously unpleasant sides of his culture, his
            science, and himself. The Beast represents the volatile combinations
            of sex and violence, religious dogma and emerging industrialism that
            will only become more emphatic in the near future, i.e., the French
            Revolution. <i>Brotherhood</i> is loaded with inflated metaphors and
            generic clichés, but it does deliver great action and it does
            wrestle with ideas, some of them rather ugly. </font><o:p>
