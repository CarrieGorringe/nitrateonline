            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700">
            <font size="2">Chris Rock first appears in <i>Bad Company</i> 
            playing Kevin, a self-consciously suave, designer-suited, 
            Harvard-educated CIA agent. Here he is in Prague, setting up a deal 
            to purchase a thermonuclear device from Vas (Peter Stormare), whom 
            you know is untrustworthy because he's flanked by Eurotrash thugs 
            and speaks with the corniest of movie-Russian accents. Kevin himself 
            appears to be just this side of shady, too, but it's hard to tell if 
            he's supposed to be acting so stiffly and unconvincingly, or if this 
            is Rock's idea of Bond-like urbanity. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">By the time 
            Kevin's mentor-partner, the top-coated Gaylord Oakes (Anthony 
            Hopkins), arrives on the scene, it's clear that the deal will not be 
            going down quite as planned. That is, the action was slowing down, 
            just four minutes into the movie. I was kind of hoping that Blade 
            would come slamming in the front door to sort things out, but no, 
            these jet-setting secret agent types are more nuanced than that. 
            After a few harrumphs and menacing glances, they agree to meet again 
            with cash and device in hand. Kevin and Oakes part ways on the dark 
            street outside; a funeral procession happens by, mournful chorus 
            included. Gee, you think that maybe trouble is brewing?&nbsp; </font>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Cut to the 
            chase, literally: Kevin is pursued by masked assassins in a car, who 
            actually don't catch him, even though he's running <i>uphill</i>. 
            (Apparently, phenomenal running skills are in favor over at the CIA: 
            by the end of <i>Bad Company</i>, Oakes -- played by Anthony 
            Hopkins, mind you -- will be sprinting three blocks in downtown NYC 
            to track down a nuclear bomb.) No matter his speed: the heroic and 
            noble Kevin doesn't want to &quot;compromise the mission,&quot; and throws 
            himself over Oakes when still another shooter in a helicopter. Oakes 
            then spends the rest of the film feeling guilty about the whole 
            business.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Not guilty 
            enough, however, to stop him from recruiting Kevin's twin brother 
            Jake (also played by Chris Rock) to stand in for dead brother during 
            the last crucial moments of this nuclear deal, in order to trap 
            Dragan (Matthew Marsh), the man who killed Kevin and is trying to 
            buy or steal the device from Vas. Dragan is, by the way, a terrorist 
            (of the Eastern-Euro variety), which means that shortly, the bomb 
            will be in play, the President will be at the Superbowl, and Ben 
            Affleck will be choppering in to deliver coordinates and... Oh no. 
            That was last week's 
            pushed-back-from-fall-2001-terrorist-threat-movie. This week's is 
            simultaneously less and more, less explosive and more preposterous, 
            less self-important and more cynical. If you can assume the inanity 
            -- Pookie as a CIA operative -- you'll have an easier go of it.
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The jokes start 
            coming almost as soon as Kevin's dead, as Oakes' somber face cuts to 
            Kevin's twin brother, Jake, a speed-chess hustler/ticket scalper. 
            Working a couple of scams in Washington Square Park, he's certainly 
            less ridiculous than Kevin, and so, more inviting as your point of 
            identification, not least because he cops an attitude toward the 
            CIA, at least at the beginning. His obnoxiousness is framed, in 
            part, by his clichéd projects background (&quot;We were so poor,&quot; he 
            quips, &quot;we used to lick food stamps for dinner&quot;). How lucky for Jake 
            that his brother -- whom he never knew existed, as they were 
            orphaned at birth and sent off to different foster homes -- has been 
            brutally murdered. How tedious, though, for you, as Rock appears to 
            be recycling ideas from <i>Down to Earth</i>, a movie that everyone 
            would honestly rather forget. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">This premise -- 
            the class-and-race-based fish-out-of-water business -- is obviously 
            far-fetched (and so the source of some vague comedy), and gets a 
            pseudo-boost from the fact that he's desperate for cash money 
            because his amazing girlfriend Julie (played by the amazing Kerry 
            Washington, who needs to be doing more than playing distressed 
            damsel-bait, which she inevitably becomes in this movie) is leaving 
            him for a new job and old boyfriend in Seattle. To convince her to 
            stay, Jake takes the CIA gig for $100,000 (evidently, he's not quite 
            so savvy as he supposes, to settle for this piddly sum), even 
            though, of course, he can't tell her what he's doing because you 
            never tell your girlfriend what you're doing when you're in a movie 
            like this. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">And what 
            exactly is a movie &quot;like this&quot;? Somewhere long a continuum of the 
            standard black-white buddy flick (in which staid white partner 
            learns to live again from wisecracking black partner); <i>La Femme 
            Nikita</i> (where the incredibly naturally gifted young secret agent 
            in training is not apprised of anything that's at stake, including 
            impending death and threats to his loved ones) and <i>Bait</i> or <i>
            Enemy of the State</i> (where the target of an surveillance 
            operation is a young black man who is, by definition, on the run 
            from whatever generally oppressive and specially abusive system you 
            want to imagine -- cops, CIA, terrorists). </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The point of <i>
            Bad Company</i> -- which title refers to what, exactly? The CIA? 
            Kevin's friends? Jake's friends? Anthony Hopkins' management? -- 
            appears to be that through his extraordinary trials, Jake will learn 
            to be a better person (better husband material, better sequel 
            material, better son material for his foster mom, played by typecast 
            Irma P. Hall), because he will know how to select wine, appreciate 
            classical music (&quot;You mean like Run-DMC?&quot; he asks), and, no doubt, 
            run fast and hard and ever-impressively. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Directed by 
            Joel Schumacher and produced by the overextended Jerry Bruckheimer 
            (please! take a breath), the movie slides quickly down its slippery 
            illogical slope. Once Jake learns his super-agent etiquette and 
            passes as Kevin in his fancy NYC apartment house, he's shipped off 
            to Prague to meet with Vas. Surprise, no one tells him that Kevin's 
            girl is there, and so he walks into his hotel suite there to find 
            the luscious Nicole (Garcelle Beauvais-Nilon), a CNN reporter from 
            whom he must hide his secret, lest she bust his cover. She works 
            very hard to seduce him -- lingerie in the boudoir, bare foot in his 
            crotch at dinner, deep tongue kissing in the hallway, and oh yes, 
            showering at his place -- but he is Chris Rock and this is a 
            comedy-action picture, so the liaison ends in silly efforts to 
            escape thugs carrying loud and large automatic weapons by falling 
            down a laundry chute (and how many action-pix have used this tired 
            bit of business?). </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Enter Oakes and 
            his smoothly efficient crew of computer geeks and cold-blooded 
            killers, including pretty boy Seale (Gabriel Macht) and the 
            apparently irrelevant Swanson (Brooke Smith, here turned into Queen 
            of Reaction Shots; she has only three lines of dialogue, but lots of 
            stern looks, plus a perversely undeveloped romance with Oakes). This 
            particular rescue allows Hopkins a remarkably Eastwoodian moment, as 
            Oakes arrives on the scene, chewing gum while shooting an enemy 
            dead. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">But such 
            tilting toward cool comes to naught, as Rock concurrently works 
            overtime to maintain a loony-tunes affect (screaming during the 
            inevitable car chase, ducking during numerous shoot-outs, cracking 
            wise during a completely incongruous 
            got-girls-in-my-swank-hotel-room scene, under Roy Orbison's &quot;Oh, 
            Pretty Woman&quot;). The fact that <i>Bad Company</i> was postponed after 
            9-11 suggests that the distributors were for a moment sensitive to 
            questions of taste, ironic twisting, and timing. Now, while the 
            subject matter might be less immediately traumatic, the twisting has 
            turned painful. <i>Bad Company</i>'s unwieldy mix of genres and 
            rhythms makes everyone look uncomfortable. However hard Rock and 
            Hopkins work to make sense of the very tired 
            black-white/young-old/ironic-earnest buddy formula, <i>Bad Company</i>'s 
            timing is still off. </font></span></td>
