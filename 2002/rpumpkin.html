            <p><b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Christina 
            Ricci has recently been on a public-confessions kick. Turns out that 
            she not only survived making <i>Mermaids </i>with Cher and Winona 
            Ryder, but also, a traumatic childhood, anorexia, a season of <i>
            Ally McBeal</i>, along with other, common True Hollywood 
            Stories-style horrors. Her movie choices, by contrast, are 
            refreshingly unusual: Vincent Gallo's creepy </font></span><i>
            <span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Buffalo 66</font></span></i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">, 
            Tim Burton's eccentric <i>Sleepy Hollow</i>, and Don Roos' brilliant
            <i>The Opposite of Sex</i>. </font></span></b></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Ricci's latest 
            strange choice is <i>Pumpkin,</i> which she has also co-produced. 
            Directed by Anthony Abrams and Adam Larson Broder (who teamed to 
            write the story for 1998's seriously unclever <i>Dead Man on Campus</i>),
            <i>Pumpkin</i> ostensibly satirizes college-melodrama-comedies, but 
            never quite finds a coherent tone or, for that matter, very 
            interesting targets for jokes. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Ricci plays 
            Carolyn, the only blond in Alpha Omega Pi, her sorority at Southern 
            California State University. Apparently, this difference signals her 
            capacity to think herself free of the herd, which includes head 
            sister in the house Julie (Marisa Coughlan, whose appearance in a 
            film might start counting as the kiss of death, given her previous 
            picks -- <i>Super Troopers</i>, <i>When Freddy Got Fingered,</i> <i>
            Gossip</i>) and grumpy Jeanine (Dominique Swain). Desperate to beat 
            their rivals, Tri Omega, for Sorority of the Year (or some such 
            ting), AOPi decide to mentor young male athletes prepping for the 
            &quot;Challenged Games.&quot; </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">At first the 
            girls are all ewwwy about the venture, Jeanine going so far as to 
            scream and run off in a panic when she first meets her protege. 
            Though she is also repulsed by her charge, Pumpkin Romanoff (Hank 
            Harris), Carolyn tries her best to seem receptive, barely containing 
            her disgust while teaching him to toss a discus and kick a soccer 
            ball. After a couple of meetings and passing encouragement from her 
            tennis star boyfriend Kent (Sam Ball, who has a jaw that looks like 
            Bruce Campbell's plus a Dudley-Do-Right prosthetic -- amazing), 
            Carolyn starts to think that Pumpkin can see into her soul. She 
            attributes this ability to his having suffered pain, which she, of 
            course, has not. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Carolyn 
            imagines that experiencing pain will make her deep, and to help her 
            out, the rest of the film has her suffering a lot of it. Though 
            Pumpkin's well-intentioned mother (long-suffering Brenda Blethyn) 
            tries half-heartedly to keep her son away from the girls she comes 
            to see as a &quot;whore,&quot; it's clear that Carolyn's sense of destiny will 
            prevail. And if her &quot;development&quot; takes her down a few roads she 
            doesn't anticipate, you can see them coming a mile away. What's less 
            easy to predict is how and where the film is headed, emotionally and 
            politically. As Carolyn endures (even actively pursues) one 
            devastation after another -- loss of her boyfriend, her sorority 
            membership, her friends, her self-esteem -- <i>Pumpkin</i>'s point 
            becomes increasingly hard to see. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">That's not to 
            say that its possible intentions are hard to see. It seems obvious 
            that the film is looking to skewer conventions and genres galore -- 
            romantic comedy, Greek-organization farce, <i>West Side Story</i> -- 
            but the jibes are less than original. While the movie makes fun of 
            all kinds of prejudices (as the sorority girls endeavor to rush 
            &quot;diversity&quot; quota-fillers, or struggle with their fears of the 
            &quot;challenged&quot; boys), it encourages viewers to laugh at the targets of 
            prejudice, much like Farrelly brothers' movies tend to do (remember 
            Ben Stiller chucking Frisbees at his &quot;challenged&quot; partner's head). 
            So, Pumpkin's efforts to stand up from his wheelchair, lift weights, 
            or play soccer are made to look simultaneously &quot;heroic&quot; and offered 
            as moments for viewers' self-conscious laughter. You pay for your 
            pleasure. But you still get your pleasure. Sort of. </font></span>
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The film looks 
            like it wants to be provocative and contrary, but its jibes and 
            so-called &quot;risks&quot; are run of the mill. It includes several 
            &quot;incorrect&quot; images and jokes, but descends more often to broad lobs, 
            at air-headed sorority girls; a self-loving poetry teacher (Harry 
            Lennix); Carolyn's hideously rich, ignorant, and selfish mother 
            Chippy (Lisa Banes); Kent and his one-dimensional studly teammates. 
            The ill-fated, lantern-jawed Kent does catch the brunt of the film's 
            cruelty, as his sense of shame when Carolyn chooses to bed a 
            &quot;retard&quot; over him, leads to an incredibly hysterical highway drive, 
            complete with cliff and screeching brakes, all leading him to become 
            a &quot;better person.&quot; (To its credit, the film here includes a moment 
            of musical-score overstatement that rivals a Douglas Sirk 
            melodrama.) </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">But aside from 
            such brief lunacies and Ricci's straight-faced performance, <i>
            Pumpkin</i> mostly settles for jokes that you've already seen 
            over-killed elsewhere. The aggressive &quot;bad taste&quot; and gotcha humor, 
            plainly conjured with the intent to appall or surprise, are finally 
            not so transgressive as they are mainstream and common. Carolyn's 
            journey takes her rolling over the feelings of various friends and 
            acquaintances -- not least of all Pumpkin, whom she abuses, 
            ostensibly unintentionally, again and again. The movie appears to be 
            making fun of making fun of &quot;retards,&quot; &quot;gimps,&quot; frat boys, 
            egomaniacs, et. al. But the &quot;making&quot; part is too strained and the 
            &quot;fun&quot; part is too stale. </font></span></td>
