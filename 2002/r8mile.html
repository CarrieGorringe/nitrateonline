            <font size="2">&quot;Soul's escaping, through this hole that is gaping. / 
            This world is mine for the taking. / Make me king, as we move toward 
            a new world order. / A normal life is boring; but superstardom's / 
            close to postmortem, it only grows harder.&quot; The lyrics for Eminem's 
            first single off the <i>8 Mile</i> soundtrack are as earnest and 
            compelling as anything this gifted mc has written. And the start of 
            the film has as his character, Jimmy Smith Jr. (a.k.a. Bunny Rabbit, 
            B-Rabbit, Rabbit), not even beginning to grasp what's ahead of him. 
            He jogs in place to Mobb Deep, in a filthy club bathroom, waiting 
            for and dreading his moment on stage. He checks his hood in the 
            mirror, gestures with an &quot;air mic,&quot; then, just as he thinks he might 
            be ready, lurches to the toilet to puke up his dinner.&nbsp; </font>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">It only grows 
            harder. And doesn't Eminem know it. With the release of <i>8 Mile</i>, 
            Em is everywhere, on the covers of <i>Entertainment Weekly</i>, <i>
            Spin</i>, and <i>The New York Times Magazine</i> (Frank Rich, of all 
            people, does the honoring inside), as well as an omnipresent range 
            of specials on MTV and BET (<i>Movie House</i>, <i>Jammed</i>, <i>
            Artist Collection</i>, <i>Biorhythm</i>, <i>Movie Special</i>), not 
            to mention <i>Access Hollywood</i> and AOL's front page (&quot;Ghetto Boy 
            Meets World&quot;): sign in for the chat and you too can extol the 
            virtues of Hollywood's new superstar. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Curtis Hanson's<i> 
            8 Mile</i> takes place before all this ruckus, in a time of 
            prelapserian yearning. In 1995 Detroit, Rabbit is all things 
            righteous: poor but generous, white but self-aware, ambitious but 
            sensitive. Living in a trailer park, working at an auto plant, 
            disrespected by the premiere local crew (apparently ironically 
            called Leaders of the Free World), Rabbit dreams of escape. And yet, 
            at film's start, Rabbit chokes, says not a word on stage at the 
            Shelter, despite the fact that his boys are in the crowd and his 
            best friend, the ominously/expectantly named Future (Mekhi Phifer) 
            hosts the battles. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Rabbit rides 
            the bus home, humiliated. He's just left his girlfriend (Gap triller 
            Taryn Manning), and so he's heading back to his mom's (Kim Basinger) 
            trailer. There he finds her in mid-sex-act with loutish Ray (Michael 
            Shannon), Rabbit's own former schoolmate and -- most damning -- a 
            Skynard fan. (Mom has her own dreams, that Ray will save her when 
            his insurance settlement check comes in, and the film punishes her 
            for her lack of vision and selfishness.) To top off this evening of 
            grisly comedowns, Rabbit has to rescue his angelically blond little 
            sister Lily (Chloe Greenfield), awakened when Ray and Rabbit start 
            fighting. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Thus, just ten 
            minutes into <i>8 Mile</i>, you pretty much know the score: Rabbit 
            is skinny (Em lost twenty pounds to play him, and looks almost 
            fragile at times), genuinely damaged, morally sound. He's also prone 
            to violence but with reason, destined (against all odds!) to 
            prevail. Scott (<i>The Mod Squad</i>) Silver's tired script hardly 
            bothers to develop a character or plot, but why should it? This is a 
            movie about myth and mythmaking, in this case, Eminem's -- battle 
            mc, shattered son, loyal ally, good father, artistic genius, and 
            friend to gays. And yes, this last is a stretch: Eminem, so famously 
            phobic, plays Rabbit, so earnestly egalitarian. Rabbit displays 
            initial confidence in his talent by coming to the rescue down at the 
            auto plant: a bully (Xzibit, doing screen-time with his tour-mate) 
            picks on a woman practicing her rap, and then a bystanding 
            homosexual; Rabbit steps up with impressive and enlightened wordplay 
            (the bully is the &quot;faggot&quot;), so endearing himself to Gay Man that 
            when he needs a favor a few scenes later, Gay Man's got his back.
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Such 
            fictionalizing ensures Eminem's lovability, across all categories 
            (the <i>Voice</i> this week titles his phenom &quot;Crossover Dream&quot;). 
            More significantly, it lays bare the processes and functions of 
            popular myth. Rabbit/Eminem's story is premised on the inherent 
            probity of poverty, at least as it's coupled with whiteness; 
            tellingly, the black local champion lyricist and Rabbit's chief 
            nemesis, Papa Doc (Anthony Mackie), is outed as a private-school 
            student <i>and</i> product of a non-broken home, mos def no-nos when 
            you're trying to be real. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Rabbit's 
            realness lies in his misery and, notably, the treachery all around 
            him: his mom keeps promising she'll clean up; his ex lies about 
            being pregnant; his current flame, Alex (Brittany Murphy) cheats to 
            advance her modeling career; and his homeboy Wink (Eugene Byrd) 
            keeps promising him studio time but screws him over instead. Rabbit 
            himself never betrays his friends, a personable but easily 
            thumbnailed lot -- earnest Sol George (Omar Benson Miller), goofy 
            Cheddar Bob (Evan Jones), political DJ Iz (De'Angelo Wilson) -- with 
            whom he rides around at night, trading stories about what they'll do 
            when one of them breaks out. Their most likely ticket is, of course, 
            Rabbit, whose mad skills on the mic give them all hope, dreams of 
            fine women and phat rides, and relocation to anywhere that's not the 
            wrong side of the road called 8 Mile.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">When Rabbit is 
            dreaming of getting out, the film shows him writing rhymes, 
            scratching them on his scraps of paper while gazing on little Lily 
            drawing pictures of a happy family (her and Rabbit); &quot;Lose Yourself&quot; 
            pumps in its low-key version in the background. This is <i>8 Mile</i>'s 
            version of Stallone running up the museum steps. Indeed, the film 
            repeatedly and openly celebrates its allusions, as these comprise 
            its art and artifice. On-screen references range from mom watching 
            Sirk's <i>Imitation of Life</i> (in particular, a painful outing 
            scene) and Meth and Mary's &quot;All I Need&quot; in the background as Rabbit 
            eyes Alex shimmying across the room, to Junior Mafia's &quot;Get Money&quot; 
            and ODB's &quot;Shimmy Shimmy Ya&quot; as cruising tracks. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">But by the time 
            the Wu's &quot;C.R.E.A.M.&quot; is offering backstage commentary on the big 
            fat sell-out that seems likely to taint anyone affiliated with 
            Rabbit (or with this project), <i>8 Mile</i> is long past worrying 
            about it. This is a movie about making it, about beating back the 
            meanies, about individual gumption: when Rabbit assures his mom that 
            he's going to &quot;do it on my own,&quot; she nods sagely, &quot;You know Rabbit, 
            I think that's the best way.&quot; Hooray, team. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">While all this 
            too-familiar designing hurts the film, no doubt, makes it cheesy, 
            there's also something to be said for turning the <i>Rocky</i>-like 
            finale into a rowdy mc battle: how many AOL subscribers have cheered 
            on lyricists working anal sex, dick sizes, and f*cking each other's 
            girlfriends into their rhymes? </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">At the same 
            time, the movie might benefit from checking its source. Forget that 
            Rabbit's called out as Elvis, Vanilla Ice, or Leave it to Beaver: 
            Em's been here a million times already. He knows where he's from, 
            but more importantly, he knows where his art comes from. It comes 
            not only from the trailer where he lived with Debbie or the 
            arguments he's had with Kim or the many losses he's endured during 
            his twenty-nine years on the planet. It comes from hiphop, the frame 
            and culture that granted him a voice and gave him love. </font>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">And that, at 
            last, is the film's major lapse in judgment. In remaking this kid's 
            story into a &quot;universally&quot; appealing story, it pretends that Rabbit 
            fighting to get inside, to compete with his black neighbors in 
            Detroit, is the success, that he triumphed over race prejudice. 
            Eminem, like anyone who's paid attention, knows different. In &quot;White 
            America,&quot; he raps, &quot;Let's do the math: if I was black, I woulda sold 
            half.&quot; Rabbit's story is galvanizing and Eminem is a superstar. But 
            hiphop has more and other stories to tell. </font></span></td>
