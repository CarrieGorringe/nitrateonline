            <p><i><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Treasure Planet</font></b></i><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">,
            the new animated feature from the Disney Studios, is apparently set
            in the same alternate universe as the Japanese <i>manga</i> and <i>anime</i>,
            <i>Space Cruiser Yamato</i>, where interplanetary vessels travel
            back and forth at full sail and with no apparent requirements for
            oxygen.</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jim Hawkins is a young teenage lad
            who zooms around, like a skateboarder, on his &quot;solar
            surfer&quot;, while his mother sings the single-parent blues about
            how she just can't handle what her son's getting up to (&quot;Jim, I
            have had it!&quot;). In other words, the characters are
            disappointingly contempo-sounding in a picture where you were
            expecting, if not counting on, a little more imagination. Jim comes
            into possession of a treasure map -- a sphere which, when unlocked,
            projects a huge, 360-degree holographic navigation chart -- which
            promises to solve all of his and his mother's problems; he engages a
            ship from a space harbor which is built on the edge of a crescent
            moon-shaped body, but the ship's cook (we will skip over the one
            crew member who speaks in various emissions of air that are revealed
            to be a language called &quot;Flatula&quot;) turns out to be John
            Silver, who has a mechanical leg, hand, eye, and a gear that visibly
            chugs away on the side of his head.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">One recalls how Robert Newton --
            the screen's one, and only, Long John Silver -- combined an
            ever-present element of menace into his fascinatingly colorful
            depiction of the character from Robert Louis Stevenson's novel --
            you were always a little afraid of him, which was just as well,
            since it made him wholly convincing as a pirate. Here, the movie's
            John Silver (the &quot;Long&quot; is gone) is gradually turned into
            a father figure who takes the place of the one that abandoned Jim
            and his mother long ago, and who molds and shapes Jim's moral
            character and fiber during the events that follow. His character,
            though, goes all soft (even his tummy, which looks like a
            marshmallow).</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The movie also keeps changing comic
            foils.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>First, it's the
            canine-esque Dr. Doppler (voiced by David Hyde Pierce, who did some
            wonderful work during the animated segments of <i>Osmosis Jones</i>);
            then, it's Morph, a little floating jelly-like creature who
            shape-shifts, has big eyes, and coos (since it's jelly-like, I
            wonder how they're going to market <i>that</i> character as an
            action figure!); finally, it's the film's version of the hermit-like
            Old Ben -- here, an articulated waffle iron who has, literally, lost
            part of its mind (there's a hole in the back) and jabbers madly, at
            one point saying something like, &quot;Was I have died up an admiral
            named Lupe?&quot; (That's what my notes say.)<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's too bad the filmmakers
            couldn't have glued together something more solid, here, as the
            picture is visually quite beautiful, with settings and backgrounds
            that have the burnished, lustrous look of N.C. Wyeth illustrations.
            But the film seriously lacks the grace and humor that distinguished <i>The
            Little Mermaid</i> (and, later, <i>Aladdin</i>), the animated
            feature John Musker and Ron Clemens previously worked on. Much of
            the joy from that picture was in the thrill of watching how it went
            out and staked its own territory; here, the picture feels like it's
            photocopying itself from other sources almost from the start, and,
            by the end, there's a weirdly unsatisfying feel to it, where you
            find yourself indifferent as to how the story's going to resolve
            itself and to what's going to happen to the characters on the
            screen, let alone how they're going to, putatively, live happily
            ever after. Probably the only thing that could've shaken things up
            was if the film suddenly mutated into <i>Urotsukidoji </i>territory
            during its last five minutes, scaring the pants off of everybody.</font></td>
