            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700">
            <font size="2">First time director Stephen Gaghan (who wrote <i>
            Traffic</i>) says that he wanted to make a movie about &quot;college 
            students under far too much pressure&quot; (<i>The New York Times</i> 8 
            September 2002). You might see some of that movie in <i>Abandon</i>, 
            as it occasionally treats its young protagonists with some measure 
            of respect, allowing that they have concerns beyond parties, sex, 
            and romance. Unfortunately, more often than not, the film lapses 
            into basic thriller tricks, distracting from its gloomily convoluted 
            visuals and focus on a particularly weird college-induced crisis.&nbsp;
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">At the center 
            of <i>Abandon</i> is November's <i>Cosmopolitan</i> cover girl and
            <i>Movieline</i>'s most recent designate as &quot;Hollywood's Jackpot 
            Star,&quot; Katie Holmes. Surely, she's due to break out, having done her 
            time on <i>Dawson's Creek</i>, and survived the high-school horror 
            movie <i>Disturbing Behavior</i>, as well as a couple of pretty-girl 
            parts in <i>The Gift</i> and <i>Wonder Boys</i>. Coincidentally, 
            Dawson (James Van Der Beek) is having his own breakout moment just 
            now, playing the odious college student Sean Bateman in <i>The Rules 
            of Attraction</i>. But, truth be told, Holmes' Catherine Burke 
            (Katie to her friends) brings more pain than bad boy Sean might even 
            imagine. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">As <i>Abandon</i> 
            begins, Katie is about to graduate from a small New England college 
            (actual location: McGill University in Montreal). And, as usually 
            happens on such occasion, all Katie's long-festering &quot;issues&quot; are 
            coming to a head. Her thesis is due and she's having nightmares 
            about her father leaving her when she was three (these stark and 
            snowy scenes offer one angle on the film's title, though there are 
            others, including the &quot;abandon&quot; she thinks she should be feeling as 
            she looks out on a future so full of conventional promise). She has 
            a hugely important and much-coveted job interview, to which she's 
            been invited by a sleazy male executive, and she's seeing a shrink, 
            Dr. Dave (Tony Goldwyn), who's acting too cozy, leaning in toward 
            her and looking deeply into her eyes, just before he writes her a 
            scrip after three minutes of conversation. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">On top of all 
            this, a local detective, the awkwardly named Wade Handler (Benjamin 
            Bratt), appears on campus, asking questions about the mysterious 
            disappearance of Katie's boyfriend Embry (Charlie Hunnam, of the 
            U.K. <i>Queer As Folk</i>). Just why the investigation is re-opening 
            at this moment is not so clear, as Embry disappeared two years ago 
            when Joey -- er, Katie -- was a wide-eyed, hopeful sophomore, 
            crushed by the fact that he never sent for her as he promised he 
            would. Embry is somewhat notorious around campus. A wealthy, 
            self-loving 
            genius-poet-performer-archeologist-musician-whatever-else-he-decides-to-be, 
            he disappeared on the night of his last campus performance, &quot;Trip 
            Hop Inferno.&quot; Most folks presume he took off for Europe or some 
            exotic land, to spend his trust fund or seek the meaning of life. Or 
            maybe he's dead. He hasn't tapped his trust fund, so Townie Cop 
            comes calling. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Handler's 
            questions have Katie feeling murky and frazzled, igniting flashbacks 
            galore, some seemingly related to Handler, but others perhaps not. 
            In these, Embry appears significantly less magnetic-rockstar-ish 
            than everyone seems to think him, more obviously twitty and 
            pretentious; such characteristics are, admittedly, hard to see when 
            you're a sophomore. Katie recalls her first encounter with Embry, as 
            he directs her in a chorus for one of his brilliant creations, 
            zeroing in on her voice among the many, as a means to teach the 
            group a lesson, namely, as he has them repeatedly yell: &quot;I am the 
            infantile center of the goddamn universe.&quot; </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">This speaks 
            volumes about Embry's self-love, but Katie sees it as a sign of his 
            genius, and looks suitably stricken as he gazes on her. Next 
            flashback, he's in her room, rummaging through the contents of her 
            backpack. Determining that she's a virgin because she's so 
            hyper-organized, he tosses her planner and her finance textbook out 
            the window, and instructs her to make use of her voice: she should 
            sing, he says, though there's not a lot of evidence that she does it 
            well. And then he has her up against the wall, introducing her to 
            the immeasurable pleasures of sex with himself. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Bothered by 
            these memories -- which may or may not be shaped by lingering 
            desires -- Katie does her best to hold it together, only leaving the 
            library where she toils into wee hours on her thesis when her 
            friends drag her out. These are stock college movie friends: the 
            scene-stealing roommate Sam (Zooey Deschanel), dorm neighbor and 
            only black girl on campus Amanda (Gabrielle Union), and dedicated 
            anti-corporate-globalism activist Harrison (Gabriel Mann). His major 
            crush on our girl knows no limits, as he absorbs disses on a regular 
            basis, as when Katie dismisses his politics. &quot;Anti-globalism? You 
            might as well stop oxygen or the sun coming up.&quot; Cynical <i>and</i> 
            beautiful. No wonder the boys can't resist her. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">This seems to 
            go double for the hapless detective, who packs all kinds of 
            vulnerabilities. For some reason, just when he's coming back to work 
            after some &quot;time off&quot; to deal with his alcoholism, his lieutenant 
            (Fred Ward) puts him on the missing-kid case. As he's interviewing 
            people who knew Embry, he's increasingly focused on Katie, dreamily 
            ignoring warnings from Mousy Julie (credited as such, and played by 
            perpetual good sport Melanie Lynsky) and about twelve other 
            characters: &quot;They think it's a coltish vulnerability,&quot; observes 
            Mousy Julie of Katie's charm, &quot;The pea-brain says she's in need of 
            saving.&quot; This pea-brain persists. &nbsp;</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Then again, 
            he's only about as obtuse and misdirected as everyone else on 
            screen. Sam &quot;jokingly&quot; accuses him of stalking Katie, then asks him 
            up for a drink (&quot;Bad Samantha!&quot; she scolds herself); and Harrison 
            acts out his jealousy of Katie's mutual interest in the cop by 
            telling her he loves her: her rejection is cold as they come. </font>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">This is an old 
            device, of course: like Dana Andrews in <i>Laura</i>, perhaps, or 
            Humphrey Bogart in <i>The Maltese Falcon</i>, the detective falls 
            for the chilly, visibly dangerous object of his investigation. Only 
            this time, she's half his age and very clearly unhinged. Not a good 
            or even very believable thing to do. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Katie's 
            unhinging takes a trite and specific form: she starts seeing Embry 
            on campus, at which point the plot descends quickly into nonsense. 
            She heads into the requisite nearby scary abandoned building without 
            a second thought. She cowers in her bed with the covers up to her 
            chin when someone comes pounding at her dorm room door, then does 
            nothing about it: no reports to school security or to the cop. She 
            starts writing furious, cryptic notes to herself (&quot;I have no 
            grace&quot;), and starts dropping by Handler's apartment late at night, 
            to tell him she's &quot;just afraid&quot; of Embry. And it's a very strange 
            thing that no one else notices Embry skulking about, given that he's 
            something of a local legend. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Such illogic 
            can certainly be forgiven, even useful. Slasher movies, after all, 
            rarely make strict rational sense, but they can be metaphorically 
            rich, viscerally effective, even politically provocative. At its 
            best, <i>Abandon</i> is clever and ambitious, insidiously drawing 
            you inside Katie's troubled, &quot;under pressure&quot; mind (or out of it: 
            check the corpse's point of view from the bottom of a conveniently 
            located and never-before noted pool of water, for instance). But 
            where the film's inconsistency of tone and perspective is 
            occasionally challenging, it eventually just feels like cheating.
