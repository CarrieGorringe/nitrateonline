              <font size="2">A man's alter ego is nothing more than his favorite

              --Frank W. Abagnale, </font><i><font size="2">Catch Me If You Can</font></i></span></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Frank Abagnale 
            (Leonardo DiCaprio) first appears in <i>Catch Me If You Can</i> on 
            the game show, <i>To Tell the Truth</i>. Three men in pilots' 
            uniforms stand up before a live audience and panel of questioners -- 
            including insert shots of the real Kitty Carlisle and Joe Garagiola 
            -- each proclaims his identity, not as a Pan Am pilot, but as a man 
            who pretended to be a Pan Am pilot, scamming free trips, hotel 
            rooms, and millions of dollars in checks cashed, from 1964-1967. 
            &quot;Some people,&quot; says Frank #1, &quot;consider me to be the world's 
            greatest impostor.&quot;&nbsp;</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">In this 
            semi-recreated TV moment, Frank appears an entertaining oddity, 
            slightly shy and wholly charming, more or less pleased to be 
            celebrated as a liar and a thief, a man who got over (as a teenager, 
            during most of his exploits) on all sorts of economic and legal 
            systems, around the globe. He also appears as Leo DiCaprio, at his 
            most completely disarming best. He's Leo but he's not, he's back but 
            he's new again, he's a celebrity playing someone who's playing a 
            celebrity. The circles of truth and image are wholly beguiling. It 
            makes an especially perverse sense that this first moment takes 
            place on <i>To Tell the Truth</i>, for Steven Spielberg's zippy new 
            film is indeed about the kind of &quot;truth&quot; that might only be 
            apprehended in (and as) its telling. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Based on 
            Abagnale's autobiography, <i>Catch Me If You Can</i> also celebrates 
            Frank's insidious intelligence, and treats his crimes as comedy, 
            instances of holes in the system. He's chased throughout by a 
            single, composite FBI agent, Carl Hanratty (Tom Hanks). This dogged 
            but amiable pursuer comes to admire his quarry as much as he sees 
            his own honor at stake in the capture. Hanratty is something of a 
            father figure, underlining Frank's boyishness and insecurity as well 
            as his ingenuity and charisma, as they develop -- over years -- a 
            relationship premised on mutual regard and, to an extent, affection.
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">This 
            relationship is perhaps most interesting for its cinematic aspects. 
            During Frank's escapades, they rarely appear on screen together, 
            speaking by phone (Frank: &quot;I want to call a truce&quot;; Hanratty: &quot;There 
            is no truce. You will be caught, and you will go to prison&quot;), 
            occasionally meeting or at least passing one another in crowded 
            spaces, like airports and hotel lobbies. Their lack of shared space 
            never detracts from their weird intimacy, their dance taking them in 
            parallel movements across similarly hyper-stylized interiors and 
            broad exteriors. And yet, for all their self-imposed distances 
            (partly because DiCaprio and Hanks seem genuinely fond of one 
            another and despite Hanks' silly accent), they forge a stronger, 
            more deeply resonating link than any that Frank manages with anyone 
            else, save his father, Frank Sr. (an affecting Christopher Walken).
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The film 
            proposes that its young hero -- like so many in the Spielberg 
            pantheon -- is haunted by childhood trauma (his parents' divorce) 
            and motivated by the desire to remake his family (if he can't 
            exactly have the original one, he's willing to marry his own lovely 
            girl, who is ten years his senior and believes he's a doctor <i>and</i> 
            her own age). The movie invites you to like Frank, to sympathize 
            with his (relative) plight, and Leo-as-Frank's charm does go a long 
            way toward this end. It also helps that he's surrounded by brightly 
            colored, thinly drawn supporting characters, so that he looks 
            alternately determined and brainy, naïve and vulnerable, and always 
            the most fully realized fellow in the room. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Truth be told, 
            there's little reason not to like the movie's Frank. The endearingly 
            self-conscious <i>To Tell the Truth</i> moment occurs in 1978, after 
            he has paid his debt to society -- served time in prison and worked 
            for the FBI as an expert on forgery -- and so, his desire to please, 
            to amuse and seduce, seems a sign of his rehabilitation. He never 
            meant to hurt anyone, see? Here, he shows he has achieved an 
            ultimate celebrity, performing himself well enough that his audience 
            believes and desires him, the product, the performance, the untruth 
            that passes as truth-enough. And, he's getting paid. </font></span>
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">This is 
            important for Frank, whose sense of abandonment as a child has 
            everything to do with money. The film flashes back to show a scene 
            or two when Frank Sr. and Paula (an underused Nathalie Baye) were 
            happy (in particular, a Christmas memory, when they dance blithely 
            to Judy Garland's &quot;Embraceable You,&quot; while Frank the son watches a 
            spreading red wine stain on the carpet -- sign of his imminent rage 
            for order or his premonition of domestic disaster?). Frank also 
            recalls a few scenes when mom's bringing home dad's Lodge associates 
            (James Brolin, for one). </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Her reasons for 
            betrayal remain mostly offscreen (it's her son's story, after all), 
            but his understanding of it begins with dad's failed business and 
            his mother's dissatisfaction (she went looking for work, and found 
            comfort in more traditionally supportive men, leaving Frank Jr. to 
            make his own birthday dinner -- pancakes). When Paula leaves him, 
            Frank Sr. spends his ensuing years yearning for her, telling and 
            retelling the fabulous story of their meeting in a French village 
            when he was a U.S. troop in WWII: &quot;And I turned to my buddies and 
            said, 'I will not leave France without her.'&quot; In other words, Sr. is 
            at once a profoundly romantic and haplessly tragic model for Jr.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The son's 
            reaction to the turmoil seems almost reasonable: he wants to 
            maintain control and garner respect from all who wander within his 
            vicinity, even the most insignificant, never-gonna-see-em-again 
            extras. Frank actually stumbles onto his first con accidentally, 
            though in the film's organization, it seems fated. Harassed by 
            students at his new school (the family's moved to a lower-rent 
            neighborhood where his school uniform looks out of place), Frank 
            seizes a moment, posing as a substitute French teacher in the 
            hostile classroom. He finds immediately that the rewards are huge: 
            instant respect, a sense of superiority and self-control, and 
            approval from would-have-been peers. That Frank Sr. laughs in 
            approval following a visit to the principal's office (Jr. has 
            maintained the charade for a week) is no small thing: the boy has 
            earned this all-important sanction just by being smarter than 
            everyone else.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">While this 
            reductive framework -- sad and lonely kid only wants to win back his 
            mother and father, awww -- might seem a far cry from today's 
            political bent, toward trying (and punishing) kids as adults, the 
            film hardly makes a radical reassessment of legal or moral issues. 
            In fact, its timing seems oddly ideal: this is a movie about a kid 
            who practices playing James Bond in the mirror, goes by the moniker 
            &quot;Barry Allen&quot; (the Flash's &quot;real&quot; name), and who messes with 
            airlines, banks, hospitals, schools, and the FBI, all institutions 
            currently bound up in various charges of corruption, scandal, and 
            greed. Frank looks like a near-perfect people's champion: if only he 
            was sticking it to WorldCom and Saddam, his target list would be 
            complete. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">In order to 
            maintain his sympathetic status, Frank's abuses are limited to 
            systems, easy not to care about. His dallying with women is 
            presented in an equally lighthearted manner, though none appears too 
            offended by his fooling (as if he really is <i>that</i> terrific in 
            bed). Among these conquests are a hooker played by Jennifer Garner 
            with elaborate hair (&quot;Don't be scared. Make me an offer&quot;) and 
            Frank's fiancée to be (and then not be), Brenda (Amy Adams). When 
            they meet, she's a candy striper, so sweet and innocent that she's 
            wearing braces; seemingly inspired, he forges a degree from Harvard 
            Med and watches a few episodes of <i>Dr. Kildare</i>, then poses as 
            a doctor. Later, trying to impress her lawyer father (Martin Sheen) 
            in an effort to reunite their estranged family, he pretends to have 
            a law degree as well, making him ready to join the paternal firm as 
            employee and son-in-law.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">There it is 
            again -- <i>Catch Me If You Can</i> is rife with mythic and 
            metaphorical dad anxieties. Whether you understand that dad as 
            representing a federal agency, a banking establishment, a national 
            identity (as his father does in the meeting-mom-in-France stories). 
            When he learns his mother has remarried, and has a little girl and 
            nice house to live in, Frank is as upset by his father's failure to 
            mention this earlier as he is by his mother's new life. When Other 
            Dad Hanratty shows up to take him in (again, for he's been caught 
            and escaped before), Frank begs to get in the car. The truth he 
            wants so badly to be told his way -- the way he's heard it before -- 
            doesn't exist. </font></span></p>
            <p><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Catch Me If 
            You Can</font></span></i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
            has a few extra endings, as has become Spielberg's wont (<i>A.I.</i>,
            <i>Minority Report</i>), but it has enough to say about the ways 
            that lies and half-truths shape our expectations, much less ground 
            our notions of family, that these excess minutes are less annoying 
            than they might have been. By the time you see the final title cards 
            informing you who's doing what now, you might even be reflecting on 
            the multiple ways that even these truths are being told. Or more 
            significantly, what's your stake in hearing them.</font></span></td>
