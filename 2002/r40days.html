            ads for <i>40 Days and 40 Nights</i> surely tell you more than you
            need to know about its one-joke premise. Pretty Josh Hartnett (last
            seen being bloodied and horrified in <i>Black Hawk Down</i>) makes a
            deal with himself, that he will not have sex -- neither with someone
            else nor with himself -- for the titular time period. Oh, the
            hilarity.</b><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There's
            a &quot;reason&quot; that this guy, whose name is Matt, makes this
            deal with himself. Big surprise, it has to do with his being dumped
            by the Queen-Diva-Bitch-on-Wheels of All Time, Nicole (Vinessa
            Shaw). His heartbreak is explained by a few
            under-the-opening-credits scenes, shot in handheld home-video style,
            to suggest how organic and wholesome (and ancient) their romance is.
            When she dumps him in favor of some VP of Offensive Nerdery at
            Morgan Stanley (who gives her a huge engagement rock), well, Matt is
            just beside himself. This instigates the aforementioned deal with
            himself. And it establishes the film's singularly dreadful point:
            this is a love story, yes, about a boy and his penis. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            isn't to say that the movie doesn't pretend that it's about a boy
            and a girl, for, inevitably, as soon as Matt makes this deal with
            himself/his penis, he meets the
            absolutely-wonderfully-stunningly-fantastically perfect girl, Erica
            (Shannyn Sossamon), at a Laundromat. You'd think that this might
            prompt him to rethink the deal: what exactly is at stake in it, and
            for whom? But, no. The movie never begins to answer, or really even
            ask, such questions. To tell you the truth, I'm not even really sure
            that I care that it doesn't. The penis jokes become increasingly
            tedious -- what with Matt trying so, um, hard, to resist the many
            temptations tossed in his way, mostly by girls who work at the same
            dotcom where he works, a place called bigwindow.com (he does some
            kind of graphic design, that apparently involves some very mundane
            cut and paste layout, not on a computer: whatever). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I
            confess that my mind was wandering far and often during the
            screening, but it wasn't entirely my fault -- a girl sitting next to
            me, with four friends on her other side, repeatedly informed them
            that the movie was &quot;really stupid,&quot; and she had to say it
            loudly enough so the girl four seats down could hear her.
            Ordinarily, when people who aren't you talk in the theater, it's
            irritating. But this girl ended up being more entertaining than the
            film, because her efforts to convey her distaste seemed to escalate
            with the level of the film's inanity: her gestures, her enunciation,
            her emphatically expressed pain. Let's just say it was a long night.
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">To
            return (briefly) to the plot, such as it is: when Matt concocts this
            deal with himself/his penis, his first confidante is his brother
            John (Adam Trese), a seminarian who has only a few weeks to go
            before priesthood and positively no good advice to give his brother
            (though he's supposedly expert on the abstinence thing, John is
            really very bad at it, and tells Matt every wrong thing to do). This
            Catholic connection is one of many clichés that <i>40 Days</i>
            can't seem to crawl out from underneath, but then again, the film's
            script is so highly dependent on clichés that it's hard to tell
            just where they begin and end (or <b><i>if</i></b>). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">When
            Matt finds out that his ostensible friends (a roommate, his
            coworkers, and the Bagel Guy) are taking bets on whether he can
            complete the deal, and as well taking bets from people around the
            world on the internet, this daunts him not. In fact, Matt becomes
            more determined than ever when he sees that others might benefit
            monetarily from his failure. But it's not about money. There's a
            principle involved. Maybe you have to have a penis to understand
            what that principle might be. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There
            are, of course, other penises in this mix, mostly to demonstrate
            that Matt's relationship to his own penis is relatively healthy, or
            at least relatively unpathological. His buddies, of course, make
            dick jokes at every turn. And in a desperate effort to make him
            desperate enough to jerk off in the men's room at work, they scheme
            to dose him secretly with Viagra. That the dose goes to his boss
            (Griffin Dunne, sweating and groveling and complaining about his
            woman who won't &quot;put out&quot; -- it's actually quite
            heartbreaking to see Dunne going on like this) is evidently a source
            of immense humor, as the boss develops what appears to be a terminal
            erection, but perhaps I was distracted by that girl sitting next to
            me. &quot;This is SOOO stupid!&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And
            so, I started to think about director Michael Lehmann's distressing
            career, which, after the brilliant jumpstart with <i>Heathers</i>,
            has never recovered. I recall him telling me, during a 1994
            interview concerning <i>Airheads</i> (don't even ask how we came to
            that pretty pass), that he was unable to live down the disaster of <i>Hudson
            Hawk</i>, and it appears that this has remained the case. Though <i>The
            Truth About Cats and Dogs</i> was a relative commercial success, it
            remains a lame romantic comedy, based in the most tedious
            assumptions about heterosexual relations, namely, that games must be
            played, that boys must follow their dicks, and that girls
            (especially girls who think they are &quot;ugly&quot; like Janeane
            Garafolo: and how does that idea come into someone's head?) must
            also follow these same dicks... Clearly, somewhere, there is a
            failure to communicate. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's
            downright distressing that this &quot;new&quot; film (and I use the
            term advisedly) makes the same points: Matt has trouble fessing up
            to Erica that he's got this deal with himself, because, well, he
            knows she'll thinks it's ridiculous, which she does. But she also,
            as she must, succumbs at the end, and wishes him well on meeting his
            goal, if only he promises to hook up with her at deal's end. Guess
            what: the movie needs to milk this situation for another 26 minutes
            of stuff to show, so there are complications and Miss Bitch on
            Wheels makes a return appearance and Matt considers falling for her
            again, but really wants to do right by Erica, and, of course, by his
            penis, and... and... oh jeez, &quot;This is SOOO stupid!&quot; <o:p>
