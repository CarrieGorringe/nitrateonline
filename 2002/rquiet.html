            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Graham
            Greene was incensed when Joseph L Mankiewicz’s 1958 adaptation of
            his novel turned the story’s critical eye away from it’s
            anti-American standpoint and towards an anti-Communist led stance.
            Greene purists will therefore be more at ease with Philip Noyce’s
            new adaptation of <i>The Quiet American</i>, which deals more
            explicitly with the US involvement with Indo-Chinese politics during
            the 50s at the root of events leading up to the Vietnam War. His
            second politically sensitive film of the year after <i>Rabbit Proof
            Fence</i>, Noyce’s adaptation is a timely one that has been held
            back from release for over a year. But while it’s political
            implications may not sit easily in the current post September 11 /
            pre potential Iraq attack climate, they are worthy of thought and
            discussion, and Noyce’s film is adult and intelligent to bear this
            weight.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            eponymous American at the center of the tale is first encountered as
            his corpse is fished out of the Saigon river in the opening scenes,
            identified as Alden Pyle (Brendan Fraser) by his English reporter
            friend Thomas Fowler (Michael Caine). Only then does Fowler’s
            voiceover takes us back to Pyle’s ill-fated arrival in Saigon as a
            young an idealistic aide with charitable intentions for the war-torn
            area. Ostensibly good-natured, Pyle’s ideals clash with the
            world-weary London Times reporter Fowler, who is comfortably
            installed in an opium fuelled existence with his young Vietnamese
            lover Phuong (Do Thi Hai Yen). While Fowler keeps a distance between
            the political events and his role as a reporter, Pyle feels an
            inevitable involvement in the action and a need to help out, but
            nevertheless the two become friends.<o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s
            at this point in the story that Greene’s ability to graft
            political anxieties onto human relationships comes into play, as the
            love struck Pyle vies for Phuong, threatening Fowler and turning his
            attitude towards self-preservation. This is subtly dealt with by
            Noyce, but most superbly played out by Caine, who gives one of his
            best performances of late. The vulnerable older lover in danger of
            losing his woman to a younger contender, his crisis is one that’s
            been played out in literature since Chaucer, but here Phuong comes
            to represent Vietnam itself; the subject of dual intentions from
            established colonialism and new arrogance. Pyle expresses his
            intention to take care of Phuong, to protect and ultimately possess
            her - reflecting the military aspirations that lie behind Pyle and
            his fellow Americans’ façade in their meddling with Vietnamese
            politics. A little over-explained later on in the film, especially
            when Pyle actually states that ‘Phuong is like Vietnam,’ this
            theme remains by and large a subtle one. Noyce allows the tension
            between these three characters to play out whilst building up the
            political situation around them and allowing viewers to draw their
            own conclusions.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            metaphorical conflict of cultures is played out against the backdrop
            of real conflict that already exists in the region. Early on, a shot
            of Saigon harbor shows an idealistic combination of twinkling lights
            and tiny boats bobbing on the water. But flashing in the sky and
            rumbling in the distance are signs of discord beneath this sweet façade,
            a sense that pervades the entire film like the sense of foreboding
            underling Phuong’s change of allegiances. But where the film will
            be most problematic is in Pyle’s overt political ideology, the naïve
            view that a moral ‘third way’ brought about by surreptitious
            American involvement with General The’s (Quang Hai) alternative
            army will resolve the Franco-Communist conflict. But The’s bombing
            of Saigon Square later on leaves thirty people dead, possibly more
            over time, leaving the US complicit in the slaughter and anguish of
            innocent civilians.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But,
            given all these heavy politics, <i>The Quiet American</i> remains a
            pleasurable and entertaining film, nervously given a small December
            release so that it might qualify for the Oscars. And let’s hope it
            does. Caine is such a pleasure to watch and his conflicted,
            ambiguous character such a worthy evocations of Greene’s creation
            he deserves another statuette. Christopher Hampton’s screenplay
            has to rank as one of the most successful Greene adaptations so far,
            aided along the way by the voiceover written by producer Anthony
            Minghella. Of a similarly high caliber is Christopher Doyle’s
            cinematography, which recreates the humid, sticky, and exotic
            atmosphere of the era, and the mysterious allure that Vietnam held
            during this time. His work is as lush and artistic as the stunning
            imagery he created for Wong Kar Wai in In the Mood for Love. But if
            Noyce’s sumptuous film is brushed under the carpet in the name of
            political correctness, then we really are in trouble. Cinema as a
            challenging and mentally stimulating medium is just as important as
            escapism, even if it does raise questions we don’t really want to
            answer.<o:p>
