            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>Orange County</b></i><b>, the
            first new film of the year (no, I haven't seen <i>Impostor</i>,
            yet), turns out to be a little mild, genial, and, at least from this
            seat in the house, perfectly fine.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Shaun (Colin Hanks), a southern
            California high school senior, is aghast to learn that his chances
            for getting into Stanford -- and, thereby, becoming a professional
            writer -- have been dashed due to a clumsy mistake in paperwork. He
            then attempts, over the course of several days, to rectify this
            error, with help from his girlfriend Ashley (Schuyler Fisk, who has
            the same glorious smile as her mother, Sissy Spacek), and his older
            brother Lance (Jack Black), who has a propensity for speed the same
            way Ernest Thesiger's character in <i>The Bride of Frankenstein</i>
            had a weakness for gin, and at one point inadvertently causes a
            building to burn to the ground. (Asked by a fireman why he's only
            wearing underdrawers, Lance replies, quite naturally, that he took
            his trousers off so he could run faster through the flames.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The picture is modest, light,
            enjoyable, genuinely funny in parts, and displays a good amount of
            comic sense. (There is, at least, one urine joke, though, and a
            fleeting gag involving a dog, for anyone pining for such material.)
            As one of the characters says about Shaun's autobiographical
            writing, the filmmakers seem to genuinely like their characters,
            here, and the picture is more observant about them than you might
            expect when first going in. In a role where a comedian could easily
            have run-amuck to the point of intense irritation, Jack Black does a
            certain amount of running-amuck (his character is, after all,
            receiving pharmacological impetus in some scenes), but he knows how
            far to go and when to pull back. (He does not seem to mind spending
            a great deal of the picture in Jockey shorts, a feat many other
            actors have demurred from, for reasons I will gently not go into,
            here.) Colin Hanks, as Shaun, gives a fully engaging performance and
            shows definite comic verve: you really do end up wanting to see him
            succeed in his sometimes insurmountable task by the end of the
            picture.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The director Jake Kasdan has also
            assembled a fairly impressive amount of talent in the supporting
            roles, including John Lithgow, Lily Tomlin, Garry Marshall, Judith
            Ivey, Harold Ramis (who's hilarious), Jane Adams (ditto, as a
            Stanford admissions office worker), and the ever-amazing Catherine
            O'Hara (and, in unbilled appearances, Kevin Kline and Ben Stiller),
            and they're all deployed to good use. The only dark spot in the
            picture, and I wouldn't have mentioned it otherwise, is Chevy Chase,
            who makes a one-scene appearance near the beginning of the film as a
            high school principal: he never appears in the same shot with any of
            the actors whom he's supposed to be in the scene with, and he
            appears on-camera with dead eyes. It's a stinging moment: this is
            what twenty-five years of bad movies and bad career choices will get
            you.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
