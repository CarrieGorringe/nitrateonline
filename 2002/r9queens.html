            <font size="2"><i>Nine Queens</i> opens on a close-up: one cigarette 
            being lit with another. The camera pulls out to show chain-smoker 
            Juan (Gastón Pauls), shifting his weight and peering across the 
            street at an Esso gas station. He flicks the butt, crosses the 
            street, and enters the convenience store, where he fiddles with bags 
            of chips and cookies, until he decides on his purchase. At the 
            counter, he runs his scam, asking for change for a large bill, 
            miscounting and confusing the clerk. She goes off duty while he's 
            still in the store, and Juan decides to press his luck, trying the 
            same scam on her replacement, whereupon he's busted by a detective 
            who happens to be shopping, and has observed the whole deal. </font>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">As tends to 
            happen in movies about conmen, this opening scene doesn't take you 
            quite where you're expecting to go. And neither do many of the 
            scenes that follow -- deceit is, of course, the name of this game. 
            Still, this first scene in the convenience store sets up Juan's 
            youthful naïveté and nerve (going for that second scam seems 
            especially risky), and sets in motion his meeting with another, more 
            experienced conman, Marcos (Ricardo Darín). Theirs is a partnership 
            of some convenience: Marcos reveals that his previous partner has 
            recently moved on, and he's looking for a replacement; Juan is 
            looking for instruction and a leg up in the business. Over the next 
            thirty-six hours or so, they roam the streets of Buenos Aires, 
            testing one another's conning abilities and ostensible moral fibers.
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Their 
            differences are telling. Though Marcos is ruthless about taking 
            money from whomever he can (including little old ladies), while Juan 
            wants to draw lines. But as Marcos explains it, cons go on 
            continuously, and con artists are everywhere; as he lists the many 
            names for such artists, the camera searches the street, suggesting 
            that anyone in the frame might be a thief. Given that the film takes 
            place in Argentina, this speech has added resonance, but certainly, 
            it applies broadly, to any population premised on class divisions 
            and shot through with advertising campaigns that reaffirm the 
            overclasses' sense of superiority and privilege and fill 
            underclasses with desire.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i>Nine Queens</i>' 
            class analysis is acute, and narrowly focused on defining the 
            characters. Juan's eagerness to find a big, fast job is motivated by 
            his poor father's situation (he's in prison for scamming, and needs 
            money, and his good son wants to put what his father has taught him 
            to good, mostly moral use). And Marcos, well, he's a bit more 
            reckless, at least as you understand him, always looking for the 
            huge, put-you-over job, willing to gamble, but also confident of his 
            own scamming skills. He had money, or his late father did, in an 
            estate that Marcos squandered and also essentially stole from his 
            two siblings, angry Valeria (Leticia Brédice) and undauntedly doting 
            Federico (Tomás Fonzi). </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">These 
            complicated and emotionally volatile family ties are only one angle 
            that the film works well. The central scam that occupies Marcos and 
            Juan involves a sheet of rare stamps, the &quot;Nine Queens.&quot; Or rather, 
            it's a sheet of faux-stamps, but, as you hear it, very good quality 
            art. They locate a buyer, Gandolfo (Ignasi Abadal), who's about to 
            leave town quick because he's been busted for his own expansively 
            shady deals. They have only a matter of hours to set up the deal and 
            deliver. The scam seems simple enough, but inevitably, problems crop 
            up. Also inevitably, most of these problems have to do with doubt 
            and betrayal: as much as the conmen must depend on and trust one 
            another to get their work done, they must also assume, given their 
            career choice, that no one can be trusted. Thus, their evolving 
            dilemma. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">For starters, 
            Gandolfo happens to be staying at the very swank hotel where Valeria 
            works. Ostensibly, this is a good thing -- they have access to and 
            knowledge of the hotel's backdoors. But then Marcos must admit the 
            bad blood between him and his sister, and suddenly, there's a little 
            edge of trouble. Or again, they bring in the forged stamps for a 
            rush job of an inspection, a careful balance of trust and distrust 
            that becomes more complicated than it needs to be. Or again, a point 
            comes up when the smarmy Gandolfo sets up a ridiculous deal-breaker 
            that has to do with use of Valeria. Needless to say, this becomes a 
            very dicey transaction for everyone.&nbsp;</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The conman 
            movie formula -- at least as it's been honed by makers like David 
            Mamet or even George Roy Hill (<i>The Sting</i>) -- brings with it 
            certain expectations. You expect characters to be intelligent and 
            ruthless, to betray one another, and act out or on some masculine 
            ideals. You might also expect that the stakes have some metaphorical 
            resonance, as it is unlikely that you have a precise sense of what 
            it means to win and/or lose millions of dollars in a card game, real 
            estate ruse, or sexual subterfuge. And you surely expect that the 
            plot of a conman movie will begin a few steps ahead of you and 
            maintain that distance, more or less, throughout. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Bielinsky's 
            movie does this much, but it also does something more interesting, 
            which is to explore the relationship between truth and trust, as 
            this develops and breaks down in a subtle and specific case, between 
            Juan and Marcos. That they have and lose other relationships also 
            dependent on these poles for definition only makes their own teaming 
            up more fascinating -- they're a moral and emotional car wreck 
            waiting to happen. Their gamesmanship is clever and involving, but 
            less so than their shifting psychic balance, as Juan judges Marcos, 
            or Marcos is impressed by Juan, or either is moved to protect the 
            other (or himself) in the various &quot;pinches&quot; that come up. </font>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Such shifts 
            have as much to do with the environments Juan and Marcos inhabit as 
            they do with actual plot turns (as some of these turns are, 
            unavoidably in this context, false). And so you read characters as 
            they appear in each moment, unable to put together a completely 
            coherent narrative of who is whom, or better, who will be whom a few 
            scenes down the road. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Director of 
            photography Marcelo Camorino brings a fluid yet simultaneously 
            rough-and-ready sensibility to this shrewdly winding narrative. At 
            one point, Juan and Marcos converse while Marcos sits inside a café 
            whose waiter they're scamming, and Juan sits outside, on a bench -- 
            the windowsill marks the distinction between inside and out, but the 
            window allows free movement of noise, air, rhythm. A street 
            sensibility always makes its way inside, somehow. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">When Juan and 
            Marcos are on the street, they look at ease and part of the crowd; 
            the handheld and long-shot camerawork allows you to feel intimacy 
            but also distance. But when they're inside, standing among the glass 
            and high-tech décor of the hotel, the con men are slightly less 
            comfortable, surrounded by scammers in suits. In this space, you're 
            tempted to think back to that early scene, when Marcos points out 
            the crooks on the street, supposedly working invisibly. You might 
            even think that thieving is unlimited to urban &quot;deviants,&quot; obvious 
            or not. At its most successful, thieving takes place far from the 
            street. </font></span>
