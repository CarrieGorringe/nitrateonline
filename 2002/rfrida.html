            <font face="Verdana" size="5">A woman with cajones </font></p>
            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Julie Taymor's <i>Frida</i> 
            pulses with color. Bright oranges, limey greens, deep blues, and 
            crisp yellows: most of these hues are borrowed from Frida Kahlo's 
            paintings, all approximate the dynamic fervor of her brief, 
            tumultuous life. Most of her work depicted her experience, the ways 
            she appeared to herself, the ways she felt. Always, they burned with 
            color. </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At its best, Taymor's movie pulls 
            enormous imaginative energy from Frida's chronic 
            self-representations. When Frida (played by Salma Hayek, who spent 
            some 8 years pulling this project together) marries Mexican muralist 
            Diego Rivera (Alfred Molina), their wedding portrait literally comes 
            alive, their forms seeming to melt from their flat, stiff poses, 
            their shoulders giving way as they join in a party of celebrants 
            forming around them. Or, the process reverses, and life becomes a 
            painting, as when Frida miscarries and, unable to talk with her 
            husband, whose own grief isolates him, paints herself, prone, 
            broken, and exposed, the fetus floating above her, bloody and raw.
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This inventive melding of art and 
            biography grants <i>Frida</i> -- written by Clancy Sigal, Diane 
            Lake, Gregory Nava, and Anna Thomas, and based on a biography by 
            Hayden Herrera -- a peculiar and pleasing elegance. Certainly, these 
            slips between art and life, captured as art, reflect the reasons for 
            making the movie to begin with: Frida understood herself more 
            profoundly than most people can, perhaps because she spent so much 
            time with herself, alone, in bed. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's well known that Frida Kahlo 
            suffered mightily and throughout her life, emotionally, spiritually, 
            and physically. This pain became the primary source of her art (her 
            many self-portraits are her most famous legacy) as well as a 
            dreadful, inevitable focus. The film opens on Frida flat on her 
            back, in the bed that will become her death bier (she was cremated, 
            per her wishes: &quot;Burn this Judas of a body,&quot; she tells Diego), as 
            she goes to her one and only Mexican exhibition, in 1953. As the 
            truck carrying her pitches about on the rocky road, Frida winces, 
            then looks up. Lips majestically red, necklace gleaming, Frida looks 
            up at the mirror above her, fastened to the bed's wooden canopy: 
            seeing herself, she draws unspeakable strength, and the film takes 
            you back in time. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's a familiar device, surely 
            (though seeing Salma Hayek running through a hallway in a 
            schoolgirl's uniform is vaguely startling), and it sends the film 
            into common territory: this is what happened to Frida, this is how 
            she lived with her parents, this is what her house looked like. The 
            film's first part shows that she was a rebellious, willful, sensual 
            child, having sex with her boyfriend in the closet, joining in a 
            family photo dressed in a man's suit, harassing the famous Diego 
            Rivera while he's at her school to paint a mural. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">From here, the film introduces the 
            first of the &quot;two big accidents&quot; that afflict Frida, the 1925 
            trolley wreck that breaks her back and leaves her in a body cast for 
            years, and leads to some 35 surgical operations. (In fact, Frida's 
            pain began much earlier, with polio at age 6, but the film leaves 
            this out). The crash occurs as if it's a ghastly dream: the trolley 
            skids, she sees the wall coming at her, she appears crumpled, from 
            an overhead shot, her body covered in the gold leaf she's just seen 
            in a craftsman's hand, an instant before the disaster. The film cuts 
            to a gorgeously grotesque animated sequence, menacing, rattling 
            dance-of-death skeletons who transform into her doctors, as they 
            start listing her broken bones and offer a grim prognosis. </font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Throughout Frida's recovery, her 
            photographer father (Roger Rees) dotes on her, while her mother 
            (Patricia Reyes Spindola) frets that her chance for &quot;proper&quot; 
            marriage is gone. This standard parental divide more or less sets up 
            Frida's lifelong dedication to crossing gender expectations. She 
            won't stay home and cook, instead throwing herself into her painting 
            and politics (she and Diego are dedicated Communists) with bracing 
            enthusiasm. When her comrade Diego asks her to marry him (admiring 
            that she is &quot;a woman with cajones&quot;), she articulates the principles 
            most important to her, and so, the film's thematic focus: if Diego, 
            21 years her senior and a notorious philanderer with two failed 
            marriages behind him, cannot promise fidelity, he must be loyal. He 
            agrees, they wed, and of course, he fails her. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The movie's liberties in depicting 
            the various calamities that befall Frida are alternately inspired 
            and silly. Inspired when she looks out a window and sees her dress 
            on a clothesline, an image, paused here, that becomes a famous 
            painting. Inspired when Frida and Diego arrive in New York, the 
            moment depicted as a series of mobile 3D postcard images. (This is 
            the trip when he paints the infamous &quot;Lenin&quot; mural for John D. 
            Rockefeller [Edward Norton] an episode more coherently rendered in 
            Tim Robbins' &lt;i&gt;The Hand That Rocks the Cradle&lt;/i&gt;.) Inspired when, 
            while passing her time at a movie house, Frida imagines her husband 
            as King Kong. Diego goes on to engage in revolving door sexual 
            liaisons (depicted literally), and she has her own tryst with one of 
            his conquests (forgettable Saffron Burrows).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But the movie turns silly when 
            Frida initially wins Diego's heart by out-drinking him and muralist 
            David Alfaro Siqueiros (Antonio Banderas, on screen for about two 
            minutes), then dancing a sexy tango with photographer Tina Modetti 
            (an unconvincing Ashley Judd). The scene is crazy-fake and obvious: 
            Diego gazes on the women dancing, then kissing, with a look that's 
            part admiration and part lust. Too bad Frida doesn't catch this look 
            before she agrees to marry her &quot;toad.&quot; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Most accounts have Frida Kahlo 
            &quot;holding her own&quot; against Diego's womanizing by bedding as many 
            people as she could herself. As &quot;liberated&quot; as the stories may 
            sound, the film also suggests that there's a cost for Frida in 
            adopting such tactics. The most irredeemable meltdown in their 
            relationship comes when Frida discovers Diego's affair with her own 
            sister Christina (Mía Maestro), at which point the film's trajectory 
            changes. She kicks out Diego and Christina (and Christina's kids, 
            here serving as props more than anything else). She drinks with 
            Diego's previous ex-wife, Lupe Marin (Valeria Golino) and, when they 
            finish ticking off his many failings, decide that she should try to 
            sell her own paintings, in order to be free of him forever. The film 
            doesn't really follow through on that, and you're left wondering how 
            she lived. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Cut to another encounter with Diego 
            (the film actually loses energy when he's off screen): he visits her 
            at her mother's grave (of all places) to ask her help in looking 
            after/entertaining Leon Trotsky (Geoffrey Rush), seeking sanctuary 
            in Mexico. Frida and Trotsky connect, intellectually, and so they 
            promptly jump into bed. Within a scene, Frida's changed her mind, 
            guilt-ridden on a rainy day no less, when she overhears Trotsky's 
            wife bemoaning his disloyalty. It's probably a good lesson, if it's 
            yours, but here it's heavy-handed. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Seeking respite from Mexico and all 
            she knows there, Frida goes to Paris, where she enjoys nightclubs, 
            cafés, and the attentions of Josephine Baker -- don't blink or 
            you'll miss it, a one-scene only rendezvous, so sensationally filmed 
            and so under-motivated that you may wonder what it has to do with 
            anything, aside from demonstrating that &quot;this happened.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At other times, splendid times, &lt;i&gt;Frida&lt;/i&gt; 
            is more expansive, less interested in including figures or events 
            than in complicating and contextualizing specific (usually renowned) 
            events. Frida's barroom encounter with &quot;Death&quot; is unforgettable: 
            singer Chavela Vargas's riveting performance laments the ways that 
            life becomes tortuous and also exemplifies the very point this film 
            is making. Pain is life. Even for a woman with cajones.</font></td>
