            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Movies that begin with someone 
            moving in to a new house always end badly. What happens in between 
            can range from harrowing to tedious, from the dreadful ghosts in <i>
            The Haunting</i>, <i>The Shining</i>, or <i>The Amityville Horror</i> 
            to the corny Vietnam war flashbacks afflicting poor William Katt in 
            the too cleverly named <i>House</i>. No doubt: in the movies, a new 
            abode bodes ill.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Panic Room</i> opens with just 
            one of these ominous scenes. Taut-faced, carefully-appointed Meg 
            (Jodie Foster) is touring a cavernous, multi-floored mansion on New 
            York's Upper West Side, accompanied by her pouty, scooter-riding 
            eleven-year-old daughter Sarah (Kristen Stewart). The place is 
            filled with menacing shadows and echoey hardwood floors; by far its 
            most threatening aspect is its &quot;panic room,&quot; with a thick steel door 
            that slams shut with an alarming thwack, a bank of surveillance 
            monitors -- all shooting from sharp, high angles, of course -- and 
            cases filled with bottled water and fireproof blankets. Apparently, 
            the previous owner, now deceased, was worried about &quot;home 
            invasions.&quot; But, damn, this is grim.&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At this point, it's hard not to 
            remember Eddie Murphy's dead-on parody of <i>Amityville</i>: when 
            white folks enter a house and hear a scarily echoing voice telling 
            them to &quot;Get out!&quot; they stay anyway, worried about property rights 
            or moral high ground or some sh*t. Yet, Murphy observes, when black 
            folks hear that same big bad voice, they say, &quot;Okay,&quot; and get out 
            the door, real quick. It's the difference between a sense of 
            privilege and sense of practicable survival. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Panic Room</i> is all about that 
            sense of privilege, but not in any way that challenges or messes 
            with it. Instead, the film presumes the privilege in order to allow 
            the setting -- which is, as the title suggests, its most critical 
            component. Or, to borrow from Eddie Murphy: &lt;I&gt;Panic Room&lt;/I&gt; is a 
            conspicuously white folks' movie. To be fair, it's working within a 
            generic framework. As Meg and child are considering this mightily 
            creepy joint, neither seems a bit unnerved, but really, they needn't 
            be -- they are characters built on the expectations of money and 
            whiteness. Meg mentions that the place might be, well, expensive, 
            but, as her real estate agent (Ann Magnuson) snipes, she &quot;can afford 
            it.&quot; This is because Meg is getting the house as payback from her 
            cheating dog of an ex-husband, &quot;pharmaceuticals&quot; millionaire Stephen 
            (Patrick Bauchau), who has recently dumped her for a younger woman. 
            Meg is mad enough that she decides to take the house, even though 
            she thinks that panic room a tad sinister. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jump to the first night in the 
            house, complete with thunder and rain. Meg tucks Sarah in, checking 
            that her bedside refrigerator is stocked with water and juice 
            bottles, then soaks in a claw-footed tub (a must-have accessory for 
            all gothic-inclined mansions), downing glasses of red wine and 
            looking pained and strained as all get-out. The thunder rumbles.
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Oy. With such a generic point of 
            entry, you might be imagining the worst for <i>Panic Room</i>. At 
            the same time, you might also be hopeful, given that it's directed 
            by David Fincher, who concocted two of the more inventive genre-f*cking 
            movies in recent memory, the edgy deconstruction of serial killer 
            flicks, <i>Seven</i> (1997), and the grimly self-righteous (and 
            often exhilarating) assault on buddy films, <i>Fight Club</i> 
            (1999). Shoot, even <i>The Game</i> had its anti-generic moments, 
            most involving Sean Penn's sorties against anything resembling 
            narrative coherence (though exactly what genre is at stake here is a 
            little unclear). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But with <i>Panic Room</i>, 
            scripted by David Koepp, Fincher has his work cut out for him (so to 
            speak). As per any &quot;don't go in the house&quot;-style thriller, the girls 
            will be assailed by a crew of boys, in this case, a trio of home 
            invaders -- security systems expert Burnham (Forest Whitaker), 
            twitty mastermind Junior (Jared Leto), and ski-masked muscle who 
            calls himself &quot;Raoul&quot; (Dwight Yoakam). So they have a reason to be 
            in the house, they want millions of dollars that are hidden in the 
            titular room. They bust in, Meg hears them, and soon as you can say, 
            &quot;Get out!&quot; Meg and Sarah are locked inside the room and the three 
            guys are locked out -- which means that they'll be spending the next 
            ninety minutes trying to hammer, drill, gas, and unscrew their way 
            in. For a little while, mother and daughter listen to these sounds 
            and watch the monitors in horror (no working phone inside the room, 
            of course). Tensions mount when you discover that Meg is 
            (momentarily) claustrophobic and that Sarah is diabetic and drat! 
            she left her kit back in her bedroom. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">You can't help but know what's 
            going to happen here. The boys surprise each other but no one else: 
            Raoul is a short-tempered thug, Junior a mealy-mouthed scum (Leto's 
            uninspired &quot;accent&quot; is key to this characterization), and Burnham a 
            generally nice guy with a family to support (apparently, designing 
            security systems doesn't pay so well, and besides, someone has to do 
            the right thing, eventually). The girls are equally predictable: 
            initially mopey and stiff, Meg turns out to be an agile action hero, 
            most excellent at the dramatic slow-motion dash, and handier with a 
            sledgehammer than she could have imagined. Even Sarah, still looking 
            haggard, with eyes dark-circled, following her lack-of-injection 
            ordeal, gets audience-rousingly scrappy with a few leftover needles. 
            And oh yes, a couple of cops who come by are irksomely slow on the 
            uptake -- exactly as you know they will be. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In lieu of plot or character, then,
            <i>Panic Room</i> offers the house. It's a good house, even a 
            spectacular house. As assembled on screen by director David Fincher 
            and his cinematographers (first Darius Khondji, with whom the 
            director reached what <i>Premiere</i> magazine calls &quot;a stalemate 
            over the film's visual direction,&quot; and second, Conrad Hall), along 
            with production designer Arthur Max, the house is simultaneously 
            serene and weird, a nightmare waiting to happen. It's all fractured 
            spaces and graceful tracking shots that take you through walls and 
            floors; at one point the camera takes you through the kitchen, up 
            and over counters, through portals, and through a freaking pot 
            handle, an acrobatic maneuver that is consummately cool. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Even aside from the breakaway 
            architecture, the house around the panic room has a striking visual 
            design, composed of long dark hallways and stairways that pile on 
            top of one another, it's punctuated by grim shadows, doorways that 
            loom in low-angle shots, windows that look out on the rainy street, 
            and all those menacing video cameras in every-which corner. Since 
            Meg and Sarah have only just moved in, there's precious little 
            domestic detail, save for a bike and a pizza box in the kitchen, and 
            a soccer ball conveniently located so that it might be kicked loudly 
            down the stairs at a crucial moment. Altogether ooky. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And yet... as beautiful and well 
            used as all this space is, midway through the film, it starts to 
            feel less foreboding than vacant, an occasion for Great Visuals, 
            rather than a location where characters live and where anything 
            might happen, or at least anything that you might remember two days 
            later (this is quite unlike <i>Seven</i>, for example, which events 
            resonated in a certain corner of the cultural imaginary for years, 
            as in, &quot;What's in the box?&quot;). <i>Panic Room</i>'s visual 
            organization is surely precise -- you always know where the 
            characters are in relation to the house and each other -- but it 
            overwhelms a more crucial anxiety and dread. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Worse, the film comes round to a 
            very conventional moral neatness that's unusual in a Fincher film. 
            While it surely raises significant questions about the relations 
            between security and money, in a world where such relations have 
            turned suddenly, very visibly tenuous (and granted, the film was 
            made before 9-11), it never pushes hard at the assumption of 
            privilege that grounds these relations. This assumption is built 
            into <i>Panic Room</i>'s fundamental premise, the primary function 
            of the house: the rich white folks have to come out on top.</font>
