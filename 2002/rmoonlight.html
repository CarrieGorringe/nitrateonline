            review by <a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>, 27 September 2002</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Positioning itself as one of the
            fall season's early dramatic contenders for a sliver of Oscar buzz,
            veteran TV director Brad Silberling's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Moonlight
            Mile</i> is thankfully light-years ahead of his previous theatrical
            efforts (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Casper</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">City of Angels</i>). Yes, perhaps not as commercial a property as his
            two earlier features (which grossed a combined $500-million
            worldwide), here is obviously a more intimate, personal effort, the
            kind that voting members of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and
            Sciences admire so much. This emotionally sad yet heartwarming story
            of a would-have-been son-in-law reluctantly catering to the bereaved
            needs of his murdered fiancée's parents is squarely rooted in the
            1989 death of Rebecca Schaeffer, a television star (<i>My Sister Sam</i>)
            who was engaged to Silberling. As writer, director, and co-producer
            (with Mark Johnson), Silberling has prescribed a self-cathartic
            cinematic tale that both spiritually allows him to deal with a
            tremendous personal tragedy while also sharing a powerfully written
            dramatic narrative, filled with tenderness and comic flourishes,
            with his audience.</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film is also a well-deserved
            step forward in the blossoming career of actor Jake Gyllenhaal (yes,
            that's his sister Maggie in the recently released <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Secretary</i>),
            whose puppy-dog face and subdued performances have won him legions
            of fans who have admired his inspired, subtle contributions to such
            films as<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal"> October Sky</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Donnie Darko</i>,
            and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Good Girl</i>. He
            would have made a fine Spiderman if Tobey Maguire had refused that
            role. Working in the shadow of Academy Award-winners Dustin Hoffman
            and Susan Sarandon, Gyllenhaal more than holds his own against the
            senior talent, well justified in earning him a top-billed
            credit—even if some of the higher-octane stars end up bringing in
            their own fans. Hoffman and Sarandon, as actors and producers (he
            through his Punch Productions, she as a co-credited executive
            producer) have graciously allowed Gyllenhaal to shine. He
            substantially grows his career with a humdinger of a role, as Joe
            Nast, in a performance awakened as the film begins in the bed of his
            once bride-to-be, now dead and recently buried, and sustained
            through to the final edema-induced cure.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Set in New England in the early
            1970s, when songs were ten cents a pop on the local hangout jukebox
            and young men were confused enough about serving, or not, in Uncle
            Sam's ill-fated effort in Vietnam, Joe skulks through his listless
            life and the depressed hallways of the passion-filled home of
            ex-hippies JoJo and Ben Floss. The rhythm and love that was their
            lives have been irrevocably shattered by the death of their daughter
            Diana at a local diner, a bystander casualty of another distraught
            couples' jealous demons. Joe becomes his non-in-laws' therapeutic
            tonic, an adoptive figure forged as a replacement for their shared
            loss. It's obvious enough that Joe is just a bludgeon for the
            emotional punishment the family is trying to deal with, yet he
            grudgingly digs himself in deeper with each passing week, too limp
            to speak out. His situation threatens to transform Joe into a
            figurative living grave-marker when Ben instinctively enjoins his
            &quot;son&quot; to become a partner in his commercial real-estate
            business. Decades ago Dustin Hoffman played a character
            (coincidentally named Ben) endeared to a possible life-numbing
            career in plastics in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Graduate</i>; I suspect it is not as clearly unintentional that
            Hoffman's then career-blooming role is so flatteringly rewritten
            here.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As much as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Moonlight
            Mile</i> serves up a heaping tablespoon of filial misfortune and how
            three people come to grips with it, there is also a distinct
            co-relation to how America and the world are dealing with the
            year-old grief of September 11—that we must clear away the acres
            of debris, rebuild (yet not forget), and move forward. Life will and
            must go on. New people will enter our lives, as in Joe's case does
            the spunky, refreshingly honest Bertie Knox (a terrific first major
            feature spin from Boston native Ellen Pompeo), a local
            tomboy/postmistress/barkeep suffering her own Vietnam-induced
            conflicts.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Serving as an accelerant for the
            family angst is the town's fierce local district attorney Mona Camp
            (Holly Hunter), whose forceful prosecution of the Floss' daughter's
            case provides a crucial turning point in Joe's ability to deal with
            Diana's death and its guilt-laden aftermath.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The score by Mark Isham adds its
            own perfect period flavor, and the film's soundtrack is an
            outstanding collection of touching musical moments from the '70s,
            including the eponymous Rolling Stones tune.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What makes <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Moonlight
            Mile</i> such a tear-filled joy is how quickly and easily the
            director-writer has squeezed every single viewer into Diana/Joe's
            empathic room in the Floss household, stuffed with photographs and
            horse show ribbons. Silberling's diagnosis and cure is reminiscent
            of those recommended by an old-time family doctor, molded by his
            small-town, Capra-esque comic charm, whose house calls to his ailing
            patients were grave enough to recommend a serious dose of
            somberness, yet always quaintly cheerful enough to lighten up the
            face of a distraught child. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Moonlight
            Mile</i> is that well-prescribed cherry lollipop.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"></o:p>
