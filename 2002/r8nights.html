            Sandler’s animated seasonal offering is a curious mix of <i>A
            Christmas Carol </i>with a dose of Farrelly Brother’s gross-out
            humor, topped of with a few musical numbers and some sending up of
            Yiddish traditions. Yep, it’s really one of the most bizarre films
            this season, if not this year. and, in any case, probably the only
            place you’re likely to see incontinent cartoon reindeer, if
            that’s your cup of tea.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Davey
            is 33 years old, Jewish and one of the most embittered members of
            his community. Generally resentful of anyone having a good time,
            Davey’s antics reach their nadir during the holiday season when,
            on a drunken rampage, he lands himself in court and very nearly in
            jail. But, this being the festive season and all, Davey is given one
            last chance to dodge the slammer by agreeing to community service
            with the local basketball coach Whitey. An unassuming and upstanding
            (if slightly ridiculed) member of the community, Whitey lives
            quietly with his sister Eleanor until the ungrateful so-and-so Davey
            decides to make his life hell, despite the fact he has moved in with
            them after his trailer is burnt down.<o:p>
            </o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Whitey
            and Eleanor become the butt of Davey’s practical jokes (like the
            time Davey rolls Whitey down a hill in a portapotty, and Whitey
            emerges covered in other people’s feces) but out of good will or
            sheer stupidity still allow him to live with them. But as Davey
            slowly wears down their kindness, he also comes to realize the error
            of his ways, with a little help from his old high-school sweetheart
            Jennifer who can’t believe the sweet-natures boy she dated has
            turned out to be so obnoxious. And after some cod-psychoanalysis
            (it’s all about his childhood, you see) Davey make a final attempt
            to reform himself and get into the Hanukah spirit.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s
            really hard to see who <i>8 Crazy Nights</i> is aimed at; it’s far
            too obscene for kids and there’s far too many poo jokes for adults
            to find it bearable, let alone funny. Admittedly there are a few
            genuine laughs to be had here, but every time Sandler builds up the
            sweetness or sarcasm, he knocks it down with a poo joke. And most of
            the time we’re not even reaching a <i>South Park</i> level of
            humor here but rather a paler than pale imitation most of the time
            that just leaves you slack-jawed in amazement that this ever got
            made, but we’ll get to that later. Based around the eights nights
            of Hanukah, <i>8 Crazy Nights</i> manages to skirt around Jewish
            themes and just rehash two standard Christmas tales --<i>A Christmas
            Carol</i> and <i>It’s a Wonderful Life</i> -- so as not to be
            off-putting to Christmas audiences. It’s a weakness that Davey
            himself would be first to point out, probably throwing in a few
            expletives on the way, and it’s sappiness is incongruous to the
            kind of off-beat drama and sarcastic humor the film is trying to
            create.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sandler
            has a lot of vocal talent as an actor but his physical humor is
            obviously lost with the move to animation, despite the resemblance
            between him and Davey. The animation is very unfussy, more
            traditional that flashy or revolutionary CGI. The style of animation
            is also a strange mixture; while Davey is virtually an animated
            version of Sandler himself, Whitey and Eleanor’s elfin features
            would be more at home in <i>Snow White and the Seven Dwarves</i>.
            There’s also some brazen, but actually quite effective, product
            placement when various company logos (like the Footlocker referee)
            come to life in a mall to inform Davey of his wrongs during one of
            the musical numbers. Now we know where he got the money from</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Which
            brings us on to the making of this film. With Sandler voicing three
            characters, acting as co-producer and co-script-writer it’s not
            hard to see who’s running this ship. One can only wonder what
            director Seth Kearsley actually had to do with the production, apart
            from nodding and smiling at Sandler’s suggestions. And for Sandler
            himself this marks a brave move into new territory but a
            disappointing one after his foray into serious acting recently in
            Paul Thomas Anderson’s <i>Punch-Drunk Love</i>. As much as this
            fun and personal project for Sandler shows that his heart is in the
            right place, it also shows that his should surrender his juvenile
            streak as it’s not going to win him over many fans. Love or hate
            him, Sandler has the kind of ‘star power’ and funding to get
            something like this off the ground, providing his name is part of
            the title. If you’re still reading at this point then it seems you
            really will have to see <i>8 Crazy Nights</i> to believe it. Good
            luck.<o:p>
