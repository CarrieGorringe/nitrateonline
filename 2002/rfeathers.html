            review by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 20 September 2002</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Filmed nearly half a dozen
            times, A.E.W. Mason's <i>The Four Feathers</i> is both timeless and
            dated. First published in 1902, the story was written in a time when
            European colonialism seemed not only a good idea but a divine right.
            Watching Alexander and Zoltan Korda's 1939 adaptation is an
            occasionally uncomfortable experience. Seeing hordes of black men
            being routed by the Brits seems eerily similar to watching the Ku
            Klux Klan riding to the rescue in <i>The Birth of a Nation</i>.
            Still, many of the ideological divides that led to the Victorian era
            conflict depicted in the tale haven't gone away, nor have the
            story's themes of cowardice and redemption. In the right hands, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Four Feathers </i></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"><b>could
            have felt thoroughly modern despite the period costumes.</b><o:p>

            </span></font></p>
            <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Indian
            filmmaker Shekhar Kapur is an intriguing choice for the latest
            version. Born in what would later become Pakistan during the waning
            days of British occupation, Kapur, who has lived in both India and
            the U.K, approaches the material in an understandably less
            jingoistic manner. More importantly, his last movie </font></span><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Elizabeth</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> made the scheming
            behind the Virgin Queen's reign as gripping as a well-made
            contemporary gangster flick. He's not able to repeat his previous
            success with this one, though. Much of </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Four Feathers </i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">feels
            staid, and concessions for today's viewers seem more than a little
            forced.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At
            least Kapur wisely recruited another talented Australian to play his
            protagonist. Last time, it was Cate Blanchett. In </font></span><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Four Feathers</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">, Heath
            Ledger stars as Harry Feversham, a young British Army lieutenant
            with a bright future. His military career is just starting, and his
            engagement to Ethne (Kate Hudson, spouting a less-than-convincing
            British drawl) has made him the envy of many in the junior officer
            corps. With his whole life ahead of him, it's small wonder that
            Harry gets cold feet when his unit is about to be deployed in the
            Sudan.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Leery
            about risking his life for a campaign of questionable necessity,
            Harry resigns his commission. His peers feel more than a little
            betrayed and deliver him an insult: a box of white feathers. The
            plumes are a symbol of cowardice. Gradually regretting his decision,
            Harry decides that merely returning to the Army isn't enough to
            restore his honor. His acts from here on vary from brave to
            suicidal. The tale at this point becomes a feast for the eyes
            (thanks to </font></span><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Snow
            Falling on Cedars</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">
            cinematographer Robert Richardson) and fitful nourishment for the
            heart and head. While the Moroccan locales are gorgeous, Harry's
            bearded, hairy disguise makes him more like a hippie who missed the
            bus to Woodstock than an Arab. At least the 1939 version came up
            with a semi-credible technique for enabling him to blend with the
            populace (he pretended to be mute). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            time around Harry has an African sidekick named Abou Fatma (Djimon

italic">) who bails him out every time his desire to prove his valor starts to
            get unhealthy. Hounsou imbues the role with considerable dignity,
            but many times his sacrifices on Harry's behalf are rather
            contrived. It's almost as if credited screenwriters Michael Schiffer
            (</span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Crimson Tide</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">)</span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">

            Wings of the Dove</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">) felt
            obligated to create a &quot;good&quot; Sudanese character.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">In
            many ways, this adaptation follows in the path of the Kordas'
            version, including the missteps. That version was also handsomely
            photographed (Jack Cardiff who shot </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            African Queen</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:
italic"> and </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Red Shoes</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">
            was one of the cinematographers). Both movies also seemed to lose
            momentum after Harry rescues his best friend Jack (Wes Bentley).
            It's almost as if Harry's later exploits are an afterthought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The romantic triangle subplot in both movies is flat. Waiting
            for it to resolve is less exciting than watching C-SPAN with the
            sound off. Ledger and Bentley have more chemistry with each other
            than either does with Hudson. While she is certainly miscast, the
            material gives her a rather shaky foundation. This is a shame
            because much of the strength of Kapur's </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Elizabeth</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">
            and </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

            unusual strength and dynamic nature of the female leads.<o:p>

            won't have to worry about receiving any feathers for this one. While
            he's often treated as something of a teen idol, he frequently
            demonstrates an eagerness to dive into his characters' weaknesses
            that more seasoned performers sometimes lack. This was certainly
            evident in </font></span><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Monsters
