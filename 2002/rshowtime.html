            surely great pleasure to be taken in watching William Shatner play
            himself. And for about four minutes, <i>Showtime</i> makes the most
            of the opportunity. Shatner plays himself playing an expert adviser
            for the film's titular cop-buddy-reality TV series, which stars two
            &quot;real&quot; L.A. cops, grumpy twenty-eight-year veteran Mitch
            (Robert De Niro) and dilettantish showboat Trey (Eddie Murphy), who
            wants more than anything else to be a movie star. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            Shatner looks on with increasing frustration, Mitch goes up on his
            one line again and again. Meanwhile, Trey takes to heart every one
            of Shatner's pointers on, say, how to slide off a car hood with élan
            and how to arch an eyebrow for maximum <i>TJ-Hooker</i> effect.
            Being such an accomplished self-parodist -- from his <i>Saturday-Night-Live</i>
            minute (&quot;Get a life!&quot;) to his more recent Priceline.com
            ads -- Shatner plays these scenes to maximum Shatner effect,
            remarking of Mitch, in overstated-aside fashion, &quot;I've never
            seen such a terrible actor in my life!&quot; Ha ha ha. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's
            one thing for Bill Shatner to play himself. It's quite another for
            an entire movie to play him. The trouble with <i>Showtime</i> is
            that it never lets up on its self-congratulatory wink-winking. This
            isn't to say De Niro and Murphy can't do nifty and amusing
            self-parody (see <i>Meet the Parents</i> and <i>Bowfinger</i>),
            here, all the jokes are obvious and underwhelming. By the time Trey
            is charging toward the camera for his umpteenth close-up, you're
            really quite ready for the whole thing to be done with. And that's
            only about twenty minutes in.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So,
            okay. Tom (<i>Shanghai Noon</i>) Dey's movie is not about anything
            than what it is: a collision of buddy cops with reality TV, peppered
            with shenanigans. Both genres, so formulaic, overdetermined by clichés
            and stereotypes, are eminently accessible for parody. That the
            parody is also a formula only doubles the fun. And so, you might
            wonder, what's the point? Ahh, but there you would be wrong. There's
            no wondering in formula. That's what makes it formula. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            gears get grinding like so: Mitch begins as a &quot;real&quot; cop,
            undercover to bust a &quot;real&quot; dealer (Mos Def, in a
            depressing part, in fact, exactly the kind of part that his
            character vehemently protested in Spike Lee's <i>Bamboozled</i>).
            (All the character types and concepts here should appear in
            scare-quotes to denote the hilarious irony they mean to represent,
            but wouldn't that be tedious to read?) The bust goes wrong when
            rookie uniform Trey mistakes Mitch for an actual criminal and calls
            for back-up; the TV van is listening in, and when it arrives on the
            scene, chaos erupts (in case you miss the essential premise here,
            the fight with Mos Def results in the shooting up of hundreds of hot
            TVs which he has stored in his &quot;back room&quot;). Mitch shoots
            one guy's shoulder-mounted camera, he's in trouble; the assault is,
            of course, broadcast, TV being the bane of all &quot;real&quot;
            people's existence here. Soon after, he's commanded by his
            desk-bound captain stereotype (Frankie Faison) to participate in
            this reality show, conceived and produced by Chase Renzi (Rene
            Russo, who mostly just looks tired). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">She
            secures Mitch's participation, asserting that he's perfect because
            &quot;women love bad boys.&quot; He, in turn, thinks the series has
            been conceived by &quot;some Hollywood dickhead.&quot; And
            eventually, they -- surprise surprise -- couple up, thus fulfilling
            the primary buddy-movie necessity, that at least one buddy is
            visibly heterosexual. When Chase decides that Mitch needs a partner,
            a &quot;funny minority type,&quot; Trey gets wind of the casting
            call. He arranges with his acting buddy (Kadeem Hardison, and <i>what</i>
            has happened to his career?) to demonstrate his abilities: the buddy
            plays Incompetent Mugger, Trey plays Self-Dazzling Hero, Chase plays
            Thrilled Producer, with Groveling Assistant in Tow. The rest of the
            film is like that, an ongoing car wreck of odious artifice that is,
            apparently, its own point. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            order to ensure that her fakey-fake show is a big reality hit, Chase
            takes it upon herself to rearrange the real cops' lives as much as
            possible (because it's just so funny to see Mitch fume and Trey
            prance about): she redesigns the police station so it looks like <i>Men
            In Black</i>'s HQ, and provides new cars (Humvee and Corvette), so
            the &quot;characters&quot; conform to research on viewers'
            expectations of their buddy cops. Trey conforms enthusiastically, a
            &quot;natural&quot; pop star, coming up with catchphrases
            (&quot;It's... showtime!&quot;), renaming himself (&quot;Ice
            Trey&quot;), and puffing up his chest and looming for the low angle
            camera. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And
            oh, stop me if you've heard this before: when Chase insists that
            each guy spend five minutes a day in front of the
            &quot;confessional&quot; camera &quot;Turn on your heart
            light!&quot;), the movie's comedic montage sequence kicks in: Mitch
            announces, &quot;I wish I was dead,&quot; then proceeds to eat
            bananas, read the paper, shaves, or, most cunningly, stare blankly
            at the camera; Trey spends his confessional time wondering aloud if
            he might do better with the &quot;younger demographic&quot; if he
            were partnered with a &quot;Wesley Snipes type,&quot; rather than
            ancient, crotchety Mitch. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">To
            complete the formula unto parody (even though the formula is rather
            parody by definition), Trey and Mitch are also on a &quot;real&quot;
            case while shooting the series. They're tracking a fiendish Latino
            villain named Vargas (Pedro Damián), complete with bleached blond
            tips and that familiar movie-gangster swagger (and stereotypically
            thick accent, and jeez, the film is so clever, it parodies that
            too). In between hanging out at Club Cuba Loco and murdering his
            employees, Vargas is buying up a load of handheld weapons that can
            shoot through trucks, body armor, and buildings. So, along with your
            parody and your formula, you get your explosions, vehicular and
            structural. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Showtime</span></i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
            makes its colossal lack of originality its oh-so-po-mo point. But
            that's not so clever as it might have sounded to someone, somewhere
            along the line. Written by Keith Sharon, Alfred Gough, and Miles
            Millar, and based on a story by Jorge Saralegui (they would be the
            &quot;too many cooks&quot; of whom you've heard tell), and made for
            the ungodly sum of $90 million, it's a whole lot of too-muchness.
            Especially excessive are those &quot;funny minority types,&quot;
            really just too familiar, as offenses and/or jokes, to be very
            funny.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">&nbsp;

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It
            appears that <i>Showtime</i> wants to be about the insidious
            manufacturing of reality (preferably gritty) and identity
            (preferably masculine) by those horrid media producers. Make that TV
            producers. Movie people, don't you know, have an admirable sense of
            scale and self-consciousness, whereas TV people are flat-out gauche,
            ratings-craving animals. Everyone knows this, has seen it
            represented in movies and, yes, on TV. This isn't to say that the TV
            producers, the villains, and Trey are the only greedy, mindless
            characters in the film. A couple of scenes also take aim at
            consumers: fans of the TV series called <i>Showtime</i> are
            represented as demented, screaming suckers, twice in the shape of
            black women who cannot get enough of their favorite stars; Trey
            dismisses one of these fans with that comic standby, &quot;That
            bitch is crazy!&quot; Disrespecting everyone from its characters and
            its audience, <i>Showtime</i> is mostly a bad time. </font><o:p>
