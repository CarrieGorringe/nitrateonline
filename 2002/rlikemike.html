            <p><font face="Verdana" size="5">Franchise Playing </font></p>
            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;They're playin' basketball, we 
            love that basketball...&quot; Yes they are, and yes we do, all up in <i>
            Like Mike</i>, the much-promoted movie starring Lil' Bow Wow and a 
            few plucky adults. And according to the lyrics of Bow Wow's first 
            single off the soundtrack -- powerpacked with featured artists, 
            Bow's mentor Jermaine Dupri, Fabolous, and Fundisha -- he knows how 
            to play the game: &quot;When I got possession, I'm gonna have to fool wit 
            it, / I might cross you up and fake one way, / Turn around and hit 
            you wit the MJ fade-away.&quot; </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's easy to see why Bow Wow -- 
            ambitious, clever, self-confident -- appealed to the folks who put 
            this film-CD-gear- package together, namely, 20th Century Fox, the 
            NBA, and Columbia Records. He plays an adorable orphan named Calvin 
            (as in Calvin Broadus, the birth name of Bow's other mentor, Snoop) 
            who gets a chance to play for the NBA. It goes without saying that, 
            during this dream-come-true stint, the kid learns important lessons 
            about friendship, sportsmanship, and room service, in between times, 
            sharing the court with The Answer and The Admiral. Think: <i>Space 
            Jam</i> without the cartoon characters, or better, Harry Potter 
            without the damn broomstick, but with cornrows and a wicked jump 
            shot. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It doesn't hurt that young Bow Wow 
            (currently in the process of dropping the Lil' from his name, now 
            that he's fifteen and, as he puts it to the <i>Washington Post</i>, 
            &quot;The Lil' thing is getting played out&quot;) is a talented performer, a 
            hard worker, and a team player to boot. Somehow he manages to look 
            simultaneously cool and cute enough that he attracts fans -- many of 
            them screaming and waving giant foam-rubber doggy-paws -- across 
            race-gender-and-age lines. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Take a look at his frankly 
            incredible music videos for &quot;Puppy Love,&quot; &quot;Ghetto Girls,&quot; and &quot;Thank 
            You.&quot; The kid straddles demographics like nobody's business. His 
            lyrics maintain that he can't get serious with girls, because he's 
            &quot;just too young to get down like that.&quot; But images suggest 
            otherwise. Whether he's spraying his hose at girls washing cars, 
            playing with his puppies, or wrestling with a woman twice his 
            height, he wins smiles-and-nods and &quot;Yo, mans&quot; from everyone in the 
            vicinity, Da Brat and JD, girls jumping rope and guys in fly rides. 
            Aside from his kiddie sex appeal, he makes older girls swoon and 
            impresses boys of all ages. He makes sense on Twix commercials and
            <i>106th &amp; Park</i>, Nick and BET. And now he's making movies too.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">From <i>Like Mike</i>'s very first 
            image -- a close shot of Bow's face that has girlies in the audience 
            squealing -- it's clear the filmmakers know exactly what they're 
            doing. Calvin is a nice kid (he'd never be caught dead making the 
            kind of dance moves Bow makes), living at a rickety inner city Group 
            Home run by one Bittleman (Crispin Glover, looking <i>very</i> 
            scary), who makes the kids sell candy bars at the Staples Center 
            late at night. Calvin spends his off-work hours doing homework for 
            Sister Theresa (Anne Meara) and shooting hoops with fellow lovable 
            waifs Reg (Brenda Song) and Murph (Jonathan Lipnicki, who seems not 
            to have grown an inch since <i>Jerry Maguire</i>, just a little 
            scary). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Refusing to be cowed by 
            circumstance, he dreams of being adopted by the perfect family, 
            taking reruns of <i>Fresh Prince of Bel Air</i> as his model. You 
            know this is fantasy -- and not a very healthy one -- but he thinks 
            he's on his way, every time the pairs of parents trundle in looking 
            for adoptees. He and his pals watch forlornly fro the doorway as 
            younger orphans are selected (&quot;Parents only want the puppies,&quot; sighs 
            one of the unchosen). As if to add insult to injury, the 
            &quot;height-challenged&quot; Calvin must endure daily abuse from the Group 
            Home's very own bully, the ominously named Ox (Jesse Plemons).
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Just so, when Calvin comes on what 
            he takes to be a very special pair of old kicks, with the initials &quot;MJ&quot; 
            magic-markered in the tongues, Ox tosses them over a power wire. 
            Desperate to get his shoes, Calvin crawls out on a tree limb during 
            a storm and gets zapped. Progress Energy Inc. has already stepped up 
            to condemn the act: &quot;The actions depicted in the movie's 
            make-believe scene are extremely dangerous and if replicated would 
            most likely result in severe electrical shock or death&quot; -- kids, 
            don't try this at home!</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Conceived by Michael Elliot (once a 
            rapper himself, as well as <i>Krush</i> magazine publisher, radio 
            host, and <i>The Source</i>'s &quot;Director of Special Projects&quot;), <i>
            Like Mike</i> is more like a lengthy commercial -- for Bow, for 
            Columbia's soundtrack CD, for the NBA, for ESPN -- than a movie. So, 
            Calvin's electrical charge is all good -- his teeth rattle, his 
            sneakers light up, and suddenly, he can make shots he didn't even 
            dream of making before. Long story short: he's hired by the L.A. 
            Knights, whose promotions maniac Frank (Eugene Levy) convinces the 
            infinitely patient Coach Wagner (Robert Forster, who has never 
            looked sadder than he does in this role) to go along with what seems 
            a ratings gimmick, pairing Calvin with the team's currently 
            struggling franchise player, Tracey Reynolds (Morris Chestnut: 
            what's more disheartening, costarring with the scene-stealing Bow or 
            the barely registering Steven Seagal?). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At first, relevant adults assume 
            Calvin's hiring is a joke, until -- oh no! -- they discover the 
            kid's got game. And it takes just one road-series montage to make 
            Calvin and Tracey into the team's much-lauded franchise duo. Poor 
            Tracey is assigned to guide Calvin, which he righteously resents. 
            They room together on the road, which puts a considerable crimp in 
            T-Time's style, especially when it comes to the ladies. The film 
            can't quite make sense of the several events that are supposed to 
            bring Tracey and Calvin together, and so it jumps from one to 
            another: they rap along with DMX in the car, they hang out <i>About 
            A Boy</i>-like at Tracey's mansion, they pass and shoot like 
            gangbusters on the court. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Like Mike</i> negotiates its 
            star's multiple appeals -- for girls and boys, hiphop aficionados 
            and eight-year-old pop fans -- by emphasizing his cute-little-boyness 
            (soon to be over, as Bow's mustache is already starting to show). 
            Just so, the sex-part of these appeals, which, in another 
            circumstance, could turn into Mario Van Peebles as baby Sweetback, 
            is ameliorated, routed through one of Tracey's dates, who thinks 
            Calvin's so &quot;sweet,&quot; she has to hold him to her bosom and comfort 
            him. </font></p>
            <p style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; margin-left: 0in; margin-right: 0in; margin-top: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt">
            Here, Calvin is much like other movie-orphans, and <i>Like Mike</i> 
            conjures the same old-fashioned story that Shirley Temple used to 
            make, 'cept without animal crackers and with beats. And just so you 
            know that the film knows that it's ripping off clichés, when Calvin 
            is auditioning potential adoptive parents (who come out of the 
            woodwork when he's rich and famous), one couple does musical 
            theater, and they treat him to a rousing, if horrific, rendition of 
            &quot;Tomorrow.&quot; </p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At the same time, <i>Like Mike</i> 
            generates a self-consciously up-to-date, PG-13 buddy dynamic. While 
            most of the film delights in its outrageousness (Crispin Glover 
            seems incapable of playing anything but a caricature), the 
            Tracey-Calvin relationship forms a sentimental center. On the road, 
            they're more or less equal roommates, competing for females, good 
            shots, and Coach's approval. At home, they're more like father and 
            son, or maybe better, brothers: Tracey teaches Calvin geometry by 
            painting orange triangles all over his mansion's pretty white walls; 
            and well-meaning Calvin tries to reconcile Tracey with his own 
            estranged dad. (No moms or daughters here: girls only gum up the 
            bonding works.) The very complicatedness of this layered, homosocial, 
            mentor-mentee liaison makes it compelling, if not exactly coherent. 
            You might imagine this is not unlike life, if you're Bow Wow.</font></td>
