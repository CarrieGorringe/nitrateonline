            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 19 April 2001</i> </font>
            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ultimately, <i>The Scorpion King</i> 
            did not turn out to be as agonizing an experience as I feared it 
            would after having a look at the opening sequences, but I still 
            couldn't wait to get outta there when the end credits came up.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is more video-game 
            moviemaking, with constant moving about, whether or not there's any 
            intention or meaning to it, punctuated every two minutes (you can 
            set your watch by it) by someone getting whapped in the chops. This 
            thwacking-whacking style of filmmaking, unencumbered by the 
            impediment of character or story, can get awfully tiresome after a 
            while, especially when it is artless in the extreme.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The movie has World Wrestling 
            Federation star The Rock emerging (or, rather, re-emerging: he was 
            introduced during the very early parts of last year's <i>The Mummy 
            Returns</i>, at which time this feature film was already in the 
            first stages of production) out of the ancient Egyptian desert to 
            take on a no-goodnik who is presiding over no less than the 
            pre-boom-boom city of Gomorrah. The Rock looks very fit and not 
            ominously muscled, so that, at one point, he shoots somebody with an 
            arrow that he has just pulled out of his own back (a feat that some 
            of us, who have just been subjected to back surgery and tests such 
            as disc-o-graphs, would find hard to duplicate at home). The movie 
            is fitted out with such standard accessories as a snide villain with 
            a British accent (Steven Brand, who looks like a dyspeptic Russell 
            Crowe), a chirping comic sidekick (Grant Heslov) who dispenses such 
            anachronistic laugh-getters as, &quot;They got the city sealed up tighter 
            than a crab's buttocks!&quot; (give us a break, dear), a kooky scientist 
            (Bernard Hill), a plucky tagalong boy, and a female interest (Kelly 
            Hu) who, while she's pleasing to the eye, looks like she just came 
            out of the end of an airbrush (well, that's the way she's presented, 
            here).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Michael Clarke Duncan turns out to 
            be the best thing in the picture, although I would like to see him 
            doing something other than jabbing and hacking at people with 
            various spheres and swords. The Rock is more personable in his debut 
            leading role, here, than Arnold Schwarzenegger was in <i>Conan the 
            Barbarian</i> (the comparison is inevitable) -- he's presented as an 
            icon, but what's supposed to make him iconoclastic is not, I'm 
            afraid, anything in the picture itself, but what he brings with him 
            from his W.W.F. appearances. Many of his key scenes in the film are 
            underscored by electric guitar stings and wails, just like in a 
            W.W.F. televised bout. The movie treats him as nothing more than an 
            action toy -- you set him in motion, and he clobbers everything in 
            sight. While he's expressed interest, off-screen, in genuinely 
            trying to do a good job in the acting profession, it remains to be 
            seen another day as to whether he'll turn into a star, an actor, or 
            whatever.</font></td>
