            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>When a spotless, silver Mercedes
            Benz and an aging wreckmobile collide in the A.M. rush hour on New
            York City's F.D.R. drive, a stormy battle of a high-powered have and
            humble have-not begins in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Changing
            Lanes</i>, an engrossing, action-packed vehicle that runs out of gas
            as it nears its preachy finish line. Some unbelievable character
            mood swings over the course of this car-crossed tale of two men
            whose lives are thrown asunder by that fateful sideswipe. Like the
            old 'Fifties television show, it's one of those eight million
            stories that embrace the Naked City on any give day. The
            domino-effect, day-in-the-life approach will follow powerful
            attorney Gavin Banek (Ben Affleck) and insurance drone Doyle Gipson
            (Samuel L. Gipson) as they are caught up in tardy court appointments
            -- representing less-than-honest partners in a multi-million dollar
            estate dispute or trying to bandage a dysfunctional family wound
            that threatens to sever his wife and two young boys to Siberia in
            the Pacific Northwest -- that breeds a nasty outbreak of misguided
            guilt and ugly reprisals before calmer heads prevail.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There is an excessive air of
            desperation in freshman Chap Taylor and Academy Award-winner (for <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Player</i>) Michael Tolkin's screenplay, exacerbated by the parallel
            story style used by British director Roger Michell (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Notting
            Hill</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Persuasion</i>, and
            the small-but-mighty <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Titanic
            Town</i>, a little seen treasure about the Catholic-Protestant
            conflict in Northern Ireland) as the two protagonists stubbornly
            battle wits and an occasional inner demon of social consciousness.
            Salvatore Totino's hand-held, rainy-day cinematography casts a
            steel-grey pall over nearly every scene. The sun (actually it's
            snow) will come out <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">tomorrow</b>,
            the film screams, the day-after sunny soothing of tortured souls par
            for the moral course in writer Tolkin's work, having extended us
            cautionary sermonizing begetting ecstatic triumph in several earlier
            efforts, especially <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Rapture</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Of the stellar on-screen talent,
            the immensely watchable Jackson recaptures that frustrated essence
            that hounded his rock-solid-fish-out-of-water Zeus Carter role in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Die Hard: With a Vengeance</i>. While beleaguered Doyle Gipson may be
            from the same stream (his wardrobe has a rather damp aura to it), he
            comes with the extra baggage of being a recovering alcoholic (with
            William Hurt popping in for a few shots as his A.A. sponsor) that
            has forced his estranged wife (Kim Staunton) to desperate judicial
            measures. Doyle's earnest attempts to paste the fragile fragments of
            his home life together are tossed into disarray when he's late for
            court because of that initial fender-bender. Affleck's spin as the
            callow king of the corporate estate world shows a pull-all-punches
            flamboyance following the loss (and Doyle's gain) of a folder filled
            with extremely important legal documents. These papers become a
            poetic maguffin when Gavin learns from associate
            attorney/extra-marital plaything Michelle (Toni Collette) that the
            partners of his public-policy/municipal law firm, Arnell, Delano and
            Strauss are even more cutthroat than he is. It's all the more of a
            corporate comedown because Mr. Delano (Sydney Pollack) is an oily
            son-of-a-bitch AND his father-in-law, who thinks nothing of prodding
            his agreeable, stunning daughter (Amanda Peet) to slither in the
            legal slime on dad's behalf.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The streets of New York are covered
            in computer corruption and verbal mud-flinging as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Changing
            Lanes</i>' dual leads cross more than a few moral boundaries,
            occasionally stopping by the seed-of-doubt side of the road before
            cranking up, often with clever abandon (especially when Doyle makes
            gleeful display of a lug-nut wrench from a taxi passing Gavin on the
            highway of retribution), their get-back machines. Of course, just as
            it's battle-scarred contestants sink further into its tit-for-tat,
            revenge-filled sewer, the ultimate cop-out occurs when Gavin
            stumbles into a church filed with parishioners observing Good
