            Penn is sort of scowling on the cover of this month's <i>Talk</i>
            magazine (which, as it turns out, is the last <i>Talk</i> magazine,
            dramatically folded as of 18 January). Penn's look is familiar, but
            still, it's not quite so grim as you've seen it in the past. While
            bearing remnants of this &quot;greatest actor of his
            generation's&quot; signature don't-f*ck-with-me look, it also makes
            a certain concession, as if to say, &quot;The fight just doesn't
            seem worth it, and besides, I have better things to do.&quot; <o:p>

            a concession makes sense. He's been working hard for years. He's
            made amazing art, as an actor in such wide-ranging projects as <i>Carlito's
            Way</i>, <i>Dead Man Walking</i>, and <i>The Sweet Lowdown</i> (the
            last scene is one of the most heartbreaking in all movies -- &quot;I
            made a mistake! I made a mistake!&quot;), and as ambitious
            writer-director of <i>The Indian Runner</i>, <i>The Crossing Guard</i>,
            and <i>The Pledge</i>. Plus, he's hung around with famously volatile
            personalities (Madonna, Dennis Hopper, Warren Beatty, Jack
            Nicholson). So now, if he's not precisely &quot;matured&quot; in a
            conventional sense, at least he's assumed another set of priorities.

            crucially, the forty-one-year-old Penn has told interviewers again
            and again, his family with Robin Wright, is his reason for
            breathing. This makes him mellower than he used to be on some points
            (he says he appeared on <i>Friends</i> last year because he and more
            importantly, his daughter, are fans of the show), but also firm in
            his opinions. He no longer needs to take aim at easy targets who
            hardly seem worth the effort -- say, tabloid photographers (whom he
            punched and spit at), his former friend Nicolas Cage (whom he
            accused of abandoning his talent), or his <i>U-Turn</i> director
            Oliver Stone (whom he accused of being an animal). And if he's got
            to spend a few minutes berating Bill O'Reilly publicly, well, maybe
            it's for old time's sake. And more power to him. <o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            <i>Talk</i> cover story, like most recent coverage of Penn, is
            occasioned by a new movie, <i>I Am Sam</i>. Simultaneously a
            surprising and understandable choice for Penn, the film concerns the
            legal and emotional struggles of a mentally retarded man, Sam
            (Penn), to retain custody of his seven-year-old daughter, Lucy
            (Dakota Fanning). As the film opens, a homeless woman with whom Sam
            apparently had a one-night hook-up, goes into labor while Sam rushes
            across town from the Starbucks where he sorts sugar packets and
            cleans tables. Arriving at the hospital breathless and thrilled,
            just after the birth, he holds the infant tenderly, while the mother
            looks on appalled. She wants nothing to do with him or the baby, and
            promptly exits the film. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Sam,
            by contrast, is thoroughly in love with his child, naming her for
            his favorite Beatles song, &quot;Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds&quot;
            (the film's soundtrack is crammed with Beatles covers, which sound
            fake and thin). And until she turns seven (which is, according to
            the film's schematic script, his own mental age), he devotes himself
            to her welfare and everything is more or less fine. When Lucy finds
            herself able to read at a higher level than her dad, in steps
            Children's Services, in the imposing form of Margaret (Loretta
            Devine). Distraught but resourceful, Sam gets a high-powered
            attorney, Rita (Michelle Pfeiffer), who, due to office politics, her
            own chaotic life, and the film's inclination toward <i>Ally McBeal</i>-ish
            overstatement, is implausibly shamed into taking the case pro bono.
            What follows is an increasingly strange plot mix of old-school soap,
            innocuous slapstick comedy (that shot of Sam falling down the stairs
            hat you've seen in the trailer), earnest social problem film, and
            contrived courtroom drama. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">In
            combining these elements, <i>I Am Sam</i> draws directly and
            awkwardly from 1979's <i>Kramer vs. Kramer</i> (Sam and his friends
            helpfully quote from Robert Benton's movie, in case you don't make
            the connection yourself). The film updates the issues and the
            technique: Elliot Davis's handheld camerawork suggests that what's
            going on is urgent rather than cloying, challenging rather than
            predictable. But the shamelessly manipulative script, by
            producer-director Jessie (<i>Corinna, Corrina</i>) Nelson and
            Kristine Johnson, will not let these characters be: they must run
            the gamut of movie-of-the-week emotion... A to B. Rita has the
            toughest row to hoe, as she must be the bright career woman in dire
            need of life and parenting lessons from Sam. She has a young son and
            a marriage that's collapsing, despite her vigorous denials and
            hackneyed sublimation in her work, and while Pfeiffer is sharp
            enough to make even the most dreadful role close to watchable (see,
            for instance, <i>What Lies Beneath</i>), here she is hard up against
            it. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Perhaps
            the most alarming scene has Rita, looking coiffed and polished as
            usual, visiting Sam after he has lost the case (they are appealing,
            of course). Having also lost his job, he's now holed himself up in
            his apartment. She entreats him not to give up, and suddenly, he's
            had it: &quot;People like you don't know! You're perfect. People
            like you don't feel anything!&quot; At which point, Rita collapses,
            appropriately, showing how very much she does feel... something:
            &quot;I'll never be enough!&quot; she wails. Ow ow ow. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">As
            Rita's thematic opposite, Sam's kindly, agoraphobic neighbor, Annie
            (Dianne Weist) fares just as badly. She tries to help him with Lucy
            but, like agoraphobics tend to do, gets all panicky when she
            considers leaving her apartment. The point seems to be that women
            who are either too much &quot;outside&quot;-oriented, or too much
            &quot;inside&quot;-oriented, make inadequate parents. The middle
            ground might have been occupied by Lucy's foster mom, Randy (Laura
            Dern), but whenever she tries to be sensible and loving (her
            supposedly supportive husband mostly stays out of the picture, for
            unknown reasons), she's cut off at the knees by Sam's unexpected
            appearances at the house, now walking dogs -- so adorably caring for
            their runny noses! -- in order to make ends meet. Lucy just loves
            those doggies. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Rita
            and Randy, along with the lawyer who's working to take Lucy away
            (Richard Schiff in an egregiously one-note part) eventually come to
            believe that Sam is the very bestest parent possible, no matter the
            real world logic that eventually, his limitations will have actual
            effects on his child's experience and understanding of her universe.
            Perhaps surprisingly, the fact that this is emphatically <i>not</i>
            a real world movie works out worst for Sam. So what if the other
            characters are stereotypes? You've seen them before and you'll see
            them again. Sam, however, could have been something else. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">There
            is a case to be made for the film's efforts to humanize him (and it
            has been made in a <i>Washington Post</i> editorial, by Special
            Olympics executive officer Tim Shriver, 22 Jan 02). The film
            underlines his generosity, vulnerability, and resilience. And, thank
            goodness, Sam doesn't float off into Forrest Gumpian flights of
            aphoristic wisdom, or turn into a Rain Man's master class in
            full-immersion tic-acting. He even shows signs of being a funny,
            warm, and exciting character, prompting you to imagine why someone
            as exacting and hard on himself as Penn might take the part
            (perhaps, you think as your mind wanders during the film, his kids
            will get a kick out of it). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">But
            too often, Sam's &quot;difference&quot; - the very difference that
            you're encouraged to comprehend and not judge -- is the focus.
            Despite Penn's visible -- often <i>painfully</i> visible -- efforts
            to make him sympathetic, Sam is a definitively limited and
            recognizable movie character. Even as <i>I Am Sam</i> argues that
            his boundless love is enough (&quot;Love is all you need,&quot;
            etc.), it does so with emblems of his conventionally defined
            &quot;limits&quot; -- awkward gait, loud voice, and gestures that
            make &quot;undifferent&quot; people so uncomfortable. When Sam
            tearfully cuddles up to a closed-circuit-TV image of his daughter
            (testifying in court) in order to express how much he loves her,
            it's a Big Movie Moment, crass and corny enough to make you want to
            look away. Not because what he's doing is disturbing, but because
            the movie uses what he's doing so disturbingly.</span></font><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> <o:p>
