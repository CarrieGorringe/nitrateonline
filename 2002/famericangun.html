            Festival</font><p class="MsoNormal"><b>
<font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I was attracted to <i>American Gun</i> because 
it’s <i>about</i> something,&quot; explains James Coburn, the film’s hollow-cheeked, 
73-year old star. &quot;It’s not just fluff.&quot;</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Coburn should know the 
difference. Since his onscreen debut in 1959’s <i>Ride Lonesome</i>, the durable 
presence has conquered westerns, comedy, suspense, children’s films, and drama. 
However, such projects haven’t always been &quot;<i>about</i> something.&quot; Sure, there 
are the resonant masterpieces like <i>Cross of Iron</i>, <i>The Magnificent 
Seven</i>, and <i>Affliction</i> (the 1998 Paul Schrader film for which Coburn 
won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar). Sandwiched in between, however, are frothy 
lumps of empty cinematic calories like <i>Hudson Hawk</i> and <i>Snow Dogs</i> 
on his 85-film resume.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yet, even in the most 
feather-light production, this silver-haired movie veteran with the Cheshire Cat 
grin always <i>adds</i> something. In 1999’s <i>Payback</i>, Coburn injects a 
pulse into the otherwise flatlined film, playing an uncharacteristically 
sensitive mobster. After having his expensive luggage pelted full of holes by 
Mel Gibson’s trigger-happy antihero, Coburn complains, &quot;Hey -- that’s just plain
<i>mean</i>!&quot; It’s a funny bit that adds welcome color to <i>Payback</i>’s dull 
palette of stillborn bleakness.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Just plain mean</i> might 
also describe the role that won Coburn a trip to the Academy Awards podium. As 
Glen Whitehouse, a cantankerous, whiskey-guzzling cuss for which &quot;ornery&quot; is a 
gross understatement, the actor makes a completely and utterly unredeemable 
character interesting to watch. Whitehouse isn’t a dynamic chameleon that pours 
on the charm before sinking his talons in, ala Denzel Washington in <i>Training 
Day</i>. This guy is a predictable drunk quickly pickling himself into dementia 
and dragging those around him into an emotionally abusive quicksand.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">After Whitehouse’s 
long-suffering wife dies, and her children kneel in prayer before the funeral, 
he denounces the groups as a bunch of religious nuts and losers. &quot;Not one person 
in this room is worth even one gray hair on that good woman’s head,&quot; he sneers 
dismissively. Glen may be a boorish lout, but he’s hypnotic and compelling when 
the bushy-browed Coburn embodies the unsympathetic part.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Martin Tillman, the gentle, 
understanding father from <i>American Gun</i>, couldn’t be more of a contrast to 
Whitehouse. However, there’s a connection between the two films, apart from 
Coburn’s appearances in both. <i>Affliction</i> writer/director Paul Schrader 
specializes in stories about men in search of something. His most chilling and 
legendary creation, <i>Taxi Driver</i>’s psychotic cabby Travis Bickle, searches 
for his life’s meaning and finds it only through desperate, delusional acts of 
violence. In Schrader’s <i>Hardcore</i>, the hero is a strict Calvinist father 
crossing the country in search of his porn actress daughter. <i>Bringing Out the 
Dead</i>, <i>Raging Bull</i>, and <i>The Last Temptation of Christ</i>, which 
Schrader wrote for director Martin Scorsese (<i>Taxi Driver</i> was their first 
effort as a writer/director team), cover similar terrain in their depictions of 
lost souls looking for redemption and closure.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I think a lot of a movie’s 
success is in the writing,&quot; confirms Coburn, &quot;and Schrader is a genius when it 
comes to writing characters. He just plugs it in, turns it on, and lets it 
happen. We need more writers like him.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>American Gun</i> was 
written and directed by Alan Jacobs, a relative newcomer with two previous 
movies to his credit (<i>Nina Takes a Lover</i>, <i>Just One Night</i>). 
However, it plays out like a Schrader film. This time around, the hero is 
searching not for his life’s purpose or family, but for the owner of the gun 
that killed his daughter. &quot;I have the gun,&quot; explains Coburn, &quot;and go on a search 
for who made it and whose hands it was in. That’s the premise.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Martin Tillman’s life takes 
as unexpectedly devastating turn after his daughter Penny (Virginia Madsen) 
visits the Vermont homestead that he shares with wife Anne (Barbara Bain). 
Martin is a philosophical man, finding comfort in the notion that everything has 
a reason. This makes it doubly hard for Martin to comprehend the events that 
transpire during this holiday reunion between daughter, father, and mother. On a 
last-minute errand one night during her visit, Penny is shot to death. As Martin 
and Betty are forced to endure this untimely loss, <i>American Gun</i> echoes <i>
In the Bedroom</i> and that celebrated film’s brave examination of parental 
grief.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Struggling to find a meaning 
behind the madness, Martin searches for a target to blame. This merely distances 
his from Betty, who snaps, &quot;Why does it have to be anyone’s fault? It just 
happened.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The heart of <i>American Gun</i> 
is Martin’s road trip across the country to find the .357 magnum’s previous 
owner and come to terms with the shooting. Using its serial number, he tracks 
down a manufacturing plant that produced the weapon. Subsequent stops in 
Florida, New York, Los Angeles, and Las Vegas ultimately lead Martin to the 
truth he so desperately years to attain from the loss of Penny. During this 
journey, he hears varied tales in which the gun played a part, including acts of 
desperate self-defense, and passion-filled jealousy.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Those trying to pull a 
political agenda from <i>American Gun</i> might be disappointed, warns Coburn. 
&quot;The movie’s approach is unique,&quot; he explains, &quot;because it’s not pro or against 
guns, but shows what can happen with guns if you don’t pay attention. It’s about 
knowing how to <i>deal</i> with guns. My character has also been in the army, 
and there are several flashbacks of what happened to him in the war. He’s seen 
guns from different viewpoints.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>American Gun</i> initially 
portrays Martin as a young man fascinated by his grandpa’s service revolver. &quot;It 
was the most beautiful thing I ever saw,&quot; proclaims Martin of the handgun in an 
early voiceover. Later, when he serves his own tour of duty during World War II, 
he bears witness to events that re-shape his relationship with such firearms.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">American’s uneasy, two-sided 
relationship with guns – in which they are both romanticized and denounced – 
seems to be at the heart of the film, a point that director Jacobs confirms in a 
press release quote. &quot;I wanted to show the contrast between the taking up of 
arms in World War II,&quot; he explains, &quot;the last war for which there was unanimous 
national support, and the way guns are present in modern life. I wanted to 
explore the difference between a time when fighting for what is right was more 
black and white than it is now.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>American Gun</i> also 
focuses on how tragedy makes Martin question and reconsider his religious 
convictions. &quot;I still believe there’s a God,&quot; Coburn’s grieving father assures 
himself following Penny’s demise. &quot;I just don’t know what to make of him.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Later in the film, a priest 
struggles to console the bitter mourner. &quot;God never gives us more trouble than 
we can handle,&quot; this Man of the Cloth assures.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Does that mean that if I 
were a weaker man,&quot; snarls Martin, &quot;My daughter would not be dead?&quot; Again, such 
religious overtones echo Schrader and Scorsese, filmmakers who seem fueled to 
tell stories of men tortured by human frailty and begging penance for past sins.
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As if comparison to these 
cinema legends wasn’t praise enough, Jacobs joins the leagues of Quentin 
Tarantino (<i>Pulp Fiction</i>), Atom Egoyan (<i>Exotica</i>), and Rose Troche (<i>The 
Safety of Objects</i>), as a director willing to take chances with the 
chronology of his film. By leaving out a key point in the story until <i>
American Gun</i>’s shocking, unexpected finale, Jacobs forces the viewer to 
re-examine all that has gone before. We make false assumptions about Martin’s 
motives and are pleasantly blindsided by the film’s final revelation. We’re 
reminded that there’s more to current film than the banal, cookie-cutter 
plotting that Hollywood hacks like Michael Bay coast by on.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And in the middle of it all, 
there’s the magnetic presence of James Coburn. Bouncing back from the rheumatoid 
arthritis that taxed him physically in the eighties, this under-rated powerhouse 
rages forth with some of the most memorable acting of his varied, versatile 
career. &quot;Coburn read the script,&quot; confirmed Jacobs during a recent Q &amp; A at this 
year’s Seattle International Film Festival to promote <i>American Gun</i>, &quot;and 
immediately said, ‘I want to do this.’ The sad truth is, there aren’t too many 
roles of real substance out there for people his age to play.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meanwhile, Coburn is quick to 
praise Jacobs. &quot;I think he’d only done a couple a films before this. I think he 
got most of what he wanted with the movie.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">James Coburn knows the 
difference between movies that are &quot;about something,&quot; and movies that are 
&quot;fluff.&quot; <i>American Gun</i>, his latest triumph, proudly rises above the froth 
and into the former category.</font></p>
