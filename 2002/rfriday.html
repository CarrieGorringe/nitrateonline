            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700">
            <font size="2">&quot;I look at myself and the movies I do as a brand,&quot; 
            Ice Cube tells <i>Variety.</i> No doubt, he works hard for the 
            money. And even if it has been a while since folks rushed out to buy 
            the new Ice Cube CD, he's earned righteous respect -- as a member of 
            N.W.A., solo artist (<i>AmeriKKKa's Most Wanted</i>), actor (<i>The 
            Glass Shield</i>, <i>Three Kings</i>), and director (the flawed, 
            ambitious <i>The Player's Club</i>). Besides, it's hard not to like 
            Cube -- on screen, he always plays determined, thoughtful, and 
            sweet: you know, the nigga you love to hate. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">But even Ice 
            Cube's general (and expanding) media savvy doesn't quite explain the 
            crashing popularity of the <i>Friday</i> movies, which appear to 
            have taken on a life of their own. Even if you grant the initial 
            appeal of John Witherspoon's bowel troubles, how to explain the 
            repeated, ongoing, even increasing appeal of same? Apparently, Cube 
            and co-creator D.J. Pooh tapped into some zeigeisty appeal to highly 
            desirable consumers, young, eager to spend their cash on popcorn and 
            nachos and soundtrack CDs. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The first <i>
            Friday</i>'s apparently winning formula has governed the next two 
            films, with most all the elements remaining in place, save for the 
            fortuitous (for him) exit of Chris Tucker; after Smokey, he found a 
            more lucrative partnership with Jackie Chan. And so, Craig (Cube) 
            had to come up with a second second, his cousin Day-Day (Mike Epps). 
            It's good that Cube and Epps like each other's company so much, and 
            want to make movies together, but they do have a certain routine. As 
            Craig observes of his father, Willy (Witherspoon), and uncle Elroy 
            (Don D.C. Curry), they fight so much they might as well &quot;get 
            married.&quot; Mm-hmm. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i>Friday After 
            Next</i> takes place on the Friday before Christmas, and does its 
            best to turn all the goopy stuff of holiday flicks turned inside and 
            &quot;hood-o-rific.&quot; (And we'll just say right off that the &quot;ho, ho, ho&quot; 
            joke is obvious and unfunny.) Craig and Day-Day are sleeping when a 
            raggedy Santa in orange sneakers comes to their apartment and steals 
            their presents, their food, and their rent money (this despite 
            Craig's valiant efforts to beat back the intruder, and Day-Day's 
            snoring through the whole escapade). The cops come by, do nothing, 
            and the morning begins: time to start the new job down at the mall. 
            Craig and Day-Day are rent-a-cops. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Hilarious as 
            this premise might sound, in fact, the day at the mall follows the 
            routine that you've come to expect from these guys. First off, 
            they're desperate to make back the stolen rent money, as the 
            landlady, Miss Pearly (Bebe Drake) is ready to set her 
            fresh-out-of-prison son on them: &quot;If I don't get my rent money 
            today, somebody gonna get they salad tossed tonight!&quot; The son, Damon 
            (Terry Crews as Tiny Lister's stand-in), is large and hard and 
            actually not so interested in Craig and Day-Day; seems that, in 
            prison, he developed a hankering for small, fine-boned men. Lucky 
            for him (or not), Craig and Day-Day befriend just such a fellow, a 
            &quot;half-Prince&quot;-acting pimp called Money Mike (Katt Micah Williams) 
            who owns a clothing store in the mall called &quot;Pimps and Hos 
            Fashions.&quot; He wears a shiny green suit and big old pimp hat, and has 
            a luscious girlfriend Donna (K.D. Aubert).</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Throughout the 
            day, Craig and Day-Day do what they always do: complain about their 
            money situation, run from thugs, call each other names (Day-Day has 
            to ask Craig what &quot;remedial&quot; means). Craig tries to be upright and 
            flirt with the first pretty girl who walks by Money Mike's girl, as 
            it so happens), and Day-Day screws up, again and again. Too 
            enthusiastic about keeping order as a Top Flight Security Guard, he 
            tangles with church ladies singing carols in front of the liquor 
            store: no loitering. If this reminds you of Epps' interactions with 
            tourist ladies in <i>All About the Benjamins</i>, well, that seems 
            to be the point. Epps plays just-behind-the-beat as well as anyone.
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">First time 
            director Marcus Raboy keeps the physical gags moving, with leaps and 
            falls and sprints and nasty sex insinuations every few minutes or 
            so. The slapstick is less choreographed than haphazard. At the 
            barbeque shop owned by Elroy and Willy -- lots of lip-smacking for 
            Willy -- Elroy plays reindeer with a bunch of freaky kids who ride 
            and kick at him; Willy is grumpy Santa; Willy's wife, whose only 
            name is &quot;Mrs. Jones&quot; (Anna Maria Horsford) is the infinitely patient 
            Mrs. Claus; and Elroy's new girlfriend Cookie (Sommore) is a busty, 
            mostly silent elfette. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">All this 
            razzing on Christmas conventions, underlined by the continued 
            thieving by that same Sketchy Santa (Rickey Smiley) who grabs 
            Craig's loot at the beginning, takes on the semblance of a theme 
            (and goodness knows that all that crass business is in need of 
            serious razzing). But the film is really about bodily, base humor -- 
            abuse, humiliation, stupidity. This doesn't make it much different 
            from mainstream (white) popular media of the moment, from films (<i>Jackass</i> 
            and <i>American Pie</i>) to TV(<i>Jackass</i> and <i>Tom Green</i>,
            <i>The Bachelor</i>, <i>Blind Date</i>, <i>Fear Factor</i>), where 
            humiliation passes for entertainment. Everyone's invited. People 
            audition for it. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">True, <i>Friday 
            After Next</i> has a script and timing, and true, the series started 
            in 1995, before most of these other ingenious entries into the 
            field. And, in fact, <i>Friday After Next</i> is one of the milder 
            incarnations of the trend. The question is broad: what's at stake in 
            such buffoonery? Who pays and in what ways? The raging success of 
            the concept -- laughing at ineptitude and cruelty, cartoonish pain 
            and inanity -- is increasingly disconcerting. It's hardly confined a 
            single demographic, consumers or producers. It's pervasive, 
            predictable, and eventually, perhaps, potent.</font></span></td>
