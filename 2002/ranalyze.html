            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 6 December 2002</i></font><p>
            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the interest of fair disclosure, 
            I must state that I walked out of <i>Analyze That</i> at the point 
            where Billy Crystal stuck a handgun in his belt and it slips down 
            inside the front of his trousers, causing him to go ooh, ah, ah, 
            ooh, ah a lot. This is not what I would expect to find in a Billy 
            Crystal picture, and it is not what I would want to see Billy 
            Crystal doing on the screen. However, if you put down your 
            hard-earned money to see this movie, you will probably want to leave 
            at the same point, as well. It really, really is that bad.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is -- for want of a place to 
            start, if we're going to talk about this picture at any length at 
            all -- a sequel to the 1999 comedy, <i>Analyze This</i> (meaning, if 
            there's going to be another sequel, and don't bank the farm on that, 
            it may be called <i>Analyze Those</i>), where Robert De Niro played 
            a mobster who would up under the good graces of a psychiatrist 
            played by Billy Crystal. It should be noted that Kenneth Lonergan, 
            who co-wrote the screenplay for that picture (and wrote the one for
            <i>You Can Count On Me</i>, which he also directed, with rewarding 
            results), is not present, here. The new story has something to do 
            with De Niro's mobster, now incarcerated, having a breakdown in 
            prison, which causes him to start singing all the songs from <i>West 
            Side Story</i>. He is released, imminent to a parole hearing, to the 
            custody of Crystal's psychiatrist, and has to live in his home with 
            his family (including his wife, played, again, by Lisa Kudrow). De 
            Niro tries his hand as a salesman in a car showroom. He gets hired 
            as a consultant for a TV show that, gosh be golly, looks a lot like
            <i>The Sopranos</i>. (One of the show's actors is played, uncredited, 
            by Anthony LaPaglia, in one of the only instances where one can hear 
            him using his native Australian accent.) Then there is an attempt to 
            rob some trucks carrying gold bullion, which doesn't make much 
            sense. Nothing, in fact, makes sense in this film.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Which might not be so bad if the 
            jokes were any good. In one scene, De Niro exposes himself to a 
            bunch of elderly ladies. He also asks for a bacon strip at a Jewish 
            reception. Cathy Moriarty-Gentile, who played the glorious Vickie 
            opposite De Niro's Jake LaMotta in <i>Raging Bull</i> (and who still 
            looks pretty darn good, in my opinion), holds up an electric mixer 
            and asks, &quot;Do you wanna lick my beaters?&quot; There is a scene where 
            Crystal dribbles food out of his mouth, at length, in a restaurant. 
            There is another where he is extensively goosed by a thug, who then 
            tries to shake Crystal's hand with the same hand he'd just used for 
            the goosing. This is as good as it gets.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kudrow and Joe Viterelli, who has a 
            wonderful bowl-of-mashed-potatoes-like face and reprises his role, 
            here, from the 1999 film as De Niro's sidekick, escape from 
            disgracing themselves in the least (But can someone please give Lisa 
            Kudrow a chance to again show what she showed to such marvelous 
            extent in <i>The Opposite of Sex</i>?). Crystal, De Niro, and 
            director Harold Ramis (who once gave us <i>Groundhog Day</i>) have 
            no excuse&nbsp; for why they settled on such awful material. Some people 
            voiced the opinion that Robert De Niro's performances in <i>Analyze 
            This</i> and <i>Meet the Parents</i> were better than the serious 
            work he was doing at the same time, and that maybe he should do more 
            comedy. Well, after his appearances in <i>Showtime</i> and this 
            movie, Robert De Niro's got a lot of explaining to do.</font></p>
