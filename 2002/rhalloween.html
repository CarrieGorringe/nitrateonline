            latest Michael Myers movie went through many &quot;working
            titles&quot; before its release this past Friday. Way back in 1999,
            hard on the heels of 1998's <i>Halloween H20: 20 Years Later</i>,
            this 8th film in the series was called <i>Halloween: Evil Never Dies</i>
            and then, <i>Halloween H2K</i> (this, presumably, was the plan for a
            2000 release date). In 2000, someone thought to combine the two,
            thusly: <i>Halloween H2K: Evil Never Dies</i>. By 2001, the
            &quot;2K&quot; was clearly out, and so, the name mutated again, from
            the rather perfunctory <i>Hall8ween</i> or <i>Halloween 8</i>, to <i>Halloween:
            Homecoming</i> or <i>Halloween: The Homecoming</i>, to <i>Halloween:
            MichaelMyers.com</i>. Now, at last, the title has been fixed and
            perhaps less importantly, the film is in theaters, for a minute
            anyway. And so you have it: <i>Halloween: Resurrection</i>. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">After
            all that time and wrangling: resurrection? Please. Since when is <i>that</i>
            news in a slasher film? Maybe there's something to be said for an
            unadorned, unclever, decidedly uncompelling promotional tactic. And
            what does it matter what it's called, anyway? You know what you're
            getting in this flick, whether you want it or not. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">For
            one thing, you're getting yet another appearance by Michael's
            sister, Laurie Strode (played one more time by indefatigable
            VoiceStream pitchperson, Ms. Jamie Lee Curtis, suddenly looking
            very, very tired indeed). Lucky for her, she only has about five
            minutes to endure, as she's locked up in an asylum following the
            discovery that, when she thought she decapitated her brother, she
            had actually wasted a paramedic, with conveniently crushed vocal
            chords so he couldn't tell her who he was, as well as three kids.
            One nurse tells another this story, to occasion flashbacks to the
            previous film, and catch you up, in case you want to be caught up,
            with where the action begins here. And begin it does -- cue John
            Carpenter's theme music and stalker cam, a few shadowy shots of
            Michael (Brad Loree) in infamously ooky white-face mask, another few
            of the knife in silhouette and glinting in the light, and a few more
            of the surveillance monitors, or more specifically, the monitors in
            rooms where no one is watching. Michael has come to kill Laurie once
            and for all, which he does -- big knife ripping right through her
            and a magnificent slo-mo face-up plummet from a roof to boot. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Her
            final gesture is a splendid one -- she kisses Michael on his
            mask-mouth and growls, &quot;See you in hell!&quot; <i>Tres</i> nice
            exit. So, Laurie better hope against hope that no one comes up with
            a way to implant an alien baby in her so she'll return as Laurie
            eight, or nine or ten, with acid for blood and a hankering for
            basketball. Oh wait, wrong franchise. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Assuming
            that Laurie is, in fact, finally done with the whole Michael Myers
            business, you know that someone else will have to pick up the slack.
            Not just the nubile-young-bodies-ripe-for-slaughter slack, either.
            Someone has to be in charge, bring weight, and make you want Mike to
            get his in the end. And that someone is -- get ready -- Busta
            Rhymes. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Busta's
            already proved he has chops, in the wildly gesticulating department,
            as well as the mesmerizing performance department (check Hype
            Williams' video for &quot;Put Your Hands Where My Eyes Could
            See&quot;) and in subtler drama (see Gus Van Sant's <i>Finding
            Forrester</i>). And he essentially carries this movie -- his every
            appearance on screen produces yelps of delight. When all is said and
            done, Busta does come out of this formula movie smelling fairly
            rose-like. There are reasons. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">First
            off, the man is charisma on wheels, whether selling Mountain Dew or
            dancing with digital elephants. This despite his role as Freddy, a
            nefarious some-kinda-media producer, determined to cash in on the
            whole reality-TV-internet-cam thing. Toward that end, he papers a
            local college, to solicit a pack of <i>Real World</i>-er wannabes to
            spend Halloween night in Michael Myers' childhood home, for a show
            he calls <i>Dangertainment</i>. Catchy. Their adventures will be
            aired live over the net via carefully placed cameras all over the
            house and mini-cameras placed on the kids heads, à la MTV's <i>Fear</i>,
            itself sort of derived/ripped off from 1999's internet-advertising
            phenom, <i>The Blair Witch Project</i>. It's all very skritchy,
            mobile-framey, and zig-zaggy: great when it comes time to confuse
            you about who's where and when the next silhouette of a knife is
            going to be pointed at someone's throat. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Second,
            Busta is a hard worker. He's been promoting the bejesus out of this
            film, with appearances all over, and not only the usual <i>106th
            &amp; Park</i>, Leno, and MTV beach thingies guest shots, but also
            the more creative. The other night he showed up on <i>WWF Smackdown</i>,
            dueting with The Rock on &quot;Under the Boardwalk.&quot; Seems
            folks just love Bussa Bus, wherever he goes. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Third,
            Busta makes sure that his guy, no matter how gnarly he might appear
            at first, kicks ass. You see him early on watching kung fu movies on
            TV in his motel room, alone (he's a serious trash-TV producer, not
            screwing the contestants), and he practices his moves while he
            watches, especially the eeiii-yahh screeches. Even if Freddy is an
            ambitious, reckless entrepreneur at first, when he learns the truth
            -- that Michael is still living at home, in the basement, by eating
            live rats -- he does the right thing, and saves that Last White
            Girl, for sure.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">And
            fourth, Busta out-acts and out-spectacularizes Tyra Banks, who plays
            Freddy's assistant, Nora. Okay, so the out-acting is no biggie. And
            okay, so she doesn't have much time on screen: Nora and Freddy
            exchange a few knowing glances while shooting the kids'
            intro-confessionals; toast one another with wine when, early on, it
            looks like the project is going well; and other than that, Nora/Tyra
            has only one more-than-thirty-seconds scene, in which she does not
            speak, but does slither-dance while making a
            whipped-cream-and-coffee, and elaborate bit of nonsense so that she
            doesn't see her camera-guy being harpooned by Michael, on the very
            camera that camera dead-camera-boy has just that second carefully
            placed by the stairwell... well, la-dee-da! You know Miss Latte will
            be punished for this sexy display and self-indulgence. But you don't
            even see her bloody horrible death scene, just the considerable
            blood slick she leaves on the floor, above which she dangles, so
            very pop-eyedly. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Of
            course, even without Nora's slaughter, there are more than enough
            gruesome violences committed against young bodies -- all locked in
            the house because they've signed their webcast contract. The group
            Freddy assembles and instructs to &quot;search for clues&quot; (and
            then endeavors to scare silly by planting various Michael
            paraphernalia, like aggressively marked up coloring books, a high
            chair with nasty leather restraints for baby Mike, skeletons in the
            basement wall, first dead sister's hairbrush at her now-cobwebby
            dressing table, etc.) consists of the kind of fresh meat you're used
            to seeing in slasher flicks -- kids looking for a break, ready to do
            anything to be the next Johnny Depp or Josh Hartnett. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">This
            crew consists of Last Girl Sara (Bianca Kajlich), tarty literature
            major/impalee Donna (Daisy McCrackin),
            bleached-blond-TV-star/decapitated girl Jen (Katee Sackhoff, who is
            actually charming, as far as she goes), boring-as-heck/throat-cut
            kid Bill (played by forgettable <i>American Pie</i> cast member
            Thomas Ian Nicholas, apparently still looking for that break), and
            gothic-affecting music major Jim (Luke Kirby) -- I actually forget
            what happens to him, but he deserves it because he comes on to Donna
            by saying, &quot;You've got great legs. What time do they
            open?&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            single character who seems sensible and un-irritating, and has seen
            enough of these movies to know how <i>not</i> to act, is Jen's
            bong-smoking buddy Rudy (Sean Patrick Thomas, who also made <i>Dracula
            2000</i> before he blew up in <i>Save the Last Dance</i>, and is
            apparently part of this equally old project because the director
            Rick Rosenthal, aside from directing Sean Penn's <i>Bad Boys</i>
            nineteen years ago and <i>Halloween 2</i> twenty-one years ago, has
            recently done episodes for Thomas's TV series, <i>The District</i>).
            Rudy works in the cafeteria down at the college, which suggests
            that, unlike the other kids, he knows a little something-something
            about the world. It also gives him a &quot;hook,&quot; which is that
            he's into food and nutrition, going so far as to float the theory
            that Michael is murderous because of a poor diet. Plus, Rudy knows
            his way around a knife drawer, which comes in handy here, briefly,
            anyway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">You
            keep track of all these kiddies by way of <i>Halloween: Resurrection</i>'s
            major gimmick, that is, the cameras on their heads, and the
            split-images on the computer screens, watched by a bunch of kids at
            a Halloween party, wearing costumes and laughing at the killings,
            because, like you (the presumed viewer of this film), they've seen
            way too many slasher flicks, and know how they all turn out. The one
            observer who takes the events seriously is Sara's email-pal Myles
            (Ryan Merriman), who's dressed like Vince Vega in <i>Pulp Fiction</i>:
            truly, a meaningful costume. Myles sends Sara helpful messages on
            her palm pilot like, &quot;He's on the stairs!&quot; and &quot;GO
            NOW!&quot; She plays resourceful Last Girl just fine, slipping out
            half-open windows, kicking Michael in the head, and, importantly,
            getting interminably stuck under some debris just as the room is
            going up in flames and Michael's sitting bolt upright from his
            deadlike splay on the floor -- again. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">All
            this takes place as multiple audiences watch -- Freddy, the internet
            viewers, you. While Rhymes' Freddy is most fun to watch (especially
            facing off against Michael) and makes a fine speech at the end about
            the evils of invasive cameras, the kid participants in <i>Dangertainment</i>
            surely have a sense of what's at issue, long before Michael makes
            the scene. At first they think maybe they'll just all stay together
            in one room, unmoving, for the night; Jen, who aspires to stardom,
            reminds them of their duty to a viewing &quot;public.&quot; They
            agree to &quot;perform,&quot; trudging off to &quot;explore&quot;
            the Myers' creaky, dark, awful rooms.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like
            most films in the genre, this one is self-knowing. Unlike most of
            them, it does have something to say beyond the body count. If you
            can see past the obvious machinations on its surface (which,
            granted, demands some tolerance for the genre), <i>Halloween:
            Resurrection</i> poses real questions about responsibility even as
            it gives you what you paid for -- quick splatter and even quicker
            dread of splatter. For one thing, it doesn't pretend that white kids
            are the only ones who appreciate the genre; for another, it invites
            meta-audience participation via that palm pilot device, as you get
            to read along with internal catcalls. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">And
            for one more thing, it makes a grim, grand metaphor out of reality
            TV and insidious observation technologies (both encroaching on daily
            experience by the minute). This extends beyond its reference to <i>The
            Osbournes</i> (which must have been added after the film came off
            the shelf), to timely and occasionally insightful concerns about
            surveillance culture. After several frazzling and frustrating
            moments, she takes off her head camera and points it at herself:
            &quot;You watch,&quot; she snarls, her face close and blurry in the
            frame. &quot;You watch!&quot; It is what you've come to do, after
            all.</span></font></td>
