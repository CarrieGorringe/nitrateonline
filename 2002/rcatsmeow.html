            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><b>You may have 
            heard some things about William Randolph Hearst. That he was 
            superrich and not a little tyrannical, publishing magnate and 
            proponent of yellow journalism, Patty Hearst's grandfather and a 
            model for Orson Welles' (and co-screenwriter William J. Mankiewicz's) 
            Charles Foster Kane. You may have also heard that he was, for years, 
            devoted to his mistress, Marion Davies, endeavoring not only to 
            design a film career for her, but also to ensure her fidelity to him 
            -- like, forever.</b> </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">For years, a 
            rumor circulated around Hollywood, with occasional seepage outside, 
            concerning the bizarre and untimely death of a friend of Hearst, the 
            cowboy picture producer Thomas Ince, during a November 1924 cruise 
            on Hearst's yacht, the Oneida. According to one rather legendary 
            version of events -- the one that is taken up by Peter Bogdanovich's 
            new film, <i>The Cat's Meow</i> -- on a dark night, Hearst mistook 
            Ince for Charlie Chaplin, whom he understood to be dallying with 
            Marion, and shot him in the head. Being Hearst, he was able to have 
            a doctor and private ambulance take Ince's unconscious body home, 
            where he died days later. And being Hearst, he was able to keep the 
            press and the law at bay: the official word was that Ince died of 
            something like &quot;indigestion.&quot; (Hearst's biographer, David Nasaw, by 
            the way, insists that there is no good reason to believe this story, 
            any which way). </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Bogdanovich's 
            movie re-imagines all this as it might have appeared to one of the 
            guests on that fateful yachting trip, Elinor Glyn (Joanna Lumley). 
            Though Elinor isn't precisely a witness to what happens, she offers 
            bits of memory and gossip, laced through with cautions about excess 
            -- of desire and wealth, fantasy and business. Glyn's narration 
            begins while at Ince's funeral (which appears in the film in quaint, 
            and rather elegant, black and white). As she gazes on the coffin, 
            the shot dissolves to the yacht and fades into color: the 
            distinction between past and present is at once harsh and hazy. 
            Worst of all, <i>The Cat's Meow</i> insists, you can't go back to 
            the good old days, because they were never so good as you think they 
            were. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The yachting 
            party, ironically conceived as a birthday celebration for Ince (Cary 
            Elwes), begins as Glyn waits in her motorcar at the pier: though she 
            has arrived before the other guests, she'll be damned to make her 
            actual appearance <i>early</i>. Immediately, then, the film asks you 
            to be wary of your guide. No matter that Glyn is witty, self-aware, 
            even, for fleeting moments, warm. She has a reputation for writing 
            well about the rich and famous because is one of them. </font>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">For all the 
            forgetting that goes on this film -- willful and accidental, 
            self-delusional and self-protective -- you can't forget this much. 
            Glyn's capacity to go along, not to mention feel nostalgic for this 
            scene, is premised on her dedication to the cause. Or rather, as she 
            herself describes it in a bit of writerly explication: she's in 
            thrall to the Curse, which strikes you &quot;like a disease.&quot; Once you 
            succumb, you realize that Hollywood is &quot;not a place at all, but a 
            living creature, an evil wizard.&quot; And soon you start believing what 
            it tells you, that &quot;you are the most important person in any room.&quot;&nbsp;
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">This speech 
            takes place at the first night's dinner, and as the camera pans 
            around the table, it's clear that just about everyone in that room 
            is thinking how important he or she is at that moment. This is how 
            the business works, how lies and careers become codependent. And 
            it's exactly how the film sets up Hearst (Edward Hermann), as the 
            King of This World, always the most important person in all rooms. 
            He's poofed up and soft, and deadly afraid that his lack (of 
            knowledge, security, potency, juice) will be found out. And so his 
            entire life is dedicated to putting up the front that he is 
            absolutely, never ever afraid of any of it. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">He's 
            introduced, tellingly, as less powerhouse publisher (&quot;He controls 
            more print than Jesus Christ,&quot; observes one hanger-on). Peeping 
            through a porthole on his yacht, he observes his guests and 
            especially, keeps watch over Marion (Kirsten Dunst, who is 
            tremendous in this role). Marion is a child next to Hearst, but also 
            his grown up caretaker: when he frets that she's going to leave him, 
            or doesn't appreciate the butterfly broach he's given her, she 
            assures him, at ease with her own will and love: &quot;Shut up and keep 
            me happy, Pops.&quot; At times anxious because she knows he's watching 
            her, Marion maintains her stylish sailor-dress sunny-ness: she's 
            surely resilient, or maybe just terrified to let down her guard.
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">As this little 
            show goes on in Hearst's outpost/stateroom, the lower deck teems 
            with performance. Louella Parsons (Jennifer Tilly, of the 
            fingernails-on-chalkboard voice) appears as a young up-and-comer, 
            not yet the gossip columnist with a lifetime contract with Hearst 
            Papers (this comes about, according to <i>The Cat's Meow</i>,because 
            Hearst must buy her silence regarding the Ince incident); a couple 
            of flapper-party girls; Ince, his business manager-buddy-beard 
            George (Victor Sleazak), and Ince's mistress, Margaret (Claudia 
            Harrison); the band members; and Chaplin (Eddie Izzard), all mill 
            about expecting good times to rain down on them. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Though everyone 
            knows the illicit nature of Hearst's relationship with Marion, they 
            all observe the pretense of propriety as if their lives depended on 
            it. Ince, in particular, is worried &quot;not to get on [Hearst's] 
            morally objectionable side,&quot; as he's hoping to strike up a lucrative 
            movie-making deal with him, promising to take &quot;good care&quot; of Marion. 
            Ince believes that his primary potential obstacles are 1) even 
            getting Hearst's attention, since the old man tends to be easily 
            distracted, and 2) keeping the Margaret affair a secret. Of course, 
            everyone already knows about the affair (he's brought Margaret along 
            for the trip), and frankly, it's hard to believe that he's so 
            ignorant. But Ince's density and self-absorption, matched only by 
            Hearst's own, become important plot points. And so, you settle in to 
            listen to Margaret's incessant complaints and his alarming 
            indifference. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Given that he's 
            only one navel-gazer on a ship full of them, Ince's problems (and 
            annoyances) start looking minor, even though he's actually the 
            closest to losing his livelihood (and so, his sense of himself, or 
            his sense of room-importance). Ince's once lucrative Western films 
            have fallen out of fashion, and he's up against it. Louella is 
            angling for a career; her early morning ping-pong game with an angry 
            Margaret is part comedy and part tragedy: Lolly is dim beyond the 
            pale. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Chaplin is also 
            at something of a crossroads, as his film, <i>A Woman of Paris</i> 
            (in which he did not appear), failed miserably at the box office, 
            and his last conquest, teenaged Lita Grey, has turned up pregnant. 
            He's hopeful about Marion, but you're not sure&nbsp; why. She, in turn, 
            apparently quite in love with Hearst, is still not beyond imagining 
            what it might be like to spend time with someone who might last more 
            than thirty seconds on the dance floor. She's also quite ready to 
            believe Charlie when he tells her that her career path lies in 
            comedy, as her historical dramas, which Hearst prefers because they 
            are &quot;respectable,&quot; are mostly painful to watch. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Everyone is in 
            some state of crisis, personal and professional, because these are 
            the same thing, and because, crisis is the only way these folks know 
            how to function (or not function). Still, this may be the least 
            interesting way to read <i>The Cat's Meow</i>. It's hardly a 
            newsflash to say that Hollywood is rife with corruption and 
            selfishness. Neither does the film offer much in the way of plot of 
            clever camerawork: such conventional movie elements have never 
            appeared to interest Bogdanovich, and it shows, especially in his 
            most successful films. Most sadly, perhaps, her protestations to 
            Hearst -- &quot;Stop listening to whispers and listen to me!&quot; -- are 
            rendered meaningless. The whispers in Hollywood are deafening.&nbsp;
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">But if <i>The 
            Cat's Meow</i> is regular in story and execution, that's actually 
            okay. Because it's not about either. In fact, it's less a narrative 
            per se than a portrait of a moment that never really existed. Or 
            better, it's a series of portraits setting off its most eloquent and 
            moving image, and that is, again and again, Marion Davies. Forgotten 
            by film &quot;history,&quot; or worse, remembered as a victim of Hearst's 
            follies, here she comes alive. By film's end, she looks too 
            deer-in-the-headlights, unable to collapse or move. She's seen the 
            shooting and the work of the cover-up, and the next morning, she 
            faces herself, in the form of the choices she does not have: to 
            believe in Charlie Chaplin, or William Randolph Hearst. </font>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Marion is here, 
            in her blankness and horror, the most accurate register of the loss 
            that lies at the center of this film, and by extension, this 
            narcissistic culture. When she decides, at last, to stay with 
            &quot;Pops,&quot; you're left feeling as shell-shocked as she looks, waving to 
            her departing guests from the deck, leaning into her hollow mountain 
            of a man. </font></span></p>
