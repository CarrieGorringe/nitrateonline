            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The title of <i>Half Past Dead</i> 
            refers to the fact that the protagonist was at one time clinically 
            dead for twenty-two minutes (?!?) before being successfully revived. 
            Once this is mentioned, it is never brought up in the movie again. 
            What credibility the movie may have had flatlines after it is 
            announced that the action is taking place on &quot;New Alcatraz&quot;, built 
            right on the old Alcatraz Island (the renovation costs must've been 
            enormous), which features one of the tiniest penitentiary blocks in 
            motion picture history, and is run by a warden who was once a 
            convict himself and is named &quot;El Fuego&quot; (meaning that he's badder 
            than any of the other convicts could possibly be).</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">One dark and stormy night, a group 
            of dignitaries, including a U.S. Supreme Court Justice (played by 
            the formidable Linda Thorson, best known as Tara King, the last of 
            John Steed's co-<i>Avengers</i>), arrives to see the warden 
            &quot;inaugurate&quot; his new &quot;state-of-the-art execution chamber&quot; (which 
            looks like a Rodeo Drive clothing showroom without the racks). The 
            prisoner sentenced to die that night is a judge (Bruce Weitz) who 
            stole a fortune in gold from a train and hid it but---oops!---killed 
            five people when the train derailed. Just as he's strapped into the 
            execution chair, from out of the sky, in drop a gang of criminals, 
            guns blazing (and the Europeans think that people in the U.S. are 
            gun nuts, for some reason!), and they strap the Supreme Court 
            Justice into the execution chair so they can kidnap the judge 
            and...well, on top of everything else, it's a morality tale! The 
            chief villain (played by rap musician Ja Rule) says on several 
            occasions that &quot;God is dead&quot;, chastises the female judge for 
            championing women's rights while remaining unmarried, then leans 
            close to her, gauges her scent, and pronounces, &quot;Your bait is still 
            fresh.&quot; (Tara King would've spat in his eye and then made him beg 
            for more.) The convicted judge, on the other hand, is calmly 
            resigned to his fate and has no fear of mortality. (He and the 
            protagonist exchange Zen secrets, at one point, like two school kids 
            who are in on the same joke.) And the movie never misses an 
            opportunity to show the beaded wristband which Steven Seagal wears 
            on one wrist (the actor converted to Buddhism).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The last time I saw Seagal 
            was...oh, geesh, I think it was in&nbsp; <i>On Deadly Ground</i>, the 
            movie where Michael Caine, wearing a spot of plaster on his face as 
            if he'd cut himself shaving, played the heavy by yammering into the 
            camera while we were wondering why Michael Caine was appearing in 
            this movie. (Probably so that he could go on to do fine work in 
            lower-budgeted movies like <i>Blood and Wine</i> and <i>Little 
            Voices</i>.) Then, Seagal himself expelled a huge amount of hot air 
            at the movie's end for, I don't know, ten minutes, telling us about 
            how we should be conserving the environment. Actually, the 
            environment could do with a bit more conserving, but I doubt if the 
            movie or Seagal won over any hold-outs.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Well, there have been some changes 
            since then. In <i>Half Past Dead</i>, Seagal, standing in the middle 
            of it all, appears almost entirely in close-up, usually heavily 
            shadowed, and wearing tent-like outfits that disguise his form. 
            During an opening shoot-out, he ducks round a corner the way Patty 
            Duke ran off-stage during the musical numbers in <i>Billie</i> so 
            that Donna McKechnie could step forward and perform the dance 
            routine. When Seagal does get into a fight, the camera, again, moves 
            in as close as it can get to him. The only honest-to-Godfrey 
            one-on-one fight sequence that occurs in the film is between Morris 
            Chestnut (who plays what amounts to second-banana to Seagal) and Nia 
            Peeples, who wears clouds of blue mascara around her eyes and swings 
            her limbs while wearing a bat-like outer coat.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Then, somebody decided, no, 
            wait---let's end the movie with some X-treme skydiving stunts! So, 
            in the worst piece of commercial moviemaking I've seen in years, all 
            story logic and continuity is tossed right out the window so that 
            the movie can do just that. Good grief. Laugh and roll your eyes all 
            you want, but what lingers most in recollection is the sight of 
            Seagal, trying to hang onto being an action hero while clearly being 
            past it, and trying to make himself hip and up-to-date in spite of 
            it. (There are loads and loads of heavy-acceleration metal and 
            hiphop numbers dolloped onto the soundtrack.) All we're expected to 
            do is just get stoked on the usual on-screen overkill of explosions 
            and violence. The audience is already heading for the exits. The 
            movie starts out ludicrous, but ends up sad.</font></td>
