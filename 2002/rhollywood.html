            <span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="5">Reinvention</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700">
            <font size="2">In show business, survival depends on serial 
            reinvention. Those celebrities who have perfected the routine are 
            legendary for it -- Madonna, Michael Jackson, Steven Spielberg (from
            <i>Jaws</i> to <i>Private Ryan</i>). Others are equally famous for 
            always seeming consistent, if not tedious, like Mick Jagger or 
            Robert Altman, maybe. Ingeniously, the industry offers ego-massaging 
            wiggle room on both ends of this spectrum. Desire and delusion, 
            creativity and vanity: a little shake-and-stir, and voila! 
            reinvention starts to resemble cunning consistency, while sameness 
            looks like a more discreet transformation. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Perhaps the 
            premiere practitioner of this self-image sleight-of-hand is Woody 
            Allen. Surely, one of Allen's enduring appeals is his willingness to 
            showcase his phobias, distastes, and petty concerns on one hand, and 
            his arrogance and contempt on the other. All this while his refusal 
            to participate in the business as such has made him, simultaneously, 
            an admirable renegade and difficult personality. (We won't even get 
            into his personal life: the heart wants what the heart wants, etc.)
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Allen's dilemma 
            is familiar: most simplistically, he's caught between the business 
            and art of movies. And despite his persistent fretting about this 
            dilemma, he's made a lot of movies, thirty-one in thirty-four years. 
            These don't win a lot of prizes or make tons of cash, but his 
            &quot;peers&quot; (whoever they may be) call him brilliant. Occasionally, and 
            notoriously, he's tried other approaches. But if his Bergmanish 
            films and work with &quot;foreign&quot; cinematographers didn't exactly cement 
            a new reputation as an art-filmmaker, to be fair, he did, somewhat 
            bravely, stretch his skills to the point of breaking. Still, and 
            stubbornly, his &quot;fans&quot; (whoever they may be) want comedies. And so, 
            he relents. Repeatedly. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">That said, the 
            relenting this time is different than it has been in the past. That 
            isn't to say that Allen's new movie, <i>Hollywood Ending</i>, 
            doesn't wholly and tiresomely subscribe to the Allen formula. That 
            is, Allen plays Val Waxman, a neurotic New York-based director who 
            loses his woman and fusses about it, then wins her back, or not. (As 
            he's told various interviewers, he has a &quot;limited range as an actor&quot; 
            and knows what he does well). It's the same movie he's made many 
            times before, and while there is an audience for that movie, it's a 
            small one. This means that, again and again, promotions people need 
            to come up with other ways to sell the product -- especially since 
            the director whose name means the most in any Woody Allen movie will 
            not participate, remaining pathologically (though quite 
            understandably) averse to press, to making nice, to showing up with 
            smiles and nods, if not handshakes. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Until now. The 
            reinvention of <i>Hollywood Ending</i> is not the film, but the 
            sixty-six-year-old Allen as self-promoter. This year, with his 
            second DreamWorks picture, he is a changed man. And he is 
            everywhere. Turner Movie Classics is running a mini-fest of his 
            films, and a documentary, <i>Woody Allen: A Life in Film</i>, on 4 
            May. He went to the Oscars. He's going to Cannes. He's bringing the 
            wife along on promotional road trips. He's speaking politely with 
            reporters who have little to ask him except, gee, how come he likes 
            New York so much? </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">This was 
            precisely the case during a recent promotional moment this past 
            week, wherein Allen went strolling through Central Park with Katie 
            Couric. They paused to admire the sunny day or a bit of garbage 
            floating in the pond, and studiously avoided the looks of 
            passers-by, pretending really hard that they were 1) enjoying New 
            York, and 2) doing it alone. In the midst of all this conviviality, 
            Katie actually asked him why he likes New York. He mumbled something 
            about growing up there, but didn't really have an answer, because 
            the question was, of course, a non-question, or rather, a set-up for 
            yet another display of Allen's affection for Manhattan. Suddenly, 
            such affection is all the rage. Suddenly, he's esteemed for having 
            it, for being so resilient about it. And so what if he's cashing in? 
            Everyone else is. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i>Hollywood 
            Ending</i> is, for the most part, set in NYC, the NYC that Allen 
            knows and loves, that is, the white-looking, wealthy one. It's 
            mostly used as a point of comparison for the slimier slickness of 
            L.A., and both locations are rendered by shorthand. A tanned studio 
            exec extols the fabulosity of the sunny clime, then has to get off 
            the phone to go get his skin cancer treatment (the other Walking 
            L.A. Joke is George Hamilton, who plays some kind of executive, but 
            it only matters that he's George Hamilton). Back in New York, Val 
            sits on a park bench with his ex-wife Ellie (Téa Leoni). The sun 
            filters gently through the trees, the grass looks almost too green, 
            the sky perfectly blue. It's a far cry from the famously thrilling 
            bench scene of a </font></span><i>
            <span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Manhattan</font></span></i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">. 
            It is, rather, lite. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">As is the rest 
            of <i>Hollywood Ending</i>, which, for all the artist's professed 
            devotion to New York, is set indoors -- in hotel rooms and 
            restaurants, and on movie sets. (Which does make sense, given that 
            Val's directing a circa '40s gangster movie, but still, why shoot a 
            movie in beloved New York and not use it?) Val has a lot riding on 
            this picture. The two-time Oscar-winner, now washed up (i.e., deemed 
            too psycho to work with), is reduced to shooting deodorant 
            commercials in Canada. Ellie taps him to direct a project she's been 
            shepherding from her new base in L.A., <i>The City That Never Sleeps</i>. 
            This despite bad blood between them, owing to the fact that she left 
            him for slick studio head Hal (Treat Williams). She argues (with 
            Hal, pacing and swiping at the air with her boxing gloves as she 
            does so) that Val deserves a second chance in the business. He wants 
            a second chance with her. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The primary 
            joke is run into the ground almost as soon as it comes up: Val goes 
            psychosomatically blind just before production begins. In order to 
            keep the gig and prove himself to Ellie, he pretends he can see, 
            enlisting the help of the NYU student (Barney Cheng) working as 
            translator for the Chinese cinematographer Val insisted on hiring. 
            The film, of course, is awful -- like the director, you never see a 
            frame, but you don't have to. Comments fly concerning the 
            strangeness of Val's &quot;vision,&quot; the actors are perpetually confused, 
            and the cinematographer is increasingly furious at the film's 
            incoherence. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Adding to the 
            confusion, Val has hired his current girlfriend, the film's 
            designated bimbette Lori (Debra Messing), for a small part. Hoping 
            to &quot;tone up&quot; for her one day of shooting, she conveniently goes off 
            to a spa partway through production. This means Allen can work on 
            rekindling his flame with Ellie. Before he goes blind, Val mostly 
            insults her fiancé, the studio head (she, in turn, accuses him of 
            posing as the &quot;Great American Artist&quot;). When he's blind, he gets her 
            to help keep his secret, which she does, mainly, it appears, because 
            she still loves him. Just why is unclear, except that this is the 
            premise of any Woody Allen movie, that the young (sometimes very 
            young) woman costar adores him. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Other plot 
            points in <i>Hollywood Ending</i> are equally under-motivated. It's 
            not clear why press-phobic Val agrees to having an <i>Esquire</i> 
            reporter (Jodie Markell) on the set twenty-four hours a day, who 
            provides a weary and wholly unnecessary voiceover recounting of 
            events. It's less clear why he goes into the dressing room of his 
            leading lady (Tiffani Thiessen), knowing she will be coming on to 
            him and knowing that he can't reveal his blindness. When she does 
            come on to him (because, well, because that's what leading ladies do 
            with their cranky old directors), Val trips over furniture and 
            mistakes her plump breast for a &quot;throw pillow.&quot; </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Perhaps most 
            drearily, Val's long-estranged son pops up near film's end, for one 
            scene, as evidence of the trauma that has brought on the 
            psychosomatic hysteria. (This is long past the time you might have 
            cared about any such reason.) This kid, Tony (Mark Webber), is a 
            good-natured green-haired punk whose teeny apartment is filled with 
            empty pizza boxes and a drum kit. Generous despite his father's 
            continuing cracks about his hair, his new name (Scumbag X), and his 
            aspirations, Tony actually seems much healthier than he has any 
            right to be. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Even aside from 
            the fact that the green-haired punk joke is, like, dated, this 
            inept, unfunny handling of the father-son divide indicates the 
            film's general trouble: it's smug and self-involved, not reinvented 
            at all. </font></span></td>
