            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 22 March 2002</i></font><p>
            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">At the men's frat house in <i>
            Sorority Boys</i>, the guys are happily partying, drinking beer, 
            making out with girls, and teasing the ladies over at the sorority 
            house next door, merrily contriving a slingshot that sends various 
            colorful sexual appliances zinging through their windows. (The girls 
            just pick them up and drop them in a basket by the front stoop.) The 
            guys just think they're having fun, while the girls, particularly 
            sorority president Leah (Melissa Sagemiller), see it as being crass 
            and demeaning to women: she hands out fliers warning girls not to go 
            into the parties because they're being exploited by the guys. (The 
            girls go in, anyway.)</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Then, three of the guys at the 
            disreputable men's fraternity -- Dave (Barry Watson), Adam (Michael 
            Rosenbaum), and the broad-shouldered Doofer (Harland Williams), who 
            asserts his coming-of-age by wearing a little plastic lula girl on a 
            string around his neck -- are ostracized, for something they didn't 
            do, so, until they can get things straightened-out, they end up 
            seeking refuge, for only a few days, at the neighboring girls' 
            sorority house, disguising themselves as girls -- three very tall 
            girls, &quot;from Minnesota&quot;. Thus do they realize some hard truths about 
            the mysteries of the feminine mystique -- that sexual harassment 
            isn't fun, that guys who won't take &quot;no&quot; for an answer while hitting 
            on girls can be a real drag, and how hard it is to find off-the-rack 
            clothing that fits. &quot;Why can't they design a dress for girls who 
            have a big caboose?&quot; says Dave, piqued, while trying to find 
            something to wear and only coming up with skimpy little pieces of 
            nothing.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Sorority Boys</i>, which Wally 
            Wolodarsky directed from an original screenplay by Joe Jarvis and 
            Greg Coolidge, is sophomoric, sometimes raunchy (there is a fight 
            where two of the guys battle it out between each other while armed 
            with dildos -- I can just imagine how this scene was pitched to 
            studio executives: &quot;And, the really funny thing is, one of them's 
            purple, while the other one is lime green!&quot;), and the jokes don't 
            fire as well as they're supposed to. (The male fraternity is Kappa 
            Omicron Kappa, or KOK, while the female sorority is Delta Omicron 
            Gamma, or DOG -- that's about as good as the jokes get.) But it's 
            amiable, and it basically has its heart in the right place: it 
            doesn't try to be funny while dumping on all the characters, like 
            some of the more dubious film comedies of last year, and it keeps 
            things fairly light. The scenes between Michael Rosenbaum and 
            Melissa Sagemiller are obvious cadged from the ones Dustin Hoffman 
            and Jessica Lange played in <i>Tootsie</i>, scenes which, especially 
            towards the end of that film, made stone-cold friends of mine 
            profoundly moved, so at least the makers of <i>Sorority Boys</i> are 
            stealing from the best.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The three leads perform perfectly 
            well -- they may be wearing dresses and heels in public, but they do 
            so proudly and they don't take guff from anyone -- and there is also 
            some enjoyable work from Brad Beyer,&nbsp; who, as the head of the 
            fraternity house, knits his brow together and tries to look and 
            sound decisive while delivering judgment despite the fact that his 
            voice is still changing registers; and Heather Matarazzo, who's 
            baffled over what to do about the shrill sound of her voice and 
            laugh, which turns people off, and which makes it sound even worse. 
            Tony Denham also appears as a pint-sized Lothario who apparently 
            gets results with come-on lines like, &quot;So, you sexy she-devil...!&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When the jokes do go-off right, 
            they're choice: when one of the guys whips off his wig to prove that 
            he's a he, one of his sorority sisters (Yvonne Scio), who had been 
            convinced otherwise, still doesn't quite get it: &quot;Oh, my Lord! You 
            LOOK like a MAN!&quot; And, having grown up with an older sister, I can 
            fully relate to the scene where Harland Williams draws the 
            unenviable duty of cleaning the sorority house bathroom, including 
            the drain in the sink. It's one of those aspects of the female 
            mystery that guys are spared from until they get married and start 
            raising a family in close quarters, and one of the reasons why, when 
            still in college and intemperate youth, they party hearty while they 
            can.</font></td>
