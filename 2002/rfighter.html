            review by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 25 January 2002</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>When looking a Jan Wiener during
            the opening frames of the documentary <i>Fighter</i>, the only
            indication that he that he isn't made of stone is the fact that he
            is in constant motion. Darting about with a quickness and agility
            that would make a twenty-year-old jealous, the seventy-something
            Jewish immigrant from Czechoslovakia has firm, toned muscles,
            hard-chiseled features and a thick shock of bristly white hair. As
            the title character in <i>Fighter</i>, Wiener has an intimidating
            boxing stance. This came in handy when he had to flee from Prague at
            the dawn of World War II.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While on the run, he did time in an
            Italian POW camp and eventually became a pilot in the British Royal
            Air Force. Sadly, his struggles didn't end with the Nazis eventually
            fell. Initially welcomed back as a hero, Wiener's defiant attitude
            upset Communist Party officials. He wound up spending five years in
            a labor camp before eventually finding his way to the United States.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Had director Amir Bar-Lev merely
            followed Wiener around Europe as he recounted his hair-raising early
            life, <i>Fighter</i> would have been intriguing. Another factor,
            however, makes the film engrossing and hard to forget: Wiener's
            choice of friends.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Decades after making his home in
            America, Wiener met writer-filmmaker Arnost Lustig. While Lustig,
            like Wiener, is a septuagenarian Jewish Czech immigrant, the two are
            diametrically opposed. Lustig survived Auschwitz and became a
            Communist Party official after the war. Despite all the time that
            has passed, Wiener still chastises Lustig. When Wiener's temper
            flares, it's remarkable that Bar-Lev was able to continue filming.
            The two men talk and talk as if no one were watching.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Bar-Lev's intimacy with his
            subjects is remarkable, and it allows him to reveal how these men
            have managed to become and remain friends. The straightforward,
            almost didactic Wiener sometimes tires of Lustig's analytical
            attitude toward life. Often, though, their demeanors are
            complementary. In the film's most moving sequence, Wiener recalls
            having to hold his dying father's hand. Half a century after the
            fact, he still feels abandoned and betrayed by his father's suicide.
            Lustig muses over the situation in a manner that provides his friend
            with some needed comfort. He suggests that Wiener's father may have
            killed himself to avoid being a burden to his son. In moments like
            these, Bar-Lev reveals how a friendship like theirs can bridge with
            widest of ideological divides.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Through these men, Bar-Lev is able
            to look head on into the tragedies of the twentieth century.
            Fortunately, the movie is hardly gloomy. Wiener and Lustig are often
            a riot together. Their timing puts most professional comedy teams to
            shame. At one point during their journey through contemporary
            Europe, Wiener's memory lapses, leading him to warn the slightly
            younger man that his ability to recall things will fail next. Each
            man in his own way demonstrates remarkable courage. Despite all that
            has happened to them, Lustig remains thoughtful, and Wiener stays
            rebellious. The fact that these two fellows are close when they
            would more likely be antagonists is a sure sign of hope.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"></o:p>
