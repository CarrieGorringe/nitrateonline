            performance of an opera is working or not is whether, during the
            emotional high points, the music and drama succeed in inducing
            goosebumps, and that happened at least twice during Benoît
            Jacquot's film of the Puccini opera <i>Tosca</i> (which won the Prix
            Louis Delluc, one of France's highest film awards, last December).</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jacquot's<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>film starts out by introducing the main characters -- the
            artist Mario, his lover, the singer Tosca, and Scarpia, the
            malevolent secret police official -- by showing (using high-contrast
            black-and-white) the singers who will be portraying them recording
            their parts in the studio, accompanied by the Royal Opera House
            Orchestra of Covent Garden (stirringly lead by Antonio Pappano,
            whose conducting in these parts of the film is sometimes poetic in
            its own right). The film then switches to color to show the
            characters and action unfolding in period costuming and sets. There
            is method in this: it eliminates our noticing that the performers
            are acting before the cameras to prerecorded music by directing our
            attention to it at the beginning, then dismissing it. (Joseph
            Losey's visually stunning 1979 film of Mozart's &quot;Don
            Giovanni&quot; was nonetheless emotionally distant, in part because
            you were aware that the performers were trying not to look as if
            they were lip-synching their parts.) The sets for the action have an
            artfully half-constructed look to them, set against a slate-black
            cast of darkness -- what we might imagine in our heads were we
            listening to a recording of the opera at home.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The very beautiful Angela Gheorghiu,
            as Tosca, and Roberto Alagna, as Mario, suggest a loving, gentle,
            impassioned relationship -- he'll end up being captured, detained,
            and tortured by Scarpia, and Tosca will end up taking a knife to
            Scarpia because of it, delivering the &quot;kiss of Tosca&quot; in
            the meantime. (The depiction of their love also helps gets us
            through the rather tricky plot devices that arise in the opera's
            third act -- reminiscent of Victorine Sardou, who wrote the stage
            melodrama the opera's based on, and his deathless advice as to how
            to handle stage dramaturgy, &quot;Torture the women! Make them
            suffer!&quot;) Ruggero Raimondi played the Don in Losey's 1979 film,
            but Losey used Raimondi's looks to emphasize his crepuscular regard
            for the Don in particular and the opera in general. As Scarpia,
            Raimondi makes a simply splendid villain -- he brings great shading
            and nuance to a part that most would be content to giving a
            standard, mustache-twirling interpretation to. Raimondi's Scarpia is
            even a little taken-aback by the breath of Tosca's emotion when she
            expresses jealousy<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>in
            response to the suggestion of the possibility of Mario seeing
            another woman -- Scarpia knew he had it in her, and he wanted to tap
            into that to trick both Mario and Tosca to his ends, but he's still
            surprised over how much feeling, and passion, she has, and that, in
            turn, makes him want to have her for his own all the more so, and it
            will further drive him towards destroying a love that, we know, to
            be a true and genuine one between Mario and Tosca.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is both a musical and dramatic
            piece that utilizes big emotions and requires a staging that will
            allow them room to build and flow. Jacquot seems to have kicked-out
            the walls of this <i>Tosca</i> so as to accommodate an infinite
            amount of space, whether it be intimate or grand, in the making of
            this picture. And, along with a remarkable use of color -- there are
            swirls of reds and golds that are, at times, breathtaking -- the
            film in turn blooms with a beautiful and powerful surge.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>
