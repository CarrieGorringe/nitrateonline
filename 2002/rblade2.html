            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><b>Dig that 
            crazy fade. Whatever else you say about Blade (at least the Marvel 
            Comics character as embodied by Wesley Snipes), you have to give it 
            up to the haircut -- half-retro, half-futuristic, all severe and 
            mad-at-the-planet. It implies that whole eternal-internal conflict 
            he has going on, that half-vampire, half-human thing, all the 
            self-hating and self-loving that pretty much eats him alive. And, 
            yes, the hair also completes the brooding-superhero's outfit -- the 
            bulging black leather pants, the silver-buckled chest, the huge 
            sword he keeps up against his back, and, of course, the sunglasses. 
            You know you can't be destroying blood-suckers and saving humanity 
            without the sunglasses.</b> </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">In his second 
            movie outing, the super-conflicted Blade takes on a whole new race 
            of super-vampires, known as Reapers. Ominously pale and veiny, so 
            white they look blue, these Nosferatu-looking monsters crawl on 
            walls like insects and feed on vampires, ripping out their throats 
            with mouths that open in stages, first peeling back Predator-style, 
            then simultaneously gnawing and penetrating, Alien-style. The first 
            Reaper, Nomak (Luke Goss), appears in <i>Blade II</i>'s first scene, 
            whacking and chowing down on a few unfortunate vampires who think 
            they've got the ideal gig overseeing a Prague blood bank. Lifting 
            his bloody face to a surveillance camera that catches him in the 
            act, Nomak snarls in a helpful self-introduction: &quot;Vampires! I hate 
            vampires!&quot; </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">You might think 
            that Blade, who notoriously hates vampires like poison, might be 
            inclined to like this guy, but you'd be wrong. &quot;Forget what you 
            think you know,&quot; growls Blade in his opening voice-over (including, 
            apparently, that old adage that vampires can't be photographed). The 
            Daywalker has his own agenda, still fever-dreaming and raging, but 
            changed too. For one thing, he's got a new human helper, Scud 
            (Norman Reedus), a weapons-concocting pothead with more attitude and 
            less experience than leather-faced father-figure Whistler (Kris 
            Kristofferson). And for another, he now seems to like the kick-ass 
            coolness of his vampire-slaying mission, to the point that he even 
            looks enthusiastic on occasion, as in his first <i>Blade II</i> 
            scene, where he takes out a few undead who come at him on 
            motorcycles in a dark alley. Whoosh whoomp whoomp: dead undeads.
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The new Blade 
            recalls the Ripley who showed up in Cameron's <i>Aliens</i>: potent 
            and focused, primed for full-on combat. But while the sequel has a 
            higher body count than the first (with amped up martial arts 
            choreography by Donnie Yen, who plays a vampire named Snowman), it 
            is also, thanks to the darkly sinuous imagination of Mexican-born 
            director Guillermo del Toro (<i>Cronos</i>, <i>The Devil's Backbone</i>), 
            grim and full of menace. At the same time, Blade remains primarily 
            the peculiar and compelling head-case product of an energetic 
            collaboration between star Snipes (his Amen Ra Films produced) and 
            screenwriter David S. Goyer (currently at work on the third 
            installment of the planned trilogy).</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">And so, some 
            things are the same in Blade's universe: first, he tracks down 
            Whistler (whose suicide in the first movie sure sounded like a done 
            deal), and resurrects him from the yucky vampiric fate he's been 
            suffering (the meanies have him floating in a big old blood vat when 
            Blade recovers him); as well, he still has to fix regularly to 
            control the &quot;thirst&quot; (again, a junkie superhero? - not so average), 
            and he still has a hard time with what you might call, for lack of a 
            better word, romance.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Whereas too 
            many vampires get off on being sensual and seductive, Blade is most 
            comfortable (or at least used to) being a macho hard-ass: he hides 
            behind those sunglasses, tends to stomp off to be alone in his 
            meditation room, and resents the hell out of anything resembling 
            weakness, which for him, generally speaking means anything connected 
            to vampires, who are, in this universe, victims and incarnations of 
            a virus. Still, Blade has desires and attachments. Where the first 
            film's object of affection was human, 'NBushe Wright's blood 
            specialist, here she's a sultry ninja-girl vampire. </font></span>
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Nyssa (Leonor 
            Varela) first appears in black bodysuit and mask, with her similarly 
            disguised partner, Asad (Danny John-Jules). They infiltrate Blade's 
            workshop, engage in a big old martial arts contest, then reveal 
            themselves and make nice with their nemesis, recruiting him to fight 
            alongside them in order to defeat the Reapers. He's skeptical, 
            naturally, but she's persuasive, and besides, she grants him gets 
            access to the vampires' monumental HQ, since her extremely creepy 
            dad (Thomas Kretschmann) is head-suckhead-in-charge. Blade goes for 
            this, because he figures he can blow up the joint with a bomb he has 
            strapped to his body -- born righteously mad, now Blade's become a 
            (potential) terrorist. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Perhaps the 
            most compelling aspect of the <i>Blade</i> movie franchise is its 
            consistently intricate politics. For all the fun of the new film's 
            elaborate fight scenes, stunning cinematography (by Gabriel 
            Beristain) and design (Carol Spier), its most riveting aspect 
            remains Blade. He's so mesmerizingly difficult, so self-divided, as 
            described by the title of Mos Def and Massive Attack's excellent 
            soundtrack contribution, as &quot;I Against I.&quot; <i>Blade II</i> 
            re-complicates already complex questions about identity and 
            community, justice and loyalty, again allegorizing race (human and 
            vampire, black and white). Blade's mixed-race status makes him feel 
            alienated, but also special. He keeps fretting himself into a frenzy 
            on a race continuum, sliding between dynamic and charismatic, 
            sinister and galling.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Back in the 
            first movie, owing to his dear departed mother's horrific fate, 
            Blade pulverized his vampire &quot;father,&quot; the ultrawhite Deacon Frost 
            (Stephen Dorff). Here, he hangs on to his grudge against the race, 
            even though, as Nyssa suggests, in doing so, he's &quot;denying&quot; a 
            crucial part of himself, the yucky sucker part. That he finds 
            himself attracted to her is not a little alarming for Blade, and he 
            deals with it mostly by gnashing his teeth, retreating to his 
            chamber of solitude, disappearing during the gang fights, and 
            reloading his gigantic weapons with silver bullets and garlic 
            shards. (This last despite the fact that, rather inconveniently, the 
            Reapers don't share the same weaknesses as your standard vampires, 
            but you surely predicted that much of a plot turn.) Nyssa, meantime, 
            focuses on the mission, and pretends that Blade is trustworthy 
            enough to bring to the old vampire HQ. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">It turns out he 
            doesn't have to self-detonate, but he does meet the Bloodpack, an 
            elite vampire team that's been training for two years for one reason 
            -- to destroy Blade. These include Snowman, Chupa the Wrestlemania 
            escapee (Matt Schulze), red-wigged girlie Verlaine (Marit Velle Kile) 
            and her bald-headed tat-boy Lighthammer (Daz Crawford), and an Irish 
            longhair called Priest (Tony Curran). They're the motley crew for 
            sure, and like the first film, this one falls back on the bad young 
            vamps partying down at the all-night dance club: here they snort 
            blood-as-red-crack-powder, tongue-kiss with razor blades, and dig 
            around in each other's exposed insides: pointedly gross, but perhaps 
            it's unfair to call it out as &quot;evil&quot; per se. Kids, sensual 
            pleasures, addiction -- the connections are too easy to leave 
            unexamined. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">When the 
            Bloodpack and Blade meet, they instantly despise one another, and 
            he's all bossy and insisting that since they came to him, they have 
            to follow his orders they're suspicious of one another. The most 
            obvious bad-ass is Reinhardt (Ron Perlman, reprising a bit of the 
            fuck-everybody pose he struck for <i>Alien Resurrection</i>). He 
            immediately brings the race issue to the forefront, telling Blade 
            that the burning question they all want answered is, &quot;Do you blush?&quot; 
            No way Blade's going to take such baiting, so he smacks down 
            Reinhardt, claps an explosive device into the back of his head and 
            keeps the detonator himself; meanwhile, Reinhardt (um, could the 
            sex/race/penis-size metaphors be any more obvious?). </font></span>
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">It's not that 
            Blade lacks for whiter-than-white vampires to hate on, but Reinhardt 
            provides a particularly apt target. But Reinhardt has an even more 
            remarkable adversary, Whistler, with whom he becomes locked in a 
            terminal contest over who can be the sickest old-school white guy. 
            Now how screwed up is that? The competition builds gradually, with 
            Reinhardt warning Blade to keep his &quot;dog curbed,&quot; then calling out 
            Whistler (whose face is looking plain scarier and scarier -- what 
            the heck kind of bad road did Kristofferson travel during his youth, 
            anyway?) as &quot;hillbilly.&quot; Whistler calls him &quot;Fritz&quot; and &quot;Adolph.&quot; 
            Yeah, they're bad. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">They're also 
            part of a cultural system. As overt and metaphorical as the film's 
            race politics are, they remain complex. With their DNA all messed 
            with, the mutant Reapers have their own claim to victimization, as a 
            race, as well as their genocidal urges, much like half-breed Blade, 
            much like any vampire who's been turned. While vampires are 
            creatures of darkness, quite literally allergic to sunlight, the 
            Blade series recuperates blackness -- in his body and perspective. 
            And that's where the haircut makes so much sense, along with the big 
            guns and sword, the tortured psyche and the comic book hero's 
            mythos. Blade's conflicts are almost too deep and shallow at the 
            same time. Too much time and never enough. Or, as Mos Def puts it, 
            &quot;Spread across time till my time never come.&quot; </font></span>
