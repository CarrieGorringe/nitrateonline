            this imminent loss, Jakob (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and Frank (Barry
            Pepper) drink beers and argue. Throughout their conversation, the
            camera doesn't move, framing them with a window in investment banker
            Frank's apartment. It looks out on Ground Zero. When Jake, a prep
            school teacher, observes that, according to the <i>New York Times</i>,
            &quot;the air is bad down here,&quot; Frank grimaces, &quot;F*ck the
            <i>Times</i>. I read the <i>Post</i>.&quot; Besides, he snarls, all
            attitude and anger, no terrorists are going to chase him off his own

            changes the subject to Monty's dog, Doyle. Too bad Monty can't bring
            him along to the penitentiary. Frank schools Jake: first off, no one
            brings his dog, and second, &quot;Guys who look like Monty don't do
            well in prison.&quot; When Jake hopefully suggests he'll go visit
            Monty once a month, Frank snaps: he knew what he was doing, he lived
            well off &quot;the misery of other people.&quot; And the price, for
            everyone, will be terrible. &quot;After tonight,&quot; Frank adds,
            &quot;It's bye-bye Monty. He's gone.&quot; With this, the camera
            cuts, at last, to show the masked workers at Ground Zero, below.
            Illuminated by floodlights, they rake and shovel, seemingly
            endlessly. <o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            connections between this difficult conversation and its devastating
            framing are at the heart of Spike Lee's <i>The 25th Hour</i>. While
            its narrative focus is Monty's last night, the film is also about
            survival in more abstract and concrete senses. It opens with huge,
            hard-hitting shots of the March 2002 tribute to the Twin Towers, the
            towers of light. Initially, these floodlights are so close in the
            frame that they're almost unreadable, but as the shots pull out, the
            specifics of their memory and trauma become clear. It's ironic,
            perhaps, that distance brings (or allows) meaning, but also fitting.
            Just as Frank and Jake struggle over the implications and
            consequences of Ground Zero for themselves, so does New York City,
            and by extension, the nation, continue to contemplate and (mis)understand.
            Heartbreaking, the process is inevitable. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">That
            Lee's movie sets Monty's individual story against this almost
            unfathomably large -- simultaneously personal and impersonal --
            backdrop is only one of its audacious ambitions. With a screenplay
            adapted by David Benioff from his novel, published in the summer of
            2001, the film brings together feelings of love, grief and anger. If
            it doesn't completely make sense of their combinations, it does lay
            out their collisions in detail, sometimes agonizing, sometimes
            trite, always difficult. For the most part, the film cuts back and
            forth between this last night (the twenty-fifth hour) and the
            incremental events that brought Monty to his unbearable present. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">It
            opens with a jolt: Monty and his hulking partner in crime, Kostya
            (Tony Siragusa), booming along in the night, happen upon a dog,
            beaten bloody and left for dead near the East River. Kostya sensibly
            wants to drive on, but Monty wants to save it, risking the dog's
            frightened attacks in order to scoop it up in a blanket and whisk it
            to the all-night vet's in the trunk of his car. Though the damage to
            the dog takes place off screen, before the film even begins, the
            scene of his rescue is turbulent, even violent, in its handheld
            digital camerawork (by cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto, whose
            remarkable year included lensing <i>8 Mile</i> and <i>Frida</i>),
            jarring editing (by longtime Lee collaborator Barry Alexander
            Brown), and sheer noise: Monty's car roars in the night, city
            traffic pounds and screeches in the distance. <o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">This
            is an apt start for a film so attentive to the effects of rage and
            fear, the will to bear and beat adversity: even in the midst of
            chaos, Monty wants to do the right thing. And he's rewarded: in the
            next scene, jumped months ahead in time, he's walking Doyle, now
            healthy and doting, along the riverside. When an old client
            approaches, Monty says no. He's been &quot;touched,&quot; he says,
            &quot;It's over.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            film goes on to reveal how this end has come to him, and how it
            looms as a new, frightening beginning. He visits his retired fireman
            dad, James (Brian Cox), now a pub owner. The walls of his
            establishment are decorated with a shrine to real-life members of
            the fire department's Rescue 5, James' unit, who died 9-11. (No
            matter where you go in this film, the recent past haunts you.) As it
            turns out, Monty's lapse into big-time dealing had to do with his
            alcoholic dad's own needs, though it started early, when he was in
            school, where he was kicked off the basketball team. Now, over a
            last steak dinner at the bar, he tries to comfort James, who worries
            that Monty suffered from his mother's death, or that his own
            drunkenness left his son alone. Monty doesn't want to hear it:
            &quot;It wasn't you, Pop.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Monty
            heads into the bathroom, where he confronts himself in the dingy
            mirror, launches into a tirade, projecting his dread and fury onto
            all the &quot;others&quot; and &quot;a**holes&quot; he can think of,
            a series of &quot;F*ck yous&quot; aimed at the Sikhs and Pakistanis,
            the terrorists, the Chelsea boys, the Russians in Brighton Beach,
            the brothers, the Korean grocers all of whom come right back at him,
            fronting just like him, mad a the world and blaming everyone else.
            Many have compared this imaginary spree to the similarly framed and
            powerful tirade sequence in <i>Do the Right Thing</i> (1989), but
            there's something else going on here, too. It's awful to think that
            the same sentiments and set-ups are equally relevant some thirteen
            years later, a bleak backdrop to 9-11. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Being
            a dealer, Monty is perhaps the most obvious embodiment of greed and
            selfishness in this new world order (though, of course, it's hardly
            specific to his particular generation or class). Wheeling as best he
            can to make it to the next level, Monty resents everyone he's
            learned to see as his competitor and enemy, unable to see through to
            the system that positions everyone except, perhaps, the most
            spectacularly privileged, to lose. Like the tremendous close-ups of
            the tremendous floodlights, these in-your-face shots indicate the
            costs of such myopia. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Monty's
            other grave loss is more romantic, in several senses. He has a girl,
            Naturelle Rivera (Rosario Dawson), whom he encourages her to move
            on, to begin her life anew once he's gone. In part, this advice is a
            function of their own complicated past: flashbacks show that he met
            her while she was still in high school, on a playground where he was
            selling drugs. Their first flirtation -- he in a black leather
            jacket, she in her schoolgirl uniform, takes place on the swings.
            When the Puerto Rican girl reveals that she plays basketball, the
            brooding Monty is visibly delighted: &quot;It's not every day I meet
            a girl as pretty as you who plays the three-spot.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>

            at the same time that it's insidious (she's seventeen, says she's
            eighteen, she's Rosario Dawson, he's willing to hear the lie), this
            budding love story can only end badly -- you already know he's going
            to jail. Worse, he has suspicions, encouraged by Kostya and Frank,
            that his beautiful, affectionate and perfectly named Naturelle is
            the one who turned him in to the DEA. It's a grim thought (though
            his dad insists it can't be, &quot;She's a good girl&quot;), and
            goes to the film's thematic interests in loyalty and distrust,
            mourning and pushing forward. <o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">While
            Nat is clearly troubled by his coldness on this, their last day
            together. But she's determined to stick it out, and agrees to wear
            the dress he likes, &quot;the silver one,&quot; to an after-hours
            party, at the exclusive nightclub owned by his employer, the creepy
            Russian gangster, Uncle Nikolai (Levani Outchaneichvili). Here she
            meets another schoolgirl, Jake's student Mary (Anna Paquin). Cast as
            Naturelle's mirror opposite, confident, naïve, and all too willing
            to sex up her teacher for a better grade, Mary also suffers the
            Spike Lee signature shot, the &quot;moving sidewalk,&quot; as she
            makes her way to the club's bathroom -- it had to happen, might as
            well be her, high and pretending to be more arrogant than she is.
            Young and easily impressed, Mary looks up to Naturelle, admires her
            dress and her exotic life with someone who knows the club's owner. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            clubbish frenzy permits the protagonists to split off and have
            separate rows and revelations. Afterwards, in the morning, however,<i>
            25th Hour</i> delivers its most potent images of what all that
            frenzy aspires to: hope, safety, self-possession. Narrated by James
            while he's driving his son to prison, the sequence stretches out
            into an &quot;America&quot; that these diehard city dwellers have
            never known, a reverie set in the desert, imagining Monty's life
            without prison, projecting into a future that might be. It's a
            knock-your-socks effort of imagination and desire, Monty and Nat's
            wholly integrated, wholly ordinary and extraordinary family (none
            resemble him, suggesting that he's given up his fears of
            &quot;visible&quot; otherness). Just think, dad says, Monty sleeping
            in the car beside him, you'll look back and say, &quot;It all came
            so close to never happening.&quot; <o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            story James tells is so simple and yet so outrageous, and has
            everything to do with lessons available at Ground Zero. It's not
            about vengeance or violence, but about benevolence and courage. That
            the movie doesn't resolve its own ending, doesn't let on what choice
            Monty will make, is its greatest gift. <i>25th Hour</i> takes its
            time, especially in this last storytelling, and if it occasionally
            stumbles, making some points too obviously, it is, in the end, a
            generous, reflective, uncommonly resonant film. <o:p>
