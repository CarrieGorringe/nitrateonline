            was touched by this kid's story,&quot; Denzel Washington tells the <i>New
            York Times</i> (3 November 2002). Indeed, Antwone Fisher's story --
            a young black man beating unspeakable odds -- is all about touching
            and being touched, brimming with unspeakable tragedy, triumph over
            adversity. And, given Washington's well-known commitment to
            individual integrity and collective uplift, this story is an
            unsurprising choice for his directorial debut. All this adds up to
            stakes that appear to be very personal. This both despite and
            because said stakes are framed in the film and the press in public
            ways: for the real life Fisher (who has revised the script into a
            memoir, <i>Finding Fish</i>), for Washington, for
            plucked-from-the-Sony-gift-shop star Derek Luke. <o:p>

            begins with a dream scene. A little boy stands in a sunlit field,
            birds chirping, thunder threatening in the far-off distance. The
            camera pans to him, then hovers over him: the boy's alone. At that
            moment, a huge white barn door slides open, looming over the little
            boy, and then a man gestures him inside, smiling. The boy smiles
            back, he sees before him a crowd of people -- family, ideal and
            abstract -- welcoming him to a table laid with scrumptious, heaping
            dishes. Thrilled and amazed, the boy sits before a plate piled high
            with pancakes and butter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

            in a sweat, Antwone (Luke) awakens to the sound of a Navy ship's
            whistle; in the head, he's approached by a white seaman, taunting
            him, &quot;What's that on your face?&quot; Antwone launches himself
            at the other seaman. Fisher's sent to the psych ward, assigned to
            three sessions with Dr. Jerome Davenport (Washington). Antwone's
            been here before, to see another doctor, and he's indignant:
            &quot;Just 'cause I jumped on a white boy, something must be wrong
            with me?&quot; The good doctor knows something about this story.
            When Antwone refuses to talk, he's okay with that too. Eventually,
            he'll talk. He has to. He's got a story that will touch everyone. <o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">This
            story is, as such stories tend to be, both terrible and
            inspirational. Born in the Ohio State Correctional Facility to a
            drug-addicted mother, his father murdered months before he's born,
            the child is given over to the state, then raised (in the film) by a
            foster mother, Mrs. Tate (Novella Nelson). She's as dreadful a bad
            matriarch as ever appeared on screen. She calls all her foster
            children &quot;niggers,&quot; beats them with a wet towel, and
            tortures six-year-old Antwone (Malcolm David Kelley) with fire.
            Worse, when he's left alone with babysitter Nadine (Yolonda Ross),
            she insists that little Twoney give her some &quot;sugar&quot; and
            &quot;drop 'em&quot; in the basement, the abuse represented by a
            slow zoom on the basement window from the outside, the boy running
            from the house, door slamming behind him, his tiny, bony chest
            heaving as he hauls a** to his best friend's house down the street. <o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">It's
            only when he turns fourteen (and is played, for a minute, by Corey
            Hodges) that Antwone can stand up to Mrs. Tate: &quot;Why do you
            always need to make things difficult for me?&quot; When she tries to
            beat him for using such &quot;fancy&quot; words, he stops her, but
            doesn't hit her back. Instead, he repeatedly takes out his righteous
            rage against the men on his ship. Each fight lands him back in the
            doctor's vicinity and steers him to another disclosure, some dark
            secret -- cruelty, abandonment, violence -- from long ago. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">This
            pattern grants the film an unnecessarily schematic structure,
            reducing the real complexity of Antwone's journeys. Here, it looks
            like narrating his history and then finding his family in Cleveland
            lead neatly to the seaman's &quot;cure,&quot; his maturity, his
            sense of identity. Aside from revealing Antwone's journey, this
            intercutting between his memories and his visits with Davenport (in
            the office, at the doctor's home, in the ship's latrine) leads to
            some minor revelation of the doctor's own familial troubles, in
            particular with his wife, Berta (Salli Richardson). The doctor
            becomes a father figure for Antwone, though he also remains
            strangely locked inside himself, stiff like an officer, reticent
            about his own past.<o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Indeed,
            Thanksgiving at the Davenports turns out to be something of a
            disaster, with Jerome's family acting out in observably habitual
            ways. Maybe an assembly of relations isn't such a good thing. Yet,
            the movie only pauses on this moment, and in fact, uses it as a way
            to underline the importance of recovering and forgiving families.
            (Or even better, making the masculine embrace of the Navy your new
            family.) <o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">At
            the same time, Antwone begins a relationship with a fellow sailor he
            spots working at the bookstore on base, Cheryl (Joy Bryant).
            Unstintingly supportive, daughter of a Vietnam War veteran, and
            perfectly pretty, she models trust and well-being, and for all the
            weight the character has to carry, Bryant's unadorned performance
            provides <i>Antwone Fisher</i> with a kind of emotional subtlety
            that its plot tends to overwhelm. The young couple's scenes together
            are among the most touching here, precisely because their
            representation of this &quot;healing&quot; process is small-scale:
            they drink frapuccinos together, they go out to dinner and he makes
            faces at her salad, she smiles. More often than not, the film
            suffers from a surfeit of significance, as Antwone realizes a truth
            or makes a connection, and the music soars. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">One
            disturbing truth is the inexplicable malevolence visited upon this
            boy -- by his foster mother, his babysitter, and his birth mother,
            Eva (Viola Davis), whom he finally tracks down. Gazing up at her
            project window from the street below, he asks his newly found Uncle
            James (Earl Billings), &quot;You're not going to let anything happen
            to me, are you?&quot; The question appears to startle James, but
            then, he hasn't seen the build-up to it, the scenes detailing the
            fear that Antwone feels regarding his awful &quot;mothers.&quot; Her
            story remains wholly unspoken -- she literally can't say a word once
            he starts telling her how strong and good he is, in spite of her
            terrible neglect. While Viola Davis' remarkable face and restrained
            performance in these three minutes let you in on some of Eva's own
            anguish, the film maintains its direct line, from Antwone's telling
            to his healing. No distractions. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">This
            single-mindedness can feel limited; there's obviously more to
            Antwone's story than the scenes in which he appears (or even the
            flashback shown a few times, his father's murder by an angry
            ex-girlfriend with a shotgun), concerning, for instance, Berta
            Davenport (whose brief perusal of some &quot;happy days&quot;
            snapshots hints at a resonant, recent history with Jerome).
            Antwone's story does touch everyone, but <i>Antwone Fisher</i>
            doesn't show how. <o:p>
