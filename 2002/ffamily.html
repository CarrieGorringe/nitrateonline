            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>&quot;Well, Mom, there's
            something I've been meaning to tell you…&quot; It's a phrase that
            puts most parents onto the precipice between good and bad news, as
            they breathlessly wait for the &quot;push&quot; that will send them
            over one edge or another. For politically conservative and
            fundamentalist Christian parents, the revelation that their children
            are gay or lesbian must be the worst scenario imaginable; how, asks
            Oscar<sup>©</sup>-nominated filmmaker Arthur Dong, does a parent
            (or can a parent) of a particularly rigid mindset, cope with the
            prospect of having a child whose sexuality, in their opinion,
            contains within it &quot;the very element that will lead to the
            destruction of the human race&quot;? Dong, himself gay, has
            constructed his latest documentary, <i>Family Fundamentals</i>, along the same
            lines as he has his other films, <i>Coming Out Under Fire</i> (a
            study of gays in the military) and <i>Licensed to Kill</i> (about
            individuals who feel free to kill gays because of biblical and
            societal justifications). His trademark approach to documenting
            anti-gay attitudes towards gays and lesbians -- creating empathy for
            those who hold often frightening views concerning homosexuality
            without resorting to histrionics -- is on full display here. This
            time, however, Dong takes this topic beyond the all-too easy
            opportunity to examine what some might call the ultimate in
            delicious ironies: he also appears to be &quot;redefining&quot; what
            it means to be a gay or lesbian though examining the prejudices that
            confine them within both far-right and far-left political beliefs.
            In so doing, the filmmaker hopes to encourage dialogue between the
            various doctrinal and personal cross-sections of gay and-anti gay
            societies.</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In order to accomplish this goal,
            Dong has chosen three individuals, all of whom represent a disparate
            cross-section of the gay and lesbian community. Susan Jester, a
            community redevelopment specialist for the state of New Jersey, gave
            marriage, in her words, &quot;the old college try&quot;, before
            coming out in her thirties (Jester's son is also gay). Brett
            Matthews's story has the most typical outcome of the three. Matthews
            is the son of a former Mormon bishop, an accomplished Air Force
            pilot who, following a detailed investigation, was stripped of his commission,
            his pension
            and his veterans' benefits; after a long fight with the Air Force, he
            has been able to obtain only an honorable discharge. The most
            atypical of the three is, arguably, Brian Bennett, a Vice President
            for Southern California Edison, a Republican, and a former political
            protégé of current talk-show host, ultra-Republican and former
            House Representative Robert Dornan. Bennett and Dornan's
            relationship was once so close that Dornan treated him like a son
            (Bennett's nickname for Dornan was, and still is,
            &quot;Poppy&quot;); pictures of the two together at various
            Republican functions still decorate the walls of Bennett's home.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As with any film devoted to the
            task of exploring attitudes toward homosexuality, it's hardly
            surprising that those on the right end of the political spectrum are
            vehemently opposed to granting gays and lesbians any leeway in the
            recognition of their civil rights, the approach usually taking the
            form of alternating between being patronizing toward these moral
            &quot;inferiors&quot; and savage attacks. Dong captures both with an
            ease that is remarkably measured in tone given the (usually) flammable
            nature of the material. The usual references to chapters in
            the books of Leviticus and Romans are trotted out as a
            justification to condemn homosexuality. Susan Jester's mother
            cries over the &quot;hurt&quot; that her daughter has inflicted upon
            her. Brett Matthews feels so shunned by his family that he appears
            to be the most psychologically broken of the three (his
            self-deprecating joke about being gay without having the
            &quot;blessing&quot; of either a fashion or interior-decorating
            sense underscores his alienation from both the straight and gay
            communities).<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Dong, however, also takes the
            viewer beyond the typical realm of non-acceptance by the outside
            world, and reveals the anti-gay forces as representing not quite the
            confidently unified front that an outside observer would assume to
            be the case. As the documentary progresses, Jester's mother
            expresses her anger at some members of her group whose anti-gay
            stance is preventing those gays and lesbians who want to be
            &quot;saved&quot; from themselves from coming back to the church.
            Matthews' father, in a letter, tells his son that Satan must have
            led him astray because &quot;God doesn't make mistakes&quot;, while
            at the same time convinced that his son is headed straight for Hell
            if he doesn't relinquish his homosexuality, Even with the dire
            predictions of a miserable afterlife, this is hardly a wholesale
            rejection of one's offspring; in fact, Matthews' father expresses
            unequivocal love for his son in his letters, although it's a love
            tainted by despair. Only Bennett, the one with the highest media
            profile, is the one for whom there is the least acceptance: Dornan
            and his family have shunned him for good, or unless he relinquishes
            his so-called gay &quot;lifestyle.&quot; The circumstances
            surrounding Bennett's rejection by the Dornan family constitute the
            typical reaction of conservatives to gays and lesbians, but, despite
            the lack of a blood relationship, the pain is no less severe;
            Bennett often comes close to tears when the subject arises.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">But Brian Bennett's problems of
            being accepted whole cloth aren't completely restricted to those
            with a right-wing mindset. Perhaps the greatest irony of <i>Family
            Fundamentals</i> lies in its reception by an audience at this year's
            Sundance film festival, one which has a proud tradition of
            supporting films with provocative themes. It was noted, in the
            February 12, 2002 edition of the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, how
            little post-screening sympathy Bennett's case could muster in some
            quarters, to say
            the least. A few members of the audience expressed the opinion
            that Bennett's only real problem lay in pledging his allegiance to
            the wrong political party (The all-too-obvious fact that gays and
            lesbians have made little advancement into mainstream society,
            despite holding membership in any political party, is obviously
            ignored because of its inconvenience). Other members of the gay and
            liberal communities have been far less generous, and restrained, in
            their assessment of Bennett's political beliefs. <i>Out</i> magazine
            has baldly described him as a &quot;sellout&quot;. The political
            director of the California Democratic Party, Bob Mulholland, was
            quoted as saying that if Bennett and other Republican gays had their
            way, &quot;blacks would still be segregated in the South waiting for
            Southern leaders to change.&quot; (One wonders how Bennett's
            partner, himself a Democrat -- <i>and</i> an African-American -- might have responded to Mr.
            Mulholland's comments).&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Without a doubt, Bennett is the real lightning rod of the
            film, violating more than the other interviewees the concept of
            &quot;gayness&quot;, as far as everyone is concerned. It is no
            accident that Dong chose to take on this project after he discovered
            Bennett's story; there is no question that the filmmaker, in a
            quiet, yet subtle, fashion, is asking gays and lesbians to extend
            the range of their symbolic rainbow to include political, as well as
            sexual, differences. In other words, they, too, have an obligation
            to abandon a circle-the-wagons defense strategy against any real or
            perceived threats from heterosexuals and begin to address the
            conflicts within their own group. Allowing this contradiction to go
            unacknowledged is the film's only weakness. More likely, this is a
            sin of omission, not commission, on Dong's part; he probably did not
            expect to be hit by a broadside from festival-goers with presumably
            tolerant mindsets. It's not necessarily one that harms the overall
            intent or content of the film, but it would have helped to
            demonstrate on how many levels just how support for dialogue between
            several groups -- not just gay versus straight -- has to be
            considered before any significant dialogue can occur.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">It is this graduated format that
            influences Dong's nimble cinematic style; the viewer no sooner
            thinks that he/she has the pattern or the viewpoint all figured out
            when he/she discovers that the filmmaker's point of view is already
            four steps ahead, and the viewer has to race to catch up. Yet, each
            step can hardly be described as the result of shallow content,
            because, under all that ; the film consists of long takes that
            contain considerable detail and brisk pacing. Dong's style is
            recognizably from the <b><i>cinema vérité</i></b> school of
            filmmaking (with all of the characteristic hand-held camera takes,
            and allowing the interviewees to speak for themselves), but he never
            refuses to erase his own participation in the proceedings, allowing
            his own voice-overs and his presence during interviews to also speak
            for themselves. In another break from the traditional explorations
            of gays and lesbians subjected to heterosexual bigotry, Dong never
            feels the need to constantly reiterate the central humanity of his
            interviewees: in other words, he doesn't feel the need to stress
            that both homosexuality and heterosexuality are (rightly)
            genetically based and, therefore, equally deserving of respect. Not
            only would the style be inappropriate to the film's theme, but such
            a didactic approach would simply -- and somewhat paradoxically --
            drain his interviewees of their humanity. It's a format that is
            central to the very point he needs to make: dialogue between two
            opposing sides cannot exist either in a state of rage or in chaos.
            By both alternating between openness and control, Dong can keep
            everything in balance, and keep his plea for understanding and
            continuous dialogue always at the forefront.<o:p>

            is a wryly entertaining, heartbreaking, infuriating and often
            hilarious film of how fundamentalist Christianity is occasionally
            obliged to address what it might see as the ultimate viper in its
            bosom. The film's tagline of &quot;What happens when three Christian
            families have children who become homosexual?&quot; has only one
            real answer: anything beyond what one might expect. Is it possible
            for all of the disparate parties involved in this civil-rights drama
            to, in the usual hackneyed phrase, stop talking <i>at</i> each other
            and start talking <i>to</i> each other instead? Dong, both wisely
            and sadly, has to leave that question unanswered -- for now.</font><font size="2" face="Verdana"><o:p>
