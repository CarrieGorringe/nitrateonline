            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>When it was released in 1974,
            &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; was more than a catchy tune. It was a
            feisty, eloquent way for Southerners to let the world know:</b></font></p>

              <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Despite
                some historical stains, people who live south of the Mason-Dixon
                should be proud of their heritage.</b></font></li>
              <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Northerners

              <li class="MsoNormal" style="mso-list:l0 level1 lfo1;tab-stops:list .5in"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Southerners,
                regardless of ethnicity, can kick out the jams.</b></font></li>
            </ul>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Even Canadian Neil Young, whose
            vitriolic 1971 tune, &quot;Southern Man&quot;, is lambasted by the
            Lynyrd Skynyrd song, has publicly admitted that the band, and their
            rebuttal, were great.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The same cannot be said for either
            Jewel Kilcher's languid cover or the movie that supports it. The
            faux folkie drones through the song like she's reciting a poem she
            doesn't like. Similarly, <i>Sweet Home Alabama</i> manages to
            perpetuate some annoying stereotypes about Dixie residents and lacks
            enough outrageousness to capture local quirks or to really entertain</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It also squanders the considerable
            talent of real-life Southern girl Reese Witherspoon (she's a
            Nashville native). In this outing, she's a transplanted Alabama
            fashion designer named Melanie Carmichael who has managed to flower
            in New York. Her first major show is a hit, and the Mayor's amiable
            son, Andrew (Patrick Dempsey), has just asked her to marry him. She
            can't accept because she's failed to get a long-desired divorce from
            her previous husband, Jake (Josh Lucas). Despite seven years of
            separation and their inability to complete a single sentence after
            starting a yelling match, they've never filled out the paperwork for
            a divorce, and Jake seems to be ignoring her requests simply to
            spite her. Despite their willingness to conduct<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>all of their quarrels at full volume, Melanie and Jake's
            battle of wills is actually rather dully played out:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>the most she does to corner and coerce him is to redecorate
            the house.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What follows isn't much fun either
            –the situation and characters are grafted from previous movies or
            sitcoms. Her parents (Fred Ward and Mary Kay Place) are merely
            recycled white-trash stereotypes without enough personality to stand
            on their own. Her father's sole accomplishment appears to revolve
            around Civil War reenactments, and Mom's constant pressuring led
            Melanie to take beauty contests a little too close to heart. Neither
            of the capable performers can do much to make the characters likable
            or even interesting. C. Jay Cox's screenplay also includes the
            requisite token gay character and equally unimaginative city folk.
            Candace Bergen is wasted as New York's shrewish, calculating mayor.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While Cox and director Andy Tennant
            manage to bungle the local-color angle and can't even seem to come
            up with interesting protagonists. In <i>Legally Blonde</i>,
            Witherspoon was downright loveable because her Elle Woods, while
            thoroughly ditzy, was anything but stupid. Elle's obsession with
            fashion was exceeded only by her concern for her friends so liking
            her was easy. On the other hand, Melanie's past betrayals don't
            endear her, and the other characters aren't endearing or real enough
            to make viewers care about their eventual reconciliation. It doesn't
            help that Cox and Tennant give Witherspoon little to do but wear
            flattering outfits. The central romantic triangle isn't much to
            leave home for, either. Melanie's dilemma is to decide which
            handsome amiably bland suitor she should embrace. Neither Lucas or
            Dempsey projects enough personality to make the battle interesting.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Tennant's last two movies <i>Ever
            After</i> and <i>Anna and the King</i> at least tried to bring fresh
            spins on old tales. This time around he plays it so safely that that
            <i>Sweet Home Alabama</i> is practically antiseptic. It's a safe bet
            that the gutsy Lynyrd Skynyrd, particularly the outspoken and now
            deceased singer Ronnie Van Zant, would not have approved.</font></td>
