</font></span><i><font size="1" face="Verdana">interview by
<a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 19 April 2002</font></i></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700"><font size="2">Fabián 
Bielinsky greets me with a warm and hearty handshake. At once relaxed and 
fervent, he's clearly pleased that his first feature film, <i>Nine Queens</i> (<i>Nueve 
reinas</i>) has won fans on the international film festival circuit, not to 
mention winning seven 2001 Argentinean Film Critics Association Awards, out of 
ten nominations, as well as the People's Choice Award from MTV Argentina and the 
Audience Award and Best Director Award at the Lleida Latin-American Film 
Festival. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">He made his first film in 
1972, while a member of the student film group at the Buenos Aires National High 
School. He worked went on to work as an assistant director on some 400 
commercials and several feature films, and spent some time teaching 
Cinematographic Production and Film Analysis. He says that teaching helped him 
to focus his own energies: &quot;When I analyzed films with pupils, it helped me to 
take the time that I couldn't always take -- to watch it, to absorb it, to 
understand it.&quot; Bielinsky brings the same kind of enthusiasm to filmmaking, and 
to talking about filmmaking. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>Cynthia Fuchs: </b>
</i>You started making films when you were thirteen? </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>Fabián Bielinsky: </b>
</i>Absolutely. It was a little before that, but they weren't &quot;films.&quot; My family 
had a Super-8 camera and so my friends and I filmed things. When I was thirteen, 
I started the first year in high school and there they had this cultural 
program, for the first time in 1972, and they had film classes, after school, 
actually. I got into these filmmaking classes, and there was a group of like 
fifteen guys. It was the first exposure I had to film classes. From the fifteen 
people, only one could direct the first exercise, an adaptation of &quot;Continuidad 
de los Parques,&quot; a short story by Julio Cortazar, and our teacher selected me. 
Not because I was any better than the others, but because I was so passionate 
about it, and he noticed that. It was like a miracle. When I first heard there 
would be this filmmaking program, I went crazy! I feel lucky that I knew from 
the very first years of my life that I knew what I wanted to do. With a lot of 
passion and a lot of pleasure -- I knew it. I know it's a privilege too, to be 
able to do it. And one has to be grateful for that. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>You 
mentioned &quot;pleasure.&quot; From all reports, it appears that you're very aware not 
only of the pleasure to be taken in watching a film, but in putting it together.
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>FB: </b></i>Yes. I 
came into this idea of pleasure, as a definition. For me it is all about 
pleasure. I know that some people do this because of possible results, money or 
fame. But that's not my particular case. From the first moment, I am doing this 
since I'm a child because I love it. I can remember the feeling of being in the 
theater: it was The Moment. I still have this feeling, this nice warm feeling, a 
vibration, when I see the logos of the studios, the mountain or the lion. I have 
a happy feeling for the two hours to come. The idea of film, of narration and 
stories on the screen, is made out of pleasure. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">And all my life, I was 
conditioned. I worked as a first AD [assistant director] on a lot of 
commercials. I didn't make the step to become a director until a couple of years 
ago. What finally pushed me into writing the script and directing was that I was 
beginning to lose the pleasure of being there as an assistant director. I was 
doing things on automatic pilot, losing the tension and the vibration. I was 
becoming an old AD. And then I wanted to recover that feeling, the excitement. I 
was lucky enough that everything happened well for me, but I was seeking that. 
There's nothing you can plan about the pleasure of the work, because shooting a 
film is hard, and can be a really bad experience. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">In this particular case, 
for <i>Nine Queens</i>, I followed my instinct and my experience as a first AD. 
Which is: the knowledge that you're going to spend your life doing things, not 
enjoying things. Going to the festivals, talking to critics, that's all nice, 
but that's a small amount of time. The great amount of time, you spend doing it 
-- it's your life. So if you're going to have a bad experience doing this, it 
doesn't matter if the reviews are great or you earn a lot of money. For your 
work, you have to have great people and great conditions, to have pleasure out 
of that. So, don't choose the best DP [director of photography], if he's a son 
of a bitch. I chose Marcelo Camorino, someone you can talk to and go out with 
for a beer after work. That was my philosophy on this, and we had a great time, 
believe me. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The actors were wonderful, 
and helped me. The acting was something that I never actually studied; I dealt 
with it in a kind of intuitive way. I had to tell them, &quot;Look, this is not 
working, but I can't tell you exactly what to do.&quot; So they could do that, they 
could say, &quot;Let's take a little out of this,&quot; or &quot;Do that,&quot; and they were great 
and funny. I know that's a cliché, to say, &quot;I hope you enjoy the film because we 
did,&quot; but this is real. I'm not going to suffer while involved in the film 
business. The very moment I realize that I'm suffering doing films, I'll go 
home. I have no trouble with that. I have no plan about the path I'm going 
through. That's bullsh*t to me. The only plan is, enjoy it while I'm doing it.
</font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>The film 
works a kind of tension when it comes to viewing pleasure, in that it delivers 
enough that is familiar that you can anticipate, but also, keeps pulling out the 
rug from under your expectations. Your characters here, for example, don't 
really &quot;develop&quot; in a usual way. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>FB: </b></i>Yes. I 
make you believe that we are going to go from A to D, but then we go from A to 
E, then back to C. This film is about manipulation. And my own thinking in 
writing it was to cause the audience to be -- emotion-wise, information-wise, 
and identification-wise -- at specific points. And then I wanted to shock 
everybody at particular moments, to let people think they could think ahead, and 
then contradict that. I had the advantage, which is that most of the films today 
are so predictable, so by the numbers, that it's very easy to fool somebody. In 
terms of character, I didn't want anyone to predict anything. I wanted to have 
an internal contradiction, so the moment you start thinking, &quot;Okay, he's going 
to do this,&quot; that the guy is going to be friends, but you open a door and out 
comes a monster. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>Which is 
appealing as well as startling, because often, pleasure is about being able to 
predict. They say formula films are popular because of that in certain cultural 
moments, say, in times of crisis.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>FB: </b></i>The film, 
when it begins, looks like a buddy film, a particularly predictable structure. 
You know the ending, the way the relationship will evolve. Which is the most 
terrible thing. You can always have a new permutation of the same pieces, but if 
you know how it will end, that's it, the film is over. So, as soon as you see 
these very different characters decide to work together in the first scene, you 
think, &quot;Okay, that's what's going to happen.&quot; And this is tricky -- it looks 
like a buddy film, but they will never go through this relational path. I like 
to change the previous ideas. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>I'm also 
wondering about the physical spaces that define this relationship.&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><b></b><font size="2"><i><b>FB: </b></i>
Yes, the hotel is the perfect &quot;null space.&quot; I really thought about this, the 
relationship between these guys [Juan (Gastón Pauls) and Marcos (Ricardo Darín)] 
and their surroundings. Them and the street, them and the hotel. With them and 
the street, it was a comfortable relationship: they live there, the street is 
supporting them and protecting them, it is water for fish. How to create that 
feeling? I tried to blend them into the scene. Whenever I could, I used hidden 
cameras, in trucks across the street, working with the long lens. They knew the 
lines, of course, but I didn't want the actors to rehearse too much. So I say 
&quot;Action,&quot; and the actors had to work in the middle of the street, no lights, no 
visible cameras, no nothing. They were the characters. And the cameramen didn't 
know exactly where the actors would stop, so they had to be very quick on their 
feet. I loved that. I wanted to mix them into the environment. </font></span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">And then this relationship 
between them and their surroundings is completely contradicted, when they get to 
the hotel. They are uncomfortable. They know that someone is looking over them 
all the time, the security people or the clients. This is not their own 
environment. So it's like they're aware all the time of where they are. So I 
hope this produces this little vibration all the time. Mainly, this tension is 
visible through the sister, [Valeria (Leticia Brédice)], who works there. When 
she acts, she's doing two different jobs -- one is her real feelings, and the 
other is her response to her surroundings. She cannot express herself; she's 
doing a picture of herself to her employers. She's mad at her brother, but has 
to be so restrained. I love that twisting, that doubled response. </font></span>
</p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>Can you 
talk about the family situation, with Marcos and Valeria, complicates the buddy 
story, with Marcos and Juan? </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>FB: </b></i>There are 
a lot of things to say about that, but my only regret is that I had to give a 
lot of information to make this puzzle understandable for the audience. So I had 
to emphasize a lot of things about how Marcos cheated his family, background 
information that took us out of the immediate present. What I love actually is 
to have two or three characters and let the audience just feel that there is 
something there, a history, that is not explained. I'm only going to tell you 
the minimal amount of things. Remember this Robert Altman film, <i>A Wedding</i>? 
At the end, the old lady is dying and her husband, Vittorio Gassman, is there. 
And she finally dies. All through the film you are wondering how come these two 
are married, this low-class Italian guy with this high-class woman older than 
him? And then when she's dead -- I saw it when I was fourteen, but I still 
remember -- but he puts this napkin over his arm and says, &quot;Madame, I hope you 
have been well served,&quot; or something like that. And then you know, this guy is a 
waiter. Nobody tells you anything; it's just an attitude and a napkin on the 
arm. I love that! </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">In <i>Nine Queens</i>, I 
had to give more information, but I enjoy that idea. And that's a reason that I 
used just twenty-four hours or so in the life of these guys. I knew that before 
I knew the story. I wanted to do it in one day, no more. It sounds like a 
limitation, but it's a challenge. It allows the audience to interpret what went 
on in the rest of their lives. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>Given 
that the characters are all lying to one another at some level, how were you 
thinking about setting up a narrative, based on lies but also getting at some 
kind of truth?</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>FB: </b></i>It is a 
tricky game. As I thought about it, I wasn't adding information or stories, but 
multiplying. The informational structure is one thing, and then the relationship 
between these two guys who lie to each other, that's something else. They don't 
trust each other but they give each other information, which is a way of giving 
information to the audience -- it's multiplication, because it involves 
information from two people who lie to each other and to the audience. In a way, 
it's a game, really amusing, a guessing game. Or like a card game: I show you, I 
don't show you. Some things are the outcome of the combination of these 
elements, which can be unexpected. It is like working with materials that you 
like -- whatever you do with them, there is always an enjoyable outcome. </font>
</span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>It sounds 
like there is some tension involved too, in that the plot has to be so precisely 
laid out, yet there was some flexibility in the production, some play, as to 
where the actors would end up in a shot, for instance. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>FB: </b></i>Well, 
there's a main contrast there, and that's because the plot is artificial, 
perfectly driven and drawn. Actually, I would say that I found the end of the 
film because I could feel this artificiality at the beginning. I was wondering 
when I was writing at the beginning, &quot;Why is this so artificial?&quot; and then I 
knew, and I felt, &quot;Of course!&quot; I saw how it came together. Every single problem 
I had in the first twenty pages, I saw that they would come together. And I 
wanted to contrast this artificiality of the plot with the form of the film, the 
way it would look, with camera and lighting. So I decided to do this kind of 
available lighting, which was difficult for the DP; he doesn't work that way 
every day. He suffered a lot! I told him at the start, that we were going to do 
it this way, that &quot;You should pretend that you aren't there.&quot; He made a 
sacrifice in that way, and I am so grateful. He was trying to understand a mood 
and convey that, which is, in the end, more interesting than showing your stuff.
</font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>Do you 
want to continue writing and directing, both? </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>FB: </b></i>In 
Argentina, if you get into production on something, most of the time it is 
because you write your own stuff. There are no freelance writers, looking for a 
director. If you don't write, it's rare that you will come to do a film. It's 
like you write in self-defense. You have no other choice. That said, I wanted to 
write this film, but it does have a context -- that's the way the industry was. 
Now, because everything has been so lovely and nice for me in the past year, I 
have this connection with the film industry here in the States, and they are 
sending me scripts, so that's a possibility. But my main advantage is that I'm 
not looking for it. I can do Argentinean films for the rest of my life and I'll 
be happy. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>The 
funding situation is looking bleak right now. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>FB: </b></i>Yes, 
we're in trouble now. But I have this privilege, and I can have financing from 
the United States, or Europe, or Spain. But our industry is financed through the 
government, the Argentine Film Institute. It's likely that for the rest of this 
year we'll have trouble producing. But I don't have to step into Hollywood. I 
learned that there's a relationship between the amount of money they invest and 
the amount of control they want to take over your film. So the less money, the 
less control. I'm not interested in big, I'm interested in pleasure. </font>
