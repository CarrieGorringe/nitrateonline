<p><font face="Verdana"><font size="2"><b>When you think of the following great 
'60s and '70s tunes: &quot;Stubborn Kind of Fellow,&quot; &quot;Ain't No Mountain High Enough&quot; 
and &quot;Mercy Mercy Me,&quot; the name Marvin Gaye easily comes to mind. It's his voice 
dominating the tunes, and he was also a nimble pianist and capable songwriter to 
boot.&nbsp; But, as the new documentary <i>Standing in the Shadows</i> by director 
Paul Justman of Motown reveals, he and the other vocalists who churned out hits 
on an astonishing basis were part of a larger equation. The fist song would 
sound hollow without pianist Joe Hunter, the second rocks with Uriel Jones' 
subtle but driving drumbeat and the last song features a delicate bassline from
</b></font><b><font size="2">Bob Babbit.</font></b></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">These fellows were all part of Motown's gifted 
house band, the Funk Brothers, who played on an astronomical number of memorable 
hit songs until the label moved from Detroit to Los Angeles in 1972. <i>Standing 
in the Shadows of Motown</i> centers around a scorching reunion concert given in 
Detroit in 2000 featuring all seven of the then surviving members of the group 
teaming with a diverse vocalists like Bootsy Collins, Joan Osbourne, Gerald 
Levert and Chaka Kahn. It also allows the band to recall how the sessions were 
recorded in Motown's legendary Studio A (a.k.a. The Snake Pit) and includes the 
only known video footage of seminal bassist James Jamerson. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The documentary is partially inspired by the 
book of the same name written by <i>Allan &quot;Dr. Licks&quot; Slutsky</i>. Slutsky 
served as a producer on the documentary and the soundtrack albums, helped 
organize to concert and even played guitar with the band at the event. Slutsky's 
effort have a chilling sense of urgency because drummer Richard &quot;Pistol&quot; Allan 
and keyboardist Johnny Griffith has since passed on.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Fortunately, Slutsky, Babbit, Jones, and Hunter 
were all able to make it to FilmFest Kansas City last month to talk about a 
their tunes, their lives and the film in a roundtable interview. Listening to 
the four of them, it was obvious that age had not diminished their almost 
radar-like way of communicating. When one question arose, they would finish each 
other's answers. To get the guys started, I handed them my Marvin Gaye CD.

<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Dan Lybarger:</font></b></i><font size="2"><i>
</i>I just wanted to hand to see if this might jog your memories.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Bob Babbit:</font></b></i><font size="2"><i>
</i>This does right away [pointing to a photo of a bespectacled Gaye wearing 
sweats]. I remember several times coming into work and seeing him in his jogging 
clothes. </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Uriel Jones:</font></b></i><font size="2"><i>
</i>I can picture him like this a lot of times we'd be staying in hotels. You'd 
look out the hotel windows, and you'd see Marvin outside any time of the morning 
walking by himself, looking like he was in deep thought. I remember that <i>very</i> 
well.</font></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">DL [to Allan &quot;Dr. Licks&quot; Slutsky]:</font></b></i><font size="2"><i>
</i>It must have been tricky to get all of these people back together.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Allan &quot;Dr. Licks&quot; Slutsky:</font></b></i><font size="2"><i>
</i>Not only had they not played together in decades, but some of them hadn't 
played their instruments for decades. </font></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Joe Messina, for instance, when Motown moved in 
'72 stopped playing guitar and took up chromatic harmonica. A month before the 
movie started (shooting), he picked up his guitar from under his bed and got his 
chops together again. Eddie Willis hadn't played in 10 years. He was the other 
guitar player. He was on the road with the Four Tops for twenty years after 
Motown had left Detroit. When he stopped touring with the Tops, he stopped 
playing for ten years. The other guys were all playing around that time.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">One of the reasons it was able to happen was 
that Motown was always a really easy place for these guys to play. Most R&amp;B 
house bands, their musicians' background was R&amp;B, a little bit of rock 'n' roll, 
blues. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">These guys hand all that, and they were also 
extremely accomplished jazz musicians, which takes a much higher level of 
dexterity and harmonic knowledge. So when it came to playing Motown, it was like 
a weightlifter who can lift 500 pounds being called upon to lift 200 pounds. So, 
it was easy.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The reason Motown had the sound that it did was 
because it was so effortless and it swung so hard. Booker T and the MGs were one 
of the great house band of the '60s, but they didn't have a jazz background. 
Their music is funky, it rocks but it doesn't swing. To swing, you've got to be 
a jazz musician.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">A lot of the Motown songs were shuffles like 
&quot;How Sweet It Is&quot; with James Jamerson [imitates Jamerson's bassline]. It's got a 
deep swing to it. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You've had this long layoff, and if they were 
called upon after a long layoff to play jazz, it wouldn't happen. They were 
called upon to play something that was extremely easy for them. It was tough 
this time around. They didn't have the chops that they did, and there were a lot 
of health issues, but that was the reason it was able to happen.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Yuriel, for instance, and the other drummer 
Richard &quot;Pistol&quot; Allan, who passed away, neither of these guys had any business 
playing this gig. They didn't tell me how sick they were. Yuriel needed a 
quintuple bypass, and he had it a few days after the shooting. &quot;Pistol&quot; was 
dying of lung cancer. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">They were risking their lives doing it. It was 
so important to them. This was their lives. This was their chance to say to the 
world, &quot;This is what I did.&quot; They'd never get that chance again, so they didn't 
want to miss it. Thank God for one, and unfortunately for the other one. I think 
&quot;Pistol&quot; if he had a choice would rather have himself go out that way with his 
legacy preserved than miss the opportunity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Jones:</font></b></i><font size="2"><i>
</i>It looked so hard for Allan Slutsky to be getting us together. That was the 
easy part. His job was <i>convincing</i> us that we could do this. [The room 
fills with laughter]. Because the first day of our rehearsals, you talk about 
some strange feelings. I was scared to death. I was imagining what this was 
going to sound like. It was scary with all us coming together at the same time 
because this guy hadn't played in so many years. And that guy hadn't played in 
so many years. After a few days, it just came in. Everything gelled and came 
back to us. </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Slutsky:</font></b></i><font size="2"><i>
</i>I went in on the first day not knowing if they could still play. I had 
fourteen years on the project at that point because I had three years writing 
the book and eleven years searching for funding. So did I just throw out 
fourteen years of my life? I didn't know. In five minutes, we were doing &quot;Heatwave&quot; 
[sung by Joan Osbourne]. This whole situation has been a situation of being able 
to exhale because we lost two guys along the way. Robert White [whose guitar 
licks opened The Temptations' &quot;My Girl&quot;] died before I could get funding. I was 
fighting a biological time clock. After we had finally wrapped it, their legacy 
is finally preserved now. </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Jones:</font></b></i><font size="2"><i>
</i>He's not saying that we're <i>old</i>! </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Slutsky:</font></b></i><font size="2"><i>
</i>What did you tell me what Earl's [Van Dyke] wife said?</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Jones:</font></b></i><font size="2"><i>
</i>Earl's wife said, &quot;This guy Slutsky, there's only one thing I can say. He's 
got to be crazy white man or a rich white man [they all crack up].</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Hunter:</font></b></i><font size="2"><i>
</i>I knew he wasn't crazy. </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Babbit: </font></b></i>
<font size="2">We knew he wasn't rich! </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Hunter:</font></b></i><font size="2"><i>
</i>He called me, and said &quot;I got a retainer for you.&quot; It shocked me, and I 
looked and said let me get out and see him. I knew he wasn't crazy because he 
had a retainer in hand. </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Babbit:</font></b></i><font size="2"><i>
</i>Joe [Messina] made a thirty-minute trip in about ten minutes! You know how 
Mohammad Ali said, &quot;I can turn off the light and be in bed before it gets dark.&quot; 
It was like before your voice faded on the phone. It was twenty miles away.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Hunter:</font></b></i><font size="2"><i>
</i>And then I knew &quot;Heat Wave&quot; because I was steadily looking at that check.</font></font><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">DL:</font></b></i><font size="2"><i>
</i>Because James Jamerson is such a focal point for the film and the history of 
Motown is there not that much video footage of him playing? </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Slutsky: </font></b></i>
<font size="2">It's ALL in the movie.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">DL:</font></b></i><font size="2"><i>
</i>That's it?</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Slutsky:</font></b></i><font size="2"><i>
</i>There's quite a few clips. There's one with Marvin Gaye with &quot;What's Going 
On?&quot; There's one where he's playing behind The Temptations. We couldn't use the 
sound for licensing reasons, so we used another song, but he's actually playing 
&quot;My Girl.&quot; You can see his one finger called &quot;the hook&quot; really well.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Babbit:</font></b></i><font size="2"><i>
</i>There's not enough of it in there.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Slutsky:</font></b></i><font size="2"><i>
</i>There's not a lot of footage of these guys. That's one of the reasons we had 
to use recreation scenes because there's not a lot of archival footage. Nobody 
cared about them that way or thought there'd be any value to it. Any time [The 
Funk Brothers] were in some Motown footage, it was incidental because they were 
shooting the [vocal] band, and [The Funk Brothers] were in the background.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">DL [to Babbit, Jones, and Hunter]:</font></b></i><font size="2"><i>
</i>Is it gratifying to finally be a headliner?</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Hunter: </font></b></i>
<font size="2">Yes, it is.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Jones: </font></b></i>
<font size="2">The main thing is: put our names and faces on the record. </font>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Babbit:</font></b></i><font size="2"> 
When I moved out of Detroit moved to East Coast and went on to Nashville, I got 
in touch with a lot of musicians, and it's really hard when you're hearing 
stories about certain musicians that claimed to have played on those records 
because there wasn't any credits on the records for a long time. That's the 
hardest part. Joe Hunter's got the greatest story about Chicago and meeting &quot;Joe 
Hunter.&quot; Go ahead, Joe.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Hunter:</font></b></i><font size="2"> 
I knew a producer at Chess Records in Chicago, and he called me and said, &quot;Come 
on over and do a few tunes with us.&quot; When I got there, he came and got me and 
smiled and everything and said, &quot;I want to introduce you to somebody.&quot; I went up 
to this guy he introduced me to. [The producer] said, &quot;This is Joe Hunter.&quot;
</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I said, &quot;You're the Joe Hunter that worked at 
Motown?&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">He said, &quot;Yes. Yes. Yes.&quot;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;You did 'Pride and Joy' with Marvin.&quot; </font>
</p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;Yes. Yes. Yes.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I named a few other tunes, and he said, &quot;You 
didn't give me your name.&quot; And I said, &quot;Well, I'm Joe Hunter, too.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">He said, &quot;You sure aren't working Motown. Come 
here let me talk with you. I had to get this job, but I had to use a name.&quot; But 
he could play. He could actually play good. Anyway, he said he had impressed the 
people in order to get the job. I said, &quot;I'll forgive you for the fraud or 
whatever you had to do—whatever you call that using somebody else's name. But 
don't do it no more. You can go by your own name now. You've got the job, you're 
here, and they like you. He was another Joe Hunter. He was me. I met myself.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Jones:</font></b></i><font size="2"> 
Tell him the end of it, Joe. </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Hunter:</font></b></i><font size="2"> 
Huh?</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Jones:</font></b></i><font size="2"> 
Tell him about, &quot;Do you have the money from the sessions?&quot; </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Hunter:</font></b></i><font size="2"> 
I've been through a lot of experiences like that. </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Slutsky:</font></b></i><font size="2"> 
These guys have been in the vocabulary for Modern R&amp;B. James Jamerson, in 
particular, was the first virtuoso of the Fender bass. The Fender bass was only 
invented in 1954. For about the first decade, nobody knew what to do with it. 
You actually saw Fender bassists holding the instrument vertically like an 
upright bass because it really didn't have a personality yet. It was a 
newfangled contraption. They didn't even know if it would make it. It was like 
the Chapman Stick, a new instrument that never really made it.</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">So, [Jamerson] was the first guy to give it any 
personality because everybody was basically doing cocktail bass. Boom, boom, 
boom. And all of the sudden you get this doing (imitating Jamerson's more 
intricate sound), all these crazy lines. He invented the vocabulary as these 
guys did. Yuriel, Benny Benjamin, or &quot;Pistol&quot; Allen, Earl or Joe came up with.
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I'll give you an example. In the '70s, on the 
show <i>Barney Miller</i>, you got [hums the basslines]. That bassline is note 
for note &quot;You're All I Need to Get By&quot; from the bridge. You go into the '80s, 
and you've got &quot;Maneater&quot; by Hall and Oates. That's &quot;You Can't Hurry Love&quot; by 
James Jamerson. You go into the '90s. You've got &quot;Love Shack.&quot; That's &quot;Nowhere 
to Run&quot; by James Jamerson. They've been using these guys' ideas for decades. You 
can't escape it. It's like trying to speak the English language without the 
words &quot;the&quot; and &quot;and.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Hunter:</font></b></i><font size="2"> 
I played with three rap groups, just recording with them as long as they pay me. 
Just don't mention my name. I don't want no critics. I don't like today's music, 
the rap thing, you know.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">DL:</font></b></i><font size="2"><i>
</i>It's interesting that you chose singers like Ben Harper and Joan Osbourne 
who weren't necessarily associated with the Motown label.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Jones:</font></b></i><font size="2"><i>
</i>The reason we did that was because is that the movie is about everybody you 
talk to and say &quot;What's the Motown sound?&quot; they say everything but the 
musicians. Even in the movie there's a part in there where I explain and say, 
&quot;You hear some people may say it's the food. I'd like to see somebody take some 
pork chops or hamburgers, throw it down the floor on floor of the studio count 
to four and get a hit!&quot; We wasn't going to use no Motown artists, but we still 
got the Motown sound. We used to say you could take a chicken off the street and 
wring its neck in the studio and with The Funk Brothers, you've got a hit!
</font></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The basic Motown sound was the musicians. In 
order to prove it, we used artists that wasn't associated with Motown. And they 
sung Motown songs, and it still had the Motown sound.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Slutsky:</font></b></i><font size="2"><i>
</i>Take the Supremes. The Supremes only sang on Supremes songs. They didn't 
sing on The Four Tops; they didn't sing on the Vandellas' [songs]. Stevie 
[Wonder] didn't sing with the Tops. Probably the busiest musician at Motown was 
Smokey [Robinson] because he was a producer, songwriter and an artist. You take 
all of the tracks he was involved in, maybe forty percent. It's still not the 
other sixty percent. </font></font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">These guys [The Funk Brothers] are on 
everything. The only continuity on the Motown sound was these guys. When most of 
the Motown acts went out on the road, Berry Gordy from the very beginning had a 
very different concept. He was looking for Vegas. He wanted this high energy.
</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You take a song like [The Temptations'] &quot;Get 
Ready&quot; [hums the laid-back but firm bassline]. When you see The Temptations play 
that live [he hums a sound that is quicker but has no swing], it had all these 
blaring horns because he wanted that high energy, but the Motown sound wasn't 
about energy. It was about good head bopping music, and that sound came from 
these guys. No other musicians could get it. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The first thing that happened to me when I came 
up to Detroit for the first time, I had never heard any of them play live. I 
went with &quot;Pistol&quot; to club. &quot;Pistol&quot; was a very flamboyant. There was a singer 
named…What was his name? [gets a tip from the others] Norman Thrasher was 
singing. This guy's right in the middle of a sensitive ballad. &quot;Pistol&quot; walks 
into the place and goes, &quot;Norman Thrasher! This Pistol's in the house!&quot; 
[Thrasher] stopped what he was doing and brought &quot;Pistol&quot; on the stage. &quot;Ladies 
and Gentlemen, the great Motown drummer.&quot; He started to play &quot;Heatwave,&quot; because 
&quot;Pistol&quot; was the shuffle guy. My reaction as a musician was that I had played 
Motown songs for thirty years now. I can't tell you how many weddings and bar 
mitzvahs that I've played the obligatory Motown medley, &quot;Dancing in the 
Streets,&quot; &quot;My Girl&quot; and &quot;Heatwave&quot; The second I heard &quot;Pistol,&quot; I said &quot;That's 
it!&quot; I had played these songs a million times, and this was the first time 
because it wasn't a sound was the creation and the sole property of a very small 
group of musicians. It's proven by the fact that when they went out to LA and 
didn't use these musicians, they lost it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Hunter:</font></b></i><font size="2"><i>
</i>The artists was dubbed then [in the later Motown recordings]. They recorded 
the band tracks a lot of times first, and then they dubbed the other part.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Babbit:</font></b></i><font size="2"><i>
</i>A lot of times you never saw the artist. </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Slutsky:</font></b></i><font size="2"><i>
</i>In the early days, they didn't have enough tracks. Everybody cut it live. 
Once they got into eight tracks, these guys cut first, and then the artist came 
in. Songwriters didn't know what artists they were working for. </font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Jones: </font></b></i>
<font size="2">With&quot;Twenty-Five Miles,&quot; my drum solo in there, Edwin Starr is 
singing my drum solo, he's singing along with me. If I hadn't done that solo, 
he'd have probably done something else there. </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Babbit:</font></b></i><font size="2"><i>
</i>That was the genius of some of the producers. If we were cutting something 
and they had the idea for the song and they heard something that happened in the 
song. For example, on some of the Supremes tunes they'd hear something in 
Jamerson's basslines they gave to the horns to play. They would never have had 
the horn part as part of the arrangement prior to cutting that track. Once they 
cut that track and they felt that groove, if it wasn't the actual artist, the 
producer might say, &quot;Yeah. Yeah.&quot; </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><font size="2">Slutsky: </font></b><font size="2">In 
a lot of other places, guys would just read charts [or prewritten arrangements]. 
At Motown, they had very minimal, just bass chord charts. If you tried to write 
something for a James Jamerson, he'd laugh at you and say, &quot;You want me to play 
this bullsh*t?&quot; </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Jones: </font></b></i>
<font size="2">He did that a lot of times. He took the [prewritten] music and 
throw it on the floor.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Hunter: </font></b></i>
<font size="2">He'd take the music, throw it on the floor and <i>step on it</i>.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><b><font size="2">Slutsky: </font></b></i>
<font size="2">The soundtrack is out in the stores. We worked it into a 2-CD 
deal. The second CD will be out in January [of 2003]. What we're doing is in the 
vaults at Universal, they have all the original multitracks. There's two tracks 
on [the current soundtrack], &quot;You Just Keep Me Hanging On&quot; and &quot;Bernadette.&quot; 
We've got sixteen vault tracks like the Diana Ross version of &quot;Ain't No 
Mountain,&quot; &quot;I Was Made to Love Her,&quot; &quot;My Guy.&quot; We're remixing them from a 
musician's standing, which means no vocals. Listen to the melody on the piano. 
Listen to the melody on the bass. We're pushing faders and mute buttons on each 
song. All of these incredible parts have been buried for decades under this 
sound. You might get this full orchestration. All of the sudden you hit the mute 
button, and it's just Uriel and Jamerson, and it's just incredible. These are 
songs that we all know so well, and it's just unbelievable.</font></font></p>

<font size="2">Can I add one thing? Mostly we've been talking about the music, 
but the other half of the film is what makes it so significant. One half of the 
film is the music is when you have a monumental contribution of this size, it's 
significant because these guys have had the impact of The Beatles although they 
were faceless. But these are magnetic riveting characters, and this movie 
explores their life outside just music. The story of these guys as a social unit 
outside of just music—the story of James Jamerson, who was a tormented genius, 
it was very cinematic to put the story around Jamerson because it's the ultimate 
sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll story. </font></font></p>
