            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">How many times can Robert De Niro 
            play a cop? &quot;I dunno what else to do but be a cop,&quot; his character 
            says at one point in <i>City by the Sea</i>, where he is once again 
            playing a police detective, and, once again, he is our stolid vessel 
            of justice, his grave face flickering with signs of introspection. 
            Pauline Kael wrote how, after seeing <i>Awakenings</i> in 1991, De 
            Niro seemed to be doing the same things over and over again, and, in 
            the last 10 years since then, with few exceptions (his amiably 
            scruffy, then suddenly explosive, appearance in <i>Jackie Brown</i>; 
            the clownish gangster in <i>Analyze This</i>), those words seem to 
            have been prescient.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yet, De Niro manages to squeeze out 
            some fresh juice from what one expects to be a standard role. Here, 
            he plays Vince LaMarca, a New York City police detective who is 
            assigned to investigate a murder that occurred in Long Beach, near 
            the once-thriving boardwalk and casino that have now become deserted 
            and frightfully gone to seed. The victim, a drug dealer, was killed 
            by Joey (James Franco), who is Vince's son by a previous marriage, 
            and whom he has barely seen, if at all, during the past 14 years. 
            Vince's attempts to bring the lad in &quot;safe,&quot; without the use of any 
            force, cause a whole number of bad things to tumble out of the past 
            back into the open -- how Vince's own father was himself convicted, 
            and executed, for a murder, and the ugly circumstances that caused 
            him to leave his former wife (Patti LuPone, in a stringent, and 
            excellent, performance) and young son. And Vince has wanted none of 
            this to cloud the relationship he now has, a caring and loving one, 
            with a new woman, Michelle (Frances McDormand).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While the film is based on actual 
            events (written about in an &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine article, &quot;Mark of a 
            Murderer,&quot; by Mike McAlary), the director Michael Caton-Jones works 
            to elevate the material from becoming dimensionally flat (much as he 
            did previously in the comedy <i>Doc Hollywood</i>), mostly by 
            getting good work from the performers. James Russo -- who did the 
            miraculous, last year, with his brilliant lead performance in the 
            cable film <i>James Dean</i> -- seems to have frozen and emaciated 
            himself to play Joey, who's chasing after dreams of cleaning himself 
            up as a junkie and doing a fix-all relocation to Key West, Florida. 
            Russo plays Joey so that we can see a certain quality in him that 
            would inspire us to genuinely want to haul him out of the state that 
            he's in, even though one look at Joey's hollowed-out eyes tells us 
            the attempt could very well be futile. And De Niro fills out his 
            character in the second half of the film with unexpected flashes of 
            parental anguish and rue. Vince is essentially a pragmatist, but he 
            tries to reestablish contact with his son, much as he would try 
            talking a criminal into disarming himself and turning himself over 
            to custody rather than doing something rash. When he sees Joey 
            suddenly, at the last minute, slip out of his grasp (a moment 
            greatly aided by some excellent cinematography by Karl Walter 
            Lindenlaub), age and desolation register nakedly on De Niro's face. 
            He becomes a weathered father and a weathered man, blasted through 
            and through. It's an aspect we haven't seen in his work before, and 
            it's welcome.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film's later sections unravel 
            into standard, predictable stuff, but the picture sticks with an 
            ending that is more dramatically credible than a sop to the 
            audience. All in all, <i>City by the Sea</i> emerges damp, but 
            afloat.</font></td>
