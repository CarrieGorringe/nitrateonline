<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700"><font size="2">Peter 
Bogdanovich comes packing several bottles of distilled water. He has a long day 
ahead of him, with a full schedule of interviews leading up to this evening, 
when his new movie, <i>The Cat's Meow</i>, opens the Washington DC International 
Film Festival. For a man who's spent so much of his early career in the 
spotlight, the sixty-two-year-old Bogdanovich is pleasantly un-in-love with 
himself. This doesn't mean he's not elegant, or attentive to details of demeanor 
and language, or even that he's not prideful. But he does appear to appreciate 
the simple (but also complex) fact of being alive. He has unexpected humility.
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Once touted as a brilliant 
young artist, whose <i>The Last Picture Show</i> (1971) evidenced both a 
youthful sensibility and tender nostalgia, Bogdanovich counted among his friends 
Orson Welles and John Ford. He went on to make <i>Paper Moon</i> (1973) and <i>
Mask</i> (1985), as well as some films that were less well received (</font></span><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">At 
Long Last Love</font></span></i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
[1975] and&nbsp; <i>Nickelodeon</i> [1976]). And, of course, he would marry (and 
eventually divorce) his girlfriend Dorothy Stratten's half-sister Louise, some 
years after Dorothy's brutal murder by her ex-husband (recalled in his book, <i>
The Killing of the Unicorn</i>). </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">More recently, Bogdanovich 
is probably best known as a director of cable movies (</font></span><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Rescuers: 
Two Women</font></span></i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
[1997]), the wise and respectful commentator for DVDs of films by directors like 
Welles or John Ford, and in his recurring role on <i>The Sopranos</i>, as Dr. 
Melfi's shrink, Dr. Elliot Kupferberg.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i>The Cat's Meow</i> is a 
deft picture that examines Hollywood scandal from the inside. It's based on a 
story that Bogdanovich first heard from Welles while interviewing him for a 
book, <i>This Is Orson Welles</i>; Steven Peros' script came to him 
coincidentally. Framed as a flashback by writer Elinor Glyn (Joanna Lumley), the 
film takes places on the yacht of William Randolph Hearst (Edward Herrmann), in 
1924, when the producer Thomas Ince (Cary Elwes) takes ill and a few days later, 
dies mysteriously. The film takes up the most persistent rumor about what 
happened during the cruise, namely, that Hearst shot Ince, believing him to be 
Charlie Chaplin (Eddie Izzard), who was romancing Hearst's girlfriend, Marion 
Davies (Kirsten Dunst). </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">We begin with a brief 
discussion of my own experience teaching <i>Last Picture Show</i> in an 
introduction to film class, which, I informed him, surprised students by its 
relevance to them. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>Peter Bogdanovich 
(sighing, lightly): </b></i>It's amazing that there's no film culture in America 
anymore. There used to be a lot of film culture. When I was interviewing Orson 
Welles, when <i>The Last Picture Show</i> came out, in 1971, we talked about <i>
Citizen Kane</i>, which was then thirty years old. It seemed like a long time 
ago. Now, <i>Picture Show</i> is thirty years old, and it doesn't seem like such 
a long time, on some level. Time, according to that old cliché, is deeply 
relative. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>Cynthia Fuchs: </b>
</i>Did Welles have a sense that films in the '70s were not living up to what 
films thirty years before had been?</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>PB: </b></i>Yeah. But 
so did I. what I thought we were all trying to do then was something different 
than what happens now. And it was different. It was a whole burst of youth at 
the end of the '60s and into the '70s. Orson felt that as the '70s wore on, that 
we were debasing our audience, and that eventually we would all be stuck with 
what happened with the fall of the Roman empire, which was that the 
entertainment was sex and violence, murder and killing and sexual diversions. We 
aren't too far from there. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>Do you 
think that with the &quot;market&quot; so wide now, with room for films as well as product 
-- in festivals, on cable, and even in theaters -- that young filmmakers have 
opportunities? </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>PB: </b></i>Yes, I 
think <i>Picture Show</i> would have been an art picture today. It sort of was 
then; only a major studio picked it up for release, slowly. But then all films 
were released somewhat slowly in those days, except exploitation films. And that 
didn't change until the mid-'70s, with <i>Godfather</i> and <i>Jaws</i>. What 
happens now is you've got to open the picture on the first weekend and do big 
grosses; otherwise you're gone. Lions Gate is handling this film on a platform, 
which is more old-fashioned. We opened <i>Picture Show</i> in New York and Los 
Angeles, it was in one theater only in each city, not even three, but <i>one</i>. 
It makes sense, because the less theaters you have, the more sure you are that 
you're going to have a packed house. And a packed house is always a better 
audience than a half-empty one. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>The &quot;art 
houseness&quot; of <i>Cat's Meow</i> seems to me partly thematic. It's a tough 
picture, character-wise: no one trusts anyone else, throughout. </font></span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>PB: </b></i>It's 
funny that you said that. I didn't actually think of that consciously. I just 
took it as part of the general atmosphere of the show business, or that kind of 
show business. But it's true, nobody trusts anyone. I did sort of take it like 
that was normal -- it shows you how deeply enmeshed I am in it. </font></span>
</p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>Talk a 
little about the flashback structure. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>PB: </b></i>When I 
got the script, it began at the funeral [for Thomas Ince] and ended at the 
funeral, but before it went to the yacht, there was about forty pages 
introducing Chaplin in his studio, Marion in her studio, and Louella [Parsons, 
the Hearst gossip columnist, played in the film by Jennifer Tilly]. I didn't 
think we needed all that. I thought the unity would be more interesting if we 
went from the funeral to the yacht, and back to the funeral at the end. I like 
the flashback idea, particularly when we figured out we would shoot the 
beginning and the end of the film in black and white. It was a practical 
solution to a problem we had. The fact that I artistically thought it would be 
dynamite for the picture, I didn't really share that with everyone, because 
producers tend to like it better if it's a practical solution to a problem, 
rather than an artistic one. I don't know why [laughs]. However, I must say, on 
Mike Pasternak's behalf -- he was one of the producers -- that I did share with 
him that I thought it would be as effective as hell, going from black and white 
to color, and going from the coffin to the yacht. It's an obvious parallel, but 
I thought it would work. And the studio was worried about it because they had a 
deal for a one -hundred percent color movie, and this was going to be ninety 
percent color. But the problem was that we were shooting in Berlin, and there 
was no way to make Berlin in December look like L.A. in the summer. The light 
wouldn't be right. We solved that [snaps! his fingers] easily with black and 
white. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>The 
flashback is also tricky for narrative, in terms of giving viewers information 
Elinor might not know. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>PB: </b></i>Well, 
yes, that's a license you take. And we did it. I love the narration Steve wrote.
</font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>I was 
fascinated as well by the way the film looks at &quot;scandal,&quot; not as something 
titillating that happens to other people, but as a series of events that befall 
specific people, or characters, here. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><b></b><font size="2"><i><b>PB: </b></i>
Yes, &quot;scandal&quot; is something that people say about someone else. It isn't how 
people feel when it's happening to them. It's something else, it's their life. 
It seems very contemporary, doesn't it? Scandal, cover-up, disgrace. Everybody 
is interested in all of that. People live very difficult lives, most people, and 
they're on kind of a treadmill, and maybe the scandal that happens to the 
celebrated and famous, gives them some vicarious pleasure, and makes their own 
lives more interesting. I mean, I've had it myself, being in the spotlight, but 
I notice that when there's some hot story going on, I read about it, and tend to 
think it enriches my life. It doesn't, really: it depletes it on a certain 
level. But you think it gives you something to think about and talk about, 
beyond the routine of your own life. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>Yes, it 
creates a community of some kind, when &quot;everyone&quot; can talk about the same thing.
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>PB: </b></i>Yes, like 
the weather. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>The film 
is attentive to how the characters deal with these crises so moment to moment. I 
was struck in particular by the shots of Kirsten Dunst's face when she has to 
choose, between Chaplin and Hearst. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>PB: </b></i>
Complicated, what goes on there with her. That was a difficult scene, and we 
didn't get it right, in the writing or anything, until right before we made it. 
There were a number of scenes like that. There were many scenes that we didn't 
touch, that we shot as Steve wrote them. But some we had to redo, and think out. 
I kept thinking that we ought to have a scene with the three of them, and there 
wasn't one. There was a separate scene where Hearst threatens Chaplin, and 
another where he threatens her. And none of us -- the actors and I -- thought 
those scenes worked. The interesting thing was, when we got into that scene, we 
found that Marion had very little to say. And Kirsten was very smart. She said, 
&quot;I don't think she'd say anything. I think she'd just listen.&quot; And she doesn't, 
until Hearst leaves. But she has a lot of reactions -- I think there's more 
reaction time on her than the people talking. And to me, Marion's he heart of 
the movie. I empathize with her more than anyone else. I thought she was the 
most intelligent, and most sensitive person in the film. She's the only one who 
really takes the guilt on herself. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>It sounds 
like you work closely with your actors. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><b></b><font size="2"><i><b>PB: </b></i>
They tell me that. They say I talk with them more than other directors. To me, 
that's what it's about. There's where you put the camera. And there's what do 
you do with your actors, which is the most important thing. By and large, movies 
are about the performances; that's what people remember: faces, emotions. My job 
as a director is to get the best possible performances out of the actors. And 
that happens when you create an ensemble and they feel comfortable. On the set, 
you're the only audience they've got. So it's important that they trust you and 
they feel that you understand their problems. Having been an actor, and 
continuing to act. I usually say to the actors, &quot;Look, I'm just an actor. I just 
don't happen to have a role in this script. I'm here to help up.&quot; </font></span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">As far as where to put the 
camera, which is also something that I think is my job, my goal is always to be 
where I think the performance will be best shown and where the meaning and 
impact of the scene will come most clearly across. You can't make that 
determination until you have the actors play for you. Every picture's different. 
But on this picture, we brought the writer with us to Europe to work on the 
script. I insisted on it; I knew we be doing some rewriting, and he's a nice guy 
and a good writer, and wanted to bring him into the democratic process. There 
was a lot of improvisation and we kept certain lines, about fifty percent was 
kept as it was. But I think that's how a picture attains its freshness, if 
you're not exactly sure of it until right before you shoot it. </font></span>
</p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>That 
takes a bit of confidence. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><b></b><font size="2"><i><b>PB: </b></i>
Well, it does. The confidence is that you will get it. Experience helps. I'm not 
saying I wasn't anxious during the making of the film. It was a nervous-making 
picture, but we got through it. That's part of making pictures. I think that it 
should be a sense of a high-wire act. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>I've 
heard you say in an interview that you think films should be difficult, to make.
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><b></b><font size="2"><i><b>PB: </b></i>
Yes, I do think that. I think the challenge promotes creativity. How do we do 
this with no money and no time? How do we do it right? The challenge on this 
film was a very short shooting schedule [thirty-one days], but we had good 
actors. And the key was to not shoot much, just to shoot what we needed, not 
coverage or luxury shots. And we didn't shoot many takes. It's always a miracle 
when a movie turns out well. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>I don't 
imagine that a lot of people set out to make bad films.&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><b></b><font size="2"><i><b>PB: </b></i>
No, I don't think they do, though some films are hackwork going in. But I think 
everybody tries to make a decent picture. In security will tend to make you 
shoot more and take more time, thinking that you'll get something better. But 
actors usually, if they're any good, give it to you early on. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>So 
there's a certain tension here, between knowing you're only going to shoot a set 
amount of film, but wanting to have some flexibility with the actors. </font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>PB: </b></i>Yeah, 
it's not so much flexibility in cutting: I had none. But on the set, yes. I 
shoot pretty much the way I intend to cut. My first film, <i>Targets</i> [1968], 
was made in twenty-three days. And then <i>Picture Show</i> in sixty days. And 
after that I had longish schedules, fifty or sixty days. <i>What's Up Doc?</i> 
was seventy-two, because we needed four weeks to shoot the chase sequence. But I 
don't like to shoot a lot of coverage. It's the way I learned. All the directors 
I admired most were very confident with what they did and how they felt. John 
Ford used to put his hand over the lens to stop the camera. And Hitchcock cut in 
the camera. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">My approach with actors is 
to get right in there with them. And if they're not used to that, they kind of 
wonder what I'm doing, and I explain to them, I'm trying to help them give the 
best performance. Sometimes, when we're in a hurry, and we don't have any other 
way to do it, I'll give them a line reading, as a way of indicating an emotion 
or a nuance I don't really know how to get to otherwise. Some actors really like 
that, and others don't. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>And 
you're apt to rewrite or work on scripts. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>PB: </b></i>Yes, even 
if I don't write the screenplay, I've always had a lot of input. I didn't get 
any credit on <i>Mask</i>, but I worked through nine drafts on that. There's a 
Writers' Guild rule in the U.S., and it's prejudiced against directors. Unless 
the director has written fifty percent or over of the script, he gets no credit. 
In Europe, there isn't that sort of thing. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>The 
studio system allowed for the idea of the auteur to emerge, if only as a 
reaction against that system. How do you think it works today, in terms of what 
directors can do or how they're treated? There are some stars, of course, like 
Cameron or Spielberg, but the promotions system seems actor-driven, or better, 
FX-driven. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>PB: </b></i>The <i>
politiques des auteurs</i>, which started with Truffaut and the French New Wave, 
was a way of taking the product of the old studio system, and proving that while 
it seemed to be impersonal and factory-like, beneath the surface, it wasn't. 
There were a number of directors and personalities who were vivid and apparent, 
despite who their collaborators were. It was a way of saying, &quot;Look at Howard 
Hawks,&quot; because people didn't know his name, he was so versatile. That's how I 
got into film appreciation on a higher level. So when people ask me &quot;What's your 
favorite movie?&quot; I don't really have one. I have favorite directors. </font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Today, there's hardly any 
talk about the auteur theory, which is what they call it over here, and that's 
not a correct translation, because it's not a theory; it's a political position. 
The French tend to be political about their artistic choices. Today, there are 
certain clear auteurs around -- Spielberg and Scorsese. And it's ironic, because 
everyone gets that ridiculous billing: &quot;A So-and-So Film.&quot; A kid who just came 
out of film school gets it. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>How do 
you think about doing interviews as opposed to giving them? </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>PB: </b></i>It's 
okay. I don't have to prepare as much when I give one, as when I do one. My life 
is sort of my preparation. I have to be careful, though, as I have a tendency to 
be too candid. Doing an interview is fun, it really just comes from being 
curious about certain people, asking things that I find interesting. </font>
