            Marie (Kate Bosworth) is a surfer girl. Apparently, she's an
            extremely gifted surfer girl, though this is not so much on display
            in <i>Blue Crush</i> as her taut surfer girl figure and sun-bleached
            blond hair. From film's start, you see there's a reason for this
            lack: it's about Anne Marie's efforts to &quot;come back&quot; after
            her mother's abandonment and a &quot;near-drowning incident&quot;
            (this phrase repeated several times, by insensitive observers) that
            happened some three years before.</b> <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And
            surely, you want her to come back. By all initial appearances, Anne
            Marie is dedicated to her craft -- the film's first images show her
            waking from a nightmare (hitting her head on an underwater reef,
            nearly drowning), running along the water outside her Oahu home,
            completing her sit-ups and pull-ups, then checking the surf-watch
            hotline. Double overhead: time to beeline for the water. Once there,
            she and her girls, Eden (Michelle Rodriguez) and Lena (Sanoe Lake, a
            real surfer girl in her first film performance), as well as her
            little sister Penny (Mika Boorem), have to contend with a crew of
            guy surfers who like to posture and insinuate the girls are, you
            know, inferior. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            being a movie about surfer girls, the boys -- including Anne Marie's
            ex, Drew (Chris Taloa), Kala (Kala Alexander), and JJ (Ruben Ejada)
            -- are sometimes piggish, sometimes fuzzily supportive, always
            fiercely protective of their surfing subculture. The girls serve
            other roles: Eden pushes Anne Marie to compete and Lena encourages
            her to flirt with boys, like opposite angels on her shoulders, and
            not a little tired as &quot;supporting character&quot; types. The
            most refreshing aspect of this surfing scene (really, all of them),
            is that it is <b><i>not</i></b> set to '70s guitar rock. Rather, the
            scenes use hiphop or something related, keeping up with what the
            kids on screen might actually listen to, not some nostalgia
            filmmakers' trip. This first, set-you-up surfing scene takes place
            under Blestenation's &quot;Cruel Summer,&quot; a mix of beats and a
            pop hook that speaks directly to Anne Marie's lingering confusion.
            When she fails to take a wave, Eden gripes, &quot;What the hell is
            she afraid of?&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Okay,
            got that: she's nervous about failing, even dying (surfing can be
            dangerous). Following their morning excursion, the girls drop
            fourteen-year-old Penny at school. The shirt-sleeved principal comes
            out to the parking lot to fill in more &quot;character
            background,&quot; chastising Anne Marie for not fulfilling her own
            promise as a student. Though Anne Marie mouths off to Geeky Adult,
            she clearly feels guilt. That night, she chases down Penny, who's
            gone out partying, that is, drinking beer and imbibing who knows
            what else with Anne Marie's increasingly skuzzy-looking ex (this
            &quot;scary&quot; party scene, Anne Marie rushing through the crowd
            as handheld POV camera, is accompanied by a speedy and appropriately
            disorienting remix of N.E.R.D.'s &quot;Rock Star&quot;). Though Eden
            and Lena remind Anne Marie that they also used to party hard when
            they were younger, and gee, they &quot;turned out all right,&quot;
            big sister is only partly convinced. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">She
            has dreams: Penny will go to college and she will go around the
            world. Anne Marie wants to live up to her early promise as a great
            surfer, be sponsored by Billabong, appear on the cover of <i>Surfing</i>
            magazine, and earn her living as a respected athlete seeking
            fabulous waves. For the moment, though, she's treading water. Anne
            Marie's days -- aside fro the early morning boarding -- are routine:
            she and the girls wolf down Twinkies for breakfast, then head to
            work, late. They're maids at a fancy hotel on the &quot;other&quot;
            side of the island from where they live live. At the hotel, they see
            how wealthy folks live, trying on expensive clothes and surfing the
            net on elegant laptops. (Eden uses the laptop: the film uses this
            opportunity to &quot;explain&quot; Anne Marie's upcoming
            participation in the Pipe Masters competition, where her surfing
            career will be made or broken in a single afternoon.) <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            other room they're cleaning belongs to a professional football
            player (the whole team's in Hawaii on vacation), which is
            horrendously rank, littered with food, booze, vomit, and used
            condoms. A girl can only take so much. Anne Marie marches out to the
            beach, where she finds the occupant, Leslie (Faizon Love, whose
            primary function in the film appears to be jiggling, like he's in a
            Bubba Sparxx video), and schools him on how to clean up after
            himself. This display of spunk impresses Leslie's pretty-boy
            quarterback, Matt (Matthew Davis, the Ken Doll-looking bad boyfriend
            in <i>Legally Blonde</i>). He approaches her for surfing lessons.
            Can true love be far behind? <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            it turns out, the romance is more complicated than it first appears.
            It's definitely a jaw-dropping moment when, after a day of lessons
            (&quot;Are you psyched?&quot; she gushes), he hands her $1000 in
            cash just as they begin to kiss. No slouch, Anne Marie gasps,
            &quot;Are you trying to buy me?&quot; Actually, he is, but this
            being a PG-13 surfer girls movie, he says no, she pretends to
            believe him, and they proceed with the clinch. It may be that Anne
            Marie actually trusts that Matt will make her Mrs. Football Star,
            but given all the yapping about her dreams and hard work and
            dedication before this moment, it's hard to accept her instant
            rollover-and-lie-down maneuver. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Then
            again, given the much-publicized conflicts between director John
            Stockwell and Disney when he was trying to make <i>crazy/beautiful</i>
            a serious movie about a girl (played by Kirsten Dunst) with serious
            substance abuse problems (references to drugs and scenes of drinking
            were excised), the fact that <i>Blue Crush</i> makes even a vague
            allusion to something resembling prostitution, however
            &quot;innocuous&quot; or &quot;ironic,&quot; establishes Anne
            Marie's basic dilemma: money. It may be dressed up like romance
            versus independence, but that's what it is. Should she aspire to be
            wifey (or, as Eden puts it, &quot;Pro Ho&quot;) or should she pursue
            her own career and let QB-boy head on home? When Anne Marie wakes
            post-sex, he's gone to practice, leaving a note that instructs her
            to live it up. She orders blueberry pancakes from room service and
            swims in the private pool, takes a shower and wears the fluffy white
            terry robe. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Most
            obviously, this scene reemphasizes rich boyfriend's lure, such as it
            is. Matt is the blandest potential Prince Charming to appear in a
            girl's fantasy since, oh, <i>Charlie's Angels</i>, or maybe <i>Legally
            Blonde</i>. The decision is taken out of her hands when she later
            overhears the other football players' well-manicured girlfriends
            gossiping about her. Poor naïve Anne Marie is horrified to realize
            they don't consider her an equal. Poor you recognize this as a
            standard movie ploy, wherein studio types assume viewers prefer to
            identify with &quot;workers&quot; who are destined for better
            things, even if said viewers are not maids or valets themselves.
            Anne Marie wades into a nearby body of water, he follows, and here
            they have their showdown, in her supposed &quot;element.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            corny and overwrought as this romance gets -- and it gets even worse
            -- the truth is, the film, which is based on Susan Orlean's magazine
            story, &quot;Surf Girls of Maui,&quot; doesn't need it. Big fat
            super-popular boy power movies don't rely on plot, so it probably
            makes sense that this pulse-pounding girl power movie doesn't either
            (and like most boy movies, this one is about a stunningly beautiful
            white protagonist surrounded by a multi-culti crew). <i>Blue Crush</i>
            is righteously in love with its surfing scenes, comprised of
            incredible long shots of little specks-of-humans on giant blue
            waves, underwater shots, and spectacular POV-on-body-board shots
            through the wave curls, that is, the &quot;washing machine
            experience.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            final competition is particularly wild with a bumping dance track
            and thrilling camerawork that conveys the rush and risk for the
            girls (including pro surfers Rochelle Ballard, Megan Abubo, who
            double for Bosworth and Rodriguez, as well as Keala Kennelly, Kayne
            Beachley, and Kate Skarratt). The final credits sequence is most
            informative, however, showing pros and Hawaiian locals, kids and
            older folks, all surfing. And now, in case you forgot, <i>Blue Crush</i>'s
            final moments remind you. This is a longstanding culture, not just a
            cool new extreme sports event to be rendered in video games, the
            latest &quot;fad&quot; to be consumed by the mainlanders.</font></span><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana"></o:p>
