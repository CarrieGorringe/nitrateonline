            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Rain </i>is a tense 
            coming-of-age film that forecasts inevitable tragedy with subtle 
            acting and original images, filmed in an unforced way that makes it 
            all seem natural, even when the script sometimes lets the film down.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Envision some quaint, family beach 
            cabin tucked along the shoreline of a sun-drenched New Zealand bay.&nbsp; 
            Imagine that two vacationing parents and their pair of precocious 
            children occupy the cozy abode. Does the setting churn forth Disney-esque 
            visions of domestic bliss and unthreatening adventure? Not for the 
            subjects of <i>Rain</i>, a tense coming-of-age film that forecasts 
            inevitable tragedy with subtle acting and the original, unfamiliar 
            images framed by first-time director Christine Jeffs.&nbsp; Viewers 
            taking in this cinematic tidal wave of household dysfunction will 
            never again associate the sound of beach waves with calming sunsets 
            and restful tanning.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Casting its observant eye onto 
            bored, quietly simmering Kate (Sarah Peirse) and her passive, 
            bloated husband Ed (Alistair Browning), <i>Rain</i> makes it clear 
            from the get-go that something’s rotten in this beachfront paradise 
            of rustic cabins, tidy squares of backyard lawn, aluminum reclining 
            chairs, and booze. <i>Lots</i> of booze. While Kate slices chunks of 
            citrus and adds them to the plentiful alcoholic beverages on hand, 
            red-faced Ed is already pleasantly toasted inside this unhealthy 
            holiday house. Kate and Ed make an unhappy coupling, drowning their 
            sorrows with rollicking, nightly parties and stints of community 
            skinny-dipping in the nearby surf.&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">None of this goes unnoticed by 
            their two perceptive children. Too young to truly understand, tiny 
            tot Jim (Aaron Murphy) treats the hedonistic festivities like water 
            off a duck’s back, but the more perceptive Janey (Alicia 
            Fulford-Wierzbicki), a curious thirteen-year old, handles such 
            irresponsibility with a rebelliousness that bodes for gray skies 
            ahead.&nbsp; Entering into a covert competition with Kate for the carnal 
            affections of local bohemian, boat-building hunk Cady (Marton Csokas), 
            she mirrors the jaded promiscuity of her mother, with disastrous 
            consequences.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Jim acts as an unknowing contrast to this 
            growing doom, symbolizing the innocence that the family has long 
            since turned its back on.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">One can admire <i>Rain</i>’s 
            refusal to cop out with a happy wrap-up, as Jeffs delivers a 
            climactic blow to this damaged clan that remains true to the film’s 
            “storm on the horizon” feel.&nbsp; Still, the way in which this harsh 
            denouement comes about seems contrived and unlikely. Without being a 
            complete spoiler, I’ll reveal only that <i>Rain</i> is one of those 
            films in which sexual awakening at the hands of an enigmatic 
            beefcake is perceived as an inevitable rite of passage. It’s a tired 
            cliché.&nbsp; Still, the tragedy that cloaks the movie’s ending is 
            symbolically sound, if not entirely believable.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Rain</i> introduces a cast of 
            game New Zealand actors to a global audience. Sarah Pierse plays 
            Kate as an emotionally dead, passive aggressive woman who joylessly 
            whiles away the hours engaged in prolonged, adulterous trysts. Such 
            sexual frolics might not provide any true happiness, but they pass 
            the time and provide her with proof that she’s still partially 
            alive.&nbsp; Browning convincingly portrays a once-engaging suitor whose 
            indifference to anything void of alcohol transforms him into an 
            ineffective paternal anchor steadily going to seed. However, Alicia 
            Fulford-Wierzbicki steals the show as Janey, emoting quiet spite as 
            she takes in the silent betrayals around her and refuses to be 
            ignored, even if it means plunging into this sleazy stew 
            herself.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Moody, heartbreaking, and filmed in 
            a natural, unforced style that makes its characters seem entirely 
            convincing even when its script is not, <i>Rain</i> casts a downbeat 
            spell that’s not easily shaken.&nbsp; Wash it down with a mocha chaser or 
            a handful of antidepressants, and you’ll recover from its 
            effectively despairing images fast enough to raise your spirits for 
            the remainder of the evening.</font></td>
