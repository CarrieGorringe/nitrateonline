            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>The Transporter</i> is the first 
            action movie I can recall seeing that has a direct reference to 
            Marcel Proust. Out of nowhere.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Girl (Taiwanese actress Shu Qi) 
            has made breakfast for The Guy (Jason Statham, previously seen in 
            Guy Ritchie's two heist films, <i>Snatch</i> and <i>Lock, Stock and 
            Two Smoking Barrels</i>) which includes coffee and freshly-baked 
            madeleines. Madeleines? Why madeleines? Why not, say, cinnamon buns? 
            Just when you start wondering if this is going where you think it is 
            going to go, in drops the local friendly Police Inspector (François 
            Berleand), who nibbles a madeleine and asks The Guy if he's ever 
            read <i>Remembrance of Things Past</i>. &quot;Fantastic. Memory like a 
            steel trap,&quot; says the Inspector of its author.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">No doubt the screenwriters, Luc 
            Besson and Robert Mark Kamen, thought they would have a little fun, 
            here, because that's the last time anyone does or mentions anything 
            significant about memory or remembrance. The movie features a 
            kidnapping (whose hostage is The Girl) whose purpose is never 
            explained; there are repeated attempts to blow The Guy to 
            smithereens which are never explained, either. I rather enjoyed the 
            first thirty or forty minutes of the film, though, where The Guy, a 
            highly-disciplined driver who specializes in &quot;transporting&quot; 
            everything from escaping bank robbers to unnamed goods in zippered 
            bags, leads a harrowing chase through the streets, alleys, and, at 
            one point, over a bridge in the French city of Nice. This is a movie 
            where you can tell who the good guys and bad guys are because the 
            bad guys sweat too much and dress badly. Statham's character eludes 
            the authorities and drives a beautifully polished, custom-appointed 
            BMW while wearing a suit and tie and without ever breaking a sweat, 
            even when a gun is pointed at his head and cops are blocking the 
            access ahead.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Girl, who turns out to be tied 
            up and gagged and then concealed in a zippered bad that The Guy is 
            paid to transport, is ingratiating and clever and looks like she'll 
            be matching The Guy wit for wit -- she's mixed up in some business 
            involving smuggling slave labor into the country sealed in cargo 
            containers. But she ends up being turned into something of a cargo 
            container herself, hefted around by one gun-toting baddie after 
            another as the movie simply accelerates and accelerates the action. 
            Up until the forty-minute point, the already fast-paced action has a 
            near-balletic quality to it in some of its precision -- the 
            director, Corey Yuen, previously worked as a performer on some of 
            the wonderful Hong Kong-made &quot;Fong Sai Yuk&quot; films that starred Jet 
            Li -- and there are some good, audacious ideas mixed up in the 
            mélange that makes up the rest of the picture: a battle in a garage 
            that continues well after motor oil has been spilled all over the 
            floor; a furious contest staged in the cab of a truck that's 
            speeding down a highway. (Statham's character always stops short of 
            doing anything that's outright vicious.) But everything is filmed 
            very close-up and in-your-face (something that's really killing 
            action pictures being made nowadays), and after a while the movie 
            just turns into a blur, indistinguishable from anything else that's 
            currently being slapped on the screen.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jason Statham looks as 
            smoothed-down and modeled-for-action as Vin Diesel, but he has an 
            ironic detachment that Diesel lacks, and he makes his way through 
            the fight sequences with authoritative skill. It should be noted, 
            though, that Besson and Kamen previously wrote the screenplay for 
            the mind-blowingly awful <i>The Fifth Element</i>, and, here, they 
            give the characters lines such as the one where Shu Qi's character 
            has to say, tearfully, &quot;He was a bastard, but he was still my 
            father.&quot; Besson has said that he wants to do French-made films which 
            are Hollywood in style so as to compete with the Hollywood-made 
            action films that have been coming into Europe and monopolizing 
            cinemas there for years. In this movie, it feels like they started 
            out with something but then decided to settle for something much 
            less. The picture even walks away from the action, so to speak, at 
            the end and doesn't even bother to tell us what happens to the 
            characters played by Statham and Shu Qi: both of the performers 
            deserve better.</font></td>
