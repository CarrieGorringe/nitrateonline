            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">When we first see Barry, the 
            protagonist played by Adam Sandler in P.T. Anderson's film, <i>
            Punch-Drunk Love</i>, he is dressed in an indigo-blue, formal-cut 
            suit, speaking into a telephone with the assured, polished, 
            seemingly informed manner of what some would describe as &quot;telephone 
            communications skills&quot;. Does he spend all his time on the 
            contraption? No. Barry runs a sanitary supply company (institutional 
            toilet plungers with unbreakable handles, for example) out of a 
            storage unit in the arid wastes of Sherman Oaks, and he is also 
            pecked at by not one, but seven, sisters, who know how to aim their 
            darts to keep him in his place. &quot;Why are you wearing that suit?&quot; one 
            of them asks, making it sound like a withering putdown, while 
            sashaying into Barry's workplace.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Barry takes this thoughtless 
            cruelty with the amiable patience of someone who knows better and is 
            trying to keep the peace, but he is prone, as he confesses to one of 
            his brothers-in-law, to sudden crying jags, and to taking out his 
            frustration in sudden gusts of fury on inanimate objects such as 
            plate-glass windows. Something must be done, but the question is 
            who? That's answered by the arrival of Lena (Emily Watson, who 
            looks, and acts, splendid): she sees something in Barry and likes it 
            and doesn't want to see it go away, just yet. Barry, in turn, is 
            charmed by Lena crossing-paths with him, not once but several times, 
            and suspects that she may be the right ticket for him, as well. We, 
            in the audience, can see that Barry does not need to end up getting 
            permanently stamped as&nbsp; &quot;damaged goods&quot; (to quote a great friend and 
            brother of mine who might have used that exact same adjective upon 
            seeing this film), and that Lena might be the one to help restore 
            balance and order in his existence.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As you may have suspected if you've 
            gotten this far, it rapidly becomes clear that this is not the Adam 
            Sandler who was thwacking people, hard, with golf clubs in <i>Happy 
            Gilmore</i>. In the past, Sandler used an innocuous, seemingly 
            guileless quality to lure people into watching, and laughing, at 
            situations you wouldn't normally consider to be funny and which you 
            still would consider to be more painful than funny (and this 
            trickster quality was what probably made me feel particularly sour 
            towards that work). Here, Anderson (and Sandler) separates out the 
            guileless quality in Sandler and refines it so that the character of 
            Barry approaches a state of true devotion, even purity. All Barry 
            wants is someone whom he can make happy and, in so doing, achieve 
            happiness in return, and he is very uncomplicated and direct about 
            this.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The first part of the film is 
            staged and shot (with cinematographer Robert Elswit) so that Barry 
            seems to be living inbetween glares of light and in the fine space 
            between large, undefined spaces---as if he were toiling away along 
            the edges of things. When Lena enters, the picture literally opens 
            out, and the scenes take on great clarity. (They're also accompanied 
            by a beautiful, and brilliant, orchestrated sound-and-music score by 
            Jon Brion.) Some of the tumultuous business which keeps getting in 
            the way and threatening to separate Barry and Lena -- like all that 
            chasing around Cary Grant and Katharine Hepburn did with Asta the 
            dog in <i>Bringing Up Baby</i> -- includes a scheme whereby Barry 
            can accumulate an astronomical amount of frequent-flier miles, and a 
            phone-sex scam (like at the beginning, where Barry turns out to have 
            been speaking with a telephone solicitor, all he wanted was someone 
            to talk to for a while) which results in his being pursued and 
            intimidated by a group of thugs (led by Philip Seymour Hoffman) who 
            operate out of, of all places, Provo, Utah. (What? they couldn't get 
            tickets to see <i>The Singles Ward</i>?) This latter creates a 
            situation whereby Barry can use some of his pent-up frustration to 
            some righteously indignant use. But the film is haunting. There's a 
            gorgeous moment where Barry reunited with Lena, in silhouette and 
            longshot, that's precisely executed and emotionally sweeping. And 
            when the two characters embrace in close-up, and Barry finds safe 
            harbor in the cleft of Lena's neck and shoulder, they could be 
            lovers clutching each other amidst the whirlwind, and the film in 
            that moment assumes an air of desperate, aching romanticism.&nbsp; 
            Anderson is trying for something very special in this picture, and 
            the results are audacious. He takes risks, goes way out on a limb, 
            and just about pulls it off.</font></td>
