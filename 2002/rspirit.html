            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Well, at least the animals don't
            talk. Not on-camera, anyway. &quot;Sometimes, a horse has gotta do
            what a horse has gotta do,&quot; Matt Damon says on the soundtrack
            during <i>Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron</i>, as the film's lead
            character, a brown mustang stallion, throws one mean ol' cavalry
            soldier after another off his back while they try to break him. Even
            the mean ol' squinty-eyed colonel of the fort where this is taking
            place fails to do so, and he's a cuss, even after the stallion bites
            his riding crop in half. Our hero fares better with the Lakota tribe
            next door, though: they treat him humanely, give him apples to eat,
            and the horse returns their consideration in turn.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The movie is briskly paced, and at
            times lovingly rendered in a combination of conventional and
            computer-generated animation. It is also clunkingly inspirational --
            the whole story is about the stallion doggedly determined to get
            back &quot;home&quot; to the herd from whence he sprung, and, at the
            end, how he and his Lakota friend, a young brave named Little Creek,
            win their &quot;freedom forever&quot;. At least in this little soap
            bubble of a story. (History chronicles that the opposite was true,
            that the native Western wilderness would be run over by the
            &quot;manifest destiny&quot; movement, along with, shamefully, the
            native American tribes.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While the filmmakers take the
            admirable tact of having the animals on-screen communicate
            non-verbally, their actions and reactions are often decidedly
            anthropomorphic, and the Bryan Adams songs that are incorporated
            into Hans Zimmer's orchestral score are as achingly uplifting as a
            hatpin being suddenly jabbed into your thigh. (Sample lyric:
            &quot;Here I am,/This is me....&quot; Well, who were you expecting,
            someone else? responded I.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Our four-footed hero -- who refers
            to humans as &quot;two-leggeds&quot; -- frees several of his
            captive, bridled comrades during the course of the narrative,
            single-hoofedly demolishes a steam locomotive and incinerates a
            railroad workers' camp in the process, and gets the girl in the end
            -- a brown and cream-coloured filly named Rain. Kids at the showing
            I attended were eating the whole thing up. Now, if Spirit and Rain
            can only prevent the Oklahoma land rush....</font></td>
