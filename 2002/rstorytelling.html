<meta name="description" content="Storytelling - Director Todd Solondz's uncompromisingly jaundiced view of human nature seems to have caught up with him this time around; in attempting to push the limits of being all-knowing and cynical, Solondz' viewpoint no longer possesses the &quot;coolness&quot; of revelation, but, rather, an arrogance that make the film seem false and excessively smarmy.">

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Todd Solondz’s bitter,
            caustically comic &quot;Storytelling&quot; comes across as the work
            of a particularly vengeful nerd out for some unforgiving payback. He
            hacks away at suburban facades with the zeal of a classroom geek
            wasting the school bully after brushing up on some Tae Kwon Do –
            or brandishing a revolver from his father’s hunting cabinet. Of
            all the new filmmakers that emerged in the early nineties, Solondz
            is by far the angriest. He’s like the cinematic blood brother of
            fringe-dwelling artist R. Crumb, his vision empowered by personal
            rage made comic.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><o:p>

            announced the New Jersey director’s arrival with a fierce take on
            sibling rivalry and coming of age. Its adolescent protagonist, Dawn
            Wiener, stumbled through a psychic torture chamber of junior high
            abuse while her parents gave preferential treatment to a favored
            younger sister. Two years later, Solondz spewed even stronger venom

            The only ray of hope to emerge from this unsavory stew of miserable

            with an eighties era creative writing class, instructed by a
            hard-a*s, dream-snuffing teacher, Mr. Scott (an intense Robert
            Wisdom). An embittered African-American who claims a writer’s
            Pulitzer Prize but little upward job mobility, the educator is all
            steely-eyed gazes and angry put-downs. He crucifies Marcus (Leo

            cerebral palsy is hacked to pieces by Scott’s blunt-edged verbal
            sword. &quot;The story’s a piece of sh*t,&quot; states the

            class a blubbering, humiliated sad sack. &quot;He hated my story,

            morphs into an ugly, surreal freak show that conjures forth memories

            degrading encounter with Mr. Scott through an in-class reading of a
            new story based on the night’s sordid activity. Instead of
            sympathy, her classmates bash the piece as ugly, racist,

            winking social commentary. But what, exactly, is the message to its
            madness? By making Mr. Scott a black man who demands that his lovers
            scream racial epithets during demeaning intercourse, is Solondz
            probing racism and exploitation? The way it’s set up, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Storytelling</i>

            documentary filmmaker Toby Oxman (played with complex shades of

            stoner, and persuades the Livingston family to star in his latest
            project. Attempting to illuminate the pressures and decisions faced
            by contemporary high school students bound for college, Toby sees in
            Scooby the embodiment of pre-SAT angst, and perhaps a reflection of
            his own frustrated high school days. <o:p>

            school yearbook, searching for a long-ago female acquaintance to ask
            on a date, we wince at the middle-aged man’s urgent anxiety: he
            knows that his time is running out in matters of love and
            livelihood. After some half-a*sed stabs at acting, law school, and
            writing, he rationalizes such failures with the defensiveness of a
            left-behind relic watching the world pass him by. &quot;I’m glad
            to be out of writing,&quot; he says, along with the sour-grapes

            (Noah Fleiss), is too focused on girls, cars, and touchdowns to make
            time for even a sliver of sensitivity. &quot;Why do you drive such a
            sh*tty car?&quot; he asks Toby as the filmmaker pulls into the
            Livingston family driveway. Equally unfeeling is the household’s
            youngest child, Mikey (Jonathan Osser), who demands that an
            overworked maid tend to his spilled grape juice even as she mourns

            <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Storytelling</i> concludes in
            an explosion of exploitation, revenge, and tragedy. When Toby’s
            well-intended movie evolves into an altogether different type of
            animal that may or may not portray Scooby in a flattering light,
            Solondz dares us to ask ourselves whether personal trust and
            integrity should be compromised in the name of a pop culture
            &quot;hit.&quot; Giamatti, bringing to life a man who subtly morphs
            from a tentative wannabe to a triumphant – if compromised –
            success, has never been better. The film’s final scene, in which
            Scooby’s eyes become sober and knowing for the first time, caps a
            brilliant performance by Webber as a dazed druggie waking up from a
            life-long pipe dream. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Despite the superb acting that
            permeates every scene in &quot;Non-Fiction&quot;, Solondz insists on
            enshrouding the finale in a dark cloak of nihilistic tragedy. His
            story could stand on its own as an honest look at both how we are
            used, and how we use others, in waves of exploitation that are often
            gradual, imperceptible, and even unrecognizable. Instead, he slips
            us a sneaky Molotov cocktail at the last minute. It feels like a
            cheap shot.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><o:p>

            the end, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Storytelling</i>
            gives us the best and worst examples of celluloid yarn spinning,
            taking detailed, complex characters and subjecting them to
            post-Tarantino shock tactics. Early on in the film, a writing
            student asks a peer why her material is so mean-spirited. The same
            could be asked of the undeniably talented Solondz, who conjures up
            intriguing people and chucks them into a meat grinder. For his next
            bout of cinematic storytelling, the director could afford to really
            test his range - with a happy ending.</span></font><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
