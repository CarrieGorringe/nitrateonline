            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The tone of the new film, <i>Red 
            Dragon</i>, is made clear from the start, a prologue where the 
            camera zooms in on the face of Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins -- 
            you were expecting Percy Kilbride?) wincing while listening to a 
            wayward flautist playing with the Baltimore Symphony, followed by a 
            formal at-home dinner where the symphony trustees exude over the 
            wonderful &quot;soirées&quot; Lecter has thrown for them. (<i>Don't eat 
            anything!</i> we're supposed to scream.) Enter Will Graham (Edward 
            Norton), an F.B.I. agent who is visiting Lecter for his services as 
            a &quot;forensics consultant&quot;, then figures out that he's been killing 
            and cooking people. A messy struggle, and the story-proper finally 
            gets underway.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And that's pretty much the rest of 
            the movie: queasy attempts at macabre humor, flurries of action, and 
            crass shock effects. This is the second film version of Thomas 
            Harris' novel, which was already very finely served by Michael 
            Mann's 1986 film, a comparison made cruelly evident by both films 
            sharing much of the same scene progression and, in some instances, 
            the same dialogue. Also, the emphasis of the new film has been 
            shifted over to Will Graham and Lecter, even though the original 
            story was about the inevitable confrontation between Graham and the 
            serial killer he was trying to capture, Francis Dolarhyde, who 
            commits murders in order to transform himself into a higher being. 
            This rearranging results in the film skittering over a great deal of 
            the plot and most of the characters, rendering them meaningless 
            while squandering a ludicrously talented cast: Ralph Fiennes is 
            reduced to nothing more than a hare-lip and a monstrous back tattoo 
            as Dolarhyde, Philip Seymour Hoffman gets an extended whining scene 
            as a tabloid journalist, Mary-Louise Parker gets even less than that 
            playing Graham's anguished wife, and Emily Watson, as the blind girl 
            whom Dolarhyde falls for, is made to look wide-eyed and idiotic from 
            the way her scenes are staged and shot. (Especially painful, if you 
            saw Joan Allen's portrayal of the same character, in Mann's film, 
            and found it exceptional.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film confirms that director 
            Brett Ratner is, well, not exactly going to be joining the pantheon 
            of Jonathan Demme and Ridley Scott, just yet. (In a TV interview, he 
            admitted that he was intimidated by the actors and in trying to give 
            them direction.) He's unsubtle in his approach., to say the least. 
            Unable to draw out characterization or nuance, he turns the movie 
            into a circus parade: on to the next grotesquerie, the nest phony 
            surprise plot twist! (All of it accompanied, jarringly, by a grossly 
            overblown music score by Danny Elfman.) As for the scenes between 
            Will Graham and Lecter upon which the fulcrum sits, Norton fumbles 
            his way through the role, while Hopkins uses a glassy stare and a 
            sibilant speech delivery to, again, portray the bloodthirsty 
            maniac-as-epicurean. The power of the scenes between Jodie Foster 
            and Hopkins in <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i> is but a mere shadow, 
            here: Hopkins and Norton look about as well-matched as an iguana and 
            a ladybug.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I assume Hopkins agreed to reprise 
            this role because it gave him the chance to realize the full arc of 
            a character, from beginning to end. Hopkins was reticent to talk 
            about Lecter during much of the 1990s, much like Ian Richardson, who 
            was concerned that people were idolizing his performance as Francis 
            Urquart, the evil prime minister in <i>House of Cards</i>, for the 
            wrong reasons. Richardson agreed to play the part a third time only 
            under the condition that the character was killed. Whereas 
            Richardson's villain retained his maleficent complexity to the end, 
            Lecter has become fairly obvious. Devour or be devoured, as long as 
            you always make sure that the right wine is served and you're using 
            the correct silverware and table manners. These niceties, of course, 
            never stood in the way of Bundy, Dahmer, Manson, Gein, Christie, or 
            even Jack the Ripper himself, and they remain tantamount to the 
            epitome of evil in the last century or more, not to mention the man 
            with the little mustache (and he was a vegetarian, at that). It may 
            be time to set Hannibal Lecter in a corner for a while.</font></td>
