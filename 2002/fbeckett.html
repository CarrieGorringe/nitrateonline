            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>When the theatre director Alan
            Schneider consulted with Samuel Beckett prior to staging the first
            U.S. production of Beckett's play, <i>Waiting for Godot</i>, one of
            the initial questions he asked was who Godot was supposed to be. To
            which the writer replied that, if he knew, he would have said so in
            the play. And, as to why<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>audiences
            often found themselves puzzled as to the meaning of his plays,
            Beckett is quoted as having told one critic, &quot;It's all
            misunderstanding.&quot; To this, on another occasion, he amended,
            &quot;Why people have to complicate a thing so simple I can't make
            out.&quot;</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Nonetheless, one approaches the
            nineteen films, of various lengths and sizes, that comprise the <i>Beckett
            on Film</i> series with some wariness. On the one hand, Beckett has
            been typed as a purveyor of &quot;alienation&quot;, one whose works
            are difficult and obscure to most people, and whose plays feature
            performer who are seen deposited in urns or in trashcans. Would the
            films emphasize these qualities at the expense of the humor, pathos,
            and humanity that can also be found in them? On the other hand,
            Beckett has become something of an institution, one of the most
            influential playwrights of the twentieth century, and, thus, one
            whose works are often presented or discussed in the monochrome hues
            of &quot;edification&quot;. Would the films treat Beckett's work in
            such an overly reverential style that would sacrifice, again, the
            humor, pathos, and humanity that can also be found in them?</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The answer is that, for the most
            part, the films in the <i>Beckett on Film</i> series (which have
            been brought out on home video in the U.S. by Ambrose Video this
            past fall) are splendid and have made the transition from stage to
            screen quite nicely. There are many fine performances to be seen,
            several by actors who had the chance to previously play and hew
            these roles during a presentation of all nineteen of Beckett's plays
            at the Gate Theatre, in Dublin, in 1991. Michael Colgan, who
            produced that series at the Gate and has co-produced <i>Beckett on
            Film</i>, has also succeeded in obtaining the services of several
            notable film directors who turn out to fit nicely with the works
            they have chosen to film. The only caveat imposed on the project,
            coming from the Beckett estate itself, was that the works were to be
            performed as written, with no changes in dialogue.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For the eleven-minute <i>Act
            Without Words -- II</i>, a &quot;mime routine&quot; for two
            performers, Beckett instructed that it was to be performed on a
            &quot;low and narrow platform, violently lit in its entire
            length&quot;. The director Enda Hughes has set the piece on a length
            on motion picture films, running horizontally across the length of
            the screen (replete with the optical sound track visible in the long
            shots), and the action unfolds, in three film frames, from right to
            left. In the first, a sullen man emerges and goes through what
            amounts to a daily routine, from getting dressed to eating then
            undressing and &quot;retiring&quot; for the night---each time, he
            has to stop and think about what he is next supposed to do. This
            includes the lugging of a large, full sack into the second, middle
            frame of the &quot;film&quot; we're watching, after which he,
            himself, crawls into the sack, literally, a second empty sack that
            he takes along with him. A long pole, or &quot;goad&quot; as Beckett
            described it, pokes the second sack---from which emerges a second
            man, smiling, peppy, engaged in all he does (including giving
            himself a stimulating scalp massage before combing his hair). He
            scrupulously dresses, consults his pocket watch regularly to
            self-satisfying results, and lugs the full sack into the third
            frame, after which he &quot;retires&quot; and withdraws into the
            empty sack---and the &quot;goad&quot; then prods the sack from which
            emerges the sullen man, to begin to repeat his particular routine
            all over again... At which point, as Enda Hughes himself notes,
            Beckett, &quot;with impeccable comic timing, drops the
            curtain&quot;.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Beckett himself described his first
            play, <i>Waiting for Godot</i>, as a &quot;tragicomedy&quot;, and
            while the <i>Godot</i> in the <i>Beckett on Film</i> series may not
            have recognizable name stars, it is nonetheless one of the best
            productions of the play I've ever seen before -- Barry McGovern,
            stick-tall and with dark, piercing eyes, and Johnny Murphy, shorter
            and with a great rabbity grin, both played Vladimir and Estragon in
            the 1991 Gate Theatre presentations. Question: Here,
            &quot;Godot&quot; is pronounced as &quot;GOD-oh&quot; instead of
            &quot;Go-DOUGH&quot;, which is how I've been pronouncing it for the
            last thirty-odd years. James Knowlson's comprehensive 1996 biography
            of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Beckett, <i>Damned
            to Fame</i>, does not offer any clarification on the matter. And the
            kinescope made of a 1961 TV. broadcast of <i>Godot</i>, starring
            Burgess Meredith and Zero Mostel and directed by Alan Schneider,
            pronounces it as &quot;Go-DOUGH&quot;, and Schneider would've gotten
            it directly from Beckett himself. The change in pronunciation may
            have something to do with the conscious effort made by the producers
            of the <i>Beckett on Film</i> series to give an Irish sound to the
            performances of works by the Irish-born playwright.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Beckett himself spent much of his
            life in France, and several of his plays, including <i>Godot</i> and
            <i>Endgame</i> (which was originally titled <i>Fin de Partie</i>),
            were written in French, partly, Beckett explained, because of the
            discipline of writing in another language. In his early years, he
            spent long periods of time walking around Paris with James Joyce,
            and their conversations are believed to have provided the
            inspiration for Beckett's later two-character piece, <i>Ohio
            Impromptu</i> (which is performed, beautifully, in the film series
            by Jeremy Irons). Beckett worked in the Resistance during the Nazi
            occupation of France, and went into hiding for a time to avoid being
            captured. Before starting work on <i>Godot</i>, he read an account
            which described the life that Beckett's friend Alfred Péron endured
            in one of the camps -- how he was regularly beaten by the <b><i>capos</i></b>
            who ran the place, and how, after days of hard labor and
            malnourishment, he would recite passages from Baudelaire and
            Verlaine to alleviate the abject misery. Both <i>Godot</i> and <i>Endgame</i>
            have been interpreted as dramas which could be taking place after
            some post-apocalyptic period -- in the film series, Vladimir and
            Estragon are shown waiting for Mr. Godot in a setting which appears
            to be made up of blasted mounds of concrete and cement, while in<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>&quot;Endgame&quot;, which unfolds within the confines of a
            single room, Hamm, who is blind and confined to a rolling chair,
            repeatedly asks Clov, who may or may not be his son, to tell him
            what can be seen of what's left of the world through the tiny
            windows on either side of the room. <i>Endgame </i>is also the
            &quot;trashcan piece&quot;, but we find out that the two elderly
            characters, Nell and Nagg, who reside in the trashcans at the back
            of the room are probably Hamm's parents. &quot;Why did you engender
            me?&quot; Hamm furiously asks Nagg. &quot;I didn't know,&quot; Nagg
            replies. &quot;What?&quot; Hamm asks. &quot;What didn't you
            know?&quot; &quot;That it would be YOU,&quot; Nagg acidulously
            replies.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Beckett was reluctant to accept the
            Nobel Prize for literature when he was informed he would be its
            recipient in 1969, but he did so anyway, partly on behalf of the
            publishers who had supported his work over the years and who could
            now benefit from the imprimatur that the prize permitted. He
            resisted any and all offers to turn his plays into films (the 1961 TV.
            broadcast of <i>Godot</i>, directed by Schneider, being the
            exception; Beckett also wrote an original treatment for a short
            film, entitled <i>Film</i>, in 1964, along with plays for television
            and radio). Beckett could also take umbrage with liberties taken
            with his work, such as a production that changed the opening line of
            &quot;Godot&quot; from &quot;Nothing to be done&quot; to
            &quot;Nothing doing&quot;. But he would also travel any and
            everywhere where he was asked to help with a production of one of
            his plays that wasn't working (he would later take up stage
            direction himself), and he worked prolifically, including during a
            period in the 1960s when a benign tumor was removed from his upper
            palette, creating difficulties for a time with his being able to
            eat, drink, or smoke.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Beckett's dialogue can require a
            good deal of work in order to find the right cadence, emphasis, and
            rhythm that would yield forth both its inherent meaning and poetry
            to the audience. This is why the one clinker in the <i>Beckett on
            Film</i> series turns out to be Patricia Rozema's filming of <i>Happy
            Days</i>, in which the defiantly optimistic dialogue delivered by
            the main character, Winnie, is reduced to a drone of prattle.
            (Unfortunate, since this one of Beckett's best-known plays -- Ruth
            White and, later, Jessica Tandy performed it on the New York stage,
            while Madeleine Renaud played it on the Paris stage opposite her
            husband, Jean-Louis Barrault). Compare this with the range and depth
            that is conveyed by Susan Fitzgerald in her performance of <i>Footfalls</i>,
            or Stephen Brennan in <i>A Piece of Monologue</i>, short pieces
            found elsewhere in the series. The meaning is in the words, and the
            words are the meaning. In these, too, the directors found ways to
            complement the performances cinematically -- <i>Footfalls</i> is
            clothed in a beautifully melancholy twilight of grays and silvers,
            while <i>Monologue</i> is filmed in an almost Expressionistic
            black-and-white which nonetheless turns Brennan's eyes into deep,
            transfixing pools of emotion that are almost too unbearably moving
            to watch.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I wished that David Mamet's film of
            <i>Catastrophe </i>had been a little more satisfying -- Mamet sets
            the action in an actual London music hall, and has Rebecca Pidgeon
            and Harold Pinter playing two people who arrange a mute figure --
            John Gielgud, in his very last appearance as a performer -- in order
            to achieve the right combination of pose, lighting, and mood that
            would convey the &quot;catastrophe&quot; they're looking for. I also
            wasn't terribly satisfied with Neil Jordan's filming of the
            monologue &quot;Not I&quot;, which is delivered by Julianne Moore,
            but it's a difficult piece to perform in the first place -- Beckett
            instructed that it be performed with only the performer's mouth
            visible, something which confounded both directors and performers
            who tried to enact the piece onstage. For &quot;Breath&quot;, the
            producers came upon the idea of getting the artist Damien Hirst --
            he of the sharks exhibited in formaldehyde tanks, and the medicine
            cabinets with hundreds of individually designed and hand-made pills
            displayed on the shelves -- to film it. Beckett was invited by
            Kenneth Tynan to contribute a sketch to Tynan's adult revue
            &quot;Oh! Calcutta!&quot;, in 1969. Beckett responded with a piece
            in which the stage lights would go up, then down, on a setting
            comprised of strewn detritus, all of which would last for the
            entirety of the intake, then exhalation, of a human breath –
            forty-six seconds. (For the New York production, someone included a
            few naked bodies, positioned so that their wares would be on display
            -- not what Beckett had in mind, and he let Tynan know as much.)
            Hirst has filmed it, however, as Beckett intended, one long camera
            movement, beginning and ending in darkness, over mounds of what
            looks like discarded hospital supplies, upended medical tables and
            gurneys, blue surgical gloves, sealed medical waste bags, components
            for computers, and, finally, a pill bottle laying on its side (Keith
            Allen provides the vocalization on the soundtrack). At first, you
            think it's dismissible, but then you decide to give it a second
            look, then a third...<o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Anthony Minghella's turn with <i>Play</i>
            (the title, it turns out, has a double meaning)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
            </span>-- the &quot;urn piece&quot; -- substitutes camerawork and
            editing in place of the spotlight which illuminates the three
            characters -- a wife, her husband, and the mistress whom the husband
            takes for a time -- who take turns in reciting the sorry events
            which occurred from when the wife discovers her husband's infidelity
            to when the three of them go their separate ways, each wondering
            what has become of the other. When the characters have finished with
            their narrative, Beckett's concluding stage instructions are,
            &quot;Repeat <i>Play</i>.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The performers in Minghella's film -- Kristin Scott Thomas (wife), Alan
            Rickman (husband), and Juliet Stevenson (mistress) -- are still
            confined, up to their necks, in urns, set side by side, and they are
            made up so that they appear to have a green, decomposing quality to
            them. They also follow Beckett's stage instructions to the letter --
            when they have to &quot;repeat <i>Play</i>&quot;, the camera seems
            to almost careen back to where the first character has to speak the
            first lines of dialogue. It's the most technically audacious film in
            the series, and it's brilliantly done. (For the record, the first
            half runs seven minutes and thirty seconds, the second seven minutes
            and twenty seconds.) It's great to see Juliet Stevenson again (her
            performance in Minghella's 1991 film, <i>Truly, Madly, Deeply</i>,
            was, for me, one of the cinematic high points of the 'Nineties),
            and, for all the elaborateness that has been brought to bear in the
            filming, Minghella still delivers what Beckett intended, a sort of
            awe and terror over how the characters have become doomed -- doomed
            by their own actions, in fact -- to a kind of purgatory where they
            keep repeating and replaying to themselves the same past series of
            events over and over, whether in an actual purgatory or one that may
            exist only in their interior consciousness.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is appropriate that the last
            play of the series is <i>Rockaby</i>, and not just for the obvious
            reasons. A thirteen-minute monologue performed by actress Penelope
            Wilton, it has a gentle, cantering quality to it. The film series
            has a number of standout performances in it -- Michael Gambon and
            David Thewlis in <i>Endgame</i>, the three actresses (Paola
            Dionisotti, Anna Massey, and Sian Phillips) who perform the
            dreamlike <i>Come and Go</i>, David Kelley and Milo O'Shea as the
            blind beggar and the crippled man in <i>Rough for Theatre--1</i>,
            John Hurt in Atom Egoyan's filming of <i>Krapp's Last Tape</i>, Jim
            Norton and Timothy Spall as the two highly divergent clerks
            (&quot;Now, let's have the positive elements.&quot;) in <i>Rough for
            Theatre -- II</i>, and Niall Buggy's incredibly nuanced and delicate
            rendition of <i>That Time</i>, a piece originally written to be
            played by three actors instead of one -- and Wilton's performance
            proves to be no exception. Set against beautiful shades of black and
            brown, her character recounts her experience sitting before a window
            in her rocking chair, a window which, &quot;pane before a
            face&quot;, both separates her from the world and frames her
            existence within it to the outside world. She watches for others,
            within windows facing hers, another person behind another pane of
            glass opposite her, until, in the end, she makes the decision to
            quit this farce, with one brief, rough, brisk expression, and the
            rocking comes to a halt, like the flip of a switch: &quot;Rock her
            off.&quot;</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">By accounts, Samuel Beckett himself
            was not a colic man -- one acquaintance saw him give, literally, the
            coat off his back to a person down on his luck, in a bar in
            Montparnasse -- who used his work to express and confirm his
            misanthropy and contempt for the world. Rather, he gives expression
            to persons and experience that otherwise would have no voice, but
            which gives insight to some of the most personal and life-shaping
            questions and conditions that, sooner or later, everyone must face.
            The biggest accomplishment of the <i>Beckett on Film</i> series is
            how it shows the humanity at the heart of Beckett's work, how he
            used his craft to say, yes, it is there, even amidst the most
            bleakest and trying of circumstances, but it is not extinguished,
            and it patiently continues to endure and to exist.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"></o:p>
