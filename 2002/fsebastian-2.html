<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Been there, done that.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ten glorious days, thirty-eight new and one 
not-so-new (God bless Michael Powell) features, sixty-four-plus hours spent in 
the darkened theaters of San Sebastian, and a few less than that sleeping. Look 
at it this way: some of these movies are going to be once-in-a-lifetime 
experiences, doomed to distribution hell never to surface on American shores. I 
can sleep later.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Heavenly weather of sunny skies, , temperatures 
in the low seventies, an occasional cloud, and barely a drop of rain. A room 
with a great beach view of the Bay of Biscay, but not enough time to share the 
gentle waves with some of the partly topless crowd (some should, most 
shouldn't). Some of the best <i>tapas</i> in the world, but never more than a 
few minutes between screenings to sit down, exhale, and enjoy these marvelous, 
tasty treats. Everyone should be so lucky to have such an exhausting, 
all-expenses-paid vacation. Just be sure to stock up on your vitamin pills 
before departure.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In as much I didn't deliver the verdict on 
behalf of our New Directors Jury at the press conference or on stage during the 
star-studded, televised spectacular closing celebration of the 50th San 
Sebastian International Film Festival, I want my moment in the limelight now, 
so…&quot;And the winner is…&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Vylet</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This dramatic Czech family road trip covers a 
lot of asphalt and several generations of pent-up angst as a mother, her two 
daughters, and their grandmother pack up the ashes of the family patriarch and 
set off on a potholed journey of self discovery. Relational and political 
barriers melt on the way to a burial in Slovakia, where any inadvertent stop 
along the highway is likely to reveal a festering secret or two. Told with 
darkly comic undertones, this second feature from director Alice Nellis (after 
her <i>Eeny Meeny</i> of two years ago) and the first (as producer) for Pavel 
Solc, featured some of the best acting, directing, and writing the jury saw 
during its brief seating. During our closing balloting it won over five of the 
seven judges in basically a contest we had whittled down to less than a handful 
of titles. Regrettably the prize cannot be shared among pictures -- Nellis and 
Solc thus split the 150,000 Euro (about $148,000) prize, a nice chunk of change 
to help pay down their debt. The other finalist had to settle for honorable 
mention and a nice diploma, suitable for framing. That was the South Korean 
entry <i>Jibeuro (The Way Home)</i> a simple tale of a city-bred boy thrust into 
the backwoods, way-off-the-beaten-path homestead (read shack) of a grandmother 
fully entrenched in the 19th century. A box-office hit back home, this entry by 
second-time director-writer Lee Jung-Hyang won over most of the jurors' hearts, 
but also had one detractor flustered by the acting of Yoo Seung-Hoo as the 
spoiled youngster.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">You may be wondering why we handed out a New 
Director award to a sophomore filmmaker. Hey, we didn't make the rules; the 
festival's eligibility standards allow for any entry in this competition to be 
the director's first or second feature. The prize, sponsored by Jazztel, was 
handed out on the last night of the Festival, with Nellis and Solc barely making 
it onstage after a day-long excursion from Prague, a trip saddled with missed 
flights, a tour of Paris identical to mine on the way over to Spain, and a 
detour to Bordeaux, where one of the Festival's official Mercedes Benz vehicles 
raced the winners 250 kilometers back to San Sebastian, arriving just an hour 
before show time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A third film, the Hungarian entry <i>Hukkle</i>, 
also received a special mention &quot;for the particular conception and use of image 
and sound.&quot; This amusing and altogether different entry was definitely in a 
class by itself -- an apple in a basket of oranges. Director György Pálfi's 
seventy-five minute film is told without dialogue, a rhythmic audiovisual 
smorgasbord of images surrounding a small, intriguing mystery within a 
close-knit community. It's as much a cinematic experiment as it is an absorbing 
comic symphony. Pálfi and his cinematographer Gergely Pohárnok spent a year in 
pre-production, shot the script on 16mm stock, reevaluated that footage for 
another six months, rewrote the story, and then shot the actual film in 35mm. 
It's quite an accomplished piece of entertainment.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The jury's initial balloting actually began on 
September 25th during a lunch time meeting to eliminate the films we felt need 
not be considered during the ensuing discussions two days later. During that 
first meeting all seven jurors identified three films, in no particular order, 
which they believed would be worthy of the award. This balloting reduced the 
number of features to be considered to seven, without eliminating the remaining 
handful of films we had not yet screened. This early tally broke down as 
follows: <i>Jibuero</i> (5 votes); Niki Caro's New Zealand entry and Toronto 
festival winner <i>Whale Rider</i> (4); <i>Vylet</i> (3); <i>Les Diables</i> 
(2). a disturbing tale of an ever-deepening brother-sister relationship from 
director Christophe Ruggia; and single votes for Icelandic entry <i>Hafid (The 
Sea)</i>, another dysfunctional family tale by Baltasar Kormákur; Uruguayan Aldo 
Garay Dutrey's <i>La Espera (The Wait)</i>, a claustrophobic look at an invalid 
mother, her frustrated daughter, and a misguided neighbor; and Todd Louiso's 
American entry <i>Love Liza</i> starring Philip Seymour Hoffman and a depressed, 
gasoline-sniffing widower.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Which brings me to Friday's deliberations. The 
setting: Arzak, the internationally renown restaurant located just outside of 
town. A truly divine 5-star gastronomical treat. The jury, fully realizing what 
an enjoyable meal lay in store for us, tried to prolong our important meeting so 
we could get dinner thrown in as well. Our plot, sadly, was unsuccessful. Peter 
Scarlet, who earlier had enchanted us with tales of some previous (non-San 
Sebastian) jury shenanigans, in which members nearly came to blows, was assured 
no ambulance was necessary this day. We also learned that the Festival have 
whittled down the number of entries to be judged through the years. At one point 
over fifty films were considered! Twenty was plenty enough.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Anyway, after a week of occasional dining, 
watching, and drinking together, all the jurors had become aware of and actually 
quite friendly with one other. No blood would be flowing this year, although I 
jokingly suggested that we dress up in bloodied bandages, slings, and crutches 
during the award presentation. My absurdist sense of humor was not shared with 
the more seriously-minded Festival planners.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">So, after the crayfish salad, poached egg with 
truffle oil, monkfish with pistachio sauce, and other edible delights, we got 
down to the nitty gritty. Reverted to the same three-film selection (again, no 
particular order), <i>Whale Rider</i>, <i>Vylet</i>, and <i>Jibuero</i> garnered 
five votes, <i>Hukkle</i> received four, and one each for <i>Les Diables</i> and 
the French shock drama <i>Dans Ma Peau</i>, a disturbing film about a woman's 
self-cannibalizing mood swings.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Our next step was selecting which two films we 
felt might best embodied the winning entry: <i>Hukkle</i> (6), <i>Vylet</i> (4),
<i>Jibeuro</i> (3), and <i>Dans Ma Peau</i> (1).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">You already know the final outcome, which we 
arrived at by going around the table and stating our main choice and providing a 
few sentences in support of that decision. As <i>Hukkle</i> had an extremely 
strong showing in the preliminary round, at this point someone (it might have 
been me) suggested it receive an honorable mention.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sadly, of our winners only <i>Jibeuro</i> is 
headed for U.S. theaters, having been picked up by Paramount for November 
release.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As our jury was being shuttled into the Kursaal 
Auditorium for the final ceremony, all spouses were separated from us and we 
were funneled down to the backstage area. Piers Handling and Alberto Elena had 
been selected to present our awards tonight; they joined the senior jury (Wim 
Wenders, et al) and other luminaries (Bob Hoskins, Jean Reno, Juliette Binoche, 
Jack Cardiff, all the winners) on stage right. Four of us (myself, Peter 
Scarlet, Bryony Dixon, and Angela Prudenzi) were cordoned off, alone with the 
production staff, on stage left. Local juror Ramon Saizarbitoria was a no show. 
Although we had no involvement in the evening program, we were told we HAD to 
stay there for the entire show as we were needed for a group photograph at the 
tribute's end. Damn, we wanted to watch from the audience and were about to 
mutiny before learning that we were to join EVERYONE on stage for a final 
curtain call. We were figuratively shackled offstage, marooned for a sidelong 
glance at the presenters instead of a full court press from the audience (and 
special jury seats).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Anyway, we suffered through the awkwardness of 
the situation and, sure enough, got pushed out onto the stage for the final 
photo op, with tons of silvery confetti snowing down upon us. An unfortunate 
postscript (and showcasing why we called ourselves the junior varsity jury), was 
the photo that appeared in the Festival's final daily newspaper the next day. 
The entire New Directors Jury, Alice Nellis, and Pavel Solc were all 
unceremoniously cut off from the group shot.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The celebration did continue however, and we 
partied well into the wee hours of the night.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And now that I'm back home, I'm catching up on 
my sleep.</font></p>
