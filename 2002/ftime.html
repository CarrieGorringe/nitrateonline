<meta name="description" content="Mulholland Drive - Justin Theroux wears all black. Black jeans, black t-shirt, black leather jacket, heavily black-rimmed glasses. He smokes cigarettes he rolls himself. He's sort of hipster-punk, exponentially cool and more than a little wary of the business he's in. All this makes sense, if you know that he came up in and around Washington DC's punk scene, listening to Black Flag, Minor Threat, and Fugazi. Nowadays, the Bennington College graduate is a New York-based actor, probably best known for his work on CBS's The District, but more inclined to talk about his other work, on stage in NYC and in films, for example, Mary Harron's I Shot Andy Warhol and American Psycho.

</font></span><i><font size="1" face="Verdana">interview by
<a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 8 March 2002</font></i></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700"><font size="2">Samantha 
Mumba sits in a hard-backed chair: perfect posture, perfect makeup, perfect 
smile. In fact, she hardly moves in that chair during the half-hour we're 
talking. Poised and self-possessed, the nineteen-year-old pop star has been 
performing for years. Born in Dublin to an Irish mother and Zambian father, she 
started tap dancing at age three, attended Dublin's Billie Barry Stage School 
until she was fifteen, then started singing on Irish TV shows, eventually coming 
to New York City, where she signed a contract with manager Louis Walsh. Best 
known in the U.S. for her single, &quot;I Gotta Tell You&quot; (and a big fat tour last 
summer, opening for 'NSync), Sam Mumba is now breaking into movies with <i>The 
Time Machine</i>. She plays Mara, the resilient Eloi woman who looks after Guy 
Pearce's time traveler, some 800,000 years into the future. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>Cynthia Fuchs: </b>
</i>What possessed you to want to make a movie? </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>Samantha Mumba: </b>
</i>It wasn't a choice that I made, actually. I did an article in <i>People</i> 
magazine, and the casting director saw that, and they'd been looking for the 
role for a couple of months. They asked me to do a screen test, and I did, then 
I kind of forgot about it for a couple of weeks. Then I got a phone call to come 
up to New York and do one more, and got the part. I never thought I was going to 
get a movie. It just kind of happened. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>That's 
fortuitous. It actually seems like there's pressure nowadays, if you're a young 
person in this business, to be a multi-threat performer. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>SM: </b></i>You're 
supposed to do everything! Tell me about it! But the two things are very 
different. I might try to juggle the two, or might not. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>In pop, 
you have room for self-expression (and I know you write your own lyrics), but 
there's also a lot of image-control. I imagine that there's even more management 
in movies. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>SM: </b></i>Yeah. But 
I've been very lucky in my pop career; I decide what I wear and other aspects 
about my image. But with the movie, down to the tiniest thing, it was 
scrutinized, &quot;That isn't right, that needs to be changed.&quot; But that was actually 
okay with me, because it was about somebody else, Mara. For my singing career, 
from day one, I've loved fashion and clothes, and I can't perform well if I'm 
not comfortable in something I'm wearing. Then it would be a crap performance, 
kind of wasting everybody's time. The record company agreed, and luckily, I 
don't like really dodgy stuff. So it's worked out well. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>How did 
you think about playing a fictional character?</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>SM: </b></i>I had an 
acting coach, Larry Moss, and he said at the beginning, maybe she walks 
different than you, or maybe she does little things that you don't do. So I 
loved getting to make up those details. She's very strong, and very smart, 
actually. Larry and I would go to a coffee shop and read off the script and he'd 
put into my head a lot of ideas. I couldn't even comprehend the fear that the 
Elois would have been living with, and he got me thinking how you would feel if 
that was happening. He had me laughing, crying, screaming, giving me loads to 
work with. The other Eloi are willing to go and be eaten, and she does her best 
to fight, she and her brother. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>How was 
it to have your brother play your brother in the film? </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>SM: </b></i>I was 
filming for like three or four months, and I don't like to be away from family 
for that long, so it was good because he was here and my mom was there as well. 
It made it a lot easier. And we had fun on the set. I mean, he's my little 
brother, so we had good days and bad days, but even the bad days were all right.
</font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>He's 
interested in pursuing a performance career as well? </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>SM: </b></i>Yes, he's 
more interested in the rap thing, and is just finishing his album. </font>
</span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>Well, 
it's definitely the moment for little boy rappers, with Lil Bow Wow, Romeo, and 
Corey. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>SM: </b></i>Yeah! But 
I know that he's well able to handle this, and my mom's traveling with him. 
Plus, I keep a strict look on everything, to make sure that nobody's taking 
advantage of him. It's something he's wanted to do; he saw me doing shows when I 
was young. I've been lucky, and since I had to go through it alone, I'm a lot 
stronger. I'm so happy. I love everything. Who could complain? I'm getting to 
see the world. I'm nineteen, and been to countries that some of my friends have 
never even heard of. I left school at fifteen, but I have no regrets. I've been 
preparing all my life for it, and when I got this great record deal, I couldn't 
say no. I'm not promoting children to leave school early, and there's no way I 
could have done it without a great deal and a great manager behind me. But 
there's the whole faith thing: I think everything happens for a reason. It's too 
weird how all this has happened. It just doesn't make sense: you couldn't have 
planned it. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>During 
your performance for the film, was it weird to be acting with special effects, 
as opposed to people? </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>SM: </b></i>A little 
bit. But having said that, they built the seventy-foot cliff face, so we were on 
a location. There were a lot of effects and green screen, but there was always 
some bit of props to make us feel we were there. And the Morlocks were scary, 
genuinely, so that made my work easier. That and being swallowed into the sand 
pit! I wasn't acting: I was scared. It was a whole contraption, one of those big 
metal containers, and they buried it. And there was a suction thing, to drag us 
under, and as soon as we got under, there were two guys there to drag me out and 
up a ladder, so I could get air. It was a brief moment, but I had earplugs and 
nose plugs to keep the sand out. It was very clever. It wasn't even sand, it was 
really light and shiny. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>What was 
your experience with learning the Eloi language? </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>SM: </b></i>It was a 
little tricky, because you couldn't just learn it phonetically, you had to 
convey emotions. Because there were no subtitles in the movie, you had translate 
it, so people could understand by how your voice went up or down or your facial 
expressions. That was probably the trickiest part for me. And there was a 
language person on the set, so I couldn't slip in any made-up words. </font>
</span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>Mara, 
like the other Eloi, is always living on the edge of two realities -- the dreams 
sent by the Morlocks, and the day to day life that everyone knows will end.
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>SM: </b></i>Yes, 
Jeremy Irons' character is controlling our minds and our dreams, he knows 
everything we're doing. It's creepy. But it was good to work with actors like 
him and Guy Pearce; I learned a lot just by watching everything. </font></span>
</p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>How 
different is touring and this on-set existence? </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>SM: </b></i>The 'NSync 
[tour] was brilliant, the best time I've had, in terms of being on big turbos, 
with my dancers who are my friends, just having loads of fun, performing in 
front of thousands of people. Normally, though, you're not performing that much. 
You're doing interviews and TV shows, not so much in front of a live audience. 
The movie experience is so different. Even doing interviews is different: now 
I'm talking about Mara, not me. It gets boring talking about yourself all the 
time. I definitely want to keep the two separate. Playing a singer in a movie -- 
that doesn't appeal to me. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>Do you 
have an idea of what you might pursue in the future? </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>SM: </b></i>You know 
what, I don't have a plan. I'm just going along with what's happening. I do love 
playing characters, though, and I want to play roles that are very, very 
different from me and from each other. Though I did see some similarities 
between myself and Mara, but the fact that she's 800,000 years beyond, I though 
that divided us! I want to try loads of different things. I'd like to play a 
real bitch, a real baddie. I want to be in a comedy, maybe a romantic story, or 
a vampire. And action, I do like that. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>You did a 
lot of running and jumping in this movie.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>SM: </b></i>Yeah. 
What took it out of me was the tunnel where we're running away from the Morlocks 
at the end. We were doing take after take after take. It was well worth it, 
seeing the final outcome, but it was really tiring. And it was kind of scary 
because the ground was really uneven and you couldn't really be looking down. 
I'm surprised myself and Guy didn't go flying. The cameraman had a couple of 
near misses, because he had a big camera and was trying to keep up with us.
</font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>When 
you're touring, you don't have much trouble staying fit -- all that dancing.
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>SM: </b></i>That's my 
lot, really. I'm going to try this year to be a little more fit, start going to 
the gym. Normally, when I'm dancing every day, I built up my stamina. Singing 
and dancing at the same time is not the easiest thing to do, <i>and</i> not 
looking like you're about to pass out! And being on the road with 'NSync -- that 
amazes me. It's really hard, the dancing they do. They're a good example; I was 
blown away when I first saw their show, just godsmacked. You do it different in 
America, it's always kind of on a bigger scale. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>You 
started tap dancing when you were three: you knew then that this is what you 
needed to do? </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>SM: </b></i>Oh yeah. 
Initially, my parents put me in it because they thought, okay, if she's doing 
shows and performing, then maybe, when she grows up and goes to job interviews, 
she'll be confident and be able to present herself well. But once I went, I 
loved it. It was always a natural thing to do. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>And for 
writing, you do lyrics? </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>SM: </b></i>Yes, I've 
just finished my second album with the same producers [Anders Bagge and Arnthor 
Birgisson]. We just kind of sit around together and write down all my ideas, 
with rhymes that come to me, and they write down their ideas. I started writing 
when I was fifteen. I'd never thought about it before, and my publisher said, 
you should think about writing, and I thought, &quot;Yeah, maybe I should.&quot; For a 
couple of weeks before I was do to go into the studio to meet with the 
producers, I was writing loads at night, mostly just before I was going to bed, 
thinking about what I wanted to sing about. And I went in with all this stuff, 
and they loved everything I had. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>Pop comes 
with this stigma, of course, that the performers don't &quot;create&quot; their music.
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>SM: </b></i>Oh we all 
come from a factory, actually! But I think pop is something that's always going 
to be around, it's a tried and tested formula. I love pop, for what it is, I'm 
all into trying new things. Maybe in the future, with other albums, I'll 
experiment with different things. But for now, pop suits me. I don't know why 
people make such a big deal over pop -- if you don't like it, don't listen to 
it. And for me, I like the way it's working now. I wouldn't dream of putting 
myself down as a producer on an album. I wouldn't have a clue. There's too many 
buttons on that dashboard, and I leave that to people who specialize in it. The 
team I have is great, to want to do everything just seems selfish. </font>
</span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>Do you 
think about who your audience might be when you write or perform? </font></span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>SM: </b></i>I don't 
think about their ages. I might have little old ladies and little children that 
can barely speak. It's so varied, which is a good thing. I think of it, like, 
here I am, and whoever enjoys it can come on the bandwagon. </font></span></p>
