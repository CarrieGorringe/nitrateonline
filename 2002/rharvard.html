            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 13 September 2002</i></font><p>
            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the farcical comedy <i>Stealing 
            Harvard</i>, Jason Lee plays John, a young guy who, on the eve of 
            getting married and buying a house to settle down in, is called upon 
            to make good on a promise he made long ago to his niece -- that he 
            would pay for her to go to Harvard should she ever get accepted to 
            go to school, there.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Since the niece is played in the 
            film by Tammy Blanchard -- the wonderful performer who appeared in 
            last year's TV film <i>Life with Judy Garland</i>, and who's 
            adorable, here -- the conceit works. And Jason Lee, who's getting 
            better and better as a performer, gets down perfectly the look and 
            feel of someone who is on the verge of accepting, and falling into, 
            domestic mediocrity -- the fixed smile, resigned look, and 
            sleepwalker motions of someone who's living comfortably with a nice 
            woman (Leslie Mann) -- who runs a gift basket business from home 
            (&quot;Do you think the biscotti make it too busy?&quot;) -- and a job that 
            pays well and where too much is never expected from him. When John 
            has to come up with the money for his niece -- $30,000 worth -- it 
            saves him from making the leap over the precipice. (And, to his -- 
            and our -- pleasant surprise, he also finds out that his bride-to-be 
            isn't as square as he thought she was.) This happens when he turns 
            to his noncomformist, outlaw-spirited friend Duff, the kind of part 
            that, not so long ago, Michael Keaton or Bill Murray would've nailed 
            in a flash. Here, the part has been cast with Tom Green, and the 
            only question is, did the filmmakers agree to bring him onboard or 
            was he thrust upon them? The film was directed by Bruce McCulloch, 
            one of the talented members of the Canadian comedy group <i>Kids in 
            the Hall </i>(McCulloch also turns up in this film as a lawyer, in 
            the closing scenes), and he knows how to shape comedic scenes and 
            get them to play; the movie, up until Green's first appearance, has 
            the makings of a perfectly decent comedy (and it still does after 
            that point, too). But it cannot be denied: Green ruins every single 
            scene he's in, and the film, while it's not completely wreaked, is 
            seriously compromised by that.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With the wide eyes of a Benzedrine 
            addict, Green works himself up to a rigid, strangulated, trembling 
            state of near-hysteria. He lunges his way through scenes, grabbing 
            at any and all ideas, fumbling around with one, dropping it and then 
            nabbing at another one. It's not performing, it's scrambling, and, 
            since he doesn't give you any way to follow what he's doing, it must 
            be extremely annoying for a lot of people to watch. In fact, Green 
            seems to be acting this way ON PURPOSE, which would make a lot of 
            people wonder more: If he can't bother to perform in a coherent 
            fashion, why should we be expected to spend our time and attention 
            watching him? Green doesn't really work with the other performers 
            (Lee, in fact, seems to be keeping a healthy distance from him most 
            of the time), because, in order to do what he's doing, he has to 
            throw up an invisible shield around himself to turn the focus in. 
            He's a guy who seems to be trying to turn a form of utter 
            desperation into a shtick. And, since his character, here, is a jerk 
            (albeit a lovable one -- Duff is initially described as &quot;a man who's 
            ideas are so dumb, they're brilliant&quot;), it's doubly unappealing.
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As for the filmmakers, they're left 
            in a lurch: to paraphrase from another source (a &quot;Tom Slick&quot; 
            cartoon, in fact), the movie's got a hole in it the size of a 50 
            cent piece, and all they've got to fix it with are two quarters. As 
            for Green, he may turn into a curious anomaly, like Bill Dana's Jose 
            Jimenez character in the 1960s. But Green also projects a certain 
            kind of hostility, which makes you gotta wonder: what is going to 
            happen to this guy? Who is going to be able to use him? Sam Kinison 
            and Don Rickles could get hostile, too, but you at least knew what 
            they were hostile about. Tom Green practices a sort of onanistic 
            hostility -- he gets himself into a state not because of anything in 
            particular, but just because. He's like a kid still bouncing up and 
            down on his bed in his suburban bedroom, meaninglessly play-acting 
            to the walls. Or, as on a recent late-night rerun of his MTV show, 
            putting a coffee filter on his head and pretending to be an Imperial 
            storm-trooper from <i>Star Wars</i>. Monica Lewinsky was with him on 
            that segment of the show, and, despite his best entreaties, not even 
            she would do that.</font></td>
