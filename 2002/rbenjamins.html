            </blockquote>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The genius of 
            hiphop -- the brilliant wordplay, the rhythmic complexities, the 
            incisive social and political analysis, the humor -- rarely 
            translates to film form. That's not to say that there aren't 
            ambitious and smart hiphop movies, only that most movies, especially 
            most movies that get distribution, take an easy route, stereotyping 
            hiphop attitudes and characters into stereotypical terms -- 
            bling-bling, banging, pimping, a*s-shaking. You know, tired. <i>All 
            About the Benjamins</i> includes these popular elements -- 
            producer-writer-star Ice Cube surely understands the business he's 
            in -- but it mostly does so with a sense of self-consciousness and 
            wit, so you don't have to feel mad about it. On top of that, it 
            features some of hiphop's genius, in its mostly clever script, 
            stylish visuals, class critique, and emphasis on charismatic 
            performances to carry the day. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Directed by 
            Kevin Bray (who has previously directed videos for J. Lo, the Fugees, 
            and 'NSync), the movie has an obvious and amusing visual 
            aggressiveness. It begins with a scene that looks a little like it 
            might be <i>Friday In the Trailer Park</i>. Ice Cube is playing a 
            Miami-based bounty hunter named Bucum (most often pronounced &quot;Book 'em,&quot; 
            as in &quot;Dan-o&quot;) Jackson. He makes his way through an evergladesy back 
            lot, tracking a lowdown dirty-dog (Anthony Michael Hall), instantly 
            identifiable as such when the camera pans to show the Confederate 
            flag in his window and the Bugs Bunny-and-Sambo cartoon on his TV, 
            that makes him laugh uproariously. Bucum comes in through the back, 
            only to be ambushed by dirty-dog's scary 
            professional-wrestler-looking girlfriend, wearing daisy dukes and 
            carrying a shotgun. During the ensuing tussle, Bucum crashes through 
            the confederate flag window, punches out scary wrestler girlfriend, 
            and beats down dirty-dog. The scene ends when Bucum tasers 
            dirty-dog's nuts. And for anyone who's been wondering what Anthony 
            Michael Hall has been up to, well, now you know. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">All this 
            action-packedness -- enhanced by mobile camerawork and flashy 
            fast-cuts -- has nothing to do with anything except that it shows 
            off Bucum's determination and skills -- and he lots of both. So 
            here's the thing: Bucum wants out of this rinky-dink business where 
            he's tracking bail jumpers, in order to open his own Private 
            Detective's Agency. He's not aiming high, exactly, but he's aiming 
            more or less seriously. And then he gets tangled up with small time 
            bail-jumper Reggie Wright (Mike Epps, Cube's partner in <i>Next 
            Friday</i> and the upcoming <i>Friday After Next</i>). And well, 
            plans get messed up. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">While Bucum is 
            chasing Reggie, they inadvertently run into a bizarre and bloody 
            diamond heist, though they don't know that's what it is (you, on the 
            other hand, get to see the murders. The mismatched perpetrators -- 
            Ursula (Carmen Chaplin) and Ramose (Roger Guenveur Smith) -- are 
            unaware as they flee the scene that they have a stowaway, namely, 
            Reggie, who is in turn thinking he's cleverly eluding Bucum. Once 
            he's discovered in the back of the van, Reggie panics and drops his 
            wallet, which just happens to have a winning (to the tune of $60 
            million) lottery ticket in it. This series of events gives the 
            partners-to-be sort-of parallel reasons to be involved in tracking 
            down the thieves: Reggie wants his wallet and Bucum (who doesn't 
            believe the lottery ticket story) wants the collar, which, he says 
            naively, will give him the big-ups publicity he needs to start up 
            his detective agency. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">In fact, the 
            lottery ticket story is true, and it's a ticket whose numbers Reggie 
            has been playing for years, for his hot-mama girlfriend Gina (Eva 
            Mendes). Aside from her role in picking the numbers, Gina's primary 
            function is a matter of formula: in a buddy film, at least one of 
            buddies must involved in a long-term, straight-asserting 
            relationship; otherwise, all that close-contact activity can be 
            nervous-making. And true to form, <i>Benjamins</i> includes a 
            briefly running gag about Reggie biting Bucum's nipple during a 
            fight in a parking lot -- hardy har -- while Gina stands to the 
            side, telling Reggie to stop because, as she says repeatedly, &quot;Baby, 
            you can't fight!&quot; </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Gina is 
            slightly more energetic and slightly less incidental than most girls 
            in buddy films (think, maybe: Tea Leoni in <i>Bad Boys</i>). But 
            even if she gets her own little pieces of action with Bucum's 
            sidekick Pam (Valarie Rae Miller, playing her <i>Dark Angel</i> 
            character, Original Cindy, only straight), it's safe to say that the 
            buddy formula remains intact in this film.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">To enable this 
            plot to roll out, the diamond thieves, so inept and so 
            reprehensible, provide numerous occasions for conflict and physical 
            displays. And, as if it matters, they have their own troubles: angry 
            at their botched job, their boss, a Eurotrashy villain called 
            Williamson (Tommy Flanagan), exacts brutal Eurotrashy vengeance, 
            clobbering Ursula in the face and shooting Ramose, point blank, in 
            the wrist. This bit of sadism leads to more, at Ramose's expense: 
            when Bucum and Reggie catch him doing something or other, they haul 
            him into the bathroom, handcuff him to the shower rod, and take 
            turns torturing him by twisting his metal-brace screws into the 
            flesh of his arm. There's something perverse about this particular 
            brand of comedy and boy-bonding (Gina remains in the other room, 
            making faces as she hears Bad Guy's wails of agony), but it's plain 
            that Bucum and Reggie share a certain sensibility, much as they deny 
            their affiliation. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The more they 
            fight with one another, the more they seem destined to be together. 
            And the film, erratic and badly plotted as it is, relies heavily on 
            the considerable chemistry between Epps and Cube: sometimes it's 
            just fun to watch them entertain one another, which they clearly do. 
            Just so, the film is structured like a romance, complete with a 
            series of breakups and make-ups (and the usual eroto-phobic jokes 
            along the way: when Bucum tells Reggie to retrieve his keys, &quot;Dig in 
            my pockets,&quot; Reggie makes all kinds of noise about it; and when 
            Bucum tells Reggie to shoot at someone, he answers, &quot;Who you think I 
            am, Mel Gibson!?&quot;). All the while, the partners work toward what is 
            ultimately the same end, namely, to make enough benjamins to move on 
            up. Reggie is most obviously in need of cash money (the small 
            apartment he shares with Gina is filled with candles and shrines 
            that she uses to pray for the lottery to come through). His 
            neighborhood is also rough, embodied by a rough-tough corner kid (Lil 
            Bow Wow, in his acting &quot;debut&quot;), who is apparently willing to sell 
            information to everyone, including 5-0. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">At the same 
            time, Bucum has his own hard background and resulting impulse to get 
            over (the manifestly odious Williamson is a yacht dealer when he's 
            not stealing diamonds). Bucum's previous job -- cleaning up at the 
            dog track -- most obviously serves to establish a spectacular, 
            multi-tiered setting for one of several shootouts, more importantly, 
            it establishes his motivation: he sees what the rich folks have and 
            wants a piece. You glimpse Bucum's ambition (and his peculiar 
            tastes) in his fondness for expensive tropical fish; since they're 
            in Miami, most every interior has an aquarium in it, all of which 
            must be shot up or run down, preferably in slow motion; at one 
            point, someone actually shoots a bazooka at a fish truck, so that 
            dead fish fly through the air, landing whump-whump-whump all over 
            Bucum's &quot;raggedy-ass&quot; Impala. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Cleverly, it's 
            in these details -- the car, the fish, the yachts -- that the film 
            actually makes its class analysis most evident. While by the end, 
            it's winding down abruptly, like it's run out of ideas, it has also 
            made its points.&nbsp; Underlining the silliness of the bling-bling, <i>
            All About the Benjamins</i> also shows its importance in the 
            day-to-day world. Class is a function of performance and appearance 
            as much as it is a function of material wealth -- if you look the 
            part, the old school folks get nervous, but they have to move over. 
            And this is the hiphop bling-bling game, forcing the old school 
            folks to move over, to recognize that all benjamins come with costs 
            as well as rewards. </font></span>
