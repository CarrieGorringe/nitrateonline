            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Christopher Nolan's first
            mainstream Hollywood production, following on his phenomenally
            successfully, time/mind-bending <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Memento</i>
            and its intriguing featurette precursor <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Following</i>,
            is an inspired, albeit (purposedly) glacially paced adaptation of
            Scandinavian filmmaker Erik Skjoldbjaerg's debut feature—also
            entitled <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Insomnia</i>—that
            wowed audiences at Cannes a few years back. Simply put: wow redux.
            As expected, Nolan exposes a solid handle on a fairly linear
            (finally) thriller, so audiences will not need as much brainpower
            that they bookmarked for <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Memento</i>
            to enjoy this novel murder mystery. It's one heck of an absorbing,
            haunting piece, even occasionally grizzly, that mesmerizes with its
            taunt story and masterful performances by three Academy Award
            winning actors. You get acting in spades.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Moving the locale from Northern
            Norway to a small Alaskan town named Night Mute, the cast is
            similarly Americanized, featuring Al Pacino as veteran L.A.
            detective Will Dormer, subtly forced to handle a murder case far off
            his home turf. Accompanied by his younger partner Hap Eckhart
            (Martin Donovan), they alight at a civilization's-end encampment
            protected by Chief Nyback (Paul Dooley), an old acquaintance of
            Will's, in need of a city cop's expertise in unearthing the killer
            of a local teenager. The hard-nosed cop immediately finds his world
            out of kilter by the constant sunlight, mistaking 10 P.M. for 10
            A.M. In the course of his week's stay, he suffers night after night
            of sleeplessness, his body and mind unable to adjust to the bright
            environment. This, more than the rest of the plotting, is what
            stretches the film's pacing, as Nolan is determined to show us
            Dormer's ever-drooping eyes, increasingly grubby demeanor, and
            blood-drained face as he battles the mind-numbing elements beyond
            his psychological control. (Too bad he didn't pray for rain.)</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Whereas the original film merely
            plops a sexually-repressed Swedish cop (Stellan Skarsgård) in a
            cultural outpost off Norway's beaten path, Dormer's baggage is
            emptied of most of the Scandinavian version's sexual underpinnings
            in favor of a semi-moral, occupational turpitude involving some
            previous, less-than-honorable police work. This also changes the
            entire relationship between the partners and adds another
            psychological level that mires the standout cop in an ever-spiraling
            tailspin of depression, regret, and doubt.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For Pacino, no slouch in any role,
            particularly that of a law officer (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Serpico</i>,
            <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Heat</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Sea of Love</i>), it's terribly exciting to watch him play against
            expectation and out of water. He's this summer's Denzel Washington;
            perhaps not as ugly, but certainly wart-worthy. As a widely
            respected sleuth, his strong-willed character is caught with his
            hand in a deadly cookie jar, wherein <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Insomnia</i>
            becomes submerged in a battle of withering wits. Where cat and mouse
            play role-reversal mind games. The mouse is quite mighty, and
            cunning—a reclusive local author named Walter Finch—an extremely
            focused, budding sociopath marvelously molded all the more
            malevolent in the capable hands of Robin Williams. He sheds ALL
            comic pretensions as a cold-blooded rodent completely capable of
            eluding the traps Dormer sets for him, of turning the tables on a
            pursuer who spilled a secret to someone who definitely knows how to
            put it to his best advantage.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In upgrading Williams' character
            for American audiences, he has become a clever, coldly calculating
            manipulator. And, yes, Hilary Swank is also top-billed (and her role
            likewise expanded, but barely enough). She gives a strong showing as
            a observant local cop, Ellie Burr, a by-the-book student of human
            nature whose role model has just arrived in town.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But God bless Al Pacino, whose
            dogged-day iron Will rusts with each advancing minute, the crazy
            light hopelessly over-sensitizing his sense of hearing, before
            summoning up one last street cop's intuition.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">First-time screenwriter Hillary
            Seitz certainly does a yeowoman's job in cleaning up some of the
            motivations missing from the original, expanding the film's scope
            and impulses. Nolan connects all the emotional dots, pushes his cast
            to stellar effect, and then offers up some stunning set pieces. A
            stakeout gone awry in a jagged, fog-covered beach, where audience
            and cops are all straining for a point of focus, is exceedingly
            tense. While this was more than effectively borrowed from the
            original version, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Insomnia</i>
            American-style adds a breathtaking pursuit across a swiftly moving
            logjam, the timber becoming a thunderous obstacle to prey…and life.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>
