            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Humiliation, control, madness, 
            power and perception scorch Michael Haneke's implosive <i>The Piano 
            Teacher</i>, which earned best actor and actress prizes for co-stars 
            Isabelle Huppert and Benoit Magimel at the 2001 Cannes Film 
            Festival.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Rightly so, too. The film relies so 
            diligently upon Huppert's magnetic self-sufficiency and perfunctory 
            pragmatism to alternately draw us in and equally taunt us that it's 
            doubtful we have seen a portrait of disturbing coldness and clarity 
            spew such a mess of emotional disarray, disturbance, disconnection 
            and pain onscreen. Haneke, working from the novel <b><i>La Pianiste</i>
            </b>by Austrian writer Elfriede Jelinek, reaches deep into the 
            shaded, hidden bowels of Huppert's extraordinary talent and emerges 
            with an unforgettable film that literally and viscerally threatens.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In <i>The Piano Teacher</i>, 
            Huppert is Erika Kohut, a cool, autumnally dressed musical genius 
            who teaches at the prestigious Vienna Conservatory. By day she 
            pummels her students with clipped verbal assaults designed to tear 
            away confidence and destroy youthful dreams. &quot;A wrong note in 
            Beethoven is better than a bad interpretation,&quot; she tells one young 
            man as she stands imperious and disapproving at a window. Erika 
            knows how to hit the most hurtful, fragile places in people, 
            perhaps, as we learn, because she herself has had the same cuts and 
            stabs inflicted upon her.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Despite her acclaim, talent and 
            age, Erika still resides with her widowed mother (Annie Girardot), a 
            nightmare of maternal obsessiveness, possessiveness and accusation. 
            The pair spar and slap, confront and terrorize each other, only to 
            fall into their womb of a bed where they slumber the end of each day 
            away.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">By night, however, far from 
            mother's dark and furious clutches, Erika is something else. She 
            patrols tony porno houses, inhaling the flaking semen that soaks the 
            gentleman clientele's disposed kleenex, all while devouring a menu 
            of hard core fare. She creeps up on couples making love at the 
            drive-in, urinating her voyeuristic relief next to the rocking car. 
            And she mutilates her genitals with a razor kept as neatly wrapped 
            as her hair or her own surface emotions, only to be met with a 
            disapproving &quot;that's not very appetizing&quot; from her mother when a 
            rivulet of blood escapes and rolls down her thigh at the dinner 
            table.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Things turn for Erika when Walter 
            Klemmer (Magimel) appears at a recital in which she is performing. 
            He's a tall Aryan speciman, blond and windswept, and after a couple 
            of brisk, contentious interchanges, imagines he's in love with this 
            unattainable woman. At first this wholesome golden boy, obviously 
            aware of his charms and cleverness and quite used to the hunt of 
            seduction and conquest, hardly seems in Erika's league. But her 
            demands, designed to give her maximum control of a sexual liaison, 
            open a Pandora's Box of and Walter's own tricky demons, long 
            percolating, take their place in this roundelay of neurosis and 
            struggle.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Author Jelinek has said that 
            Erika's story &quot;is the bloody consequence of the fact that a woman is 
            not allowed to live if she claims a right that is not hers and that 
            she obtains only in the rarest of cases: artistic fame. The right to 
            choose a man and to dictate how he tortures her - that is, 
            domination in submission - this she is not permitted.&quot; If she 
            initially begins as Walter's tormentor she ends as her own, and as 
            women have done throughout history - unlike their male counterparts 
            who have external outlets in which to vent self-loathing and agony - 
            turns her impotence inward. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Many have stated that they feel 
            little compassion for this monster of a woman but within her - and 
            so extraordinarily unfolded by Haneke and Huppert - is the result of 
            her own emotional abuse. Who is the victim here? It's hard to tell. 
            The shapes and roles shift and sway, victim and aggressor wear 
            different cloaks at every act. But Haneke gives us, in several 
            instances, Huppert's face in extreme close-up; she listens to her 
            beloved music and with slight, minutely visible flickers, tell us 
            tomes about her life, her repression, pain and immature sexual 
            fantasy, the frustration and unbridled rage at those who wait to 
            usurp her seat in the world of musical academia or in Walter's arms. 
            Her ability to wound those who threaten her is within her immediate, 
            childish reach makes her less monster than irretrievably damaged 
            goods, and Huppert revels in the ultimate act of Erika's inevitable 
            humiliation with skinned and raw honesty. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Haneke has accomplished what, 
            perhaps only the French director Claude Chabrol has done with 
            Huppert's sturdy, durable waifishness (though she's got an adept 
            sense of timing in, not surprisingly, dark comedy) because he also 
            mines the wit in her aloofness. She was a mysteriously humorous 
            presence in Hal Hartley's <i>Amateur</i> and added much to Bertrand 
            Tavernier's <b><i>Coup de Torchon</i></b> and while lately has 
            worked with Benoit Jacquot, she's made films with two of my favorite 
            directors, Francois Ozon and Olivier Assayas, who have an innate 
            feel for women characters. And though people rarely think of her 
            having a sense of humor it's indisputable that she has a great sense 
            of irony. When Huppert is stranded in the soap operatics of, say, 
            Diane Kurys' <i>Love After Love</i>, we hardly believe she'd give up 
            control for an everyday affair and at least, not in the 
            traditionally mundane and formulaic film female fashion. In her 
            self-containment she needs an outlet that fringes on the perverse 
            and Chabrol - in films like <b><i>La Cérémonie</i></b>, <b><i>
            Violette Nozière </i></b>and <b><i>Une Affaire des Femmes</i></b> - 
            and now Haneke, who also mines much humor in his dark tale - have 
            given her the space to roam this elusive, complex, pathological 
            terrain. It's a performance that cannot be shied away from, nor 
            ignored, and in its truth it churns our stomachs with its ugliness 
            and beauty. Like love it both attracts and repulses. </font>
