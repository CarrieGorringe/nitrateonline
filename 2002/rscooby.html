            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The first single off the 
            much-promoted Scooby Doo soundtrack CD is OutKast's &quot;Land of a 
            Million Drums,&quot; a vivid, sinuous, fast-beat delight. The video for 
            the song includes a few scenes from Raja Gosnell's movie, mostly 
            having to do with the implied stoner activities of Shaggy (Matthew 
            Lillard) and digital Scooby (voiced by Scott Innes), producing much 
            smoke in the Mystery Machine. As Big Boi puts it, &quot;Stuck in this 
            green mini-van with my lungs in a chokehold. / Shaggy, pass the 
            boombastic!&quot; </font></b></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The video shows 
            Big Boi and the irrepressible Andre 3000, along with featured guest 
            Killer Mike and someone wearing ghoulish whiteface, in a series of 
            haunted-housey-mysteries-in-need-of-solving scenarios, all the while 
            explaining just why they're caught up in all this corniness. For one 
            thing, they're making art for their kids: as Big Boi raps, &quot;I pick 
            up the mic and rock it while I'm sober, / For the rated G exposure, 
            if you listen what I'm tryin' to told ya, / We fathers with seeds of 
            our own.&quot; </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Amen to all 
            that good dad business. Sadly, OutKast's latest bit of brilliance 
            has precious little to do with the live action incarnation of <i>
            Scooby Doo</i>, currently making scads of money at the box office. 
            Indeed, Warner Bros.' film, with script attributed to James Gunn, 
            appears to be a gigantic marketing concept, or, more precisely, an 
            amalgamation of concepts, tied in with AOL, Six Flags Theme Parks, 
            assorted bakeries who sell Scooby Snacks, <i>InStyle</i>, <i>
            Entertainment Weekly</i>, and of course, MTV, among others. The 
            result is a promotional vehicle that vaguely resembles a movie, that 
            is, including a series of mostly unrelated escapades, compiled 
            soundtrack, CGI sets and effects, and young actors who must have 
            better things to do with their time. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">It hardly seems 
            worthwhile to complain about <i>Scooby Doo</i>'s narrative 
            incoherence. As such, it follows, more or less, the formula laid 
            down by the cartoon series, whose longtime admirers (and their young 
            children) are the presumed consumers of this product. The first 
            scene is probably the sharpest, as Gang appears mid-episode, in 
            which they are solving a mystery, the &quot;Case of the Luna Ghost.&quot; 
            Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar) has been captured by the titular 
            Ghost, which mostly means she's being hauled around an abandoned 
            warehouse or factory of some kind, fretting that she's playing 
            damsel in distress yet again. Meanwhile, Scooby and Shaggy pursued, 
            scaring themselves as much as anyone is scaring them. And oh yes, 
            charmingly closeted Ken-doll Fred (Freddie Prinze Jr.) and slightly 
            less closeted smarty-pants Velma (Linda Cardellini) are paired off 
            per usual, eventually saving the day, so that Fred can take credit 
            and Velma can feel frustrated by his self-loving routine.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">That he takes 
            said credit before a gaggle of fans led by Pamela Anderson is one of 
            the film's few straight-up pleasures -- for the bizarre reason that 
            Pam appears as a welcome human element amid all the preposterousness 
            surrounding her. Maybe it's a matter of scale.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">No matter: she 
            spends under a minute on screen before the film moves on to what 
            passes as its &quot;plot&quot; (Bye, bye, dear Pam! We miss you!), namely, 
            that the Gang breaks up, due to boredom with their samey-same roles 
            and jealousy of one another. You know, it's <i>Behind the Music</i>, 
            for cartoons (an idea that <i>The Simpsons</i> has already covered, 
            nicely). Cut to &quot;2 Years Later,&quot; on some beachfront, as Scooby and 
            Shaggy are roasting eggplant patties and buns (so as to motivate the 
            smoke puffing from the Mystery Machine) and they get word that a 
            dire mystery is brewing, a mystery in need of their special 
            ghost-busting skills.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">As it turns 
            out, all the ex-Gang members are receiving the same summons, from 
            the very creepy Emil Mondavarious (Rowan Atkinson), owner of a 
            spring-break resort called Spooky Island (certainly named like the 
            place <i>I'd</i> want to spend my spring break!). Sullenly, the kids 
            agree to work together one more time, each insisting that he or she 
            is doing so only to prove to the others just how splendiferously 
            independent he or she has become in the time they have been apart. 
            Just so, the newly kung-fu-trained Daphne informs her skeptical 
            compatriots, &quot;I've transformed my body into a dangerous weapon.&quot; 
            More power to her.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">On the island, 
            the plot descends still further into murky nonsense. The mystery to 
            be solved ostensibly has to do with the ooky way that young visitors 
            arrive seeming like regular, self-involved, obnoxious kids, and 
            leave like zombies, their mindless sameness and frightening 
            willingness to obey all orders marked by the fact that they all 
            speak in some slang approximating hiphop, saying things like, you 
            know, &quot;Word!&quot; </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Resolute in 
            their mission to best one another, the rather ignores the rather 
            alarming body-painted voodoo-priest-type-villain who lords over the 
            all-night &quot;party.&quot; Daph, Fred, Velma, and Shaggy then do what they 
            always do, which is to &quot;split up,&quot; so that each can run into his or 
            her own particular danger, before they come back together and 
            proclaim their loyalty forever (or, as Shaggy puts it, again and 
            again, &quot;Friends never quit&quot;). Thus, Scooby heads into a dark forest 
            in search of a promised bag of hamburgers, Velma and Fred go in 
            different directions inside the haunted mansion, and Daphne wanders 
            a beach until she stumbles on a voodoo-man (Miguel Nuñez, Jr.) 
            midway through a chicken ritual. As it happens, his chicken is 
            store-bought, pre-plucked and ready for roasting, a detail she can't 
            help but note. Voodoo-man hits back, ominously: &quot;Go home before evil 
            befalls your skinny little aerobicized booty.&quot; </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Okay, so you 
            get the idea -- Spooky Island is a place where white kids are 
            menaced not only by turning into hiphop-speaking automatons, but 
            also by any number of voodoo-inclined rapscallions, at once sinister 
            and goofy. The Gang discovers that this is all part of a scheme to 
            steal kids' souls -- a lot like what happened in <i>Josie and the 
            Pussycats</i>, actually, though here the organization of events is 
            considerably less clever. No doubt the most alarming moment comes 
            when the Gang is beset by the chief vehicle for soul-theft, who is 
            none other than Sugar Ray. The band performs for a bit and then Mark 
            McGrath leaps off the stage, leading his boys in hot pursuit of poor 
            Velma. Now that is some scary sh*t! </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">It turns out 
            that McGrath and company are only flunkies for a needlessly 
            elaborate plot to steal kids' souls, in order to grant Mondavarious 
            some kind of world-dominating power. Or something like that. It's 
            actually hard to care much about any of the details, since the 
            larger picture is so dull. Where are those million drums when you 
            need them? </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Aside from the 
            completely lame hiphop-slang gimmick (white kids turning black: ahhh!), 
            the film's major disappointment is the decision by someone to omit 
            the lesbian kiss between Velma and Daphne. The occasion does present 
            itself, when the souls stolen from the Gang's bodies all fly about 
            and land, momentarily in one another's, allowing for comic 
            references (mostly by the boys in girls' bodies, of course) 
            concerning breasts and ensuing titillation. But for whatever reason, 
            Velma is not outed, even as a feeble transgender joke. Instead, 
            she's paired off with a boy, as Fred and Daphne get to smooch, and 
            Shaggy finds a girl, all leaving poor Scooby out in the cold. </font>
