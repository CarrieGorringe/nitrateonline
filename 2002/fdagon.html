</font><font face="Verdana" size="4">Interview with Stuart Gordon<br>
</font><i><font size="1" face="Verdana">interview by <a href="../kj.html" target="_top">KJ 
Doughton</a>, 21 June 2002</font></i></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">With his burly 
frame, graying beard, and jolly, welcoming manner, filmmaker Stuart Gordon could 
almost be mistaken for Santa Claus. </font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Or rather, Santa <i>Claws</i>. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After all, this <i>is</i> the director who gave 
us <i>Re-Animator</i> (1985), a film featuring a severed head attempting to get 
intimate with a shackled female love interest. He also conjured forth <i>From 
Beyond</i> (1986), where snake-like, phallic pineal glands sprout from 
foreheads, and scientists melt into puddles of gelatinous slime like the Wicked 
Witch of the West. Then there’s <i>Dagon</i> (2001), Gordon’s most recent foray 
into fear, where unknowing visitors are tormented by macabre, scaly fish people 
with human sacrifice on their minds, in a Spanish seaside village.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Seattle’s Grand Illusion Theater is the latest 
tour stop on the cult-director’s trek to promote <i>Dagon</i>, and the compact, 
funky art house tucked into a University District corner is a fitting shrine to 
his films. A block south of the earthy cinema rests a candlelit decor shop 
called Gargoyles, full of gothic, stone statues that conjure forth the doomy 
vibe of a Transylvanian cemetery. The theater itself hosts a cramped, 
claustrophobic screening room about the size of a funeral parlor, and its wooden 
ceiling is punctuated by square, symmetrical engravings... almost like the lid 
of a stylish coffin. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s eleven o’clock p.m., and Gordon’s admirers 
have filtered in from the &quot;U&quot; District’s dark streets to claim most of The Grand 
Illusion’s seats and attend <i>Dagon</i>’s northwest premiere. Some are donned in 
black capes and white pancake makeup, as if decked out for Ozzfest 2002. Others 
sport more benign, college student fashions, listening attentively as the 
director introduces his latest stylish descent into movie madness. As with <i>
Re-Animator</i>, From <i>Beyond</i>, and <i>Castle Freak</i> (1995) before it,
<i>Dagon </i>takes its premise from the celebrated author H.P. Lovecraft. This 
scream scribe tormented readers with his sinister, unsavory melting pot of sea 
demons and over-the-edge scientists before Stephen King was even a ghastly glint 
in his papa’s eye. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;This one was literally fifteen years in the 
making,&quot; Gordon laughs, enthusiasm beaming from his expressive, crinkled eyes. 
&quot;We’d take the premise to studios, and they’d tell us that it was just too damn 
weird. ‘Make the fish people into werewolves’, they would say, ‘and we’ll 
greenlight it tomorrow’.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Although the horror icon’s speech is intensely 
articulate and controlled, he appears relaxed and approachable, more like a 
teddy bear than one of the crazed mad doctors that inhabit his ghoulish 
projects. The only thing remotely maniacal about the man is his devilish sense 
of humor. &quot;When I started this movie,&quot; he explains, pointing to his hairless, 
Kojak-style bean, &quot;I had hair. That’s how long it’s taken to get it made.&quot; He 
explains to the Puget Sound crowd that Anacortes, a nearby tourist town that 
acts as gateway to the San Juan Islands, was considered as a shooting location 
for <i>Dagon</i>. Eventually, however, Gordon began principle photography at the 
turn of the millenium in Spain, where his longtime producer Brian Yuzna had 
recently established a Barcelona production studio (dubbed Fantastic Factory) 
affiliated with local company Filmax Films. &quot;I don’t think Spain felt that the 
film would do much to promote tourism,&quot; Gordon chuckles. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Indeed, <i>Dagon’s</i> unholy stew of gruesome 
imagery, seasoned with a pinch of the erotic, follows in the envelope-pushing 
footsteps of his previous horror outings. During the film’s tense climax, we 
watch a nude Raquel Moreno dangling over a sacrificial pit while reluctantly 
waiting to be snatched up by an unforgiving sea god. Images of scantily-clad 
femme fatale Barbara Crampton being faced with similar predicaments in <i>
Re-Animator</i> and <i>From Beyond</i> are brought to mind. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Lovecraft was born on August 20, 1890, in 
Providence, Rhode Island. Although inaccuracies about the author’s life often 
paint him into a twisted, unstable recluse, he was actually a multi-talented 
wordsmith who manned the editorial posts of several independent East Coast 
magazine, while penning thousands of letters to correspondents across the globe. 
He also shaped political essays and soulful poetry, as well as the darker tales 
like <i>The Tomb,</i> and <i>The Shadow over Innsmouth</i> that would 
immortalize Lovecraft as a horror writer. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the years leading up to his death from 
cancer in 1937, Lovecraft was not afforded reassurance that his inconsistently 
released writings would endure the test of time. Most often, they were one-offs 
rearing their unsettling heads in such pulp magazines as <i>Weird Tales</i>, or 
other obscure journals bubbling under the mainstream radar. Fortunately, 
Lovecraft’s work has since been preserved forever by Arkham House. Run by 
admirers of the scribe, the publishing company has issued several hardcover 
volumes of his off-kilter stories, starting with <i>The Outsider and Others</i> 
in 1939.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s easy to see parallels between Lovecraft’s 
journey as an artist and Gordon’s creative career path. Gordon has seen his own 
contributions to the horror genre re-edited without his permission (as in the 
case of <i>Re-Animator</i>, initially released on video as a neutered, watered-down 
version minus the more controversial scenes). He has also watched as others are 
relegated to obscurity (<i>From Beyond</i> is available only in an out of print 
VHS format, but Gordon is hopeful that a DVD version will eventually surface). 
Reassuringly, the director also boasts a hardcore following whose continuing 
allegiance ensures that his creative genius will be recognized into the future.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Gordon’s onscreen projects are not limited to 
horror. Futuristic sci-fi outings like <i>Robot Jox</i> (1990), <i>Fortress</i>, 
(1993), and <i>Space Truckers</i> (1997) are also on his diverse director’s 
resume. Meanwhile, he scored a co-screenwriting credit for the smash Disney hit,
<i>Honey I Shrunk the Kids</i> (1989), and eventually served as executive 
producer for the popular film’s sequel, <i>Honey, I Blew Up the Kids</i> (1992).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">However, his Lovecraft-inspired works have 
remained the filmmaker’s most enduring creations. Sipping a beverage at the 
Grand Illusion’s cinema-side cafe, the influential talent recaps his horror 
career, from pre -<i>Re-Animator</i> days staging David Mamet plays with 
Chicago’s Organic Theatre to his present success with <i>Dagon</i> ...and 
beyond.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>KJ Doughton: </i></b>What are your 
thoughts on the Millenium-edition DVD of <i>Re-Animator</i>, which came out in April?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>Stuart Gordon: </i></b>It’s a two-disc 
set with a lot of additional material. I think the best thing about it is that 
they re-mastered the sound. When <i>Re-Animator </i>was first released, it was 
not even in stereo. It was a mono release. Now, it has THX sound and a beautiful 
re-mastering of it all. Richard Band is interviewed on the DVD, and talks about 
the various cues for the film. It shows sections of the movie with only the 
music so you can get a sense of what he was working for. Richard really picked 
up on the humor in the film, and his music really helped the audience to know 
that it was OK to laugh at this movie - that there were comedic sections.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="font-style:normal">Before the film 
was scored, I told Richard that I was a big fan of Bernard Hermann, and he kind 
of went with that. Originally, we had put a credit in the beginning that said, 
&quot;Our apologies to Bernard Hermann,&quot; and it got left out, so Richard has been 
paying the price for that ever since. He got a letter from the Bernard Herman 
estate that said, &quot;If Mr. Hermann were alive, we’d be suing you right now.&quot; He 
meant it in a very loving way. He wasn’t trying to steal anything. We 
acknowledge that Bernard Hermann is The Master of film scores. But Richard’s 
score is really fun and lively. Now you can hear the score in stereo (on the new 
DVD).</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There is an additional interview with myself 
and Brian Yuzna, the producer, and an interview with Dennis Daly, one of the 
writers. The original storyboards are also shown within the film, so that you 
can click back and forth between the boards and the actual shots.&quot;</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>KJD: </b></i>Are there other DVD versions 
of <i>Re-Animator</i> floating around?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>SG: </i></b>There was one done as a laser 
disc that was converted to DVD, about five years ago. But the new version is far 
superior.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>KJD: </b>Re-Animator</i>, <i>From Beyond</i>, 
and <i>Dagon</i> are all based on the works of horror writer H.P. Lovecraft. Are 
they meant as a kind of trilogy?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>SG: </b></i>Actually, there is a forth 
film of mine in the Lovecraft groove, called <i>Castle Freak</i> [1995, 
available on VHS and DVD]. It is loosely adapted from the Lovecraft story, <i>The 
Outsider</i>. Originally, I tried to convince them that they should re-name the 
movie <i>The Outsider</i>, but Charles Band, who runs Full Moon [the film’s 
production company], is the guy who creates the titles first. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The movie got started during a meeting I was 
having in his office, where I noticed a poster on his wall that said, <i>Castle 
Freak</i>. It had a picture of a guy who looks like Quasimodo whipping some poor 
girl that’s chained to the wall. I asked him, &quot;what’s this movie about, 
Charlie?&quot; He told me, &quot;Well, there’s a castle and there’s a freak.&quot; He had 
already sold the film, on the basis of the title and the artwork alone. He said, 
&quot;as long as you have a castle in this film, and there’s a freak inside of the 
castle, you can direct it.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We did the movie pretty quickly. It was filmed 
in a castle owned by Charles Band. Make sure you get the director’s cut, because 
a few things have been taken out in the R-rated version.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>KJD: </i></b>Similar to what happened 
with Re-Animator?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><span style="font-style: italic">SG</span><i>:</i></b><span style="font-style: italic"><b>
</b></span><span style="font-style:normal">The R-rated version of </span>
Re-Animator <span style="font-style:normal">was done without my involvement. I 
was working on </span>From Beyond<span style="font-style:normal">, shooting in 
Italy, and when I came back to the States, I found that the only version of
</span>Re-Animator <span style="font-style:normal">available was the R-rated 
version. Once a movie is rated, that’s the only one that you’re allowed to 
distribute. We were very upset about it because we had no involvement in making 
these cuts and changes. We went back to the MPAA and asked them if they would 
take back the R-rating. They said that was the first time anyone had ever 
requested that! [Laughter] But they did it. They took back the R and let us 
release the unrated version.</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>KJD: </b></i>Is it true that when you 
attended the University of Wisconsin as a college student, you took heat from 
authorities for staging a psychedelic version of <i>Peter Pan</i>?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>SG: </b></i>Unfortunately, it’s true. I 
was also arrested for that production. So if any one tells you I can’t get 
arrested, they’re wrong [laughter].</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I was arrested on obscenity charges back in 
1968. We did the production as a satire of the '68 democratic convention, 
happening in Chicago. I turned it into a political allegory. <i>Peter Pan and 
the Lost Boys</i> became hippies, the pirates became the Chicago Police 
Department, and Captain Hook became the original Mayor Daly of Chicago. After 
they all went off to Never Land, they dropped acid. That scene got us into 
trouble, because it was a psychedelic dance sequence and we had a light show 
projected onto the naked bodies of seven female dancers. We were told that we 
had to shut the production down. We felt that was a violation of our free 
speech, so we performed it again, and got arrested.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="font-style:normal">I’ve always 
thought it might be fun to do a movie of the event, ‘cause it was so crazy. 
We’ve even talked of the idea of doing </span><span style="font-style:italic">Re-Animator</span><span style="font-style:normal"> 
as a musical, which would be really strange, with severed heads singing and 
dancing. </span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>KJD: </b></i>In 1969, you formed 
Chicago’s Organic Theater, and oversaw several productions, including those 
written by David Mamet. Can you elaborate on this experience? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>SG: </b></i>It was an experimental 
theater, an ensemble of actors, designers and writers. We created original plays 
and adaptations. We toured, performed, and brought productions to other places, 
including New York. We had some wonderful members of the ensemble. Joe Mantegna 
(<i>House of Games</i>) and Dennis Franz (<i>NYPD Blue</i>) were with us. It was 
a great time. We produced David Mamet’s first play<b>, </b><i>Sexual Perversity 
in Chicago.</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Dennis Franz was seen in <i>Cops</i>, a 
production we did. He and Mantegna played undercover policemen, and a casting 
director for Brian De Palma was there. He cast Dennis as a policeman in a movie 
called <i>The Fury</i>, and he’s been playing cops ever since.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>KJD: </b></i>Eventually, in 1984, you 
took on filmmaking with <i>Re-Animator</i>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>SG: </b></i>I took a leave of absence 
from the theatre to direct it, then I went back to work after shooting wrapped. 
It was during that time that the movie premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. 
The reaction was great. The company that had distributed it offered me a 
three-picture deal. Empire Pictures released it, Charles Band’s company that has 
since become Full Moon. We moved to LA. As soon as we got there, he said, yeah, 
we’re gonna make three pictures, but we’re shooting them in Italy [laughter].</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>KJD: </b></i>
<span style="font-weight:normal">Alongside Empire/Full Moon guru Charles Band, 
another name that has long been associated with your movies is producer 
BrianYuzna. How did he become involved in the mix? </span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>SG: </i></b>A mutual friend named Bob 
Greenberg, who brought Brian to Chicago to see the Organic Theatre Company, 
introduced him to me. We were doing a play then called <i>ER</i>, about an emergency 
room. Brian had read the script for <i>Re-Animator</i>, and thought we were able to 
handle medical emergencies pretty well [laughter]). </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>KJD: </b></i>
<span style="font-weight:normal">Explain your fascination with author H.P. 
Lovecraft, who wrote much of your source material.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>SG: </b></i>I had really liked Lovecraft, 
had read him since I was a teenager. But <i>Re-Animator</i> was a really obscure 
Lovecraft story that I’d never heard of. Some associates and I were talking 
about all the Dracula movies that had been made, and thinking that someone 
should make a new Frankenstein movie. A friend suggested that I read <i>Herbert 
West, Re-Animator</i>, a series involving a scientist’s attempts to re-animate 
the dead. I discovered that the story was out of print, and I had to find a copy 
in the public library. It was from an old pulp magazine that literally was 
crumbling in my hands as I turned the pages. Lovecraft wrote the story as a 
serial, in six little installments, and they were all great. We had to ask 
ourselves how many of the six were we gonna put in the movie. In typical Brian 
Yuzna fashion, he said, &quot;I think you should put <u>all</u> of them in the 
movie.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The stories follow West throughout his life, 
starting with him as a medical student. At the end of the stories, he’s in his 
fifties, and gets destroyed by his own creations. For <i>Re-Animator</i>, we 
took all six stories and compressed them in terms of time, having them all take 
place while he’s a medical student at Miskatonic University.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>KJD: </b></i>I notice that in <i>Dagon</i>, 
the leading man wears a shirt emblazoned with a Miskatonic University logo. 
There was a similar T-shirt worn by a cast member in From Beyond.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>SG: </b></i>Yeah. Lovecraft created a 
town called Arkham, Massachusetts, and Miskatonic is the University that’s 
located there. The Miskatonic Asylum for the Criminally Insane is also there.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>KJD: </b></i>Do you remember the first 
time you started reading Lovecraft’s stories?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>SG: </b></i>I read them in paperback 
books. It was in the sixties when I started reading his work, right around the 
time when he was finally being published (in book format). His stuff was put out 
in the fifties by Arkham house, a publishing company started by August Derleth, 
one of his friends. If it weren’t for that, I think Lovecraft would have been 
forgotten, because all of his work had previously only been published in these 
pulp magazines, and then they didn’t even bother renewing the copyrights on 
them. I read a bunch of those stories, and found them to be scary as hell. 
Because his work is public domain, it’s like a treasure trove.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>KJD: </b></i>The Sam Mendes film <i>
American Beauty</i> (1999) included a reference to <i>Re-Animator</i>, in a 
scene where Kevin Spacey and Wes Bentley swap movie trivia.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><span style="font-style: italic">SG</span><i>:</i></b><span style="font-style: italic"><b>
</b></span><span style="font-style:normal">I got a call from Jeffrey Combs (the 
actor portraying Herbert West), who said that beyond their mention the film, 
they had duplicated the famous &quot;lustful head&quot; scene shot for shot at the end of
</span><span style="font-style: italic">American Beauty</span><span style="font-style:normal">. 
I couldn’t believe it, then went back to take another look. It was true. In the 
scene where he’s finally going to seduce the cheerleader, his head is in the 
corner of the frame, and you can just see this disembodied head - Kevin Spacey’s 
head, lowering toward her, very much like the way we shot </span><i>Re-Animator</i><span style="font-style:normal">. 
It was really an homage to the film, and I was very honored.</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>KJD: </b></i>Speaking of the famous love 
scene between the severed head of Professor Carl Hill (David Gale) and intact 
body of Megan Halsey (Crampton), were there certain limits set by Barbara when 
it was shot? I’d have to be inebriated to agree to something like that.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><span style="font-style: italic">SG</span><i>:</i></b><span style="font-style: italic"><b>
</b></span><span style="font-style:normal">Barbara is a very brave girl. 
Originally, we had cast another girl in that role, and when we told her she had 
the part, she completely chickened out and dropped out of the production. Then 
Barbara came in, and did the scene, knowing that it would be the one people 
would be talking about. I can’t even remember the name of the other actress.</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>KJD: </b></i>In interviews, Brian Yuzna 
claims that a lot of the humor in <i>Re-Animator</i> was from you, and 
improvised. I understand that the movie was originally intended to be more of a 
straight-out horror experience.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>SG: </b></i>Well, I think that there were 
funny things in the original Lovecraft story. Whenever one of these experiments 
goes bad, the line that Herbert West keeps repeating is, &quot;Well, I guess it just 
wasn’t fresh enough.&quot; All of us were coming up with bits and pieces of shtick. 
Brian actually came up with the bit where the professor, after being beheaded, 
is trying to put his head into the pan and it keeps falling over. He takes a 
note spike and sticks the head on it, which gets a huge laugh whenever we show 
it.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>KJD: </b></i>There’s another line where 
David Gale is demonstrating the removal of a cadaver’s scalp to a room of 
medical students. He describes the procedure as, &quot;very much like peeling a large 
orange.&quot; Who came up with that?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>SG: </i></b>We interviewed and visited a 
lot of pathologists. We toured a morgue in Los Angeles, and we met these guys. 
They had the blackest senses of humor of anybody. This guy that was describing 
the process is the one who used that expression, and I said, &quot;OK, that’s going 
in the movie.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I think a lot of the comedy in <i>Re-Animator</i> 
comes from these pathologists. If you’re gonna do a job like that, you’ve gotta 
have a sense of humor. The first time I ever visited a morgue, it was the Cook 
County Morgue in Chicago. There was a guy there named Dr. Stein. He was opening 
up what looked like meat lockers, and each would be full of bodies. I’d be 
walking along trying not to lose my lunch. We got to the end of the line, and he 
turned to his assistant, and said, &quot;Well, he’s still standing. I guess he’s 
ready for the Rose Room.&quot; I said, &quot;What’s the Rose Room?&quot; It turned out that the 
Rose Room was for the bodies they found that had been dead for several weeks, 
several months, or in some cases, for several years. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">He led me into this room, where there are all 
these decomposing bodies. There was one that looked sort of like what Dracula 
looks like after he gets hit with a burst of sunlight. I remember this shape of 
a body that was just, like, dust. There was a body that had been pulled out of 
the Chicago River that had been completely bloated. It was horrific. And the 
smell was so bad. That’s why they called it the Rose Room. I couldn’t get it out 
of my nose for about a month after that. It just stayed with me. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="font-style:normal">We tried to 
give that feeling to </span>Re-Animator<span style="font-style:normal"> 
concerning the smell. I took the actors on a tour of the Cook County morgue, 
just because I wanted them to see how the bodies are treated and what the 
attitude was. Again, the smell was really bad. There is a scene in the film 
which shows Bruce Abbott going into a morgue locker, holding his breath while 
he’s doing his business inside there, then coming out and exhaling, gasping for 
air. That is really what you had to do while working there. It’s kind of hard to 
convey smell in movies, unless you do &quot;smell-o-rama&quot;. No one would want to stay 
in the theatre very long.</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>KJD: </b></i>One of <i>Re-Animator's</i> 
final scenes, where the zombies burst out of the black bags under command of 
Professor Hill, is very effective. Each body has a different look to it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>SG: </b></i>We had a gunshot to the head, 
a failed operation, a motorcycle accident, and a burn victim. One pathologist 
I’d visited was asking me specifically about the corpses that would be seen in 
the movie. So I went through and listed them all. He said, &quot;come back tomorrow&quot;. 
I came back the next day and he had a slide projector set up with a screen, and
<u>one</u> chair (laughter). The nurse says to me, &quot;I hope you have a strong 
stomach,&quot; sits me down in the chair, and starts going through slides that 
pathologists had taken of the various bodies they had worked with. It was kind 
of like, &quot;Stuart Gordon, You Asked for It&quot; (laughter)! Here’s the gunshot to the 
head. Here’s the burn victim. I started getting woozy. I was ready to pass out 
after about ten minutes. I finally asked them to stop, and said, &quot;Let me just 
hold them up to the light. If they’re smaller, I think I can deal with this a 
little better.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The pathologist thought it was pretty funny. As 
a present, he actually ended up giving me a head block that they use for 
autopsies, which they put behind the neck to keep the head from moving around. 
Quite a souvenir. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>KJD: </b></i>Did you have any sort of 
fascination with forensics prior to researching <i>Re-Animator</i>?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>SG: </b></i>No. It was a real eye opener 
for me. I had never seen a dead body, except for one at a funeral that had been 
embalmed and made up and everything.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="font-style:normal">The attitude of 
the doctors, which I tried to get into </span>Re-Animator<span style="font-style:normal">, 
was that when you’re alive, they’ll do everything their power to save you, but 
as soon as you’re dead, you become garbage. You’re toxic waste. The idea of 
putting them in garbage bags was something we observed. I never saw any of these 
nice little drawers that you see in most movies, where they’re sliding bodies 
out. They were just sort of putting them on gurneys and heaping them on top of 
each other until they could get rid of them.</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The other thing that was amazing to me was that 
the bodies looked nothing like they do in movies, which is usually sort of gray. 
In reality, they were all different colors, depending on how they died. When we 
made the film, we tried to make it more accurate, in terms of the way we 
portrayed the corpses. There were some that would be red. That usually had to do 
with a cardiac problem. Blue had to do with asphyxiation, yellow ones were 
jaundiced, and they would all have what is called pooling, where blood settles 
in the bodies. There would be a sort of two-tone effect, with the undersides all 
dark and purple. It was really pretty wild. My feeling was that the more real 
you could make something that is fantastic, the better your chances were of 
getting an audience to believe it.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>KJD: </b></i>During the early eighties, 
when <i>Re-Animator</i> was released, there seemed to be a whole movement of 
similar horror pictures that were released at the same time.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>SG: </b></i>One of the things that Brian 
Yuzna had me do that was a great education was to view all the movies made 
before <i>Re-Animator</i>, in the 'eighties. It was kind of like a horror movie 
film festival. We saw <i>Evil Dead</i>, and <i>Driller Killer</i>, and much more 
obscure ones. Brian said that we had to find a way to outdo these other films.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>KJD: </b></i>I think you did, by adding 
more sexual situations than the other films...</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>SG: </b></i>Horror movies have always had 
a certain element of sexuality. There’s always the scene of the monster carrying 
the girl in the negligee off to the swamp, or something. However, they never 
show you exactly what he’s gonna do with her once they get there. So in <i>
Re-Animator</i>, we did.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>KJD: </b></i>I understand that the 
Lovecraft story that inspired your next movie, <i>From Beyond</i>, was only used 
in the prologue.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>SG: </i></b><i>From Beyond </i>is a very 
short story, only seven pages long. We used it in the movie as kind of a 
pre-title sequence and based on those themes, kind of expanded on it.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>KJD: </b></i>That film dealt with a 
resonator that would expand its user’s pineal gland, allowing them to see 
creatures that existed in another dimension while opening the gateway to a sixth 
sense. Dr. Pretorius (Ted Sorel), the creator of this machine, is literally 
devoured by these monsters, seen morphing and melting into worsening states of 
deterioration. To get this effect, was the makeup quite taxing to apply?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>SG: </b></i>The monster he becomes is 
based on another Lovecraft concept called the shogoth, which is a 
shape-shifting, protoplasmic creature. The story that they talk about him in is 
one called, &quot;At the Mountains of Madness&quot;. The shogoths were sort of beasts of 
burden, but as a Lovecraft line explains, &quot;They accidentally gained 
intelligence.&quot; How they did that was by devouring their masters. They absorbed 
intelligence somehow. The creature that eats Pretorius becomes Pretorius, in a 
sense. &quot;You are what you eat&quot; was the idea.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We had Pretorius constantly shape-shifting. The 
most elaborate makeup on him is seen as half of his body sort of oozing and 
dripping away. Ted Sorel, who played Pretorius, said, &quot;Please don’t make me do 
this more than once,&quot; because the makeup took eight hours to apply. I said, &quot;OK 
Ted, but it may be a long day.&quot; He said, &quot;I’d rather do that than go through all 
of this again.&quot; So we’re shooting, and everything’s going great, until about 
four hours go by. Then, he starts having problems remembering his lines, which 
was not like him. This is an actor who is really sharp. Then, he started 
swaying. Eventually, we realized that the makeup was inhibiting his movement and 
stopping his circulation. He wasn’t getting enough blood to his brain. We ripped 
the makeup off of him, and found that his arm had swollen to twice its normal 
size. The shoot had become became a <u>real</u> horror movie! It was a scary 
deal. He was a trooper. I think we did have to put him back into the makeup 
again.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Shooting movies can be a very dangerous thing. 
It always amazes me how many movies you go to see where they say, &quot;in memory of 
so and so&quot;, after the film. You’re dealing with all kinds of stunts and 
pyrotechnics where there’s potential for disaster.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>KJD: </b>Dagon</i> kind of brings things 
full circle, as the latest Lovecraft adaptation. It seemed to be a larger 
production that the previous installments, with scenes shot in the ocean and 
various other risky locales.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><span style="font-style: italic">SG</span></b><span style="font-style: italic"><b>:
</b></span><span style="font-style:normal">Yes. There was one hard scene that 
involved a half-deflated raft, which we shot right on the open sea. It was 
scary. We used humor to relax us. It allowed us to get the scene done.</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>KJD: </b></i>In your own words, describe 
the central theme of <i>Dagon</i>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>SG: </b></i>A fear of genetics is a 
theme. Lovecraft’s parents went insane and had to be committed. He was afraid 
that the same thing would happen to him. That plays into this film. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>KJD: </b></i>Will this chain of Lovecraft-inspired 
horror films continue to grow? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>SG: </i></b>Probably. I’m currently 
toying with a project based on his story, &quot;The Thing on the Doorstep.&quot; You know 
how they say people look more like each other the longer they’re married? Well, 
in this story, the people actually turn <i>into </i>each other. It’s Lovecraft’s 
ode to marriage.</font></p>
