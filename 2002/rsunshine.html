            <font face="Verdana" size="5">28th Seattle International Film 
            Festival</font><p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>What might you expect from a
            film eponymously set in the land of good ole Jeb Bush, those damned
            dimpled chads, and a sea of transient moppets traipsing their
            parents around Disney World? Well, none of the above if you manage
            to catch this engrossingly extended (at 141 minutes, it passes
            quickly) big screen pop quiz. The political hijinx in independent
            film poster child John Sayles' thoroughly engrossing new movie don't
            reflect on presidential elections or siblings, or your Uncle Walt's
            niece and nephew visiting from Schenectady. Rather, small town
            Florida politicians, backstabbing land developers, and handful of
            just plain (but certainly not bland) folks upset with the
            gentrification of their close-knit neighborhood comprise another
            appealing multicharacter approach to film-making that affords
            director-writer-editor-handyman Sayles' thirteenth film (as
            director) an amiable stroll along one of the life's lesser known
            beaches. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Sunshine State</i> is
            definitely one of his most accomplished works, right alongside the
            highly acclaimed <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Lone Star</i>,
            his sprawling indictment of a small Texas border town (which earned
            Sayles an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Screenplay),
            and his real-low-budget directorial debut <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Return
            of the Secaucus Seven</i>. Perennial themes of corruption and
            uncertain hope pepper his cross-genre work, but it’s the raw
            honesty of his characters that makes them so appealing. It's that
            same quality which is so proudly evident in some of Robert Altman's
            work, particularly -- as it fits in with Sayles' current subject --
            the laid-back, underrated Southern dramedy <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Cookie's

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">So Sayles and his traveling
            ensemble have journeyed eastward from <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Lone
            Star</i> to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Passion Fish</i>
            (Louisiana) to the land of palm trees and gators, reassembling --
            with the filmmaker's long-time producer and life-partner Maggie
            Renzi -- some of his old friends (Angela Bassett, Gordon Clapp, Bill
            Cobbs, Richard Edson, Clifton James, Tom Wright, Miguel Ferrer) with
            some actors new to Sayles' cinematic world, among them Timothy
            Hutton, Ralph Waite, Clapp's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">NYPD
            Blue</i> co-star James McDaniel, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The

            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As the film begins, a series of
            seemingly unrelated scenes bombard the viewer. A pirate ship is
            ablaze and a young black boy stands watching. Alan King and his
            foursome (who bookend the film) provide some biting historical
            context on wealthy landowners turning swamplands into golf courses,
            of &quot;selling sunshine&quot; and nature on a leash. After a pit
            stop at the local Sea-Vue Motel run by a ditsy local gal, an
            attractive black woman and her anesthesiologist husband land at the
            doorstep of an estranged parent. Meanwhile a local politician tries
            to commit suicide.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like a subtle fog, the confusion
            slowly lifts amid the elegant camera work of Patrick Cady (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Girlfight</i>)
            with leisurely pans, zooms, and other movements as the characters
            bit by bit intertwine on the screen, revealing their relationships.
            It's much like a child's game of connect-the-dots or a slowed-downed
            version of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">E.R.</i>, the plot
            jig sawing back and forth among the long-time stalwarts of
            African-American enclave Lincoln Beach as they fight off encroaching
            development plans of various business interests desirous of the
            island's prime beachfront property. Nearby, Marly Temple (Falco) who
            runs her family's motel with increasing disdain, gets similar
            overtures from the real estate men with the big bucks and
            semi-nefarious notions.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Standouts in the cast? Well, it's a
            true ensemble piece, impossible to break down within the limited
            scope of this review. In the end, everyone registers, even if his or
            her screen time is less than that of their thespian compatriots.
            Richard Edson, for one, is a ne'er-do-well ex-husband pitching
            mail-order iguana scams with maybe four brief appearances (and
            probably the only film he's ever been called handsome…and Greek).
            Gordon Clapp, who has worked with Sayles since his debut feature, is
            that befuddled unsuccessful suicidalist, one Erle Pickney, a local
            commissioner on the take. His wife, Francine (Mary Steenbergen),
            promotes the town's market-driven Buccaneer Days with a plastic
            smile and a fistful of depression. No one really gets a lot of
            screen time to steal the show, although Falco's interpretation of
            Marly as short-haired, dirty-blonde, would-be adventuress has some
            of the better lines and dead-pan jokes (I especially liked her
            sarcastic delivery on the death of sponges). Her hauntingly vacant
            eyes search out the few romantic prospects in town, moving from a
            studly golf pro anxious to get over a case of stage fright, to Jack
            Meadows, a landscape architect (Tim Hutton) with a carefree
            indifference in the ethics of his employers.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's Sayles' deliberate writing and
            directing style that wins his film a stunning vote of confidence. An
            acclaimed novelist and 1983 winner of a MacArthur &quot;genius&quot;
            award, there's not one ounce of slouching in his smooth,
            self-assured filmmaking style. He's unconsciously crafted a lovely,
            small-scale revisionist rewrite of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Seven Days in May</i>, while powerfully focusing on the personal battle
            lines imperiling one Florida community. One of the most original
            American productions this year, you'll find yourself remembering
            this refreshing visit to a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Sunshine
