            review by <a href="../kj.html" target="_top">KJ Doughton</a>, 21 June 2002</i></font><p>
            <font face="Verdana" size="5">28th Seattle International Film 
            Festival</font><p class="MsoNormal"><b>
            <font face="Verdana" size="2">Armenian Immigrant Zaroohe Najarian 
            hobbles a bit as she pushes a vacuum cleaner across her living room 
            carpet, and she’s not a picture of ballerina-like grace as she plops 
            into her recliner with the delicacy of a boulder. Zaroohe appears as 
            just another low profile, little old lady in knit slippers and a 
            red, flannel bathrobe as she sweeps a patio or waters backyard plum 
            trees. &quot;My mother is unusual,&quot; proclaims the admiring son who 
            crouches behind an easel to paint her picture, &quot;because she is so <i>
            ordinary</i>.&quot; </font></b></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">By the time 
            Karina Epperlein’s wise, inventive documentary concludes, however, 
            it’s made clear that this craggy-faced, ninety-something optimist 
            with a knack for culinary wizardry is anything <i>but </i>ordinary.
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like a 
            leisurely-paced home movie, <i>I Will Not Be Sad in This World</i> 
            takes its sweet time lingering on Zaroohe’s wispy, gray hair as it 
            flips about in the Fresno, California wind. Following her around a 
            miniature backyard orchard, down the aisles of a supermarket, or in 
            front of a kitchen sink as she whittles down vegetables for a 
            masterful dinner dish, Epperlein’s camera treats her subject as an 
            old friend. We get used to Mrs. Najarian’s looks, her mannerisms, 
            and her dry humor, until the film’s narrator sweeps us into the 
            woman’s dramatic past, revealing that &quot;she carries with her stories 
            of a distant place and time.&quot;</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We learn that she 
            survived the systematic extermination of 1.5 million Armenians in 
            1915, when the Ottoman Government forced thousands of families to 
            march into the Syrian Dessert and eventually die of disease and 
            starvation. &quot;It was during World War I,&quot; she recalls of the 
            relatively under-publicized genocide, &quot;and the world did not pay 
            much attention.&quot;</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We are forced to 
            comprehend the death march through a series of grisly stills showing 
            Armenians driven barefoot through the sands, many stabbed, shot, or 
            decapitated along the way as others succumbed to disease and 
            starvation. In addition to the horrendous death toll that resulted, 
            there were hundreds of thousands who were forced into exile. For 
            Zaroohe, the loss of both parents and two brothers were among the 
            degradations she endured. </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">We are told that 
            a subsequent dictator with a penchant for mass human annihilation, 
            Adolph Hitler, studied the overlooked events in Turkey with intense 
            interest. In 1939, as he set the gears of the Holocaust into motion, 
            Hitler silenced co-conspirators who felt that society would never 
            allow him to fulfill his twisted mission, stating, &quot;Nowadays, who 
            talks of the extermination of the Armenians?&quot; If the world could 
            ignore such a travesty once, he reasoned, it was bound to cast a 
            blind eye again. </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As if Zaroohe’s 
            firsthand experience with this tragic chapter in human history 
            wasn’t enough, she reveals other tough times that came later. At 
            age12, she escaped from a Turkish orphanage, where &quot;they tried to 
            turn us into Turks,&quot; then accepted an older man’s hand in marriage 
            four years later, as a means of relocating to America. Showing her 
            unconventional, independent spirit even as a young lady, Mrs. 
            Najarian soon dumped this first husband for another man, and founded 
            a sewing union for seamstresses. &quot;I had a lot of nerve,&quot; she 
            acknowledges with a smile.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The going became 
            tough again, when her second husband suffered a stroke and she 
            dutifully served as his caregiver for over seven years. </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Despite all of 
            these trials and tribulations, <i>&quot;I Will Not Be Sad in this World</i> 
            portrays 94-year old Zaroohe as a happy person who applies a <i>
            carpe diem</i> philosophy with every breath. We see her mix rice, 
            parsley, and vegetables, and wrap meat with spinach leaves, while 
            proclaiming, &quot;Cooking is art.&quot; We observe as this spirited senior 
            waves her hands to the rhythm of some spirited Armenian music, like 
            an ecstatic orchestra conductor. Even during a hospital stay for an 
            injured hip, Zaroohe is defying the expectations of her nursing 
            staff. &quot;Usually, we don’t see them up during the first day,&quot; 
            exclaims a nurse to her son, Pete. &quot;I take it she’s an active 
            woman?&quot;</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There’s a strong 
            spirituality that envelopes Epperlein’s subject, as well. Zaroohe 
            marvels in the growth of some roses that she recently rescued from a 
            trash dumpster and planted in her backyard garden. She doesn’t 
            attend church, announcing, &quot;God is with me all the time, in my house 
            – every minute.&quot;</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Perhaps the 
            film’s narrator sums up Zaroohe’s ability to shine with optimism, 
            when she proclaims, &quot;Zaroohe allows pain and despair, then she lets 
            it go. She practices faith in life, wonder in each moment, and peace 
            with how it is.&quot; Like &quot;Before Leaving,&quot; the thoughtful look inside 
            of a French nursing facility, &quot;I Will Not Be Sad in this World&quot; is a 
            testimony to the value and wisdom of our elderly. </font></p>
