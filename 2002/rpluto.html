            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 16 August 2002</i> </font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Pity the poor film that gets
            labeled a turkey in advance. That's what happened in recent years to
            such films as <i>B. Monkey</i>, the first film directed by Michael
            Radford after the hugely successful <i>The Postman</i> (<i>Il
            Postino</i>), and <i>New Rose Hotel</i>, a William Gibson adaptation
            that Abel Ferrara knocked off with Willem Dafoe and Christopher
            Walken (and Asia Argento, who also happened to star in <i>B. Monkey</i>).
            Currently, M.G.M. is trying to figure out what to do with <i>Killing
            Me Softly</i>, an erotic thriller that was completed well over a
            year ago and which is the first English-language film to be made by
            the celebrated Chinese director Chen Kaige. The film's release date
            was changed again and again (just like the one for <i>B. Monkey</i>),
            while word began to spread like wildfire about the uproarious lack
            of chemistry between the two leads (Heather Graham and the mopey
            Joseph Fiennes), some of the individual scenes themselves (including
            a bondage bit that's supposed to involve ribbons and a fireplace
            mantle), and the ending (in which the wrong character gets fingered
            for the murders in the story). Too &quot;high-profile&quot; to be
            dumped directly into the video stores, the film is currently set to
            be out in theaters, if at all, this coming fall.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Which is probably why Eddie Murphy
            looks at us so imperiously from the posters and ads for <i>The
            Adventures of Pluto Nash</i>: go ahead, DARE to think this is not a
            comedy. Like the aforementioned-mentioned films, it probably started
            out with high hopes (most people do not enter into the arduous
            process of getting a movie made otherwise). The story, or what I
            heard about it, sounded like capable, if not promising, material.
            And Eddie Murphy certainly does not have to prove anything to
            anyone, anymore, after his performances in <i>Bowfinger</i> and as
            Sherman Klump in <i>The Nutty Professor</i>. But, still, <i>Pluto
            Nash</i> was originally supposed to be out in the spring...of 2001.
            Could dere be something the matter, Cholly?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Well, aside from the fact that it
            is a comedy that's not very funny and an action movie that is not
            very thrilling (and an uneasy alliance, at that), the whole thing is
            built around a surprise revelation concerning the identity of one of
            the characters which, when it arrives -- backfires completely, and
            wrecks whatever is left of the movie (Without giving anything away,
            I can say that it would have cost a great deal of money to reshoot.)
            The story rises from the concept that, once it is permanently
            colonized, the Moon would become a tawdry, neon-lit enclave of
            nightclubs, hotels, and other divertissements. (We really would end
            up &quot;polluting the moon&quot;, as one 1971 commencement speaker
            at U.C. Berkeley put it!) Murphy plays Pluto Nash, who runs a sort
            of Rick's Cafe Americain in one township, until gangsters show up
            and try to muscle in. While taking it on the lam, Murphy's character
            shows some nice, easy chemistry with Rosario Dawson, playing a
            singer who's just arrived &quot;from Salt Lake City&quot;
            (&quot;Rough place,&quot; Murphy replies); his robot bodyguard
            (Randy Quaid, who's fairly wonderful); and, briefly, his mom, played
            by the inimitable Pam Grier.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That's one of the movie's problems:
            when it gets ahold of something that's good (like putting Grier and
            Murphy together, as mother and son, eluding and fighting it out with
            hitmen, or having Murphy as the twenty-first-century lunar
            equivalent of Humphrey Bogart, with a clip from the Cagney and
            Bogart movie <i>The Roaring Twenties</i> to nick the reference), it
            lets it go, while, on the other hand, giving us stuff that doesn't
            work at all (most of the bang-bang stuff, plus some terrible ethnic,
            and sexist, humor).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There's a considerable amount of
            talent on view, here -- Jay Mohr plays a nightclub entertainer who
            starts out as a guy in a kilt playing the accordion onstage and
            turns himself into Tony Francis, ripping-off Frank Sinatra's
            &quot;breezy&quot; 1950s persona, the joke being that nobody on the
            Moon in the year 2078 would notice (Mohr's character sings stuff
            like &quot;Fly Me to the Moon&quot; and &quot;My kind of town, Moon
            Beach is/ My kind of town....&quot;: it's supposed to sound
            terrible, in a parodic way, but instead it's just terrible); John
            Cleese is stuck in the part of an electronic chauffeur, and he
            doesn't even get one really funny thing to do or say;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Joe Pantoliano plays a hood in charge of a platoon of hitmen,
            one of which is perpetually cross-eyed; Alec Baldwin puts in an
            unbilled cameo as an Earthbound gangster.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Surprisingly, Eddie Murphy moves
            through the film, giving it his best, while at the same time working
            with a sort of panache and, if I may say so, grace. Quite a
            difference from fifteen years ago, when he made some pretty shrill
            appearances in films after the success of <i>Beverly Hills Cop</i>.
            But, as when he had to swim through the cascade of vulgar humor that
            seemed imposed on <i>Nutty Professor II: The Klumps</i>, he should
            get some films that come up to the level at which he is now working,
            as a comedian and (as another esteemed colleague has already put it)
            an artist.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
