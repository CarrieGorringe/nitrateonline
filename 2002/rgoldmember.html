            review by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 26 July 52002</i></font><p>
            <font face="Verdana" size="5">Boys story</font></p>
            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Beyoncé Knowles is looking fine. 
            Sitting astride a Ducati for <i>Movieline</i>, parting her perfect 
            lips for <i>Maxim</i>, cavorting with Mike Myers for <i>EW</i>, the 
            girl is indisputably golden. During her live performance on Leno, 
            she pulled out funky stops evoking Tina Turner. And her sensational 
            hoola-hooping in the music video for &quot;Work It Out&quot; is all right too, 
            a giddy, gorgeous turn drawn from the artist's own childhood 
            expertise.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Beyoncé also looks terrific in <i>
            Austin Powers in Goldmember</i>. Cast as &quot;whole lotta woman&quot; Foxxy 
            Cleopatra, she carries her formidable afro, hoop earring, and weapon 
            with aplomb -- most often while wearing platforms. Introduced on 
            stage in a club called Studio 69, she sings a strange, occasionally 
            beguiling K.C. and the Sunshine Band medley, stitched together under 
            the title &quot;Hey, Goldmember.&quot; Part disco, part funk, part Shirley 
            Bassey, and part incoherent (not that there's anything wrong with 
            that), the number allows Knowles to show her wondrous stuff. Or 
            rather, it would if the film was able to focus on her for any length 
            of time. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In fact, the song serves mostly as 
            background against which Austin Powers (Mike Myers) enters the '70s, 
            complete with pimp hat, fur coat, cane, 6-inch platforms, and a 
            purple El Dorado fuzzy dice parked outside. As he makes his way into 
            the club, everyone looks him over, including Ms. Foxxy Cleopatra, 
            who, it turns out, is one of the maestro's many on-again-off-again 
            girlfriends. She shoots him several instructional glances (&quot;Meet me 
            over <i>there</i>!&quot;), which he is gleefully slow to uptake -- the 
            presumed hilarity of his entrance demands repeated shots of Myers, 
            er, Austin, er, Goldmember (he being the new character Myers has 
            devised for the film) making faces. By the time Foxxy's performance 
            is over, it's been so cut up by the camera's love for Himself, that 
            she's looking slightly less fine, and lots more pushed off to the 
            side of the scene. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Goldmember, by the way, is &quot;Dutch&quot; 
            as well as gay and double-jointed. It's not precisely clear why he 
            is any of these things, except, that Myers has frequently recalled 
            that he went to European beaches, where he noted denizens' affection 
            for Speedos: somehow this observation has combined with Goldmember's 
            derivation from the Bond villain, not to mention his own affection 
            for himself, his peeling skin (which he removes and consumes), and, 
            more importantly, his metallic member (the result of a &quot;smelting&quot; 
            accident), to form yet another playmate for Dr. Evil (Myers again). 
            That would be in addition to Number 2 (Robert Wagner), Frau 
            Farbissina (Mindy Sterling), Mini-Me (Verne Troyer), and his 
            perpetually beleaguered son Scott (Seth Green), all looking a tad 
            tired by now. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Austin and Goldmember and Foxxy are 
            meeting up in '75 because, well, they can. It would appear that the 
            most enduring aspect of the franchise, aside from Austin's bad teeth 
            and &quot;Yeah, baby!&quot; swagger, is the ability to time-travel, such that 
            even as the plot remains mind-numbingly alike in all installments, 
            something about the location might change (this film also uses the 
            more familiar technique of flashbacks to Austin and Dr. Evil's 
            boarding school days, circa 1950s). Different style cars, different 
            sized shoes and hair. But not to worry: the colors are bright, dance 
            numbers are perky, and libidos are lively, whether the characters 
            are set in the Swinging Sixties, the Psychedelic Seventies, or even 
            the Oh-So-Po-Mo 2000s. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The so-called postmodern 
            self-references of the previous Austin Powers films here become 
            epidemic, though more is not exactly better. It's just more. And it 
            is repetitive. On some level, of course, this is the point: <i>
            International Man of Mystery</i> repeats James Bond, David Niven, 
            and Peter Sellers (among other Mod Era allusions), <i>The Spy who 
            Shagged Me</i> repeats <i>International Man of Mystery</i>, and now,
            <i>Goldmember</i> repeats and rehashes all. In case you've somehow 
            missed the repetition business previously, this movie slams it home 
            with an amusing spritz of <i>Mission Impossible 2</i> (itself a 
            repetition of a repetition), briefly poofed into the proceedings as 
            a movie-within-the-movie. As you might imagine, all this reiterating 
            and hyper-referencing soon become... repetitive. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is one reason why the 
            injection of blaxploitation princess Foxxy Cleopatra seemed like a 
            good idea, cultural territory that Austin and Company had not 
            slashed and burned already. But as her first scene hints, the girl 
            doesn't really have much to do here except pose in her bellbottoms 
            and yell &quot;Shazaam!&quot; when she shoots or judo-chops someone, and 
            sashay out of Austin's bedroom in the morning, purring like she's 
            had a wild night. Much like an olden-days Bond girl, she's reduced 
            to yet another design element in Mike Myers' All-Me-All-The-Time 
            show.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Following their encounter in Studio 
            69, Foxxy convinces Austin to take her back with him to 2002, where 
            they must stop Dr. Evil from using a &quot;tractor beam&quot; to destroy the 
            world, again. Details hardly matter. Director Jay Roach and writer 
            Myers are clearly unconcerned with plot per se, much less character.
            <i>Austin Powers in Goldmember</i> is a clunky traipse through a 
            string of situations -- a few scenes on Dr. Evil's Dr. Evil-shaped 
            submarine (whose preposterously expansive interior rivals that of 
            the Spice Girls' tour bus); a jaunt to Tokyo where Fat Bastard 
            (Myers) is working as a sumo wrestler (a trip that reduces to an 
            extended fart joke); a quick stay for Dr. Evil and Mini-Me in prison 
            (where, in doo-rags and uniforms, they engage in a bizarre parody of 
            Jay-Z's &quot;Hard Knock Life,&quot; including a series of stereotypical 
            rap-video images). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What you don't see in prison might 
            be the only surprise here, given Myers' infamous penchant for body 
            grotesqueries, everywhere on display in the rest of the film. Then 
            again, it's probably better not to imagine just what Mini-Me must do 
            to survive his time inside. That's not to say the film does not make 
            hay of the Mini-Me body anxiety possibilities: he first appears in a 
            snuggly on Dr. Evil's chest, endures the usual rivalry with Scott, 
            and, when he finally falls out with dad, the clone switches over to 
            Austin's side. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This sets up a series of 
            little-and-alarming-body jokes. After Austin mistakes Mini-Me for an 
            &quot;assassin&quot; and spends endless minutes slamming him and dropkicking 
            him about the living room, they bond severely, Mini-Me becoming 
            Mini-Austin, with ruffled ascot and blue velvet suit. Their sortie 
            into Dr. Evil's Lair includes one of those Little Rascals gags, 
            where Austin rides atop Mini-Me's shoulders inside one lab coat; it 
            leads extremely indirectly to one of Myers' favorite bits, the 
            misread scene from behind a screen: this one involves Austin giving 
            birth to Mini-Me, complete with shadows insinuating broken water and 
            umbilical cord. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As jarring as this image seems, it 
            is only one of many exploiting conventional father-son business, in 
            particular the kind where mothers are irrelevant. Indeed, Austin's 
            caper this time involves reconciliation with his own absentee father 
            Nigel (Michael Caine), himself a legendary spy and ladies' man. And 
            yes, Caine is repeating his own performance as spy Harry Palmer in
            <i>The Ipcress File</i>.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Austin and Nigel, Mini-Me and Dr. 
            Evil and Scott and Number 2 and Goldmember: the 
            males-in-various-stages-of-distress parade is long and, need you be 
            reminded, self-replicating. For all their yapping about heterosexual 
            coupling, none of Myers' characters have much to do with girls, or 
            really, anyone else except other Myers' characters. By the time 
            Mini-Me takes to humping Foxxy Cleopatra's leg, under Austin's 
            horrified and completely engaged gaze, her un-necessity becomes 
            utterly clear. As Britney Spears sings on the soundtrack and for 
            about 20 seconds in <i>Goldmember</i>, this is a movie all about 
            &quot;boys.&quot;</font></td>
