</font><font face="Verdana" size="4">Interview with Dylan Kidd</font><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="4"><br>
</font></span><i><font size="1" face="Verdana">interview by
<a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 25 October 2002</font></i></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">When Neil LaBute made his feature 
directorial debut with <i>In the Company of Men</i>, many viewers mistook his 
protagonist Chad's misogynist diatribes for LaBute's own beliefs. While <i>Roger 
Dodger</i> features a similarly articulate and mean-spirited central character 
named Roger Swanson (Campbell Scott), no one will accuse him of being a 
mouthpiece for his creator, writer-director Dylan Kidd. Roger's imposing and 
arrogant manner is a marked contrast to Kidd's more unassuming demeanor. </font>
</b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Roger Dodger</i> is Kidd's first feature, 
but he's getting recognition for his film that most veterans would envy. The 
tale about a sixteen-year-old named Nick (Jesse Eisenberg) who makes the mistake 
of consulting his bitter, lecherous uncle for tips on wooing women, has earned 
the filmmaker three awards at this year's Venice Film Festival. A film 
instructor, Kidd graduated from NYU's Tisch School of the Arts and won awards 
for his 1997 short film <i>Ian's Ghost</i>. He also directed a commercial titled
<i>Evolution</i>, which earned him a &quot;Best Spot You May Never See&quot; from <i>Shoot
</i>magazine.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kidd was in Kansas City to promote the film as 
part of FilmFest KC. Despite the fact that he was able to recruit Scott and 
other name performers like Isabella Rossellini, Jennifer Beals and Elizabeth 
Berkley for his low-budget film, Kidd takes the acclaim and the criticism in 
stride. When he looks at a photo I've taken of him, he comments, &quot;I stopped 
reading my press ever since I was described as a 'roundish fellow.' As least I 
look like I'm not Sidney Greenstreet.&quot; For the record, Kidd is a balding 
red-haired man of moderate proportions and of substantial talent.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>Dan Lybarger: </i></b>Did you ever work 
in advertising?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>Dylan Kidd: </i></b>I did not. I have 
some friends in advertising, so I drew on them a little bit for reference. I 
have not ever worked in advertising.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>I read that you had actually 
directed an ad that won an award.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DK: </i></b>At some point I was trying to 
get some commercial directing work, so I spent my own money and did a spec spot, 
and it got mentioned in <i>Shoot Magazine</i>, an industry trade paper. But that 
did absolutely nothing for my commercial career [laughs]. It's just sort of a 
bizarre little offshoot. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p style="padding-top: 1.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>
How do you explain your scenes to actors?&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DK: </i></b>I think that all you can do 
as a director is to express as clearly as you can what the meat of the scene is. 
I think that a lot directors picture themselves as intimately crafting each 
little moment with the actors. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Obviously, I was on the set with people who had 
done fifty movies apiece. So for me it was much more this is where the audience 
needs to be, and this is what the scene's about. Really, you're just sort of 
there for morale, and you try to create an atmosphere where they feel like they 
can take a chance, and if they screw up, it's not a big deal. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I really feel the director's biggest role is to 
set the vibe on the set. Most of the notes I would give the actors between takes 
would be &quot;Let's not repeat ourselves. What can we do that's different? You 
basically build the performance in the editing. Like a lot of first time 
directors, I had expected there would be this perfect take. &quot;Oh, we got it. 
Great.&quot; And then in the editing room, you'd always use take threes, but you get 
good moments in all of [the takes], so you just cut and paste. By the end of the 
shoot, I'd walk up to the actor and say &quot;We need to do one more for safety. What 
haven't we done yet?&quot; </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>How did you assemble the 
cast?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DK: </i></b>The story was that it was 
blind luck in that as you guys all know the industry is set up so that it's very 
difficult for untested writers and directors to get scripts into the hands of 
name actors. So my producing partner, Anne Chaisson, and I spent six months last 
year trying to do this. We had a couple of actors in mind for Roger, and we just 
hit that firewall of agents and managers. We were making slow progress: the no 
money no actor and no actor no money Catch-22. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Out of desperation I started carrying the 
script around with me and ran into a couple of actors, and they were very 
polite, but they said, &quot;I can't accept unsolicited material. You'll have to talk 
to my agent.&quot; I knew that was just sending it into the void.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">One day I walked into a coffee shop I'd never 
been in before in my life, and Campbell Scott walked in five minutes later. Of 
course, I had a copy of the script with me because I'd been practically sleeping 
with it for the past three weeks. I went up to Campbell and was fully expecting 
to get the usual speech. The universe had sent me to the one guy who runs his 
career a little bit differently. He read it and said he'd call me back in two 
weeks. I never thought I'd hear from him again, but he called back and said he 
liked it. He wondered if I was interested in directing it. I said [I] was. I 
showed him a short film I'd done. We met, and he came on board. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Not only is he the lead in the film, but he's 
one of the executive producers. I think sometimes when I see an actor or actress 
get an executive producer credit, I think it's a sham/vanity credit. Campbell 
earned that credit by bringing us Jennifer Beals, Elizabeth Berkley and getting 
us to our money people. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It was amazing. In one week we went from not 
being able to get anyone to return our phone calls -- being one of 10,000 people 
in New York who have a script and a dream -- to me sitting with Campbell going, 
'Who do you want for Sophie?' I had my stupid list of everyone I wanted to work 
with, and it turns out that Jennifer Beals was my first choice before I even met 
Campbell. I thought this is unrealistic because Jennifer Beals would be my first 
choice. &quot;Oh, Jenny. I'll call her no problem. What about for Joyce?&quot; I'd say, 
&quot;We'd need somebody big like in the realm of an Isabella Rossellini.&quot; &quot;He'd say, 
'What about Isabella? I've worked with her.&quot; It was something I was hoping he'd 
say [laughs].</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It was like <i>Alice in Wonderland</i>. I met 
Campbell in July; we were shooting in October. In three months, it was insane.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>What about the kid, Jesse 
Eisenberg?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DK: </i></b>He's in another film in the 
festival, <i>The Emperor's Club</i>. Jesse's about to hit big. When I was first 
writing the script, I was keeping a wish list in my computer as a motivational 
tool, so if I saw a movie and I liked the way the art director or the costume 
design was, I'd write a name down in case I had a choice of anybody to work 
with. Then I saw Jesse in a promo for a Fox show called <i>Get Real</i> a couple 
of years ago. I jotted the name and didn't really think much of it. I thought 
he'd be good, but by the time we make this damn movie he'll be too old or 
whatever. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The first thing Anne and I did when we had a 
draft of this thing we had a screenplay reading in New York. And our casting 
director, when I first met with her, held up two headshots for Nick, and one of 
them was for Jesse. And I had one of those gut moments like it has to be him. It 
had to be him. You're not going to ignore all these coincidences. He absolutely 
blew us away at the reading. He absolutely <i>owned</i> the reading. We never 
read a single other actor for him.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>The dialog seemed so natural. 
How much was written down and how much was improvised?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DK: </i></b>People ask if it's an 
improvised film, but it's completely scripted, but [the actors] are so good that 
it just feels spontaneous. When Campbell first agreed to do this, he said, 
&quot;Jesus, it's like <i>Hamlet</i>, so I'm going to have to approach this as if I'm 
learning lines for a play.&quot; His theater background helped him because he's used 
to having tons of words.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>:
</i></b>How do you keep a scuzzy character like Roger from being too repulsive 
for an audience to stomach?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DK: </i></b>I wish I knew. Much of it is 
just luck. You just trust your instincts, and I know I'd been a really big fan 
of Mike Leigh's <i>Naked</i>, a film that has a really despicable main 
character. Maybe the lesson I took from that film subconsciously is that if you 
have a character who's very smart and who's passionately expressing ideas, then 
that's charismatic. There's a lot of very cynical, very bored people in the 
world, and as long as you really believe what you're saying, there's something 
really compelling about that even if what you're saying is a load of shite.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We got a miracle of a performance from 
Campbell. It's all him. He didn't soften the character, but there's something 
about Campbell that makes you keep giving him the benefit of a doubt. With the 
wrong actor, people leave the theater by page ten. &quot;Who wants to listen to this 
jackass for an hour and a half?&quot; But there's something about Campbell that you 
just feel like, &quot;Oh, maybe if I keep hanging in, he'll find some redeeming 
thing.&quot; </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>Which of the two characters 
do you find yourself more like?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DK: </i></b>In a way they're both 
idealized, so I would say I'm probably somewhere in the middle. I definitely 
think that Roger is definitely fascinating. I love them both. I feel that Nick 
is a little more of a blank slate. Roger is a little more a product of his 
environment. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I'm interested in people who are shaped by 
where they live and what they do. I think Roger represents a certain New York 
type. This is a guy who's basically confused his work with the rest of his life. 
He can't decide if he's trying to seduce somebody or he's advertising, and he's 
the product. It's all kind of mixed up. It's not excusing his behavior, but I 
definitely feel that anybody who lives in a city deals with imagery. It's very 
difficult to find out who you are and your connection to anybody else in this 
bizarre world we've created.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>Roger seems to be a really 
miserable individual. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DK: </i></b>He's completely miserable. I 
assume that anybody that's such a know-it-all -- when I meet people in real life 
who are in-your-face, almost cocky -- I assume they're miserable. Nobody can be 
that way unless there's some big problem. Maybe it's just me. I never take 
people at face value. I always feel like people who talk a lot are shy people. 
People who are quiet have a lot to say. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>It reminds me of what Oliver 
Hardy said about his regular character. He said something like I play the 
biggest fool in the world; I think I know something. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DK: </i></b>I used to do some teaching in 
New York, and I used to tell my students, &quot;The only difference between you and 
me is I <i>know</i> I don't know anything. You think you know something about 
filmmaking, but you don't.&quot; That's Roger's problem. He thinks he has a strategy 
that's working for him when all of the evidence is his life is that he's flaming 
out completely. Nick comes to him looking for advice, and Nick's actually more 
on the ball. He's got everything he needs. For me what the movie's about is the 
male idea that there's a right way to do something, a strategy, when if fact, 
life is so much more moment-to-moment. Something that Nick has to learn is that 
nobody has the answers for him. Everybody's just floundering.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>Your ending kind of reflects 
that. You put Nick in a situation and don't tell us what he's going to do.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DK: </i></b>You don't know. You just hope 
something's going to work. I thought it would be better to let people imagine 
what Nick might say rather than if I'd written the line. This might not have 
been intentional, but what I think is working about the ending is that it forces 
people to go back over the movie and think about Nick and where you think he's 
going to go from here. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I think it's a happy ending. I know he's not 
going to turn into another Roger. I love endings that are what I call &quot;The 
Parking Lot Factor.&quot; You will still be talking about it in the parking lot. 
&quot;What do you think he's going to say?&quot; To me, it's never been an ambiguous 
ending. I feel like Nick's going to be OK.&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>You're originally from 
Massachusetts. Is that correct?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DK: </i></b>I went to high school in 
Boston. I'm from all over the East Coast.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>Why does Nick come from Ohio?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DK: </i></b>I don't know. It's the kind 
of classic stupid East Coast saying, &quot;You need a sort of innocent character. 
He'll come from Ohio! They don't have sex!&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's the same thing as the names. I think the 
names in this movie are so dumb. Something pops in your head, and you do it. You 
don't do anything about it. You think, &quot;I'll change it if I have to, and I'll 
get used to it.&quot; Isabella Rossellini's character is named &quot;Joyce Maynard,&quot; which 
doesn't make any sense. Sometimes you try to work in shorthand. If you're going 
to do a buddy movie, which is what this is, you should have the complete 
opposite. I didn't buy that a kid from the Coast or another big city would be as 
starry-eyed as Nick.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>Maybe he's starry-eyed 
because his home life is pretty dreary. He's got family problems there.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DK: </i></b>I can't speak for anybody 
else, but when I was that age, I had the sneaking suspicion that there was some 
secret out there if people would just tell me, it would make life so much 
easier. In fact, nobody can. The joke premise of the movie is that this kid 
basically picks the worst person on earth to ask advice. It's like literally 
asking … I can't think of anything right now…&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>Like asking Jeffrey Dahmer 
for cooking tips. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DK: </i></b>Exactly. &quot;Jeffrey, I need to 
work on my people skills a bit.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is not a movie that has big plot twists, 
so the audience is going to be less forgiving about things that don't seem 
motivated. It's important that even if people don't know it intellectually, if 
they can at some gut level, can understand that Roger is angry at Nick. There's 
a lot of misdirected anger. It's almost like part of him thinks he's helping 
him, but he's torturing the kid a little bit. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>It kind of reminded me of the 
Art Garfunkel and Jack Nicholson relationship in <i>Carnal Knowledge</i>. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DK: </i></b>Oh, God, yeah. I'm a big fan 
of that. When you're close to people oftentimes, you have these conflicting 
things. He wants to help his nephew, but he's also pissed because he has access 
[to the rest of his family]. &quot;You want to know how to talk to women? Let's go.&quot; 
But it's like he won't let Nick go to the bathroom. He's forcing Nick to drink 
on that death march they're on.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p style="padding-top: 1.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>
The cinematography's interesting. Did you use natural lighting?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DK: </i></b>The movie is [artificially] 
lit, but Joaquin [Baca-Asay], who was our director of photography and I both 
really <i>hate</i> films that look lit. We were able to push the film stock. 
It's deliberately lit, but we were able to use light sources, like neon and 
sodium vapor. I hate it when I go to the movies and I can feel the crew just 
inside of the frame. &quot;That's obviously not an apartment on the upper west side. 
That's obviously a boom mike here.&quot; We wanted to make this feel like we ran out 
into the streets with the actors. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The cinematographer-director relationship is 
probably the core relationship, apart from working with the cast. To me, I work 
in film; I want to tell stories in pictures. As talky a movie as it is, we 
always felt that these people live in an environment. Roger is the way he is 
because of the smoking, the booze, the neon light. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We shot this film stock [52-7], and it's [Hong 
Kong director] Wong Kar-wai's film stock. Joaquin and I were really struck by a 
film called <i>In the Mood for Love</i>. He tends to shoot this stock, which is 
rated at 320. He pushes it two stops.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What Joaquin did in this movie is very gutsy. 
Let's go so balls-to-the-wall with how much we underexpose this film. Let's 
terrify ourselves. There was the big scene with Jennifer Beals. I remember going 
to give Jennifer a note, and our gaffer came up with a meter, and Joaquin was 
going &quot;How are we doing, John?&quot; And John came in with his meter, and it just 
said, &quot;Error!&quot; Joaquin went, &quot;Good.&quot; There is a weird reward in film when you go 
for it, and we got a lot of interesting effects by working so far down in the 
lens. Jennifer's getting a kick from a streetlight that's a block away. The 
light goes from green to yellow to red. You see it in her hair. It's all 
Joaquin. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>It's interesting that with 
the emphasis on atmosphere, Roger's apartment is actually rather spare. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DK: </i></b>You try to keep things as 
simple as possible. The main thing I wanted to get across to people, by whatever 
we do with his apartment, is that this is not happy. Isabella's apartment is 
supposed to be like, &quot;stay there.&quot; He goes home to his place. There is a certain 
type of horrible single-professional-in-New York that has the same white door 
with the same peephole. It's gross. I remember that shot of him coming in the 
door, and somebody in the art department said, &quot;We've got to dress it up. It's 
so plain.&quot; And I said, &quot;No! Leave it! It's horrible.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>He doesn't spend a lot of 
time at home.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DK: </i></b>It's the apartment of a bar 
fly. It's a place where you go, and you change your socks. You open the 
refrigerator, and there's one half-opened beer. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>This movie did very well at 
the Venice Film Festival. You've made this really verbal movie, and you'd think 
they'd have to know something about New York to get it, but they got it right 
away.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DK: </i></b>Venice just went over-the-top 
for us. We thought we were in this little sidebar section. I'd never been to 
Italy before. &quot;Why don't I go to Venice?&quot; We were blown away by the Italian 
response. One theory I had was that to Italians, [Roger's] just another guy 
trying to make it. It was hugely gratifying to watch the film with subtitles and 
have people laugh at all the right parts. I hope that our international company 
is happy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I don't want to take up your time, but I have a 
funny anecdote about doing press in Italy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>Go ahead and do it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DK: </i></b>One of the things that the 
Italians seemed to respond to is that it seemed to remind them of a certain kind 
of comedy that was being done by a director called Dino Risi. Have you ever 
heard of him? I had heard of him, but I had never seen any of the movies.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">So, we get there, and we didn't realize there 
was this huge buzz about the movie because the critics put us on the map. I woke 
up, and I was crashed out by jet lag in a chair by the pool, and I got shaken 
awake by a festival person. &quot;You have to go right now because they're doing a 
national live radio thing, and they want you to go right now.&quot; I go, and I'm 
running in. There's like 200 people watching, and our voices are being broadcast 
over speakers over the whole lead out. I sit down, and I put on the headphones. 
A woman says, &quot;Don't worry. They'll ask you in Italian, and I'll translate for 
you.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">[A reporter] asks a long question, and the 
translator says, &quot;We have Dino Risi's son and grandson here, and we can tell 
that your work is obviously inspired by Dino Risi, particularly <i>Il Sorpasso</i>, 
which just screened tonight. Can you talk about the influence of the movie <i>Il 
Sorpasso</i>?&quot; It's live radio, and I'm still half awake, and I just called upon 
every lying instinct you develop as a director. &quot;It's flattering to be compared 
to a giant such as Dino Rissi.&quot; It was bizarre. Sometime you realize that people 
are taking something into a movie and just running with it, giving it new 
meaning. It's sort of out of your hands.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>What was the atmosphere of 
the shoot like because you worked on <i>Roger Dodger </i>in New York shortly 
after the 9-11 attacks?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>DK: </b></i>We started shooting on 
October 22. I'd never been on a set like that. I'd been on a lot of sets as a 
film technician. For me personally it was a great way to get back to work.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I think that filmmakers tend to fall into a bit 
of self indulgence, and you start sweating about something that doesn't matter. 
What happened was that everyone's head was screwed on straight. It was a really 
pleasant four weeks. I usually have to yell about not having enough extras, and 
people were happy to be working. It, in a weird way, made for a very intense 
collaborative atmosphere.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>I understand that Campbell 
Scott's a pretty tall guy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DK: </i></b>Yes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>Did you have any difficulty 
trying to stage scenes with him and some of the shorter performers?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DK: </i></b>It helped us in that it 
played the man-boy thing. We did everything we could to make Roger look like he 
was towering over Jesse. We made his suit just a little bit too small so that he 
feels a little squirmy and uncomfortable in his own skin. He uses everything at 
his disposal.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As a director you try to make the movie come 
first, but there are a couple of guilty pleasures. For the me, it was the shot 
of (Scott) bobbing out of the sea of adolescents, so we got that shot. &quot;All 
right. I've got my one gift for myself.&quot;</font></p>
