            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Roger Dodger</i> features a 
            protagonist who's so abrasive, it's a wonder that he doesn't send 
            viewers charging for the exits.&nbsp; Fortunately, Campbell Scott (<i>The 
            Spanish Prisoner</i>) imbues the arrogant, predatory Roger Swanson 
            with a skewed intelligence. To an uniformed listener, Roger's 
            diatribes about gender roles, technology and other subjects sound 
            mesmerizingly logical. </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Roger's gift makes him a prodigious 
            ad copywriter and a miserable person. His affair with his boss Joyce 
            (Isabella Rossellini) has cooled to subzero temperatures, and 
            despite his silver tongue, Roger usually goes to his Spartan New 
            York apartment alone. Only someone like his nephew Nick (Jesse 
            Eisenberg) from Ohio could find Roger a worthy role model. The 
            sixteen-year-old lad runs away to the Big Apple in hopes of learning 
            how to score with women. Roger takes the lad to a series of 
            nightspots leading to amusingly disastrous results. Gorgeous older 
            women (played by the likes of Jennifer Beals and Elizabeth Berkley) 
            in droves find Nick's earnestness rather endearing, filling the 
            older-but-not-wiser Roger with envy. Nick may be naïve, but he's 
            bright enough to figure out that his uncle's diatribes shouldn't be 
            confused with fact. Similarly, Scott and novice writer-director 
            Dylan Kidd manage to make Roger repulsively fascinating. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Scott delivers his remarks about 
            the obsolescence of men, which open the film, in a flippant manner. 
            Roger comes across as funny and erudite, having a seemingly endless 
            grasp of several subjects. Scott gives Roger a deceptive sense of 
            authority that makes these and other diatribes sound like scripture. 
            Because Roger is so booksmart, we often get the false sense that 
            he'll eventually right himself.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kidd, however, later reveals that 
            Roger, despite his casual manner, actually does feel useless. Roger 
            laments that his job as an ad copywriter is to remind readers of 
            needs they don't really have. Similarly, Kidd and Eisenberg give 
            Nick a winning blend of innocence and common sense. Nick may have 
            come to New York with less than honorable goals, but he senses the 
            inherent self-destructiveness in Roger's lifestyle.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The setup is simple, and the lead 
            characters are almost types. Kidd throws in some intriguing twists 
            that make Roger and Nick believably human. His <b><i>cinema-verité</i>-</b>like 
            techniques (handheld cameras, and pale, muted images) also give the 
            rather talky film an energy and spontaneity it wouldn't have 
            otherwise. It's a safe bet that Nick will fare better than his uncle 
            will, but because the events look real, the movie doesn't become 
            predictable. Kidd's sharp dialogue is another asset. When Roger 
            tires of Nick's earnestness and envies the attention that women are 
            giving his nephew, he declares, &quot;This is my nephew. His name is 
            Jesus.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Despite how well Scott and 
            Eisenberg play off each other, the supporting cast is never 
            completely upstaged. Rossellini is likeably maternal, and Beals and 
            Berkley reveal a talent that hadn't been evident in their earlier 
            roles. If she keeps this up, Berkley might be able to make us forget
