            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>As the title character in <i>Undercover
            Brother</i>, the comedian Eddie Griffin sports a mushroom-like Afro,
            wide-lapel shirts and jackets and platform shoes, and drives a
            honey-coloured Cadillac De Ville in which he can take a sharp corner
            or a skid without spilling one drop of the orangeade in his Big Gulp
            cup.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This almost knight-like acolyte to
            Seventies Funk is recruited by a James Bondian organization, the
            B.R.O.T.H.E.R.H.O.O.D., who are fighting a James Bondian nemesis,
            the Man, who seek to rob African-Americans of their African-Americanness.
            In this instance, they capture a renowned Army
            general-turned-politician (Billy Dee Williams, who looks a little
            perplexed at times) who, instead of announcing his candidacy for
            U.S. president, tells a press conference that he's opening a fried
            chicken franchise. Something must be wrong!</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The B.R.O.T.H. -- oh, you know, is
            run by Chief Brother (Chi McBride), who sputters, smokes cigars, and
            has a framed picture of Danny Glover hanging prominently behind his
            desk; Smart Brother (Gary Anthony Williams), who's the brainy
            scientist of the group; and Conspiracy Brother (Dave Chappelle), who
            sees conspiracies against the black man everywhere. There's also
            Sistah Girl (Aunjanue Ellis), who can take care of herself just
            fine, thank you. (&quot;That's 'Sis-TAH', not 'Sis-TER'!&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>she says, making sure her name retains its funk quotient.)
            Undercover Brother goes undercover as a business executive in a
            front company run by the Man, meets up with a potentially lethal
            female (Denise Richards, making up for her misadventures last year
            in <i>Valentine</i>), and begins sounding like Urkel in <i>Family
            Matters</i>, taking a liking to khakis and turtleneck sweaters and
            even -- horrors! -- mayonnaise.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The most weapon-like object
            Undercover Brother carries is a wristwatch that dispenses hot sauce
            -- the deal is that he's so cool, he doesn't need to rely on guns or
            knives. But the negative, even ferocious, connotations that The Man
            had in the Sixties and Seventies have been rejiggled for this movie
            -- here, it's an entity that simply seeks to change
            African-Americans so that they're the same as everyone else, like
            the book-burners in <i>Fahrenheit 451</i> who didn't want people to
            become confused and unhappy by too many ideas. Undercover Brother,
            by his own admission, stands for the ideals of being yourself,
            &quot;finding your own funky part&quot;, and standing up for what's
            right.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While there are a wealth of ideas,
            here, the filmmakers may have overcompensated in order to make an
            entertainment that would appeal to everyone -- it feels blanded-out,
            and doesn't have the bite or edginess of the blaxploitation movies
            and Seventies funk culture from which it draws on. (The movie's
            source material, an animated cartoon created by John Ridley for the
            Internet, was supposed to have had some of that.) The film jolts to
            life with some of that, briefly, when James Brown is captured by a
            subaltern (Chris Kattan) of the Man -- Brown busts one of his moves,
            growls out one of his signature get-down growls, and the burst of
            sheer raw power that comes forth in that instance is enough to make
            the evildoers cower defensively. (James Brown doesn't need any guns
            or knives, either!)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Chris Kattan's fey, rubber-lipped
            style of comic acting simply just isn't my cup of tea. Eddie Griffin
            does have the right amount of innate &quot;coolness&quot; needed to
            keep from looking like, as one character puts it, &quot;Macy Gray
            with porkchop sideburns&quot; -- he narrows his eyes, leans into the
            camera, and breaks into a my-T-fine grin to win us over. But he's
            playing a set of mannerisms, here: there's not enough of a character
            underneath to give what he's doing much heft. The picture's far from
            terrible, but it feels awfully lightweight once it's over with. But
            stick around at the end or you'll miss one of the funniest parts of
            the movie, which appears during the end credits (it involves Oreo
            cookies) -- it's a throwaway, but it's a hoot nonetheless.</font></td>
