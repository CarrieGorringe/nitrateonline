            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">When Jean-Luc Godard's film <i>
            In Praise of Love</i> premiered at Cannes in May, 2001, all anyone 
            could talk about afterwards was the Spielberg bit. Some American 
            types show up at the home of an aging married couple on the coast of 
            Brittany to buy the rights to their life story as Resistance 
            fighters during the Second World War: William Styron will write the 
            screenplay, and Juliette Binoche will be gotten to star in it 
            because she just won the Oscar. One young woman -- the couple's 
            granddaughter, in fact -- raises an objection: Americans, and 
            particularly Hollywood, has no stories of its own, so they go around 
            and buy up other people's. Steven Spielberg did very well by the 
            story of Oskar Schindler, but not a penny went to Schindler's widow. 
            That may be because Spielberg bought the rights to Thomas Keneally's 
            book, not the rights to the Schindlers (And, anyway, Spielberg has 
            spent a great deal of money since then to set up the Shoah 
            Foundation, whose purpose is to record and preserve the histories of 
            all living Holocaust survivors).</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I can't argue with the fact that 
            Hollywood has, still, successfully globalized the world -- a look at 
            the international box office charts in weekly &quot;Variety&quot; will confirm 
            that. And, while the Americans in the film may seem callous in 
            buying the couple's life story, why is the couple selling it to 
            begin with? The reasons for that, as it turns out, are not so 
            innocuous, either.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The scene takes up a relatively 
            tiny part of Godard's film, and it is but one component of Godard's 
            general concern, which has to do with the reduction of life to the 
            form of image -- or, more precisely, surface -- without weight, 
            meaning, or relevance. The main character, Edgar (Bruno Putzulu), is 
            a young, studious, serious-minded artist who has financial backing 
            to make a project, but he can't quite realize what that project is 
            going to be, or even what final form it's going to take. The first 
            hour of the film, showing Edgar bustling to and fro throughout 
            Paris, is shot in 35 mm. black-and-white film, and it is simply 
            gorgeous to the eye, with nighttime scenes that evoke the same 
            atmosphere, allure, and sheen as that in Jean-Pierre Melville's 
            great film <i>Bob le Flambeur</i>. There's also good reason for the 
            black-and-white: Edgar's backer (Remo Forlani) is buying up works of 
            art, part of a collection that was scattered during the war, and at 
            one point he's shown two paintings to examine -- identifying the 
            paintings, and who they are by, is another matter, since the 
            cinematography, of course, takes away all the color so that they're 
            practically reduced to daubs and splashes. The artwork is simply 
            something else of value that's traded and handed about, like 
            currency and stocks, without any individual identity.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Edgar is seen seeking out and 
            talking to a woman (Cécile Camp), whom he tracks down working as a 
            custodian in a train yard, cleaning out the empty passenger cars -- 
            he seems to want to talk her into appearing, in some capacity, in 
            his project, and she keeps, gently but assuredly, saying &quot;no.&quot; Edgar 
            knows the woman from somewhere before -- something the film reveals, 
            at the one hour mark, when it jumps back in time to two years 
            earlier, and Godard shifts gears from film to digital video, which 
            is introduced into <i>In Praise of Love</i> with nothing short of a 
            blast of color -- the effect is near-ravishing. The woman, Berthe, 
            is the granddaughter of the couple who were former Resistance 
            fighters -- she is at their home when the Americans visit because 
            she works in a law office in Paris. Edgar meets her when he visits 
            Brittany to interview people as part of a project regarding 
            Catholics who worked in the Resistance. Berthe receives, as a gift, 
            a copy of Robert Bresson's book &quot;Notes on the Cinematograph&quot; (part 
            of a running, and beautiful, homage Godard makes to Bresson 
            throughout the film), from which she reads a quote about how 
            feelings should bring about events, and not the other way around. 
            Edgar is also seen carrying with him, as if it were a talisman or a 
            guide, a copy of the works of Simone Weil. Godard's inclusion of 
            this book in the film is not arbitrary, as aspects of Weil's life 
            turn out to have a lot to do with how <i>In Praise of Love</i> has 
            been shaped. Weil, during her brief life period (1909-43), started 
            out as a proletarian activist and ended up becoming a spiritual 
            philosopher; she dropped out of the teaching profession to work for 
            a time as a factory worker; Weil's Jewish family fled from France 
            for the U.S. (by way of Casablanca) in 1942, but the following year 
            Simone went to the U.K. to work for the Free French forces 
            headquartered there. She succumbed to tuberculosis in a British 
            sanitarium in 1943, during which she refused to eat, believing that 
            what she did not eat would, instead, go to help her compatriots in 
            occupied France. (One cannot help but make comparisons between this 
            life arc and that of Godard's career, as well. Starting out as a 
            filmmaker and polemicist, Godard became radicalized in the second 
            part of the 1960s, set up a filmmaking collective that would turn 
            out films for the workers, and, when that failed, retreated for a 
            time to work on experimental videos, reemerging as a feature 
            filmmaker in the 1980s whose films began addressing spiritual 
            matters, most notably in 1985's <i>Hail, Mary</i> and 1994's <i>
            Helas pour Moi</i>.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At the start of <i>In Praise of 
            Love</i>, Edgar's project, he professes to the varied and sundry 
            people whom he meets with, is to be about the four stages of love. 
            Or about the four ages of love, love as experienced by the very 
            young to the very old. We then learn that Edgar started out with an 
            exact, and potentially vibrant, idea, but then, gradually, lost his 
            way with it -- it became stale and flat, something that he simply 
            continued to work on by rote. The project became divorced from its 
            essence, and isolated -- in the same way that Edgar's work in Paris 
            isolates him from the possibility of a love that was unrealized in 
            Brittany. (He doesn't even find out until later that he and Berthe 
            took the same train back to Paris.) Elsewhere in the film, people 
            speak of how &quot;resistance&quot; -- that is, resistance to apathy, 
            alienation, programmed indifference -- can be achieved only through 
            &quot;memory or universality.&quot; Godard does not seek to kick anyone out of 
            the boat, or send anyone off to stand with their nose in the corner. 
            In order to keep both the past and the present alive and vital, he 
            calls for us to come together and not grow apart, from the lessons 
            of history, the artistic voices of those past, or from each other. 
            Now in his early 70s, Godard expresses an urgency which most 
            moviemakers nowadays can only dream of attaining.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>In Praise of Love</i> has been 
            criticized in some quarters as being &quot;murky.&quot; I can only assume 
            these comments were made by people whose heads were in burlap bags. 
            The film has come not to bury cinema, but to give us a reason to 
            become excited about it, again.</font></p>
