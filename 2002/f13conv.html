Paula Nechak</a>, 14 June 2002</font></i></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">With only two films under her belt, director 
Jill Sprecher, who co-scripts her films with her younger sister, Karen, 
certainly merits the best actors for her quiet, detailed movies. <i>
Clockwatchers</i> starred Parker Posey, Toni Collette and Lisa Kudrow and was a 
precise and perfectly rendered look at the hell envisioned by a temp worker in 
new and impersonal corporate surroundings; Sprecher¹s new movie, <i>Thirteen 
Conversations About One Thing</i>, features Matthew McConaughey, Alan Arkin, Amy 
Irving, John Turturro, Clea DuVall and Barbara Sukowa as New Yorkers weaving 
through five stories about fate and events that have an impact upon one another, 
finally forming one significant tale with a single message and meaning. ³We 
count them happy who endure,² says a title card in the film and it, considering 
Sprecher herself survived a fateful encounter with a stranger in 1985 when he 
smashed her in the head with a bottle, is mostly about finding the courage to 
change for the better. We change because we have to, certainly, and Sprecher¹s 
carefully integrated, expositional morality play that encompasses past, present 
and future tense, hope, and in my mind, dignity, is a work that embraces 
everyday urban existence and survival and turns the ordinary into something 
extraordinary. Sprecher met to talk about her movie during its screenings at the 
2002 Seattle International Film Festival.</font></b></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>Paula Nechak: </i></b>So, how many 
responses have you had to the ³one thing² of the title?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>Jill Sprecher: </i></b>It¹s great because 
people are seeing a lot of different things. Some have said faith or grace, 
others happiness. We read somewhere that someone thought it was about 
dissolution or entropy. It¹s interesting, when my sister, Karen, and I had the 
title; initially we were sure people were going to assume it meant sex [laughs]. 
All the answers are great.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>PN: </i></b>There¹s a very interesting 
color palette in the film. In <i>Clockwatchers</i> everything was florescent and 
too bright. This film is full of dark greens and soothing colors which really 
bounce against the subject matter. How carefully do you integrate script and the 
visual look?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>JS: </i></b>It¹s weird because my sister, 
Karen, and I write certain details into our scripts and one of the things we 
envisioned in this film was that we didn¹t want any white in the color palette 
other than as a motif that would float through the stories to link them 
together, like the white shirt. We wanted to differentiate the characters, 
creating individual environments by making slight variations on the color but 
still having one overall movie and having an audience psychically link these 
people. We took the script to Dick Pope, our cinematographer, as well as our 
production and costume designers and when we took our first meeting everyone 
separately brought up a painting by Edward Hopper. His paintings are sort of a 
reference now for urban isolation and so we used a couple of his works as a 
springboard.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>PN: </i></b>in both your films you allow 
story to unfold on its own terms, there¹s time, quietness, honesty and dignity 
in there. Even when your characters behave badly they still maintain a kind of 
innate dignity. Is that something essential to you as a storyteller?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>JS: </i></b>I love the way you said that, 
I never thought of it that way but as you know a lot of the material is 
autobiographical, including the people who do terrible things. My sister and I 
haven¹t gone to the extreme of say, Alan Arkin¹s character, but we¹ve certainly 
felt his envy. I think because we so understand these characters we don¹t see 
any of them as bad people. They¹re flawed but they¹re probably their own worst 
enemies.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>PN: </i></b>Is it your view of the world 
that there are patterns of quiet? Is there more said in the unspoken than the 
spoken?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>JS: </i></b>Yes. There was a sparseness 
to the script and maybe it subconsciously influences the performances, I¹m not 
sure. The actors also dictate the way a movie should be edited. There¹s a 
tendency now to quickly get out a line and quickly get the reaction shot. I¹m 
lucky to have worked with Stephen Mirrione twice now and he¹s the best editor in 
the business. I like to think we discovered him and he¹s been stolen by bigger 
people in the business [he cut Steven Soderbergh¹s <i>Traffic</i>] but he¹s very 
attuned to the nuances of performance and he edits based upon performance.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>PN: </i></b>I¹ve heard your film compared 
to Mamet or Kieslowski - do you find it difficult to wear comparisons when you 
write from your own experiences?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>JS: </i></b>That¹s good company [laughs]. 
Now I know where the Mamet comes in - probably from <i>Glengarry Glen Ross</i> - 
somebody compared <i>Clockwatchers</i> to it, a female version, though I wasn¹t 
thinking of it when we wrote it. But Mamet¹s very specific about language and 
having actors say it as written and my sister and I always look at the script as 
a blueprint which is handed over to experts. It¹s more a living organism that 
grows while you¹re doing it. But if I had to pick a cinematic reference for this 
movie I think it would be Stanley Kubrick. He has a great sense of isolation 
with his characters and I was very struck, when I was studying film, by the 
structure of <i>The Killing</i>. It jumped all over in time but you always felt 
you were moving forward.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>PN: </i></b>Your films are ensemble 
pieces and you opt to work collaboratively with your sister in the 
scriptwriting. What do you think of the auteur theory?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>JS: </i></b>I think a movie is total 
collaboration and I¹m such an inexperienced director that in going into <i>
Clockwatchers</i> I was like, ³One of these people doesn¹t belong in this group² 
[laughs]. I thought if anyone asks me something at least my sister and I wrote 
it and we know what we were trying to say and we know the characters and so I 
can answer on that level. In my mind a director is an ultimate decision maker 
but I like to learn from everyone on the set. I understand the auteur theory, 
especially if you see a body of a person¹s work and see interests or stylistic 
things appear, but it¹s weird that when we wrote the script for <i>Thirteen 
Conversations About One Thing</i> we thought we wrote something opposite of <i>
Clockwatchers</i>. We were stunned by people constantly telling us they saw 
similarities.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>PN: </i></b>For a woman who¹s endured a 
³random attack² and participates in a business that¹s as uncertain as you can 
get, there¹s irony in the fact that your scripts try to find order in chaos.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>JS: </i></b>That¹s something I¹m obsessed 
with in movies and in life. When I got hit in the head with that bottle I 
remember making a choice that day - I could have either called a messenger to 
run something around the corner or I could have saved six dollars and delivered 
it myself. You start to think, ³If I had only turned this way instead of that.² 
It¹s natural to say ³what if² or ³why.² Plus I studied philosophy undergraduate 
and you¹re trained to look for meaning [laughs]. That¹s the whole reason for 
writing - to take apparent chaos and find order in it.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>PN: </i></b>Where do you think a film is 
actually ³made?² It¹s a question I like to ask directors. John Sayles says the 
editing room, James Ivory says it¹s the casting -</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>JS: </i></b>It¹s between the two. The 
director¹s most important job is picking the right people who will be involved 
in the movie and once that¹s done it¹s about trying to create an environment 
that¹s comfortable for everybody to do the best work they can. Editing is the 
final rewrite of a movie, so many things can happen that you can¹t predict while 
you¹re shooting and usually they turn out better than you think. Stephen 
Marrione read every draft and it took us three-and-a-half years to get the money 
for the film, which we lost while shooting, so he had a very short window to 
edit the movie. We had to go back and re-envision things in their simplest form 
so it was wonderful to go into the editing room with him because he knew the 
essence of it and he cut it in six-and-a-half weeks.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>PN: </i></b>You¹ve said you and your 
sister are very similar. Does that symbiotic element make it easier or harder to 
write and bounce ideas off of each other?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>JS: </i></b>I¹ve written things on my own 
but they¹re nothing I¹m proud of. It¹s fun for us because writing is so 
solitary. It becomes less like work and more like fun because it¹s a dialogue. I 
say we¹re similar because obviously we share a gene pool and background 
experiences. But in film she has more mainstream taste and mine is off the path. 
She¹ll tell me, ³That¹s too weird, you¹re the only person in the universe who¹ll 
get it.² So we balance each other out. Maybe it would be better to work with a 
polar opposite but we¹re so comfortable it feels honest. It saves a lot of time 
in the end.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>PN: </i></b>You cast phenomenally well - 
between both films you¹ve had Parker Posey, Toni Collette, Lisa Kudrow, Matthew 
McConaughey, Alan Arkin, Amy Irving, John Turturro, Clea DuVall and even Barbara 
Sukowa in parts. You use real actors, not personalities. How do you like to work 
with your actors? What experience would you like them to have when they work 
with you?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>JS: </i></b>I can¹t believe they agreed 
to be in the movies. And I don¹t think Hollywood knows what to do with Matthew 
because he¹s a character actor in a leading man¹s body. He was amazing and so 
smart. First, rehearsal is a luxury on any movie and with this budget it was out 
of the question. Getting a schedule for all these actors was so convoluted. In 
the end they really took it in and did the research. They did the details and 
they just got it. From the initial meeting we were all on the same wavelength 
and each actor had their own method to make the character his or hers.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>PN: </i></b>I love the ending of <i>
Thirteen Conversations...</i> because the current trend in contemporary 
literature and movies is to not have an ending that¹s in tune to what¹s come 
before.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>JS: </i></b>We would never dream of doing 
anything unless we knew the ending. I think it was Paul Newman who said ³a 
screenplay is all about the first five pages but a movie is about the last five 
minutes.² An ending is so important to a movie. I read about studio films thrown 
out and tested and they go back and re-shoot the ending, and it always feels 
tacked on because it¹s not organic, it¹s not moving toward the point and the 
message and that¹s what you have to move toward.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>PN: </i></b>Finally, I¹ve read about your 
legendary shyness...</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>JS: </i></b>[interrupting] Can you 
believe it meeting me now? I really was a very introverted person and the change 
hit my parents when they came to the Toronto Film Festival. The film premiered 
there and I thought nothing of it because I¹ve now done this a lot but they were 
shocked. I had to get up in front of 1500 people and announce the film. I guess 
getting hit with a bottle, well, after that - and I don¹t think change happens 
overnight, it¹s cumulative - I realized I was much stronger than I thought and I 
changed a lot of my behaviors. I had a victim¹s stance, I had been mugged twice 
in a three-month period, and I realized maybe it was something I was sending 
off. When you live in New York City you get bolder. When my sister and I started
<i>Clockwatchers</i> it snowballed and we thought let¹s just keep going until 
someone says ³frauds.² We really were waiting for someone to just stop us. All 
of a sudden we were shooting and I remember there was a moment when forty people 
on the set turned to me for an answer. It¹s a ping-pong because part of the time 
the job of writing is socially isolating and then all of a sudden you¹re thrown 
into something on a set that¹s a miniature society. [laughs] It¹s kind of one 
extreme to the other.</font></p>
