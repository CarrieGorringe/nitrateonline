            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The first hour and a half of
            Clint Eastwood's new film, <i>Blood Work</i>, is quite good.
            Eastwood plays a veteran F.B.I. agent, Terry McCaleb, who, while
            pursuing a suspected killer on-foot, is suddenly felled by a
            near-fatal heart attack. Two years later, he's the recipient of a
            transplant heart, with a great, blooming chest scar and a regiment
            of pills and restrictions to show for it. In addition, he has
            nagging feelings of uncertainty and doubt, causing him to question
            why he, instead of somebody else, should luck out on being the
            recipient of a donor organ.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Terry's pleasant existence on a
            boat in the Long Beach marina is interrupted by the appearance of a
            woman (Wanda de Jesús, in a very fine performance) who asks the
            now-retired agent for help in looking into the unsolved murder of
            her sister -- seems that the heart that has saved Terry's life came
            from the murdered sister. An expert in profiling, Terry looks over
            the seemingly scant evidence and spots some clues that the local
            police did not pick up on, and he's placed in a precarious position
            -- he can either overtax himself and risk rejection of his
            transplanted heart, or possibly apprehend the murderer, someone
            who's committed an act that he pointedly calls &quot;evil&quot;, and
            provide affirmation for his new lease on life.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When the film swings into its last
            half-hour, the resolution, for all this, turns out to be
            disappointingly conventional, replete with the kind of cackling,
            taunting maniac that we've been watching, with increasing weariness,
            ever since <i>Silence of the Lambs</i> in 1991. There are also some
            plot holes that are never entirely filled -- the killer would have
            had to had access to an awful lot of information in order to
            engineer the highly elaborate crimes that are revealed during the
            course of the story. Eastwood deserves credit, though, for turning
            his attention, as a filmmaker, towards stories that attempt to
            explore what it's like for aging heroes to come up against a sense
            of mortality, and he's one of the only directors around, right now,
            who, in individual scenes, gives you a sense of solid craftsmanship.
            Performers like de Jesús and Tina Lifford, as an agent who helps
            Terry because of a past, fondly remembered romantic fling, are given
            a chance to do some excellent work; Jeff Daniels gives a highly
            personable performance as Terry's neighbor and, later, driver and
            investigation &quot;partner&quot;; and, playing Terry's
            cardiologist, Anjelica Huston gives her scenes just the right
            succinct, flinty quality they need to work.<o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If <i>Blood Work</i> had more of a

            could be.</font><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana"></o:p>
