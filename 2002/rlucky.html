            review by <a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>, 19 April 52002</i></font><p>
            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Box office lightning will not 
            strike twice (or as big) for sophomore feature director Peter 
            Cattaneo -- whose initial effort (the British mega-hit <i>The Full 
            Monty</i>) nearly five years ago spawned over $200 million in 
            foreign grosses, more than ten million U.S. admissions, and a 
            phenomenal stage musical -- yet <i>Lucky Break</i> is still an 
            adorably whimsical comedy that deserves more than a passing twinkle. 
            It offers us the same type of oddball characters flitting about the 
            screen that populated his earlier film; an amusing, albeit not all 
            that original, premise; a clever, straight-forward style that 
            showcases the thespian talent; and some dialogue lost in the 
            transfer from British mouths to American ears, wherein a few 
            subtitles might have come in handy.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Screenwriter Ronan Bennett, who 
            tackled the more serious repercussions of prison life with <i>The 
            Break</i> (1997), <i>Love Lies Bleeding</i> (1994), and a few other 
            jail-based films, again moves his action behind bars, but lightens 
            up the touch considerably in his first comedy, about a band of merry 
            miscreants and smalltime crooks who stage an amateur musical to 
            disguise an ingenious escape. He's speaking somewhat from experience 
            -- he was incarcerated in Long Kesh Prison during the 1970s, and 
            involved in an unsuccessful break out attempt.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And escape into the quirky world of
            <i>Lucky </i>Break I did, taking my own vacation from an unusually 
            hot day (nearly 100 degrees) for the comfort of a theater seat in 
            Northwest D.C., amidst a preview crowd that seemed exorbitantly 
            giddy…and had a fine time with the film as well.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">James Nesbitt (<i>Waking Ned Devine</i>) 
            anchors the cast as Jimmy Hands, a warm-hearted, simple-minded 
            drifter whose petty life on the wrong side of the law has never 
            really panned out. As a child he liked occupying himself playing <i>
            cops &amp; robbers</i>, but wasn't fond of playing the law enforcement 
            role. After a fifteen-year bad streak, he and his dreadlocked pal 
            Ruddy (<i>Snatch</i>'s Lennie James), go for that one big job, a 
            bank robbery on a bright London day that unfolds, disastrously, in a 
            comic opening credit sequence. Obviously, some vocational training 
            would have helped the pair; when a gun they have secured for the 
            heist falls to pieces on the bank's floor, their career plans are 
            equally shattered. The duo end up in a rural, medium-security 
            facility, bathed in blue-steel light and uniforms, and ready for 
            some similar sized jokes, a handful of sadistic guards, and Governor 
            Graham Mortimer (Christopher Plummer), a calm, self-impressed warden 
            infatuated with show tunes.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Wherein Jimmy, facing twelve years' 
            imprisonment, finds himself a frequent guest of solitary confinement 
            (what is this, a remake of <i>The Great Escape</i>?), the soundtrack 
            tick-tocking off his perpetual boredom, the dullness occasionally 
            broken when the semi-pompous Mortimer, his office nearby, breaks 
            into spontaneous self-pleasing excerpts from <i>South Pacific</i>. 
            Having a hint of show biz blood running through his own theatrical 
            veins, Jimmy devises a makeshift plan to produce the governor's 
            ham-hocked musical on the life on Admiral Nelson. This in-house 
            musical messterpiece becomes the heavy-handed cover for a planned 
            extra-curricular excursion. That's the film in a nut-shell, with 
            Cattaneo layering the comedy with a bit of bittersweet social 
            commentary, particularly in the guise of bad-luck criminal Cliff 
            Gumbell, Jimmy's cellmate, a despondent simpleton constantly abused 
            by Perry (Ron Cook), the quintessential nasty guard. This all ends 
            in a too sad and predictable conclusion, but such reprehensible 
            deeds demand a comic comeuppance, and viewers' expectations will be 
            firmly met.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And yes, there's romance! The 
            winsome Olivia Williams, introduced to moviegoers as the love 
            interest of Kevin Costner in the dreary <i>The Postman</i> (Ugh, my 
            first Internet-based review), plays engaging Annabel Sweep, an anger 
            management behaviorist intent on breaking the inmates of their bad 
            habits. It's a role she fills with a tempered determination, much 
            like that of Miss Rosemary Cross, the widowed teacher she played 
            enchantingly in Wes Anderson's delightful 1998 comedy <i>Rushmore</i>. 
            She's such a treat!</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While the actors add a wistful 
            shine to the shenanigans, particularly Bill Nighy -- his features 
            suggesting a British variation on Robert Redford -- as Roger 
            Chamberlain, a fey, white-collar criminal and the only educated 
            crook in the lot. Sharing his cell and on-screen time is Julian 
            Barratt, imbuing arsonist Paul Dean with a manic dash of Crispin 
            Glover. Frank Harper, one of the nastier crooks in <i>Lock, Stock 
            and Two Smoking Barrels</i>, brings that same ugliness (within comic 
            reason) to John Toombes, a lifer hated by all the other prisoners 
            and intent in pushing himself to the front of the escape line. You 
            just don't play frontsies-backsies in jail and expect to get away 
            scott free.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The preparations and actual 
            production of <i>Nelson The Musical</i> are a genuine hoot, never 
            the &quot;liberating power of drama&quot; it's excited creator believes it to 
            be. Jimmy (as the one-armed, one-eyed admiral) and Annabel (as the 
            Divine Emma, his play-within-a-film beloved) deal with their own 
            romantic matters in front of and behind the curtain. The other star 
            struck prisoners enlisted in the play and/or the plot (especially 
            Rudy, too involved with a key second act solo -- with divinely funny 
            lyrics penned by comedian/actor Stephen Fry -- to exit, stage right, 
            to his freedom), overcome their inhibitions, stage fright, and even 
            some of their anger-related issues, to bring the house down.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There's a lot to be said about 
            aspiring to a life above incompetence. And <i>Lucky Break</i> shows 
            that a small, slight slice of escapist comedy can be quite the 
            disarming crowd-pleaser. Break out of your living rooms, scale the 
            walls, and hum along.</font></td>
