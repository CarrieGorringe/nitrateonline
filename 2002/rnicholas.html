            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by

            <font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The delicious trimmings found in 
            this new adaptation of Charles Dickens' first romantic novel arrive 
            early and stay late, filling nearly every minute of the 
            over-two-hour <i>oeuvre</i> with a lighthearted glow, some impudent 
            snickers, and a glorious dose of humankind's liberating ability to 
            triumph over a Scrooge or two.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">How early? How about those 
            delightful opening credits by Chris Allies, and how often do we 
            critics harp on such things? Nary much, I presume. Given the red 
            curtain treatment, à la Baz Luhrmann, the conductor's baton raps 
            thrice and the curtains are pulled aside by two hands, revealing a 
            stage of miniature cut-outs -- the cast (in alphabetical order) 
            responsible for this glorious vision. The technicians receive their 
            amusing due. Small pieces of sheet music and a school bell atop a 
            desk (music composed by Rachel Portman); panning down to the floor 
            we spot a pin cushion and two small pairs of mid 19th-century black 
            shoes (costume designer Ruth Myers); follow a small ribbon along the 
            floorboards till it breaks, snapped by a doll-size pair of shears 
            (Lesley Walker, editor); cut to a small chalk board with a sketch of 
            the Wheel of Fire -- The Blood Drinker (production designer Eve 
            Stewart); pull focus to a tiny hanging lamp in which a match ignites 
            a small flame (Dick Pope, director of photography); and cut to a 
            small stuffed black bag and gold nuggets on a table (the executive 
            producers and producers, naturally!). Curtain and lights down 
            (Written for the Screen and Directed by Douglas McGrath).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">How utterly charming!</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Most Dickens fans will be curious 
            if a two-and-a-quarter hour condensation of a 900-plus page book can 
            work. Yes, just as well as last year's television version with James 
            D'Arcy (three-and-one-third hours), the still popular 1947 
            black-and-white adaptation starring Derek Bond (108 minutes), but 
            probably not so kindly with the first silent version, released 100 
            years ago, which ran barely ten minutes. The Royal Shakespeare 
            Company mounted a nearly ten-hour version in the 1980s. Yeeowch!</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In McGrath's case, he has realized 
            that it's not quantity, but quality, that matters. He may have 
            jettisoned out enough dialogue and characters to fill a few sequels 
            to the current incarnation, but what he crams in is lean, mean, and 
            just grand. Aside from the glorious ensemble he has gathered, the 
            spectacular production values, occasionally comic blocking, and a 
            fine score all conjure up a wonderful Christmas feast.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After a highly enlightening 
            introduction to the Nicklebys, wherein dad has been done in by 
            speculation and the family forced from its quaint Devonshire 
            cottage, nineteen-year-old Nicholas (Charlie Hunnam), his sister 
            Kate (Romola Garai), and their despondent mum (Stella Gonet) head to 
            London on a self-propelled mission of mercy, arriving unwelcome to 
            the cold home of heartless uncle Ralph (Christopher Plummer), a 
            curmudgeon perfectly content in abusing his dead brother's family 
            for bothering him with such pity. First impressions aside (I had a 
            boss similarly villainous not so many years ago), Nicholas' first 
            adventure puts him under to the hellish tutelage of one-eyed school 
            master Wackford Squeers (Jim Broadbent), his viciously sadistic wife 
            (Juliet Stevenson), who makes Cruella De Vil look like a saint, 
            their overfed, piglet son (Bruce Cook) and a maliciously spiteful 
            daughter Fanny (Heather Goldenhersh). Among the downtrodden, 
            misbegotten, and otherwise deprived boys that are imprisoned at the 
            horrid Dotheboys boarding school is the crippled Smike (<i>Billy 
            Elliott</i>'s Jamie Bell), a forgotten lad that bears most of the 
            Squeers' abuse and instantly earns Nicholas' eternal friendship.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And thus Mr. Nickleby and his 
            friend graduate to the larger world, filled with inner strength and 
            moral conviction. Their journey begins far from London, unaware that 
            Ralph Nickleby has some mean-spirited, wagering notions involving 
            the demure Kate and her uncle's wretched gentlemen friends and 
            investors, their chief antagonist being the lecherous Sir Mulberry 
            Hawk (Edward Fox).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thankfully, life isn't all sad, and 
            who best to lighten up Nicholas and Smike's road trip than Vincent 
            Crummles (Nathan Lane), thespian extraordinaire, and his strange and 
            wondrous entertaining troupe of friends (including Alan Cumming as 
            Mr. Folair, a neglected performer intent on showing off his Highland 
            Fling) and family, wherein Dame Edna Everage pops up in a dual role 
            as Vincent's wife and, under his real name Barry Humphries, as the 
            over-the-hill, broken-legged actor Mr. Leadville. Without 
            determining their success, the lads become &quot;actors&quot; and put out the 
            best holiday ham throughout the countryside.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film's second half brings 
            Nicholas back to London to rejoin his extended family and do battle 
            with his unsentimental uncle and his rich and greedy friends. He 
            befriends Ned and Charles Cheeryble (Timothy Spall and Gerard 
            Horan), pleasant variations of Tweedle Dum and Tweedle Dee, who 
            quickly employ the young Nickleby at an extremely advantageous 
            salary, in a job which allows him to court his future wife, Madeline 
            Bray (<i>The Princess Diaries' </i>Anne Hathaway). Of course, 
            despite the worst intentions of the dastardly Ralph, vengeful 
            Squeers, and comrade-in-harm Hawk, evil is put down and goodness 
            triumphs. Shades of <i>Shakespeare in Love</i>, such a wonderful 
            fairy tale ending!</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Director-writer McGrath, an 
            occasional actor in several Woody Allen films, tackled Jane Austen 
            with comic dexterity with <i>Emma</i> (1996), bounces back in his 
            third directorial outing from the absolutely dreadful <i>Company Man</i>, 
            one of the worst films of 2000. Adapting the source material with 
            the wit, whimsy, and passion it deserves, McGrath's cast brings it 
            to life, and his crew adds depth to the effort, with strong 
            camerawork and fluid tracking shots, a lovely score, some marvelous 
            editing and blocking (used to particularly comic effect in a rescue 
            sequence in which Nicholas stops Squeers from repatriating Smike 
            back to the Yorkshire doldrums. The period production values add the 
            necessary flavor, with Ralph Nickleby's home is a blend of doom and 
            gloom (stuffed birds silently scream from the pins that penetrate 
            their bodies), even foretelling the villain's ultimate comeuppance 
            when the camera imprisons him between the bars of several large, 
            mock birdcages.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The handsome Hunnam, last seen in 
            Stephen Gaghan's scare piece <i>Abandon</i> but also well remembered 
            in England for his turn in the original <i>Queer as Folk</i>, is 
            fine fighting the good fight and gives a good cry when the narrative 
            calls for it. The decent women roles (Hathaway and Garai) are really 
            too condensed to register any range. Generally it's the comic 
            talent, especially Lane and Tom Courtney (where has he been 
            hiding?), the tragically frail (Bell), and the evil scoundrels 
            (Plummer, Broadbent, and Stevenson) who register best with the 
            audience. Courtney portrays the sympathetic Newman Noggs, Ralph 
            Nickleby's red-nosed manservant caught between a bottle and a hard 
            place.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the end, it's sweet revenge, 
            dignity regained, and a timeless story that makes <i>Nicholas 
            Nickleby</i> an unheralded must-see film this holiday season.</font></td>
