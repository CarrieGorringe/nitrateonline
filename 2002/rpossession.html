            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>It irks me
            that Neil LaBute, in a recent issue of Premiere Magazine, said he
            needed to change the root of Roland Michell, a protagonist of his
            latest film, <i>Possession</i>, from Brit to Yank. &quot;The
            American vs. English approach provided more chance for conflict than
            if they were both chilly English academics,&quot; he says. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Well. How
            insulting and ethnocentric can you get? Insulting in that for any
            American box office to come the film’s way we needed to have a
            Yank to identify with?; or perhaps an insult to the audience in that
            we can’t suspend our disbelief for a purely British couple instead
            of a mixed pair; or insulting to the English in that they’re
            chronically perceived as chilly. How about insulting to A.S. Byatt,
            the book’s author, in that her best-selling Booker Prize-winning
            novel had to be adjusted for the screen in the first place? <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Maybe the real
            issue is Neil LaBute is the wrong guy to direct the film. LaBute,
            the Mormon-affiliate who has exercised distaste for certain factions
            of contemporary society in theatre-of-cruelty plays like <i>The
            Company of Men</i> and <i>Your Friends and Neighbors</i> -- thawing
            a tad in the violently-disposed, loopy comedy <i>Nurse Betty</i> --
            waves a chilly wand over Byatt’s intricate and romantic novel
            about contemporary scholars Maud Bailey (Gwyneth Paltrow) and Roland
            Michell (Aaron Eckhart), who unravel a mystery concerning the
            Victorian Poet Laureate, Randolph Henry Ash (Jeremy Northam), who is
            currently being celebrated throughout London at a centenary
            celebration. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ash is
            universally believed to have been a devoted husband and that his
            body of work was written for his wife. But a letter unearthed in the
            London Library leads Michell, an Ash devotee in England on a
            fellowship at the British Museum, to ponder whether there was
            another woman in his life. He delves into Ash’s whereabouts in the
            year 1859 and learns the great poet attended a party given in honor
            of a more minor one, the fiesty Christabel LaMotte (Jennifer Ehle),
            whose lover and companion was a woman painter (Lena Headey). Michell
            deploys LaMotte expert, the imperious and frosty professor Maud
            Bailey to abet his secret mission and the rest, as they say, repeats
            history. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">LaBute
            interweaves the parallel stories with visual panache and indeed, the
            visual production is the least of his worries. It’s executed with
            quintessential period perfection by the great Luciana Arrighi, and
            juxtaposes the dual narratives by clever segues and deft threadings.
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Too, the actors
            are just fine. Paltrow executes her British accent with grace and
            elegance and Eckerd carries a likeable earnestness that should
            ignite more than it does. Northam is typically aloof and dignified
            and the always exceptional Jennifer Ehle warms the proceedings with
            a glimpse at what the film might have been. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Indeed what’s
            lacking with <i>Possession</i> is not the actors or the look of the
            film but its guts and passion. For a film that boasts heroines with
            the names &quot;Maud&quot; and &quot;Christabel,&quot; filched from
            the great epic poems by Tennyson and Coleridge, only embers simmer
            where there should be infernos. &quot;I cannot let you burn me up
            and I cannot resist you,&quot; writes LaMotte to her secret lover,
            &quot;No mere human can stand in a fire and not be consumed,&quot;
            she finishes. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s all
            ultimately grand posturing about all-consuming lust and fated
            inevitability because Neil LaBute’s <i>Possession</i> is strangely
            contained and extraordinarily chaste. Its tell-us-not-show-us
            execution cripples it; for example Paltrow continually tells Eckhart
            that she’s icy and aloof and yet nothing she actually does
            supports the statement. Eckhart keeps insisting he’s fasting when
            it comes to women and yet he eagerly (and surprisingly, since the
            chemistry between the two stars is meagre) wants a relationship with
            his imperious co-conspirator. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The groundwork is
            all there, certainly. Byatt’s story is a good one, a fascinating
            one in fact, and yet <i>Possession</i> has so little sweeping
            urgency, momentum or sustenance to carry us along on its purported
            dam-break of obsession at all costs that, considering how hard the
            actors labor to fan a dying fire, it's a darn shame. One that, I
            repeat, a different director might have had the wherewithal to
            notice had he the propensity for passion.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
