            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The makers of <i>Interview with
            the Assassin</i> have managed to pull off a feat that would make the
            Blair Witch or even the pilot of a black helicopter envious. Dealing
            with a modest production, little onscreen violence and a seemingly
            timeworn subject (the JFK assassination), writer-director Neil
            Burger delivers more than his quota of jolts. Whereas Oliver Stone's
            conspiracy thriller <i>JFK</i> was long, intricate, star-studded and
            visually flashy, <i>Interview with the Assassin</i> draws its
            considerable power from simplicity. You can count the number of
            characters on your hands, and all are played by experienced but
            little-known actors. Because the performers aren't immediately
            recognizable, Burger's mockumentary setup is convincing and tough to
            predict.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The footage we are watching is
            supposed to have been shot in 2000 by Ron Kobeleski (Dylan
            Haggerty), a downsized news cameraman who believes he has discovered
            a potential story that could not only restore his fortunes but
            possibly make him another Bob Woodward. His neighbor, Walter
            Ohlinger (Raymond J Barry), has made a confession. After berating
            Ron for his underdeveloped interviewing skills, he announces that
            he's dying of cancer and that he was the second gunman on the grassy
            knoll, the fellow who fired the &quot;magic bullet&quot; that killed
            President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963. Even if the Warren
            Commission's lone shooter conclusion is false, Walter might as well
            say he's the tooth fairy because nearly forty years have passed and
            conspiracy theories (both crackpot and scholarly) are divergent and
            plentiful. Still, Walter has saved a shell casing that was fired
            roughly around the date of the killing, knows his way around Dealey
            Plaza and is clearly mean enough to have committed the crime.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Verifying Walter's assertion proves
            nightmarish because he only identifies a single co-conspirator, a
            fellow ex-Marine named John Seymour, who may not be willing to talk
            even if he does exist. The most compelling proof seems to be that
            the two are being followed wherever they go. Even without the
            mysterious car behind them, Walter is dangerous on his own. He can
            sneak onto planes with pistols and has great difficulty with the
            word &quot;no.&quot;</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The pseudo-documentary approach
            makes <i>Interview with the Assassin </i>a good deal eerier because
            in rarely feels forced or histrionic. Barry and Haggerty don't even
            seem to be acting.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Barry oozes menace and guilt. In later scenes, he even looks
            more volatile when he's dressed up. Without uttering a line, he
            effortlessly conveys Walter's emotional descent. Haggerty's role
            isn't as showing, but it's remarkable when you consider that he has
            to carry a good deal of the film with only his voice. Because Ron is
            supposed to be running the camera, he's only seen through
            reflections unit the end of the movie.<o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Digital Video photography by
            Richard Rutkowski (<i>Chelsea Walls</i>) gives <i>Interview with the
            Assassin</i> an appropriate grit and urgency. The handheld
            camerawork looks reasonably spontaneous without being jerky. The DV
            images are remarkably clear and aren't as grainy-looking as some
            digital flicks can get. <i>Interview with the Assassin </i>wastes
            little of its brisk eighty-six-minute running time. After a while,
            it becomes difficult to decide who is scarier:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
