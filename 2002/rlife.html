            <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700">
            In the pensive and uncharacteristically thoughtful 1990 Woody Allen 
            morality play, <i>Crimes and Misdemeanors</i> a pompous, 
            pontificating television executive, played with spread-on genial 
            smarm by Alan Alda, tells the camera that &quot;comedy equals tragedy 
            plus time.&quot; It's a conceit that works well both historically and 
            theoretically, but not always in the movies. So while I dislike 
            bashing a film that visually mythologizes the city in which I live,&nbsp; 
            I must say that director Stephen Herek has sculpted a soulless, 
            thudding &quot;comedy&quot; called <i>Life or Something Like It</i> that in 
            its fairy-tale fumbling, has neither comedy nor tragedy but far too 
            much running time. This is the kind of movie (or something like it) 
            that trivializes its purported deep message about the human 
            condition and how we must wake up to possibility yet panders to the 
            most mindless sort of metaphysical babble, stifling in its 
            simplistic predictability, sophomoric message and tail-wagging 
            earnestness. </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">
            Oscar-winner Angelina Jolie wrests herself from her goth image, 
            pouring her lean and lithe body into the persona of buxom, 
            bubble-brained (and headed) platinum blonde Seattle reporter Lainie 
            Kerrigan. Lainie sports a Marilyn Monroe-do, extra tight designer 
            duds, and supposedly has a flair for smart repartee as she's given 
            complete license to improvise her soft city-beat stories by her 
            station managers. She's so good, the film winkingly tells us, that 
            her boss is sending her resume tape to the Big Apple based morning 
            show, &quot;A.M. USA,&quot; who are scouting the country for a new 
            anchorperson.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">But Lainie, 
            whose entire existence operates only as a calculated, well-oiled 
            machine, receives a smashing setback when she's told by a homeless 
            &quot;prophet&quot; that she will die in one week. &nbsp;When several of his other 
            visions come to pass Lainie spirals, dumping her dumb Seattle 
            Mariners fiance, doing a story on transit strikers drunk on her ass, 
            and seeking solace in a down to earth cameraman named Pete (Ed 
            Burns), with whom she verbally spars each time they're assigned a 
            story.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">The hits 
            and plot points of <i>Life or Something Like It</i> are so 
            unsurprising and patterned that the film emerges as a <i>Pretty 
            Woman</i> with an alternately media-tech and New Age mindset. While 
            Seattle is given a great film veneer onscreen (eschewing the grit 
            and dirt of urban sprawl) it's a bit surprising that the script by 
            Dana Stevens (she also wrote the Michael Apted directed thriller <i>
            Blink</i> and the Meg Ryan/Nicolas Cage starrer <i>City of Angels</i>) 
            labors so intensely to pass itself off as funny and so frequently 
            misses its mark. It's light-weight fluff for sure, but when it's 
            called upon to really make a statement, it instead opts to insult 
            the viewer's intelligence by avoiding the initial issues that have 
            been set in place. There's so little resonance and interior 
            soul-searching to the character's journey that after receiving the 
            news that she will be dead and gone in seven days Lainie's biggest 
            revelation is, of all things - she really likes Pete!</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Other more 
            intriguing issues crash by the wayside in light of this astounding, 
            didn't-see-it-coming fact; her brusque rivalry with her older sister 
            is hinted at but slighted, as is a cool relationship with her dad.&nbsp; 
            In truth Lainie barely makes a gesture to endear herself to anyone. 
            The film wants us to believe that she sees the light but she's a 
            taker, self-absorbed and banal, wise-cracking and patronizing - and 
            unprofessional to boot.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Jolie, a 
            capable, charismatic actor in the right conditions, gives Lainie a 
            smug and smirking uncaring and she only warms for a moment - right 
            near the end when she's given her big opportunity to interview her 
            role-model, a Barbara Walters-esque interviewer named Deborah 
            Connors, played with aplomb by the great Stockard Channing. But even 
            Connors winds up a harpie and Lainie is only sweet because the 
            camera is rolling. Ultimately Ed Burns, in his toasty lumberjack 
            grunge, lends the only soul in a grounded, everyman performance that 
            at least gives a little weight to a story that's essentially a sound 
            bite.</span></p>
            <p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Like the 
            age we live in, <i>Life or Something Like It</i> refuses to take 
            responsibility for itself, its characters or even&nbsp; a hint of basic 
            research about the business in which these people profit. Someone 
            should have pulled the plug on this travesty a long while before a 
            prophet's warning pulls the rug from Lainie's misguided and blind 
            ambition and all of that which unfortunately passes for something 
            like a wincingly insipid and uninspired story.</span></td>
