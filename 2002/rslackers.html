            movies just don't need to be made. And some movies work extra hard
            to educe comments just like that one, making the extra effort to
            gross you out, to annoy, alarm, or titillate you. Dewey Nicks'
            feature debut, <i>Slackers</i> is one of those hardworking movies.
            Consider the title's clunk-on-the-head suggests the overtime someone
            put in to come up with an irritatingly unimaginative retread
            concept.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Written
            by David H. Steinberg, <i>Slackers</i> begins with a brief rundown
            of its three protagonists' profound lack of goals and aspirations.
            Dave (Devon Sawa), Jeff (Michael C. Maronna), and Sam (Jason Segel)
            have reached senior year at whatever college they're attending,
            without really passing a course. They enroll in large lecture
            courses, never show up for class, then finagle ingenious cheats for
            the final exams. They think they are <i>very</i> clever. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">An
            example of this strategy opens the film. Dave narrates: it's 48 days
            before graduation, so they're into their homestretch (life after
            graduation isn't really a concept here; such is the standard
            limitation of farting-college-boy movies). Their mission: to steal
            official blue books off a delivery truck, in order to scam entrance
            into an exam, in order to steal questions that one of the trio will
            then use to pass said exam, after faking a bicycle accident and
            subsequent broken leg. The scheme involves videotaping a girl's
            cheerleading or perhaps track squad as they go jogging (granting
            various close-up jiggle shots that, oddly, seem more geared for your
            delectation than as a means to develop characters Dave, Jeff or Sam:
            go figure), and the to-be-late-exam-taker's cockamamie antics on a
            bike. All this effort seems extreme. Heck, maybe it would be easier
            just to go to class once in a while. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            &quot;crucial&quot; part of this plot involves Dave's appearance at
            the final for a class he didn't take, but whose questions he needs
            to steal, in order for Jeff-or-Sam (doesn't really matter which one)
            to have answers ready for the same makeup exam the next day. The
            real point (as opposed to all the fake ones listed above) is that
            Dave meets a girl who is actually taking the exam, the fabulous
            Angela (James King), and while he's flirting with her, he's spotted
            by another exam-taker, the Lord of Losers who calls himself Cool
            Ethan (Jason Schwartzman). And so... Cool Ethan threatens to bust
            the cheaters unless they get him hooked up with Angela. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            hooking up will never happen, of course, because Dave and Angela
            take mutual shines to one another, for no good reason except that
            they are the stars of the movie. But in order to make the
            &quot;feature film&quot; running time, Dave-Sam-Jeff make a series
            of efforts to get &quot;info&quot; on Angela, in order to feed it to
            Ethan, so he can look good to her. For an ordinary human, at least
            in the realm of Dave-Sam-Jeff, this approach works. But for Ethan,
            showing up at the hospital or homeless shelter where Angela
            volunteers just makes him look more crushingly repulsive (if this
            can be imagined, given that you learn he keeps a &quot;shrine&quot;
            to Angela in his dorm room and jerks off with a doll he's made out
            of strands of her hair that she's left at her chair in class). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">You
            might be appalled, for instance, when you see Ethan at the hospital,
            enticed by one of Angela's elderly patients (a freakishly made-up
            Mamie Van Doren) to suck on her breast. When Angela walks in on this
            scene, you'd imagine that would be a last straw. But no, she's so
            perfectly pretty and sweet (and dense) that she only rolls her eyes
            and maybe wonders a bit, though it's hard to tell exactly what she's
            thinking. But no matter. Girls in <i>Slackers</i> do not have brains
            or roles; they serve one function, to enhance your enjoyment of the
            boys' shenanigans. And so, Angela's mother (Leigh Taylor Young)
            blows Dave when he comes to visit (he endures the act, then falls
            for Angela and feels guilty until he learns this mother is actually
            a stepmother: thank god! He can pursue the girl of his dreams with
            legitimate passion, or something like that). And Angela's roommate
            Rianna (<i>That '70s Show</i>'s Laura Prepon) is a nympho who
            masturbates, a lot: oh, the hilarity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">While
            they do go through some ups and downs (one of these downs entails
            Ethan with a video camera), you know that Dave and Angela will be
            together in the end. You may wonder -- as you're waiting for the
            film to be over -- why the filmmakers even bothered to include a
            romantic subplot. Perhaps this gave <i>Slackers</i> enough
            &quot;heart&quot; (of the <i>Bubble Boy</i> sort) to enable young
            up-and-comers like Sawa and King to take the roles, so they can
            rationalize by pointing to their characters'
            &quot;motivations.&quot; &quot;I really like this girl,&quot; says
            King in the press notes. &quot;She has a huge heart and wants to
            believe the best in people... I know what it's like to be her age
            and fall in love and be unsure of your emotions.&quot; Oh, that's
            what those were. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still,
            you might feel some sympathy for King, and Sawa as well. She was
            very beautiful as Kate Beckinsale's fellow nurse in <i>Pearl Harbor</i>,
            and because her role was so slim, she didn't have to spend too much
            time making excuses for that film's overbearing self-love. Sawa is
            also still in that superficial career &quot;stage,&quot; tending to
            rest on his familiar insouciant-boy affect. Maybe he's looking to
            make his earlier career respectable: the not-so-bad slasher flicks <i>Final
            Destination</i> and <i>Idle Hands</i> look like masterpieces
            compared to <i>Slackers</i>. Or maybe he's looking to be the next
            Ashton Kutcher, because there surely aren't enough of them already. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            most curious career choice here would have to be Schwartzman's. Not
            long ago he was the flavor of the Geek Chic month (or year), for his
            notable work in Wes Anderson's <i>Rushmore</i>. His Ethan is more
            desperate and desperate, and certainly less charming than Max J.
            Fisher, whose admittedly troubling obsession with his teacher was
            evoked in emotional details and silliness rather than the
            bludgeoning slapstick in <i>Slackers</i>. Ethan exhibits a meanness
            that should actually be comprehensible: he's obviously been abused
            by classmates throughout his life, so that his desire to wield his
            sudden sense of power over these numb-nuts makes sense. But it's
            hard to cozy up to a character as flat-out repulsive as Cool Ethan.
            Perhaps this is the reason to take the part, to have the chance to
            play a character so awful that viewers will be convulsing with
            spasms of horror-struck laughter. You know, it's a stretch. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ethan's
            brutality and cunning are indeed remarkable. And so what if they're
            unoriginal? It's fairly clear that the aim of this genre (whatever
            you want to call it) isn't to break new, uh, ground, as much as it
            is to run over -- and over and over -- the same turf, so viewers
            know exactly when to laugh and go &quot;Yeeech!&quot; and poke their
            buddies in their arms. Still, the redundancy eventually does undo
            what is most keen in this formula, and that is to allow you to see
            stereotypes in ways that might not have occurred to you before. If
            all you're seeing is a slightly overheated version of the har-har
            sex-jokes already made lite in <i>Undeclared</i> or <i>That '70s
            Show</i> or battered to a pulp in <i>Dude, Where's My Car?</i> and <i>American
            Pie 2</i>, well, you might as well find another genre to hit up for
            spare ideas.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Recently
            (like, since he's been asked to pitch <i>Slackers</i>, about which
            there is clearly very little to say), Schwartzman has been talking
            to interviewers about going on the road with his band, Phantom
            Planet. He's the drummer, and it sounds like a decent, if
            predictable, gig. According to a &quot;band journal&quot; he wrote
            for <i>Details</i>, he gets to meet chicks, sleep while sitting up
            in the van, wake up stiff, and go on to hit the skins another day.
            You know, like, awesome. Presumably, a gig like <i>Slackers</i>
            helps pay for gas. <o:p>
