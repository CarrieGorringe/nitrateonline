            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 18 October 2002</i></font><p>
            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Naqoyqatsi</i>, the title of 
            Godfrey Reggio's new film, derives from the Hopi and translates, so 
            the film tells us, as either &quot;life as war&quot; or &quot;civilized violence&quot;.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And Reggio's film, the third in a 
            trilogy begun with <i>Koyaanisqatsi</i> in 1983 and <i>Powaqqatsi</i> 
            in 1988, is done in the style of the symphonic montage films, such 
            as <i>Berlin, Symphony of a City</i> and Man with a Movie Camera, 
            only utilizing a host of modern technologies (photosonics, thermal 
            videography, laser film processing) to distort images, combine them, 
            or radically degrade or retool them. Reggio gives us a lot, and he's 
            entirely in earnest, even when he asks us to indulge him. There are 
            some risible moments, as well as some images and sequences that are 
            impossible to dismiss outright, especially in endangered times such 
            as these.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film shows the same fallibility 
            as in Reggio's previous two films, though, in that he tends to favor 
            the decorative quality of images rather than the drama that may be 
            inherent in them.&nbsp; He cross-cuts footage of the W.T.O. riots in 
            Genoa with P.O.V. footage from violent video games, to genuinely 
            chilling effect; he turns isolated faces engaged in and reacting to 
            (apparent) conversation with each other into something altogether 
            suspect just by the way they're lit and photographed; skydivers 
            jumping out of the back of a plane are multiplied into an endless 
            stream of people who look like they are swarming out into space. 
            We're given sinisterized images of Albert Einstein, and a montage of 
            famous faces -- Arafat, Mandela, Abraham Lincoln, Colin Powell, 
            Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, Princess Diana, John Paul II -- which 
            turn out to be wax effigies from Madame Tussaud's. (There are also 
            brief appearances in the film by Osama bin Laden, and, at one point, 
            Dolly the sheep.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But what's the point? There's the 
            obvious: The tyranny of modern technology. The soulless nature of 
            modern society. The adverse effect of modern media. But, like the 
            figures in the closing sequence, Reggio leaves it all spinning in 
            the air. He doesn't provide the solutions to the problems, but wants 
            us to come up with the answers ourselves. (Which was a number of 
            people asked me both before and after the film's screening: &quot;What's 
            this movie <i>about</i>?&quot;) But the film doesn't give us enough 
            substance to stimulate thought -- it's in danger of putting itself 
            in the position of simply being one big phantasmagoria that only 
            elicits a big &quot;wow&quot;.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When it first came out, <i>
            Koyaanisqatsi </i>(or, &quot;life out of balance&quot;) made an impression by 
            providing super-clear views of unspoiled terrain in the American 
            Southwest that registered with incredible detail, then contrasting 
            it with super-fast footage of people and traffic in modern cities 
            that wasn't blurry but moved with incredible velocity. (Both filmic 
            techniques were subsequently appropriated, and exhausted, by 
            commercial media.) <i>Powaqqatsi</i> (or, &quot;life in transformation&quot;) 
            was made up primarily of footage made in Third-World countries, but, 
            as David Denby noted, the film gave only passing regard to people 
            and situations a single one from which another director like 
            Satyajit Ray could have elicited an entire movie. <i>Naqoyqatsi </i>
            uses original footage shot in London and in the U.S. -- the opening 
            shot, which goes from the &quot;Tower of Babel&quot; by Pieter Brueghel the 
            Elder to an urban building, with broken, gaping windows, located in 
            Detroit---but no single shot in the film registers in the same way 
            as the closing shot for <i>Koyaanisqatsi</i>, where Reggio 
            stretched-out a shot of a fragment of an exploding rocket falling to 
            earth in such a way that it started turning into something else and 
            took on a whole new, wholly unexpected significance while you were 
            watching it, simultaneously causing you to hold your breath to see 
            if the sequence would sustain itself and continue its momentum. 
            (That moment was also greatly aided by Philip Glass' original music; 
            and his score for <i>Naqoyqatsi</i>, while featuring some beautiful, 
            mournful cello solos by Yo-Yo Ma, is, unfortunately, not among his 
            best.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">André Bazin wrote that films can 
            provide a means not only for entertainment but for the audience to 
            define their relationship to the world around them. <i>Naqoyqatsi</i>, 
            and Reggio's previous two films, are a good attempt, a striving 
            attempt, a dedicated attempt, a challenging attempt, and a noble 
            attempt. But it may not be enough to change the world.</font></td>
