            <font face="Verdana" size="5">28th Seattle International Film 
            Festival</font><p class="MsoNormal"><b>
            <font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Me Without You</i> starts out like 
            a sentimental, sappy chick flick with a tie-dyed shirt thrown over 
            it. Opening in the groovy, free-spirited early seventies, we view 
            chummy childhood chicks Marina (Anna Friel) and Holly (Michelle 
            Williams) as they jump rope, hula-hoop, and roller skate in an 
            idealized, soft-focus haze. It’s also the swinging U.K., baby, with 
            both girls prancing around in fluorescent, oversized sweaters and 
            feather-covered stripper scarves. Can you say shagadelic?</font></b></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Marina is 
            destined to be a wild child. Her bohemian mother (Trudie Styler, 
            wife of recording artist Sting) pushes the philosophy that looks 
            matter most. Holly’s more conservative parents stress that &quot;some 
            people are pretty people, and some are clever people,&quot; insisting 
            that their deep-thinking daughter fits the latter category. With 
            each girl subscribing to such a contrasting values system, is there 
            any hope that the friendship will survive?</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Me Without You</i> 
            follows both girls into the new millenium, as they cross the bridges 
            of sex, drugs, and rock ‘n roll on their way to full-fledged 
            womanhood. Sex arrives in the form of Marina’s older brother Nat 
            (Oliver Milburn), an Adam Ant lookalike whom Holly secretly loves, 
            and a sleazy, hedonistic college professor (Kyle McLaughlan) who 
            lusts after both buddies with disastrous consequences.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The drugs come in 
            the form of pot, coke, and heroin, all of which are gobbled or shot 
            up by the impulsive Marina, while shunned by shy, reluctant Holly.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The rock ‘n roll 
            is a smorgasbord of British new wave and pop, from The Clash to 
            Depeche Mode to Echo and the Bunnymen. It’s clear that director 
            Sandra Goldbacher (&quot;The Governess&quot;) holds such alternative English 
            music close to her heart, using it to emphasize the passing of 
            different eras while her two protagonists endure both bonding and 
            betrayals.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The acting is 
            sensational. Williams, an American actress from the <i>Dawson’s 
            Creek</i> television series, sports a convincing British accent and 
            morphs from tentative wallflower to worldly, intellectual beauty. 
            Resembling a more volatile, energetic Marissa Tomei, Friel is 
            equally good, embodying a character who is all charisma and 
            fireworks on the surface, but needy, shallow, and frightened beneath 
            that thin outer layer of confident-looking bravado. There’s a scene 
            in <i>Me Without You</i> where Marina, struggling to find a human 
            anchor after nearly losing her mother to an overdose of pills, 
            attempts to seduce Holly’s proper Jewish dad (Allan Corduner). Her 
            desperate gestures, and his knowing, gentle refusal, are pure 
            perfection, sad and true when the scene could have been exploitative 
            and phony.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There are less 
            convincing elements that rear their tarnished heads as well. The 
            girls’ polar opposite families get along remarkably well. Too well, 
            perhaps, considering their diametrically opposite views on life, the 
            world, and everything. Would Holly’s decent, pillar-of-the-community 
            dad really let his hair down and start boogying with Marina’s boozy 
            mom during a neighborhood get-together? </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal">
            <span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Ultimately, <i>
            Me Without You</i> is a sum greater than its parts. The viewer is 
            taken on a journey spanning nearly three decades of bittersweet 
            camaraderie and history, in which we feel that we truly know what 
            makes Holly and Marina tick, and our hearts go out to them as both 
            continue to negotiate their imperfect, love-hate relationship. 
            Suddenly, all the slow motion and soft focus that they’re bathed in 
            comes across not as manipulative, but earned. </span></p>
