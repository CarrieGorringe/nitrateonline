            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><i><b>The
            Sweetest Thing</b></i><b> initially seems to be trying to usher in a
            new era of hedonism. The three main characters -- Christina (Cameron
            Diaz), Courtney (Christina Applegate), and Jane (Selma Blair) -- go
            out to a nightclub, where the girls, wearing little bits and pieces
            of nothing, writhe and wriggle around on the dance floor, get the
            guys to turn-on to them, and then flick them away, whether or not
            they've actually bedded them or not. Christina says that, for women
            today, it's &quot;all about preservation&quot; and setting
            &quot;boundaries:" women should have fun, but they should no longer
            go out looking for &quot;Mr. Right," but &quot;Mr. Right-Now," and
            if the right guy should come along, well, then, &quot;eventually the
            '-Now' part will just drop off."</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It's
            the women who are calling all the shots, here. Then, along comes a
            scene where Courtney, staring into a ladies' room mirror, regards
            her ample bosom and starts kneading it. The other women present
            start staring at her, not because of her unbecoming behavior, but
            because of her breasts. Can they touch them? &quot;Go ahead. That's
            why I got 'em,&quot; Courtney replies, and she continues her
            conversation with Christina, uninterrupted, while other hands
            proceed to fondle her. We're supposed to look at this scene
            approvingly; instead, the characters come off as boorish and crude,
            like watching the morons who flash the camera in the commercials
            that appear on E! Television for the &quot;Girls Gone Wild&quot;
            videos.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The
            picture wants to be a breezy, cheerfully raunchy comedy, which is
            fine -- there's nothing wrong with being cheerfully raunchy, as long
            as you throw in a few good jokes along the way. Instead, the film is
            brusque and thuddingly short on inspiration or cleverness. The
            characters get their clothes wet, strip down to their undies in
            public, and then waggle their panty-covered bottoms at each other;
            Christina (played by Diaz with the muzzy features of someone who has
            gotten too close to the flames of sexual heat) imagines that her
            perfect man is one who will perform terrific oral sex on her,
            &quot;on the hour, every hour," while she eats huge bowls of ice
            cream in bed; a biker mistakes one of the girls for going-down on
            Courtney while she's driving her car, and instead of looking
            flustered, Courtney encourages him into thinking that, scowling
            tigerishly while swinging her arm around in the air. (Applegate
            tries for a salty, refreshing candor, à la Paula Prentiss or Kim
            Cattrall, that never really surfaces.)<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">This
            may be a comedy, but there really aren't any jokes in the picture
            per-ce: the characters' brand of toidey-talk is the same as where
            just saying &quot;poo-poo&quot; and &quot;wee-wee&quot; out loud
            will get instant laughs from kids who aren't old enough yet to
            attend kindergarten. The filmmakers seem to have sat down and made
            out on a little piece of paper every nasty thing they could think of
            -- from &quot;glory holes&quot; to &quot;anal leakage&quot; -- then
            just plugged in some dialogue and used that as their script.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Christina
            is after a guy (Thomas Jane, who looks so sandy-colored in the film,
            he might've just returned from a tour of duty with the Foreign
            Legion) whom she met for only a few minutes, then let get away, so
            she and Courtney<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>pile
            into Courtney's car and roar out of town to where a wedding is being
            held, attended by both the guy and his brother (Jason Bateman). The
            road trip that ensues includes a moment where they get to stop and
            read the graffiti on a rest room wall, and Christina gets to
            complain that something in Courtney's car smells like &quot;moldy
            ass&quot; ( I don't even want to KNOW what that is). Then, after
            spending a great deal of time celebrating sexual uninhibitedness,
            the movie reverses itself and says that promiscuity is no substitute
            for monogamy. It's not terribly convincing. (There are a couple of
            bright spots in the movie: Parker Posey does a nice bit as a
            bride-to-be who breaks out in a rash before realizing that she
            doesn't want to get married. And Georgia Engel, the adorable
            comedienne who appeared on &quot;The Mary Tyler Moore Show," turns
            up in a small role, and I found her to be still adorable.)<o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><font size="2" face="Verdana">And
            the picture's ending does not arrive before they manage to pillage
            Selma Blair one more time. Blair came to notoriety when she kissed
            Sarah Michelle Gellar on-screen in director Roger Kumble's previous
            film, <i>Cruel Intentions</i>. I was just beginning to take her
            seriously as an actress after her turn last year in <i>Legally
            Blonde</i>, but this movie, I'm afraid, is not a step in the right
            direction. First, she fumbles around at a dry cleaner's with a dress
            that has a Monica Lewsinsky-esque stain on it (good grief, just tell
            'em it's toothpaste!); then, she walks into one scene rubbing her
            crotch, sore from having too much sex. She has a quickie at work
            with her boyfriend while he's wearing a huge plush animal suit.
            Then, as if in a three-ring circus, comes the topper: emergency
            paramedics arrive to find that she has a member of her boyfriend's
            anatomy stuck in her while she was performing an act of pleasure on
            him. (And if you're still not with us, don't worry, there'll be lots
            of talk about this from other sources during the weeks to come.) The
            scene almost becomes humorous in a bizarre sort of way when the
            crowds milling about this spectacle start singing &quot;I Don't Want
            to Miss a Thing," the song that Aerosmith recorded for <i>Armageddon</i>,
            to try to get the poor girl to relax. (Or, if that song doesn't get
            her to gag, nothing will.) Some actors see performing a role with
            these sort of &quot;daring&quot; scenes in it as a way of both
            expanding their acting abilities and their career potential.
            Instead, it seems sad that women today would sacrifice their sense
            of class and dignity for the attention that can be garnered from
            shameless exhibitionism.<o:p>
