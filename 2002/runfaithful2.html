            <font face="Verdana" size="5">Connie's knees</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>It's a very windy day. A very 
            windy day. Still, Connie Sumner (Diane Lane), a happy-enough 
            Westchester County housewife is determined to go into the city in 
            order to do her errands. Teetering on her high heels, loaded with 
            packages, she's struggling to get a cab when boom, she runs smack 
            into a young man, Paul (Olivier Martinez), who is carrying a stack 
            of old books. Both go down. They exchange looks. His hair blows 
            across his face. Her smile flutters. And you have once again entered 
            the bizarre realm where director Adrian Lyne holds sway, where all 
            relationships are simultaneously broadly metaphorical, oddly 
            abstract, and excruciatingly literal.</b>&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Connie takes respite from the wind 
            inside Paul's huge Soho apartment, where she introduces herself to 
            the beautiful, 28-year-old French bookseller as &quot;Constance,&quot; 
            because, you know, the film is called <i>Unfaithful</i> and she will 
            not be constant at all. Paul is apparently irresistible, casting his 
            sleepy eyes in her direction and offering her a book off the many in 
            his collection. In fact, he directs her to the precise tome of poems 
            that will win her heart, or at least get her attention, telling her 
            which row, which shelf, which number of books from the left, and 
            which page she needs to be reading. Oh my, he seems to know her so 
            well, after only a minute of dialogue. She blushes and scurries from 
            the apartment. Smitten. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">She doesn't mean to be. Connie 
            would really rather head home to the suburbs, kiss her little kid, 
            and find another, less self-destructive way to distract herself from 
            her sense that husband Edward (Richard Gere) is 
            vaguely-but-not-horribly obsessed with his work and less focused on 
            her than he may once have been. But no, poor Connie is the female 
            protagonist in an Adrian Lyne movie, and so, she must suffer. </font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Though Connie loves Edward and son 
            Charlie (Erik Per Sullivan, <i>Malcolm in the Middle</i>'s Dewey), 
            she can't stop thinking about Paul. As soon as she walks in the door 
            at home, her knees become a prominent emblem of her infidelity to 
            come. First, the maid takes note, proffering a bag of frozen peas. 
            Then Charlie espies them, celebrating their bloodiness and snapping 
            photos to show off in class. Even workaholic Edward pays attention, 
            nodding at her story of how they came about, asking innocently if 
            the young man who helped her was &quot;good looking.&quot; Most insistently, 
            the camera offers repeated close-ups of Connie's knees, band-aided 
            or raw, so as to let you know what's on her mind. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Loosely adapted by Alvin Sargent 
            and William Broyles, Jr. from Claude Chabrol's <i>La Femme Infidèle</i>,
            <i>Unfaithful</i> revisits familiar Lynian themes: much like <i>9 
            1/2 Weeks</i>, <i>Fatal Attraction</i>, <i>Indecent Proposal</i>, 
            and <i>Lolita</i>, the new film examines the trouble men get into 
            when women behave too passionately. Lyne also brings to bear his 
            trademark symbolism (pots boiling, rain pelting windshields, dogs 
            placidly observing human foibles) and filtered light (and, as the <i>
            New York Times</i> reported on 7 May 2002, he can't just use 
            filtered lenses like everyone else; he has to pump smoke onto the 
            set, to the point that Diane Lane had to have oxygen between takes). 
            This isn't to say that perfectionism is a bad thing. It is to say 
            that Lyne has one trick he likes and for which he has been rewarded. 
            And he does it again and again. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That trick here is by turns 
            intriguingly complex and irritatingly reductive. Against her better 
            judgment, Connie (or Con, as Edward so ominously calls her) lurches 
            into an affair with Paul. Her first gesture is tentative, her 
            nervousness palpable -- she takes the train into town, then calls 
            Paul from a Grand Central payphone, agreeing to come over &quot;for 
            coffee.&quot; He doesn't press her, letting her scurry off a couple of 
            more times before they actually do the deed, as he sweeps her off 
            her feet and carries her into the bedroom. (In one seeming twist, 
            the elevator in Paul's building doesn't work, so you're not 
            subjected to another of those slam-around-in-the-elevator scenes for 
            which Lyne is famous.) </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Their first tryst appears on screen 
            in fragments, as Connie recalls it during her train ride back home. 
            She's thrilled, afraid, and angry, remembering that, when Paul 
            instructed her to hit him, she did, leading directly to orgasmic 
            frenzy. Back on the train, she's simultaneously weepy and elated, 
            her hands fluttering to her flushed face, wiping away tears, as bits 
            of the afternoon flash for you. The scene is moving, not only 
            because Connie is so manifestly undone by the experience, so 
            suddenly aware of her own hunger and desire, but also because she is 
            so manifestly alone in this awareness. Boy-toy will never match her 
            excitement or ingenuity. That is, you get the feeling here that this 
            is not the beginning of a relationship, but the first step in a 
            building catastrophe, for which Connie will feel wholly responsible.
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But of course, she doesn't know 
            this yet. And the first part of the film carefully traces Connie's 
            roller-coaster emotions, punctuated by reckless decisions to go to 
            restaurants where she might be spotted (most devastatingly, by one 
            of Paul's rancorous employees, installed just for this plot-devicey 
            function). Her lack of vision exacerbates your anxiety, because you 
            know where this is headed, but it makes her sympathetic in a way 
            that most girls in Lyne's movies are not. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Moreover, he plays games: when she 
            calls him one afternoon after being waylaid outside his apartment by 
            a couple of acquaintances (Kate Burton and Margaret Colin), he comes 
            to the café where they're having coffee. Paul tousles his hair, 
            absorbs the ladies' admiring looks, then saunters past their table 
            into the bathroom, where Connie meets him and they share a fast, 
            ardent stall-encounter. She returns to the table with one button 
            undone. Oblivious of her breathlessness, the women proceed to 
            discuss the possibilities of &quot;affairs.&quot; One warns that they always 
            end disastrously, and Connie bites her lip. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Soon she's confessing to Paul that 
            he's the first thing she thinks of when she wakes up each morning. 
            Well, uh, he likes her too, though maybe not so much; you won't be 
            surprised (like she is) that he has other girlfriends. Still, your 
            sympathy gets stretched when Connie starts behaving like a crazy 
            person, or more accurately, a character in an Adrian Lyne movie. She 
            almost crashes her SUV in the rain while zooming to NYC (bad 
            driver!), forgets to pick up little Charlie at school (bad mom!), 
            and then gives Paul a gift that Edward once gave her (bad wife, and 
            not so bright, either!). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It could be that these ill-advised 
            moves indicate Connie's general conflict over the affair. The film 
            thickly underlines her capacity for duplicity and also compassion in 
            a montage that intercuts happy-Connie at Charlie's sunny outdoor 
            birthday party, and happy-Connie in Paul's dark and sultry bedroom, 
            arranged in stylish sexual tableaux, sumptuously filmed by Peter 
            Biziou. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">All good things must end. As 
            Connie's actions become increasingly inexplicable and Edward catches 
            a clue, <i>Unfaithful</i> abandons her point of view for his. This 
            is very too bad, because his point of view is odd, to say the least, 
            and in making this shift, the film appears to equate two very 
            unequal acts (adultery, and what Edward does). He hires a detective, 
            a decision that, as Gere pointed out on the <i>Today</i> show, 
            indicates serious, pre-Paul problems in the marriage: Edward would 
            rather go to this extreme than have a conversation with his wife.
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">On learning the &quot;truth,&quot; Edward 
            decides to confront Paul (who sort of resembles Gere in his more 
            insolent <i>American Gigolo</i> days), whereupon his jealousy 
            literally makes him ill, at which point, the film resorts to a very 
            cheap trick (and it's not even Lyne's usual), taking Edward's 
            unfocused, flailing perspective (&quot;I. Feel. Ill.&quot;). Such visual 
            gimmickry doesn't really make up for what follows, doesn't make what 
            Edward does next look plausible, and doesn't excuse sending Connie 
            off to the edges of the film. <i>Unfaithful</i> quickly descends 
            into a murky moral relativity, where obsession substitutes for love 
            and women forgive all.</font><hr size="1">
