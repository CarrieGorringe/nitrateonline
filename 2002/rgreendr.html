            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Green Dragon</i> opens with a 
            young Vietnamese boy waking up with a start to find himself in a 
            strange place, a room with people sleeping on the floor all about 
            him. The boy then carefully steps over the bodies of the sleeping 
            people, like a kid carefully trying not to step on the cracks in a 
            sidewalk, in order to find out where he is. It turns out to be Camp 
            Pendleton, in California, where he is among the first group of 
            refugees to be evacuated from Vietnam when the U.S. military began 
            to withdraw from that country in April, 1975, shortly after which 
            the North Vietnamese forces would sweep down and engulf Saigon and 
            the rest of the South.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Unfortunately, Timothy Linh Bui, 
            who wrote and directed <i>Green Dragon</i>, has taken a potentially 
            rich dramatic subject -- refugees who watch, from a distance, the 
            country they knew gradually disappear bit by bit, while housed by 
            U.S. soldiers whom they had counted on to prevent such a fate -- and 
            has reduced everything to the same note of quiet anguish and grief. 
            (The director's brother, Tony Bui, did pretty much the same thing 
            with the 1999 film, <i>Three Seasons</i>.) The film seems populated 
            by stock characters and stock situations. The young boy, Minh (Trung 
            Nguyen), and his sister, Anh (Jennifer Tran), are wide-eyed, 
            emotionally distant waifs who are waiting for their mother to catch 
            up and rejoin them. Their uncle, Tai (Don Duong, who has an 
            expressively pensive, centered quality to his face and gestures), is 
            called upon to act as &quot;camp manager&quot; by the C.O. (Patrick Swayze, 
            thick-necked and rather distant, as well), but his duties, beyond 
            quietly listening to people, are somewhat ill-defined. Along with 
            his conciliatory, hands-across-the-water friendship with the C.O., 
            Minh also becomes friends with a lonely camp cook (Forest Whitaker), 
            and helps the cook paint a mural on a blank wall in the mess-hall 
            kitchen.&nbsp; The intentions are entirely honorable, but the situation 
            of an older man repeatedly taking a young boy into a back room has 
            such connotations that the filmmakers may have wanted to have given 
            it some second-thought before staging things this way.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Other parts of the film, though, 
            are simplistic, even naïve. When the refugees begin to make clear 
            that they don't want to leave the camp, Tai is given a lift into 
            town and back, after which he describes to the other Vietnamese what 
            they have not yet been able to see -- many privately-owned cars, 
            vast supermarkets, and jobs that pay two dollars and ten cents an 
            hour, guaranteed minimum wage. If the employers HAVE to pay them at 
            least that much, Tai says, &quot;we can make it.” (If there are jobs 
            available, and employers who don't try to take advantage of them, 
            and affordable housing that is in better condition than a dog run.) 
            Hiep Thi Le, who played the beleaguered heroine of Oliver Stone's <i>
            Heaven and Earth</i>, looks like she may inject some well-needed 
            feistiness into the film when she first appears as a woman who 
            angrily demands why her repeated requests for baby food for her 
            infant have not been honored, but even she, after a while, becomes 
            subsumed by the overall solicitous tone. The filmmakers have stated 
            that they wanted to re-evoke a certain time and place where people 
            from another shore had to make a new beginning. Unfortunately, the 
            filmmakers seem too respectful towards their subject to fully bring 
            it to life. Time and place are what the film needs more of in order 
            to make it become anything more than well-intentioned.</font></td>
