            review by <a href="../paula.html" target="_top">Paula Nechak</a>, 3 May 2002</i></font><p>
            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Inside the cinema's constant 
            fascination with the old and new and the retelling of history is a 
            long-standing temptation: parallel a love story against the vast 
            chaos of uncertainty. Heard it before? You bet. From <i>Waterloo 
            Bridge</i> to <i>The English Patient</i>; <i>The French Lieutenant's 
            Woman</i> and in Neil LaBute's upcoming adaptation of A.S. Byatt's 
            novel, <i>Possession</i>, the past collides perfectly, passionately 
            and with dusky abandon against the future.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the books the above films were 
            based upon, the trading back-and-forth of spatial relations to serve 
            the purpose of the story's dramatic end, works beautifully because 
            of the liberating and intricate luxury of length. In the more 
            condensed medium of film, the challenge is formidable and requires a 
            flurry of detail and deftness, but especially a smooth hand.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Enigma</i>, the historical movie 
            produced by Mick Jagger and Lorne Michaels, is based upon the dense 
            1995 novel by Robert Harris and, while it chronicles a tense, 
            intriguing era in Britain's war-torn annals, is as murky and spotty 
            a piece of work as its title. The hit-and-miss director Michael 
            Apted, who shone in his documentary series beginning with <i>7 Up</i> 
            and then made banalities like <i>Blink</i>, has tackled this 
            romantic espionage thriller starring Dougray Scott, Kate Winslet, 
            Jeremy Northam and Saffron Burrows, with a heavy hand. While his 
            cast is stellar, his film's plotting and continuity sorely lacks.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Surprisingly <i>Enigma</i> has been 
            adapted for the screen by the wordsmith playwright Tom Stoppard, 
            whose script for &quot;Shakespeare in Love&quot; was breathtakingly smart. But 
            here his translation feels labored and forced and never quite pulls 
            us inside the hearts and minds of its central character. It suggests 
            his motivation, pain and longing instead of making us palpate and 
            vibrate with the danger and immediacy that surrounds and ultimately 
            propels him into the choices he makes.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Scott plays Tom Jericho, a 
            brilliant mathematician turned cryptologist who is returning - after 
            a nervous breakdown - to &quot;Station X,&quot; a covert code-breaking 
            operation nestled deep inside Bletchley Park. Here Britain's most 
            formidable minds have converged in a single mission - defeat the 
            Nazi U Boat forces and crack the code with which they communicate to 
            the German High Command. The task is especially daunting and urgent 
            because the enemy has changed the code, a fleet of Allied merchant 
            ships carrying 10,000 passengers are in the vicinity, and Jericho, 
            still tender and oozing over his abandonment by lover Claire Romilly 
            (Burrows), suspects a spy midst the British ranks.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">More, Jericho is pursued by a 
            member of the secret service, an imperious and omnipresent officer 
            named Wigram (Northam). With emotional and strategic walls closing 
            in around him, Tom has no choice but to appeal to Hester Wallace (Winslet), 
            a bookish, bright Bletchley worker who was roommates with the 
            missing Claire. The pair embark on an intrigue that takes them 
            beyond the predictability of war's tragedy and deep into a heart of 
            darkness and betrayal.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Enigma</i> is a mystery that 
            holds little surprise for all its twists and turns. While Winslet 
            lends a Nancy Drew alertness and intelligence to Hester, we can't 
            fathom her reasoning. She weeps for Claire, played with jaded, 
            playful creepiness by Burrows, at one point, flashing back to an 
            earlier encounter that verges on a flirtation. Are they lovers? For 
            Claire, with her worldly knowing and willfulness, is licentious and 
            able to seduce with a wink and Hester in her girlish purity and 
            dedication to the cause, is vulnerable - and able to obtain 
            proprietary information.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With all these extraordinary puzzle 
            pieces and characters <i>Enigma</i> as a whole doesn't gel and form 
            the bigger historical picture. Its male characters are less formed 
            and interesting than its women and It's indecipherable in parts, 
            clunkily edited and chunkily pieced together. It's a strangely 
            unsophisticated effort and that previously alluded to agility, 
            required in a movie that purports to pit such a breadth of 
            information against a palette of disparate personalities, the 
            illogic of war and the consequence of desperate acts, fails to 
            completely hold and enthrall. <i>Enigma</i> is a textbook movie 
            instead, missing in thrills and weighted with too much pouting and 
            ponderous self-pity. It's a missed opportunity that, for its plusses 
            in Winslet and Burrows, escapes cracking the code on what was its 
            own grander potential.</font></td>
