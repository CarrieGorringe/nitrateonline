            <font face="Verdana" size="5">So have no fear&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">For a minute, <i>Men In Black II</i> 
            looks like it's going to do something new-ish. Agent Jay (Will 
            Smith), jaded after five years with MIB -- during which time he has 
            endured a series of dullsville partners -- is assigned to work with 
            Agent F, a.k.a. Frank (gruff voice by Tim Blaney), the pug dog. 
            While Frank is enthusiastic about the mission and the partnership 
            (warbling &quot;I Will Survive&quot; out the car window, then barking along to 
            the chorus of &quot;Who Let the Dogs Out&quot;), Jay remains mostly depressed, 
            insisting that Frank shut up or &quot;stay.&quot; </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Frank is a singular kick. But Jay's 
            dour demeanor places him -- momentarily -- in the position that Kay 
            (Tommy Lee Jones) occupied in the original <i>Men In Black</i>. But 
            you know this situation won't last, that Smith won't play straight 
            man for too long. Which means that, while it's terrific fun whenever 
            Frank opens his little digitized mouth (accused of certain doglike 
            behavior, he snaps, &quot;That's canine profiling, and I resent it!&quot;), 
            soon the regular buddy dynamic will be reinstated. And things get 
            considerably less terrific. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jay proceeds to locate and de-neuralyze 
            Kay (Tommy Lee Jones), who, since giving up his memory and career in 
            the last film, has been working at a Massachusetts post office; he's 
            also been abandoned by that much-beloved wife for whom he gave up so 
            much (women!). In order to repeat the first film's success, the 
            filmmakers, including director Barry Sonnenfeld, have decided that 
            close repetition of plot and characterization is imperative. </font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As for Frank, well, once the action 
            heats up, the creepily charismatic diminutive pooch is mostly 
            consigned to the sidelines. Can't be having no dog dominate a 
            multi-million action-comedy-summer-blockbuster, not no-how. </font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">From the moment Kay is recovered 
            (just after Jay has a little beatbox language exchange with alien 
            Biz Markie), <i>MIBII</i> increasingly resorts to formula, just 
            about all plot elements come back: Jay and Kay argue; Jay gets to 
            run a couple of non-threatening &quot;black man&quot; jokes; a pretty girl 
            sort-of-but-not-really comes between them; they seek and battle a 
            giant-buggish alien, who simultaneously seeks some crucial, 
            cosmos-changing item. The girl is Laura (Rosario Dawson), a pizza 
            joint employee; the alien is a nasty, black-tentacly alien named 
            Serleena (played in human form by Lara Flynn Boyle); and the crucial 
            item is something called the Light of Zartha). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Serleena arrives on earth looking 
            like her real self (small, powerful, part-plant-part-insectish), 
            then takes a Victoria's Secret model's form that she happens upon in 
            a magazine. Soon after, she takes as her punky-goon-henchman a 
            sublimely stupid two-headed alien named Scrad, a.k.a. Charlie, 
            played by <i>Jackass</i>'s Johnny Knoxville (in fact, his ILM-effected 
            second head is not very convincing, lacking dimension and color).&nbsp;
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That these characters are both 
            functions of crass popular culture -- Serleena learns quickly that 
            flashing her breasts makes men delirious, Scrad is most definitely a 
            jackass -- underlines the way that the <i>MIB</i> movies negotiate 
            pop culture and media, as means to human self-understanding and 
            -inflation. One of the 1997 original's more successful gags was the 
            moment when Jay learned that certain weirdo-celebs (and his third 
            grade teacher) were really aliens -- folks like Al Roker, George 
            Lucas, Isaac Mizrahi, Newt Gingrich. While aliens are creators of 
            art, politics, and culture, humans are consumers, and moreover, they 
            like it like that. The MIB's mission, as Jay learned way back when, 
            is to preserve human routine and ignorance, so people can believe 
            they're alone in the universe and so, in control of their &quot;happy 
            lives,&quot; as Kay sardonically observes. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To attain this end, the MIB 
            organization stipulates anonymity and conformity, that whole &quot;the 
            last suit you'll ever wear&quot; business. The very popularity of the 
            first film -- in which Jay and Kay are essential sequel elements 
            rather than anonymous and expendable -- complicates the concept, but 
            hardly eradicates it. One of some twenty-one sequels coming to 
            theaters in 2002, <i>MIBII</i> makes it a point not to mess with 
            viewer expectations. Instead, it invites you to luxuriate in the 
            familiar, to enjoy what you've enjoyed before. In addition to the 
            return of Jay, Kay, and Frank, the film includes re-appearances by 
            MIB Chief Zed (Rip Torn), pawnbroker Jeebs (Tony Shaloub), and <i>
            Mr. Show</i>'s David Cross (despite the fact that his morgue 
            attendant geek was slimed in the first film; here he plays a video 
            store geek). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Repetition rules. As Will Smith's 
            soundtrack single, &quot;Black Suits Comin' (Nod Ya Head),&quot; puts it, 
            rather succinctly, &quot;The Men In Black is back to protect the world. / 
            When the enemy is near, the elite is here, / So have no fear, just 
            let me see you / Nod ya head! The Black Suits Comin'.&quot; The MIB -- 
            movie franchise and secret organization -- depends on 
            commodification, homogenization, and commercial overkill -- see, for 
            instance, the current film's tie-in with Burger King's &quot;back porch 
            grillers,&quot; seemingly connected to Jay and Kay, though it's unclear 
            just how. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What the sequel does make 
            abundantly clear is that the apparently accidental harmonies of the 
            first can -- indeed must -- be turned into calculation. <i>MIBII</i> 
            comes equipped with the aforementioned tie-ins, the first film's 
            popularity, and perhaps most importantly, the association with 
            Smith's ritual (however mythic) lock on the July 4 box office.
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">However you feel about Smith -- 
            he's a perpetual good sport, a self-involved movie star, a 
            profit-making machine, talented comedian, or upstanding &quot;role model&quot; 
            -- he has been doing his part to promote this package: film, CD, and 
            self. And of all the non-threatening-to-white-folks rappers, he's 
            extended his reign the longest (anybody remember Coolio?) For this 
            go-round, he's appeared on <i>Tonight</i> (laughing along with Leno 
            as if that guy is funny), <i>Today</i> (a couple of times, first as 
            the family-friendly rapper supreme, born to reign, then as the movie 
            star), Bravo's <i>Actors' Studio</i>, on MTV variously, on BET's <i>
            Testimony</i>, etc., etc. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The sequel, for all its investment 
            in digital effects and the efforts made to include Jones and 
            Sonnenfeld -- is about Smith more than anyone else. And to all 
            appearances, he knows this, and works hard on his image, doing 
            interview after interview, repeating all his good-guy lines. If 
            heads tend to look on his claims to hiphop cred as somewhat dubious 
            (Fresh Prince had his moment, you know, and it was a while back), he 
            continues to make records that sell decently, spout off against 
            crass bling-blingers (even as he brags about the trucks it takes to 
            bring his money home), and makes room for family, whether bringing 
            Jazzy Jeff along for occasional appearances or including Jada and 
            the kids in the mix. Nod ya head. The man understands and exploits 
            the process of commodification, homogenization, and commercial 
            overkill better than most. And on him, it looks good. </font></td>
