            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">First,
            Slim (Jennifer Lopez) is a waitress with her pal Ginny (Juliette
            Lewis, who actually looks like she might work in a diner, unlike
            Lopez), with Sheryl Crow's &quot;All I Wanna Do&quot; on the
            soundtrack. Slim is so great, she calls customers by name and leans
            down to pick up a child's toy when it's fallen on the floor. Within
            a few minutes, she meets a suspicious character who shows up with a
            rose for her, one Robbie (Noah Wyle). She's about to fall for it,
            when she's warned away by another guy in the next booth, Mitch
            (Billy Campbell), who says Robbie's trying to &quot;get in [her]
            pants&quot; on a $200 bet. Hmmph. Slim is annoyed enough that her
            judgment is impaired, and she dates the eminently and immediately
            creepy Mitch instead. Or maybe her judgment isn't impaired; maybe
            she really is as clueless as she seems at this moment. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Cut
            to series of wedding photos, under a feeble cover of &quot;This
            Guy's In Love With You,&quot; and the wedding party. She's radiant,
            he's super-rich, and you find out by way of leaden exposition
            (courtesy of writer Nicholas Kazan) that her dad abandoned her when
            she was young and she's distrustful of men but desperate to be
            &quot;safe.&quot; Again, this might be a way to explain away her
            terrible judgment, but if she's been so picky before Mitch, why fall
            for his line? Perhaps it's because he's a billionaire, apparently
            through his work as a contractor. He appears at a worksite wearing a
            hardhat for about twenty seconds, but other than that, the film
            offers no clue how he's made his money. He's rich and he's bad. What
            else do you need to know? <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Well,
            for one thing, it might be useful to know what Slim thinks she's
            doing. There are plenty of early signs that this guy is not in love
            with her, but with himself, signs to which she remains willfully
            ignorant. Just so, Mitch and pregnant wifey are driving along a
            tree-lined street, when he pulls up to a house that she has
            apparently admired (you don't see that part: you only see the creepy
            part). Mitch knocks on the door and offers a whopping big check to
            the guy who answers. It's not for sale, he whimpers. &quot;I'm very
            determined,&quot; grins/threatens Mitch, with his back to Slim, who
            smiles obliviously and pats her round tummy. The homeowner,
            meanwhile, looks alarmed and unsettled, and abruptly agrees to sell
            (in other words, this total stranger can spot what she cannot). Cut
            to post-birth scene, where Slim lies sweaty in her hospital bed and
            Mitch cuddles the infant, wholly ignoring his wife. She frowns,
            briefly, then settles back to smile and watch him be a good dad. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Her
            child grows up to be the predictably precocious Gracie (Tessa
            Allen), and suddenly, Slim gets a clue, noting that Mitch is not
            paying attention (the man turns down a shower with J-Lo: <i>what</i>
            is he thinking?). Trying to distract herself, maybe, she cooks a few
            meals, then one night, in the kitchen, she answers his pager and
            hears a woman's voice. Gadzooks! He's a wily cad! And when Slim
            confronts him, he cops to all of it, insisting that this is the way
            it is, because he's a man and men have different needs than women.
            Her husband is a psychopath and somehow she's missed it all these
            years. Plus, he makes the money around here, so she'll shut up and
            take it, because, he says, &quot;it's my rules.&quot; Cue menacing
            music. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            other detail in this arrangement according to Mitch is that he gets
            to beat Slim whenever he wants to. She's surely not pleased with any
            of this, but learns quickly that there's no way out. Just in case
            you're not paying attention (and there's all kinds of reasons that
            you might not be), the film lays out its narrative points in
            intertitles between major scenes: &quot;How They Met,&quot;
            &quot;More Than Enough,&quot; &quot;You Can Run.&quot; But, well,
            you know what you can't do. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still,
            poor Slim tries. She has another eighty minutes or so to fill until
            she gets to put on those boots and kick Mitch's pathetic ass. Ginny
            and a few friends help her escape one night, but, <b><i>quelle
            surprise</i></b>, he closes down all her credit cards. When she
            finally settles into a motel room, he calls and is able to quote
            back to her her last bit of conversation with Gracie. &quot;It's the
            information age,&quot; he says, by way of explanation, though it
            doesn't rally explain how he has so very much information on her. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At
            first, she goes to obvious hiding places, like the Seattle home of
            an ex-boyfriend, Joe (Dan Futterman, too charming to be wasted in
            this role). After exchanging some pleasantries and getting a shower,
            their idyll is busted up by a trio of thugs posing as FBI. Slim
            decides she's tired of putting everyone she loves in danger and asks
            the advice of a lawyer (Bill Cobbs), who has a two minute scene
            during which he informs her that, because she's never reported the
            abuse, she's &quot;screwed,&quot; and Campbell will likely kill her.
            How helpful. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">You
            can see why she gets a little gonzo in her efforts to rid herself of
            this scourge. One of her more desperate moves -- one that pays off
            handsomely, for her and you -- is to track down her long-absent,
            much-estranged, super-wealthy, and apparently unloved dad, whose
            name is, inexplicably and joyously, Jupiter (Fred Ward, who is
            terrific, as always, juicing up the precious few minutes he's on
            screen). He dismisses her at first (&quot;from '68 to '72, I had
            like 5 kids...&quot;), then decides to send her wads o' cash when
            that same trio of thugs comes a calling after she's gone. Any girl
            who's been able to rile up such assholes is, apparently, a-okay by
            him. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jupiter's
            cash flow is most excellent. And she spends it wisely, on a new
            house, some booby traps, Krav Maga martial arts lessons, an extra
            escape vehicle, and some extremely high tech gadgets she uses to rig
            a big showdown with Mitch. This elaborate preparation scene recalls
            Nancy getting ready to face off with Freddy Krueger, except Slim's
            devices are far more elaborate and expensive than buckets and axes.
            He deserves his punishment, no doubt, but it's a tedious and
            predictable process. At least she does the boot thing. <o:p>
