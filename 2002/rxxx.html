            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>It’s a shame that Vin Diesel,
            cinema's new millennium Rambo, has selected such an under-written
            feature for his latest, breakthrough role. Oh, there's no doubt <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">XXX</i>,
            a.k.a. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Triple-X</i>, will open
            stronger than it deserves, but the heavily-tattooed, head-shaved
            macho star, reuniting with his blockbuster <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Fast and the Furious</i> director Rob Cohen and producer Neal H.
            Moritz, may be hard-pressed for <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">X<sup>4</sup></i>
            unless they improve on the cheesy script by Ron Wilkes (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Airheads</i>,
            <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Stoned Age</i>). It's
            clear that the film is merely an evolutionary sidestep for Diesel,
            who basically has played the same character from one film to the
            next. As the X-generation's new celebrity anti-hero, I couldn't help
            but wonder why, why, why, despite all the snap, crackle, and
            brimstone of this stunt-driven, gadget-laden spy vehicle, that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">XXX</i>
            eventually left me ZZZ. There's really nothing new; the same
            muscular, sarcastic package wrapped in a slightly bigger budget. Mix
            in a massive advertising campaign and you're guaranteed a opening
            weekend hit. Large DVD sales follow.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As Xander Cage, Diesel gives a
            committed, non-nuanced performance (Hey, this isn't Hamlet) as an
            outspoken, web-based, counter-culture icon for the politically-dissed.
            His daylight hijacking of a right-wing California senator's red
            Corvette, quickly equipped by his band of merry pranksters with
            several crash-resistant video cameras, is webcast as an obviously
            well-planned stunt to shame the snobbish politico for his old-wing
            stand on skateboarding and rock music. Apparently this
            too-quickly-edited-to-be-believed Internet footage catches the one
            good eye of experienced National Security Agency agent Augustus
            Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson, looking very odd with a close-cropped
            perm and disfigured face). As his latest tuxedoed James Bond
            look-alike has just taken a fatal fling into a Czech Republic mosh
            pit, he hatches a cockamamie idea to secretly recruit programmable
            and expendable scum of the earth as a new breed of super-agent.
            Shows you how desperate our Federal government is these days. Okay,
            Xander is a quick learner, keen observer, and works well under
            pressure, but please!</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Having successfully guessed who's
            behind door number one, he gets dumped into a Colombian cocaine
            field in a live demonstration of WWIII, successfully butts up
            against a menacing, machete-wielding drug lord (a short-lived role
            for Danny Trejo), then Evel Knievels over a scary-looking,
            twenty-foot-high barbed-wire fence and a flaming building in a
            single bound. Not one scratch or broken bone. Huh?</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The price is right for Xander, with
            Cage offering him a get-out-of-jail-free card and an
            all-expenses-paid and (presumably) round-trip ticket to scenic
            Prague, therein to infiltrate Anarchy 99. This is a well-financed,
            well-armed group of now long-haired and heavily hip ex-Russian
            militia men commanded by Yorgi (Marton Csokas) and his cynical
            sidekick Yelena (Asia Argento, daughter of Italian horror-<b><i>meister</i></b>
            Dario Argento). Of course, quicker than you can say &quot;Czech
            Secret Police&quot;, XXX manages the removal of a diminutive rat of
            a policeman (Richy Müller doing a good imitation of a disheveled
            Roman Polanski) and a quick infiltration into the gang. The rest of
            the film wanders into high-octane car chases, extreme snowboarding
            under avalanche-induced conditions, a stately castle shoot-out, and
            a nasty bio-chemical weapon entitled &quot;Silent Night&quot;, which
            Yorgi wants to deliver to an ill-fated world as an early Christmas
            present.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Along for a funny side trip is
            stand-up comic-turned-actor Michael Roof (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Black
            Hawk Down</i>) as Toby Lee Shavers, a savvy, sweater-clad techo-nerd
            (think Q, the Younger) who outfits Cage and his dark blue 1967 GTO
            with a dazzling array gizmos and advanced weaponry, including
            multi-vision-mode binoculars, a next generation dart-filled
            revolver, and a handy-dandy harpoon gun, just the doodad you'd
            expect in such older model cars. (It probably wouldn't pass a
            California emissions test.) Shavers, reminiscent of the character
            played by Tom Arnold in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">True
            Lies</i>, is actually quite an affable personality I'd like to see
            expanded, if (more likely, when) a sequel enters production.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meanwhile, Jackson's character just
            stumbles in and out of the action, with one absolutely ridiculous
            rendezvous with Cage midway into the European arena setting. Sitting
            alone, seventh row, center, in Prague's sumptuous State Opera,
            Gibbons tosses some negative psychology at his recruit as he is
            regaled to a full dress rehearsal of Mozart's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Don Giovanni</i>. With the planet at death's door, the puppet-master
            decides to take an opera break? Our tax dollars at work, apparently,
            and quite a <b><i>per diem</i></b> allowance!</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But it's Diesel's movie to carry
            and Cohen's role to entertain with an broad array of smoke and
            mirrors. Their fans will lap it up, partying along with the rest of
            the Russian thugs in the cast and their lingerie-loving women. Among
            the things Cage does for his country is bed (off screen) one such
            Victoria Secret, who entertains our anti-hero among of roomful of
            perfectly lit candles, all seemingly ignited at the same time. By
            whom? The butler? It's just another moment that, when the action
            slows to allow for a toss-away piece of dialogue, you realize this
            setting shouldn't even exist in such a reelistic world.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">XXX</font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">'s
            supercharged action figure mode is bound to muscle its way to the
            top of the box office heap, but, like Cage's wool-covered garment,
            there's a whole lotta fleecing going on scriptwise. Beyond the
            extreme visual eye and ear candy supplied by cinematographer Dean
            Semler, a host of effects personnel, and composer Randy Edelman, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">XXX</i>
