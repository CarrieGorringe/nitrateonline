            24 hours on the weekend of 21-22 September, Courtney Love &quot;took
            over&quot; MTV2. While a disclaimer ran periodically under her,
            stating that the opinions being expressed were hers and hers alone
            and MTV and MTV2 would own none of it, Courtney ranted and smoked,
            dressed and undressed, dissed various pop acts, misnamed P. Diddy's
            clothing company (&quot;Sean James&quot;), and extolled the virtues
            of real rock and roll, the kind that she and her friends make. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">All
            of it was strange, but among the strangest occurrences was the
            interview with poor Molly Ringwald, who, for some inexplicable
            reason, agreed to sit on a couch with Love. Good sport Ringwald,
            currently getting good notices for her work on Broadway in <i>Cabaret</i>,
            tried to bear up under Courtney's meanderings, chief among them
            being that she emulated Ringwald during her performance in <i>Trapped</i>:
            &quot;All that was much more you than me,&quot; said Courtney. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Scary
            as this sounds -- Courtney channeling Claire Standish or Andie Walsh
            -- it might explain a few things about what was going on in <i>Trapped</i>,
            Luis (<i>Message In a Bottle</i>) Mandoki's dodgy, increasingly
            hysterical thriller. Playing a kidnapper named Cheryl Hickey (I'm
            not kidding), Love is by turns effectively creepy, even more
            effectively abused and abusive, and unnervingly mushy -- this last
            part, of course, comes near the end, when she realizes the error of
            her ways and tries to help the kindappee's parents get her back from
            her relentlessly evil husband and crime partner, Joe (Kevin Bacon).
            By that point, however, the film has so insistently run itself off a
            logical cliff that Love's erratic performance is the least of its
            problems. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            fact that <i>Trapped</i> opened cold (without critics' previews)
            prompted anticipation of its deficiencies. But an early rumor gave
            this occurrence a spin, suggesting that the filmmakers and
            distributors were being &quot;discreet,&quot; since the plot centers
            on the kidnapping of an adorable child named Abby (Dakota Fanning,
            equally adorable in <i>I Am Sam</i>). But, much as <i>Collateral
            Damage</i> is unrelated to 9-11, so <i>Trapped</i> has precious
            little to do with the past summer's child abductions and related
            media frenzy. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">To
            begin with, Joe and Cheryl are not your usual kidnappers -- they are
            movie villains. Their weaknesses are visible from jump, and you know
            that their internal tensions will do them in. Still, they believe
            they have a foolproof system; by the time they take cute little
            Abby, they've previously kidnapped four other children, all returned
            safely to their families, following 24 hours of grief and trauma,
            and a six-figure payment. Their target is always a wealthy family at
            a time when the parents are separated for some ordinary reason:
            Cheryl stays with the husband, Joe's cousin Marvin (Pruitt Taylor
            Vince) takes the victim to a cabin in the Eastern Cascades (he's not
            the best candidate for this job, for, as he puts it, &quot;I don't
            like it when little girls cry!&quot;), and seedy Joe stays with the
            wife, demanding that she have sex with him in exchange for her
            child's life. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Abby's
            parents are seemingly ideal targets for this neat, mean scheme:
            wealthy, renowned anesthesiologist and researcher Will Jennings
            (Stuart Townsend, who survived <i>Queen of the Damned</i>) and his
            ex-nurse-now-homemaker wife Karen (Charlize Theron) spend time apart
            regularly, as he's called to lecture on his invention, a new type of
            anesthetic called &quot;Restorase.&quot; He also happens to fly his
            own seaplane to these engagements, a skill that will, of course,
            come in mighty handy by the time the plot is winding down to its
            wholly predictable finale. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            plot commences when the crooks bust into the Jennings' fabulous
            Portland, Oregon home: Marvin grabs Abby, Joe stays behind with
            Karen and a cell phone, which he uses to call his cohorts every 30
            minutes -- if any one of them does not check in, the kid is toast.
            Meanwhile, Cheryl assails Will in his hotel room, then takes a call
            from Joe (this is when she starts complaining, &quot;He's difficult,
            he's not like the other ones&quot;). Reassured by Joe that all is
            under control, she then insists that Will sit tight until the next
            morning, when wifey will wire money that he will hand over to
            Cheryl. (The reason for this extra step of money wiring is vague;
            it's probably safe to assume the Hickeys prefer complications to
            what the rest of us might call straight-ahead experiences.) <o:p>
            </o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Perhaps
            you won't be surprised to learn that, despite Joe's contentions, all
            is not under control. The reason? The same gimmick that's been
            afflicting kids all this movie year -- asthma. Somehow, Abby's
            know-it-all kidnappers miss this crucial factor, and leave Abby's
            puffer behind. Not to worry, though: this crisis is quickly resolved
            and the film returns to its more prurient concern, with the
            potential sexual roundelay among the adults. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">While
            it's hard to assert that the asthma plot would have been more
            interesting, there's no doubt that the sex story is wholly
            ludicrous, and not a little embarrassing for all involved. It's not
            bad enough that Cheryl is lolling about the hotel room,
            half-dressed, knocking back Toblerone chocolate bars, and confessing
            at last that yes, yes, Joe does beat her silly and really, her
            kidnapper's life sucks. She also lets slip that this whole deal is
            about revenge. Seems Joe believes Will is responsible for his
            (Joe's) daughter's death on the operating table. But that's just
            another red herring, because Will can't be responsible: you (and
            eventually, Cheryl) need to be able to empathize with his moral
            rightness. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            far yuckier relationship occurs between Joe and Karen. Pretending to
            go along with the sex thing, she strips to her black underwear and
            hides a scalpel in her butt crack. They struggle, and, well, he ends
            up with his penis slashed. Very bloody, and the means by which Joe's
            body's morphs to a rather inelegant metaphor, that is, castrated
            male as scourge of society. By the end of <i>Trapped</i>, a
            protracted 20 minutes later, Joe is looking so pale and
            blood-deprived that he's downright cadaverous. Cheryl's still pretty
            much the same -- babbling about how much she loves Joe but turned
            around enough by her close encounter with the terminally bland Will
            that she's thinking she wants the particulars of her marriage to
            change. She doesn't know it's too late. But you do. <o:p>
