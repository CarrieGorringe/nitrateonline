            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Wes Anderson's new film, <i>The
            Royal Tenenbaums</i>, which he co-wrote with Owen Wilson and which
            is staged in the same poised, calculated, anticipating manner as
            Anderson's previous films, <i>Rushmore</i> and <i>Bottle Rocket</i>,
            concerns the fates and destinies of three grown children, all gifted
            and all unable to find any lasting success and happiness in their
            lives, and what happens when they converge, like live turkeys flung
            from a helicopter aloft, on their family's New York City brownstone
            home, just as their long-estranged father decides to return home, as
            well -- possibly because he's dying, possibly not.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Each of the Tenenbaum offspring
            have talents which oddly entice our interest. Chas (Ben Stiller) is
            a business whiz, but he cannot stay under the same roof ever since
            his wife perished in a plane crash: he keeps engaging his two young
            sons in fire drills, to see how fast they can evacuate from the
            building they're living in. Margot (Gwyneth Paltrow) -- who is
            adopted, and, in flashbacks, is shown as constantly being introduced
            as the &quot;adopted daughter&quot; of the family -- is a playwright
            who can no longer write plays, and spends hours each day in the
            bathtub watching television. Richie (Luke Wilson) is a star tennis
            player who stopped being able to play tennis, and in the middle of a
            championship match, as well. The Tenenbaum matriarch, Etheline
            (Anjelica Huston), is both an archaeologist and a tax expert, with a
            study whose shelves alternate between rows of <i>National Geographic</i>
            magazines and bound tax tables.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When Royal Tenenbaum (Gene Hackman)
            turns up, putting the entire family back together again in one
            house, it would seem to offer the catalyst to shake everyone out of
            the various states of ennui into which they had fallen. Or maybe
            not. What's most odd about the movie is how it gradually becomes
            less and less apparent<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>what
            it's supposed to be about. Anderson and Owen Wilson (who also
            appears in the film, playing an author with an affectation for
            Western apparel and an apartment in which some very strange
            paintings are hung) keep this bauble spinning in the air, always
            able to find something to keep the spin going, whether it's an
            attraction by one of the Tenenbaum brothers to Margot; a suicide
            attempt, the note for which is written after, rather than before,
            the attempt; the spotted &quot;dalmatian&quot; mice which were bred
            by one of the prodigious Tenenbaum children, and which are now
            happily infesting the family abode; or one of the characters
            wigging-out from substance abuse and, almost as an afterthought,
            crashing a car, at full speed, into the Tenenbaum home on a day a
            wedding is to be held there. (The character ends up in a treatment
            center in North Dakota, a turn of events which, somehow, seems
            absolutely apropos.).<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There is invention, but little
            transformation, and the even-keel tone of the events, plus the
            distancing devices used in the narrative -- the film is divided into
            consecutive chapters, and information is provided through a gently
            insistent narration spoken on the soundtrack by Alec Baldwin --
            makes the film piquant but not exactly absorbing. Gene Hackman plays
            Royal as an elusive character whom you can never quite get an angle
            on -- he's sly, but you're not sure what he's being sly about;
            conniving, but you're not sure if he's pulling a con job or not, or
            what kind of a con that might be;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>he'll suddenly break into street-talk or jive, and sounds
            like a majordomo while doing so, so it really seems to be coming out
            of nowhere at you. This makes it even harder to get a perspective on
            the film, but Hackman gives Royal heart, a lot of it, and his
            affection for life is unmistakable. The warmth his performance
            generates suffuses the film.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">He does jar his kids -- and
            Etheline, who, in the nearly two decades Royal has been gone, has
            become stuck in a neither-here-nor-there relationship with a
            character played, in a beautifully courtly manner, by Danny Glover
            -- into having a further existence, but one wonders if that is the
            movie that Wes Anderson had in mind. The characters, how they live
            and what they wear, are perfectly realized, so it's not as if
            Anderson is being obtuse, here. Who would have thought to have
            Gwyneth Paltrow wear kohl eyeliner and striped knit dresses,
            elegantly expressing a sense of melancholy with the curve of an Erté
            figurine, resulting in her best screen performance in years? Or have
            Owen Wilson put on a neo-Stetson, mauve fringed jacket, and beltless
            trousers that makes him look, unexpectedly, dashing? Along with Mark
            Mothersbaugh's original music, there is also an inspired mélange of
            tunes accompanying the action, ranging from a song from the
            &quot;Charlie Brown Christmas&quot; TV special, to Elliott Smith,
            the Rolling Stones' &quot;Ruby Tuesday,&quot; and several recordings
            by the deep-toned, highly idiosyncratic, singer Nico.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But the film itself may be an
            attempt to address matters of family which Anderson has not
            expressed fully, or may want to express. He's an original filmmaker,
            and I would certainly like to see him make more films, but he's also
            one who seems to tackle his subjects, not full-on, but from one
            side, almost as if he were sneaking up on them. Things can be lost
            in this manner. &quot;The Royal Tenenbaums&quot; ends up feeling as
            if it were a completed picture puzzle that is being displayed to us,
            save but for one piece being kept, behind a folding screen, there,
            in the Tenenbaum living room.</font><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana"></o:p>
