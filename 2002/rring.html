            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">You watch a videotape. It's rife 
            with stark, plaguing images. After you finish, shaking off the 
            haunting visages you've just viewed the phone rings. &quot;You'll die in 
            seven days,&quot; a girl's voice says. Joke, or the stuff that urban 
            legends are made of?&nbsp; It's the premise for Gore Verbinski's darkly 
            compulsive <i>The Ring</i>,&nbsp; a remake of Hideo Nakata's 1998 horror 
            sensation, <i>Ringu</i>, and which has enough sense of place, visual 
            idiosyncrasy and individuality to distinguish it from its 
            predecessor. Though it hasn't the wit to thrust it into the pantheon 
            of the <i>Scream</i> franchise, nor likely to create the commotion 
            of <i>The Blair Witch Project</i>, <i>The Ring</i> is still 
            intriguingly eerie, what with its sterile, rainy settings to the 
            slightly tinny, metallic tinge that casts everything about it into a 
            futuristic, post-apocalyptic dread.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Set in Seattle, <i>The Ring</i> is 
            not quite, in fact, what you expect it to be - or become.&nbsp; Think 
            back on another set-in-Seattle classic thriller, Peter Medak's 1979
            <i>The Changeling</i>, and you'll get some idea of what the film 
            relationally likes akin to. It's a revenge from beyond the grave 
            thriller that is compulsively interesting, even as its script, under 
            scrutiny, doesn't always hold up.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Australian actress Naomi Watts, who 
            made her big score in last year's <i>Mulholland Drive</i>, here 
            plays Rachel Keller, a hard-nosed <i>Seattle Post-Intelligencer</i> 
            reporter with a young son named Aidan (David Dorfman) and an ex 
            named Noah (New Zealander Martin Henderson) who is Aidan's father 
            and with whom she is still on good terms. But <i>The Ring</i> opens 
            prior to our introduction to this more-or-less distended family; 
            Rachel's niece has glimpsed a video while on an outing with friends 
            - after viewing the phone rings. Seven days, a voice says, &quot;you''ll 
            be dead in seven days.&quot; And at ten p.m. one week later, niece and 
            best friend are chatting at a sleep-over. The niece tells her pal 
            what happened during that party in a remote resort cabin. Within the 
            hour she is indeed dead and her best friend has gone mad at what 
            she's seen transpire. Rachel enters the picture, keen to discover 
            what happened. She retraces her niece's tracks and watches the 
            videotape - haunted by the disturbing, stark images that drill deep 
            into her brain. And then the phone rings...</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The premise certainly is a creepy 
            one and lives up to the tag line &quot;before you die you see the ring.&quot; 
            Verbinski wisely allows us access to the videotape and sears our 
            brains as well as his character's with truly disruptive, curious and 
            distressing pictures. Each is a clue to the final mystery of the 
            ring and, just when we believe we have solved its riddle, the real 
            horror begins. Verbinski also knows enough to tease with ambiguity, 
            as he does in the final frames - perhaps as a setup for a sequel - 
            but which is just enough of a scare to make that post-movie walk to 
            the car slightly unnerving. A long set-up turns into something 
            terrible and horrific as the final reel rolls and if Watts struts 
            less charisma than she did in that other mind-mystery &quot;Mulholland 
            Drive,&quot; she's still fearless, unafraid to be abrasive, anathema to 
            glamour and - for all the questionable ethics at play - a gutsy 
            broad and heroine.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But the people are secondary to the 
            actualization of the thesis of &quot;The Ring.&quot;&nbsp; The images we see are 
            unshakeable and preternatural and their grim black and white grain 
            and silent suffering lingers long after the mystery is unraveled. 
            This is a film that owes everything to its production design and 
            cinematography and applauds the use of cinema as a sheer visual 
            platform rather than the as a more customary and familiar narrative 
            storytelling medium.</font></td>
