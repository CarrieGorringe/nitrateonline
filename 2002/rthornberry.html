            <p style="tab-stops:225.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The
            latest Nickelodeon theatrical cartoon feature is the first in a
            no-doubt successful franchise based on its hit half-hour
            adventure-driven TV series about a carrot-topped, pig-tailed,
            bespectacled, freckle-faced (four symmetrically aligned on each
            cheek) girl with a mouthful of dental braces who travels the world
            with her world-famous documentary filmmaking parents. There's peril
            at every corner and fun at every food fight. Yeah, there's even some
            flatulence from a horse appropriately named Thunder and some totally
            innocent bathroom humor. Never meant to be raucous, and perhaps
            laden with a few too many musical overludes, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Wild Thornberrys Movie</i> is very much a totally pleasing piece. At
            a Saturday morning preview, it was obvious the producers have
            fashioned an eighty-minute African adventure ride that kept nearly
            every child seat-bound and squirm-free, including two often squiggly
            neighbor's boys in my custody. Fans of the show, their parents, and
            even kids not privy to the Nick channel will find this a rousing
            venture about a Dolittlesque girl named Eliza who talks to the
            animals.</b></font></p>
            <p style="tab-stops:225.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            regulars who have voiced the Thornberry family the last four years
            on cable television are back: Lacey Chabert as the punky
            twelve-year-old star; Jodi Carlisle as her semi-protective mom
            Marianne; Tim Curry (his often villainous nature locked safely in a
            hall closet) is the soft-hearted, light-headed, sarcasm-deprived dad
            Nigel; Australian-born Flea, a.k.a. Michael Balzary, a Red Hot Chili
            Pepper, provides the manic ramblings of Borneo bushbaby/wild thing
            Donnie Thornberry, an animated variation of SNL's Chris Kattan's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Mr
            Peepers</i>, replacing late-night dry-humping with PG-rated
            wedgie-pulling; Danielle Harris as the teenage rebel/Valley Girl,
            sibling rival, and reluctantly-just-as-heroic-as-her-sister Debbie;
            and Tom Kane as Darwin, Eliza's playfully troublesome, yet forever
            faithful, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">kemo sabe</i> chimp.</font></p>
            <p style="tab-stops:225.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">New
            feature family members include Nigel's Scottish parents, Colonel
            Radcliffe and Cordelia (Lynn Redgrave), comfortable sipping tea or
            parachuting into the action (alas the new china doesn't make as
            successful a landing). Rupert Everett and Marisa Tomei add their own
            audacious mix as Sloan and Bree Blackburn, bold outbackers whose
            proximity to the stealthy savannah skirmishes is just a tad too
            incidental for at least one adult viewer.</font></p>
            <p style="tab-stops:225.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            &quot;guest stars&quot; would be the family of adorable cheetahs
            mothered by Akela (Alfre Woodard), with the cutest of her brood,
            Tally, being cubnapped by a gang of airborne poachers. The critter
            becomes the center of Eliza's quest for absolution, as she feels
            responsible for the cat's snatching while under her playful care.
            Even a forced exile at Lady Beatrice School, a British boarding
            school (with an impetuous friend as stowaway in her baggage), can't
            keep her from finagling her way back to Africa to find the feline.
            The perilous road to Nairobi gets progressively muddied as the
            various members of the Thornberry family stave off a large scale
            elephant massacre in the Dembo Valley.</font></p>

            Malkasian -- having been one of the nearly dozen directors who
            worked on the series -- and Jeff McGrath -- a creative producer on
            the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Wild Thornberrys: The Origin of Donnie</i> telefeature and a
            director for its cutting edge predecessor series <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Rugrats</i><i style="color: black"> -- </i>keep their debut as feature
            directors quickly paced and brightly lit. You don't mess with a
            success product. The sequences are short and the colors primary,
            with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Rugrat</i> veteran Kate
            Boutilier's script heavy in the social message area without pounding
            it mercilessly into the little noggins watching from the audience.
            Having not seen the series, I suspect the film version is
            compellingly and corporately close to the tone and characters
            created by Gabor Csupo and former wife Arlene Klasky (also
            responsible for the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Rugrats</i> -- who will costar together in next summer's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Rugrats
            Meet the Wild Thornberrys</i>) and their comic compatriots Steve
            Pepoon, David Silverman, and Stephen Sustarsic.<o:p>

            single, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Father and Daughter</i>,
            and Peter Gabriel, Sting, Dave Matthews, among others, contributing.
            These musicians apparently were drawn to the project by its heavy
            anti-poaching, pro-wildlife storyline set in the African Serengeti.
            The filmmakers also put Tom Jones' rendition of Paul Anka's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">She's
            a Lady</i> to hilarious advantage when Darwin must dress up for a

            Paramount is picking up the animated slack with this admirable,
            modestly-budgeted ($35 million) picture that should draw adequately
            from its target audience of young cable devotees, particularly young
            girls wary of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Harry Potter</i>
