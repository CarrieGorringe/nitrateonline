            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Based
            on her novel of the same name, Rebecca Miller’s innovative second
            feature paints intimate portraits of three women on the verge of a
            critical and life-changing decision, each struggling in their own
            way to find freedom from a man in their life. Presided over by an
            extremely wordy voiceover, Miller’s style is a little too
            conscious of its literary roots, but through accomplished
            storytelling and use of digital camerawork, she has forged a very
            distinct and impressive style as a young filmmaker.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Out
            of the seven short stories in her novel, Miller has picked abused
            wife Delia, career girl Greta and runaway Paula; three women from
            three very different walks of life who each take roughly a third of
            the film for their stories. Firstly we meet Delia who, as a teenager
            (Laura Finelli), traded on her shapely figure to gain adoration from
            boys and find a pleasurable escape from an abusive home life. Now
            married with three children, Delia (Kyra Sedgewick) has ended up in
            another violent relationship with a husband who humiliates her in
            front of her children. After a particularly degrading beating, Delia
            flees with her children to a women’s shelter and then calls on an
            old schoolmate to house her temporarily so that she can work in a
            local diner. From these humble beginnings, Delia is then able to
            rebuild her life with her children and regain the power that her
            husband took away.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            she does by rediscovering her allure men, in particular the slimy
            advances of the cook’s son Mylert (Leo Fitzpatrick). Although she
            has finally escaped her husband, it’s no easy ride for Delia.
            Ashamed that she’s housing her children in a friend’s garage,
            forsaking her pride to rebuild her life and finally using the
            feelings of another person to bolster herself self-esteem, she’s
            as messy and complicated as you’d expect a woman in her situation
            to be in real life. Miller spares the melodrama and leaves Delia’s
            story open ended – there’s hope that she will rehabilitate
            herself but we’re aware of her emotional baggage – avoiding the
            clichés of a victimized woman who finds her perfect man in the end.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            the second and most absorbing story, Parker Posey gives a superb
            performance as Greta, a happily married cookbook editor who has all
            the ingredients for a comfortable life but finds herself completely
            unstimulated by it all. Given the opportunity to work with a hot
            young author, she begins to reflect on her life and her complete
            lack of satisfaction in both her work and relationship. Unable to
            remain faithful to her husband, as a flashback to a past fling
            illustrates, Greta has to deal with the fact that a step up the
            career ladder is also a step away from her marriage. But it’s also
            a step back towards her well-connected and equally ambitious father,
            who she deliberately lost contact with after he was unfaithful to
            her mother.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Greta
            is lacking in self-confidence to the degree that she uses her new
            job to impress an old friend at a party and make her life seem
            interesting. The previously confident college newspaper editor who
            was disgusted by her father’s infidelity finds herself drawn
            towards the very same lifestyle, almost inevitably, and painfully
            resigns herself to the fact that her attempt at a steady, settled
            life will not work. Greta could have a separate film to herself, so
            well observed and subtly acted is her character. She is the most
            enthralling woman out of the three; attractive; charismatic whilst
            vulnerable and objectionable in her actions, and her story is
            ultimately the most moving.<o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Paula
            (Fairuza Balk) is the third case study in this trio of women, and
            the weakest. The youngest of the three, she hits the road after
            being witness to an accident, which killed the man she was with. On
            the way to her mother’s house she picks up a hitchhiker; a solemn
            teenage boy who is happy to be taken wherever she’s going.
            Previously homeless, Paula was taken in by her boyfriend, and is now
            scared of the deepening commitment in her relationship brought about
            by her unexpected pregnancy. Paula’s story is the most obviously
            sympathetic of the three. She’s clearly in shock after the
            accident, which neatly explains away her rash behavior and her
            selfish need to flee from her problems. Managing to admit and solve
            her problems by the conclusion of her segment as well as caring for
            another vulnerable person works too neatly to tie up the story,
            given the more complex issues at work in the previous two stories.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Refreshingly,
            <i>Personal Velocity</i> conjures up a trio of female characters
            whose lives aren’t written away by tired clichés but brought to
            screen with all the messiness and confusion of realistic emotional
            dilemmas. However, the tenuous link between each story gives the
            overall feeling of three short films linked together by a similar
            theme, each involving within themselves rather than part of a whole.
            Linking each story together is a wry and detached male voiceover,
            unusual considering the subject matter, which prevents the film from
            straying too far into chick flick territory or being too overtly
            girlie. It’s a distinct stylistic move that suits the
            introspective nature of this subject matter, but often feels over
            explanatory and over-literary in its choice of language. Miller uses
            freeze-frame to give the voiceover precedent where dialogue or
            imagery should be the expressive medium, as though she had problems
            editing down her prose into a script.<o:p>
            </o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            use of digital photography here lends the film an intimate quality;
            stunning imagery and cinematic artifice are not at the forefront so
            much as creating an authentic environment for each character to
            exist within. And it’s the characters that are most memorable and
            provocative; their mixture of hope and hopelessness being indicative
            of Miller’s grasp on authentic and fully realized characters. <i>Personal
            Velocity</i> makes some uncomfortable moves as far as cinematic
            style is concerned, but it treats its subjects with honesty and
            humanity in a way that makes its flaws forgivable.</font><o:p>
