            review by <a href="../kj.html" target="_top">KJ Doughton</a>, 18 January
            2002</i></font><p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like Luke 
            Skywalker dive-bombing his star-cruiser into one of the Death Star’s 
            narrow crevices, the four starring helicopters in <i>Black Hawk Down</i> 
            plunge between buildings and into the urban valleys of Mogadishu, 
            Somalia. Just as the rebel alliance in <i>Star Wars </i>came to rid 
            &quot;a galaxy far, far, away&quot; from the tyranny of Darth Vader, the Delta 
            pilots helming these shark-shaped, aerial war crafts are closing in 
            on Mohamed Farrah Aidid, a brutal Somalian dictator. Meanwhile, 
            instead of droids, light sabers, and blasters, the military might 
            that stormed Somalia in the October of 1993 to extract Aidid and 
            allow the country’s starving citizens access to food relief supplies 
            carried night vision goggles, portable rocket launchers, and 
            bullets. Lots of bullets.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With all the similarities between
            <i>Star Wars</i>’ futuristic civil warring and <i>Black Hawk Down</i>’s 
            contemporary, fact-based combat, why does the former feel so upbeat 
            while the latter leaves one in a state of dizzy, disorienting 
            fatigue? Maybe it’s because George Lucas’ vision didn’t include a 
            burned, bloody canvas of severed hands, arterial spray, and bodies 
            torn in two. Indeed, while both movies employ state of the art 
            action and gadgetry, <i>Star Wars</i> still provides a feel-good, 
            escapist fantasy. With <i>Black Hawk</i> down, there is no escape. 
            This is war served up as real as it gets. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Black Hawk Down</i> is so 
            unrelenting in its vicarious tour of battlefield hell that after 
            awhile, we’re acclimated to the sight of a dozen Somali bodies 
            cluttering the backdrop of any given scene. Death becomes the rule, 
            not the exception. The sight of an elderly man stumbling through the 
            streets with a slain youth in his arms becomes just another piece of 
            scenery. Eventually, the film’s shoot ‘em up action loses its power 
            to excite, to stir, or to even hold our interest. Which is the point 
            entirely. As an Aidid follower explains to a captured U.S. soldier, 
            &quot;You Americans can go home to your interesting lives when this is 
            over. But this <b><i>is</i></b> our lives.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Black Hawk Down</i>’s numbing 
            combat is preceded by some explanatory captions, superimposed over 
            images of skeletal Somalis wandering the country’s desert landscape 
            while a harsh sun pounds down on them. Those that can walk are 
            staggering like zombies while others, robbed of even minimal 
            sustenance, are lying supine on the sand, like so much wasted human 
            driftwood. It’s April 1993, and 30,000 of the East African country’s 
            inhabitants have starved to death. A United Nations peacekeeping 
            mission has been deployed to restore access to Red Cross food 
            distribution centers, which are being hoarded by Aidid’s armies. 
            American military brass plan to thwart the warlord’s bullying abuse 
            of power by kidnapping two of his high-ranking lieutenants in an 
            &quot;extraction raid.&quot; The mission is perceived as a quick, easy, 
            &quot;in-out&quot; procedure, involving copters, Humvees, and 160 soldiers.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Director Ridley Scott (<i>Alien, 
            Bladerunner, Gladiator</i>), a master at conveying exotic times and 
            places through meticulous detail and epic set-pieces, begins the 
            film by walking us through one of Mogadishu’s busy downtown 
            marketplaces, where ammunition and bayonets are sold alongside fish 
            and bananas. Clearly, artillery is as common a commodity as 
            toiletries or produce for the average battle-worn Somalian out for a 
            little weekend shopping. Abruptly, Scott positions us inside a 
            military compound, where Major General Garrison (Sam Shepard) 
            interrogates an Aidid-linked gun supplier held hostage. Nearby, 
            young Army Rangers and Delta Force soldiers scope out the baby-blue 
            surf of the African coastline in a symmetrical line of helicopters, 
            primed to kick ass when the time is right. Meanwhile, they’ll be 
            happy to shoot wild boar and barbecue the tasty beasts at a 
            beachfront cookout.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">One can sense a thick rivalry 
            settling in during such gatherings, as when Ranger Captain Mike 
            Steele (Jason Isaacs) reprimands a cocky, younger soldier under his 
            command. &quot;I could have you cleaning latrines with your tongue ‘til 
            you don’t know the difference between sh*t and french fries,&quot; he 
            warns. Meanwhile, we meet other Army Rangers, like the impatient 
            Grimes (Ewan McGregor), whose ability to type has put him behind a 
            desk instead of a gun. The most action he’s seen involves brewing 
            the morning coffee at an Army administration office. There’s also 
            Eversmann (Josh Hartnett), an idealist who sympathizes with the 
            Somalis (dubbed &quot;skinnies&quot; by the American fighters). &quot;These people 
            have no jobs, no education, no food, and no future,&quot; he observes of 
            Mogadishu’s citizens. &quot;We’re here to help, or watch the city destroy 
            itself on CNN.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When his superior officer is 
            shipped home following a sudden epileptic seizure, Eversmann is put 
            in charge of his band of fighting men. He’s up for the job, 
            reassuring the warriors on his team that they’ll ace the mission. 
            &quot;We’re not some sorry-assed ROTC,&quot; he reminds them. &quot;We’re elite.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While the film leaves it up to the 
            viewer to sift through its labyrinthine, congested web of key 
            players and military logistics, <i>Black Hawk Down</i> sets up the 
            soldiers’ assignment with a fascinating patchwork of bird’s eye 
            views. An insider below them, helming a vehicle that’s tracked by 
            overhead helicopters, weaves through Mogadishu’s grimy, dust-caked 
            alleys towards the enemy’s lair. We watch the driver emerge and pop 
            the car’s hood. It appears that the radiator has burst, with steam 
            billowing from beneath, but the image is actually a signal to the 
            airborne snoops above that they’ve arrived at their target. </font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Suddenly, the helicopters are 
            descending on the city block, soldiers are being deployed via drop 
            ropes, and Aidid’s honchos are being rounded up for capture. A 
            steely-eyed General Garrison observes the mission continue like 
            clockwork, from glowing command center monitors. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">However, the tide turns 
            unexpectedly, as rooftop militia armed with portable 
            rocket-launchers flood the scene, their missiles hissing towards the 
            Black Hawks with tails of wispy, gray smoke. Within seconds, all 
            hell breaks loose, a soldier toppling from his rope with a 
            backbreaking thud, while hot lead cuts into <i>whooshing</i> rotor 
            blades. Soon, copters are down, and American troops are exchanging 
            skin-searing gunfire in an orgy of bloodletting that Sam Peckinpah 
            could only dream of. Lacking the comic whimsy of Chinese gangster 
            cinema or the respites provided by Steven Spielberg’s similarly 
            savage <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>, <i>Black Hawk Down</i> becomes 
            one long, nasty, sustained visit to the trenches of hell.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In direct contrast to his <i>
            Gladiator</i>, in which everything hinged on the fate of one looming 
            character, Scott has taken a completely different approach with <i>
            Black Hawk Down</i>, scattering a handful of heroes all over the 
            map. There’s no center to this unsparing universe, and the effect is 
            one of confusion and disarray. Helicopter pilots navigate ground 
            vehicles to crash sites, unaware that key thoroughfares are blocked 
            from access below. Rangers unknowingly shoot at each other. Pilots’ 
            bodies are torn from fallen aircraft and desecrated by Somali 
            militia. It’s an ugly scene. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">During one nearly unwatchable 
            incident , a desperate pilot trapped inside his downed copter 
            empties clip after clip of bullets into the never-ending waves of 
            Somali soldiers running towards him. As bodies sprint forward and 
            then collapse under the raze of ballistic firepower, the loss of 
            life is obscene.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The fact that the carnage 
            eventually becomes matter-of-fact is Scott’s biggest triumph. Such 
            sustained violence might not carry the emotional whirlwind that more 
            dynamically paced films can offer, but it does make for the most 
            realistic approach to this historical incident, which raged for over 
            fourteen hours. <i>Black Hawk Down</i> is unprecedented in conveying 
            the numbing sense of being jaded to combat, whether one is a foreign 
            soldier on a drawn-out peacekeeping mission, or a resident civilian 
            who has come to see such unending war as an everyday fact of life.
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The movie is also made memorable by 
            the chiseled, rugged faces worn by its capable cast members. Eric 
            Bana (who starred as the outspoken killer in Australia’s recent cult 
            hit, <i>Chopper</i>), playing a seasoned Delta operator who has seen 
            war before and doesn’t try to make sense of it, is all coiled, quiet 
            intensity behind rose-tinted shades. William Fichtner (<i>Armageddon, 
            Heat)</i>, appearing as another savvy pilot, has the timid, 
            seen-it-all eyes of a tired raccoon. Other familiar mugs pop up, 
            including those of Jeremy Piven (<i>Serendipity</i>), and military 
            movie favorite Tom Sizemore (<i>Saving Private Ryan, Pearl Harbor</i>).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Black Hawk Down</i> is a major 
            redemption for producer Jerry Bruckheimer, who subjected the public 
            to last year’s celluloid atrocity <i>Pearl Harbor</i> and regularly 
            backs films with little substance to match their explosion-heavy 
            window dressing. Such Bruckheimer-helmed hits as <i>The Rock, Gone 
            in Sixty Seconds</i>, and <i>Coyote Ugly</i> might have opened big, 
            but they’ve since evaporated into forgotten pop-culture pap. <i>
            Black Hawk Down</i>, boasting the most authentic depiction of 
            contemporary warfare ever filmed, belongs in a time capsule. It’s a 
            classic. </font>
