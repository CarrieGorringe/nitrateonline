            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>The Bourne Identity</i> is an 
            attempt to do a big, old-fashioned international espionage/paranoia 
            thriller -- in this instance, one of Robert Ludlum's doorstop-sized 
            pulp novels from twenty years back -- with modern-day electronics 
            and M.T.V.-style jiggedyness, and it only barely rises above the 
            lukewarm.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Matt Damon plays a guy who is 
            fished out of the water, by Italian fishermen, with two gunshots in 
            his back and no memory. Soon, though, he discovers -- with the aid 
            of a Swiss safe deposit box, the number of which is the only 
            information he has on him -- that he knows things like how to scope 
            out locations and reduce attackers to bone meal, the latter coming 
            in very handy when global resources are marshalled to try and 
            eliminate him.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like Ben Affleck, Matt Damon seems 
            to be incrementally becoming less and less interesting as an actor 
            the further out he gets from <i>Good Will Hunting</i>. Square-cut 
            and handsome, he has all his defenses up and in place, and he gives 
            performances that are buffed and polished until all the distinctive 
            edges are rubbed clean away. While taking into consideration that, 
            here, he is playing both an amnesiac and a highly-disciplined field 
            intelligence operative, Damon nonetheless sounds the same after his 
            character has a crisis of conscience in one scene as he did before, 
            and I don't think it's supposed to be ironic.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The lead actor may have become 
            profoundly mediocre, but, fortunately, Franka Potente has been cast 
            opposite him, in the girl-on-the-run-with-the-hero position, and the 
            actress who appeared, splendidly, in director Tom Tykwer's three 
            recent films is looking like she can bring a glittering appeal and 
            incisiveness to any role she cares to take on. Her surprise and 
            shock upon seeing several people she'd just seen alive turned 
            stone-cold dead provides the film with its one genuinely affecting 
            moment. But even Potente can only do so much playing opposite a 
            fencepost. She's a little better off than some of the other cast 
            members: Chris Cooper spends a lot of time stalking back and forth 
            and barking out instructions to subordinates, and some other very 
            talented actors are stuck in some very, very tiny roles -- Brian 
            Cox, Julia Stiles, and especially Clive Owen, whose role turns out 
            to be so ludicrously marginalized that you wonder why they bothered 
            to go to all the trouble to drag him into this thing at all.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Doug Liman, who did a very good 
            picture a few years back (<i>Go</i>), directed, showing a facility 
            for speed as well as an ability to effectively lark about some very 
            attractive European locations, but something went wrong with the 
            picture along the way -- the results are such that you feel like 
            you're only half-aware of what's going on most of the time, and you 
            still feel that way even after the explanations have all rolled in. 
            A film based on a book (or anything else for that matter) should be 
            able to stand on its own, without the audience having to have 
            familiarized itself with the source material beforehand. Here, you 
            have a choice: you can either read the novel before seeing the 
            picture, or you can track down the miniseries that was earlier made 
            of it, with the stalwart Richard Chamberlain in the lead. Approach 
            any or all at your own risk.</font></td>
