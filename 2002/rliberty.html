            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In a public park, a woman stands
            chained to a hot dog vendor’s cart by a pair of handcuffs attached
            to her ankle. She’s in the sights of a man with a high-powered
            rifle in the window of an office building across the square. They
            communicate by cellular phone, and the rifleman’s game of verbal
            cat-and-mouse turns into a spirited, high-stakes debate about gun
            control, grief and responsibility. There’s also a bomb ("a really
            big bomb," he adds helpfully) in the hot dog cart, rigged to go off
            when her phone battery dies.<o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is the central conceit of
            writer-director Kari Skogland’s ambitious and provocative new
            film, <i>Liberty Stands Still</i>. During the course of the
            confrontation, the basic tenets of the American action film get a
            fresh new workout by dint of her obvious passion for the material
            and some audacious casting. If the results aren’t as much of a
            commercial slam dunk as, say, such well-oiled political
            conspiracy-cum-social responsibility movies as Enemy of the State,
            chalk that up to some narrative implausibilities in the name of that
            passion, as well as audience expectations based on that casting.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The woman in question is Liberty
            Wallace (Linda Fiorentino), wife of genial but ruthless gun
            manufacturer Victor Wallace (Oliver Platt). It’s while on her way
            to an assignation with actor and lover Russell (Martin Cummins) as
            he prepares for the closing night of his most recent play that
            Liberty’s lured to the hot dog cart via phone by Joe (Wesley
            Snipes), who taunts her mercilessly but for no immediately apparent
            purpose. Turns out Joe’s got an agenda, fuelled by a genuine need
            for revenge and justice.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Generally speaking, Skogland’s
            narrative moves with a brisk and focused pace. If Russell’s
            subplot never really fits (or makes much sense) and the police
            occasionally appear conveniently inept, these weaknesses are swept
            aside by the continuously inventive ways veteran B-movie
            cinematographer Denis Maloney finds to circle the camera around the
            subjects. The exercise is massaged by Michael Convertino’s urgent
            score, which updates a Lalo Schifrin-era percussion-based cacophony
            with electronic bleats and squiggles.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The acting is fine in that taught,
            clipped way so conducive to the best thrillers, Fiorentino laying on
            her trademark sass and Platt treading a fine line between repellence
            and relaxation. Yet as good as Snipes is in a rare non-flashy role,
            his very presence represents a challenge: when one of our major
            action stars takes a part that requires him to do little more than
            squint down a gun barrel and fiddle with some high-tech equipment,
            the entire project is at risk. Credit Skogland’s incisive script
            with managing to hold audience interest by never really doing what
            they’ll expect it to do, right up until the downbeat yet
            completely logical fade. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If the world really needs a distaff
            version of Ridley Scott, then Skogland’s the real deal. Since 1994
            she’s bounced between TV and theatrical projects, and her work
            includes episodes of "Family Law" and "Queer as Folk" as well as
            1997’s <i>Men with Guns</i> (not the John Sayles film) and the
            2001 Canadian thriller <i>Zebra Lounge</i>. She’s clearly got all
            the technical chops for the job, and if she’s sitting on other
            properties with the broad social subject matter and personal urgency
            of <i>Liberty Stands Still</i> (think of a clutch of Kevin Smith
            characters, all breathless enthusiasm -- but with something really
            smart and important to say), audiences will be hearing a lot more
            from her. And if she isn’t, she’s clearly in line for the kind
            of megabudget, action-oriented fodder that will probably never go
            out of style in the boardrooms or at the box office. Either way,
            Kari Skogland wins, and <i>Liberty Stands Still</i> is a noteworthy
            step in that direction.<o:p>
