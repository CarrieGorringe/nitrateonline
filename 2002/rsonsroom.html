            (Nanni Moretti) is a good man, a dedicated psychoanalyst, loving
            husband, and sensible father. A series of short scenes at the
            beginning of <i>The Son's Room</i> -- last spring's <i>Palme d'Or</i>
            winner, directed and co-written by Moretti, with Linda Ferri and
            Heidrun Schleef -- reveals his stability and contentment. He sits
            patiently through variously (sometimes comically) dull patients'
            narrations (detailing dreams and physical ailments), takes morning
            jogs through the pretty seaport town of Ancona, eats family dinners
            with his beautiful teenager, Andrea (Giuseppe Sanfelice) and Irene
            (Jasmine Trinca), and loving wife Paola (Laura Morante). </b><o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like
            most families, this one negotiates minor bumps, but the film is
            already setting up a tension, as little incidents look vaguely
            ominous, signs that daily life is either too routine, or not quite
            routine enough: Irene rides on a friend's motorbike through busy
            streets, thrilling to the risk; Paola witnesses a mugging, too close
            for comfort; Andrea is busted for stealing a fossil from his science
            classroom, perhaps rebelling against expectations that he'll always
            be the golden boy that he has been, perhaps just bored. And
            Giovanni, listening to one patient relate his experiences with porn
            and another list her obsessive-compulsive behaviors, he can't help
            himself: as they lie on the couch, away from him, he rolls his eyes,
            then imagines jumping up during the latter's session to show her his
            neatly lined-up collection of running shoes. &quot;Look,&quot; he
            tells her in his daydream, &quot;I'm just as boring as you!&quot; <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            as the film goes on to insist, such tedium is life, and it is
            precious. Nothing can prepare Giovanni or his family for what's to
            come, though by now you'll likely have a sense that this surplus of
            comfort is about to crack open. As it usually does, life-changing
            disaster comes unexpectedly. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">On
            the day that his son dies, a Sunday, Giovanni goes to see a patient
            recently diagnosed with lung cancer. In doing so, he breaks a
            jogging date he's made with Andrea. At the time, the change in plans
            seems insignificant; Andrea is reluctant, more interested in going
            diving with his friends, and Giovanni is also vaguely distracted.
            They can always go jogging another day. Then, Andrea has his
            accident -- for some unknowable reason, he is trapped in an
            underwater cave and drowns. And suddenly, Giovanni's decision looks
            like a tragic, horrific, unforgivable error. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            rest of the film concerns the survivors' efforts to live with their
            guilt, rage, sorrow, and, perhaps especially, with each other. Their
            initial collapses are followed by displays of stoic resolve,
            mutually supportive (being &quot;strong&quot; for one another) and
            self-isolating. At the funeral home, they view the body, surrounded
            by family and friends; then, as the others clear out, Giovanni
            watches as workers drill the coffin shut: the sound, so everyday, is
            harrowing. And his visit to a marine shop to inquire after the
            workings of oxygen tanks leads to further frustration: there is no
            reason for what went wrong, no explanation. Only anger, grief, and
            endless loss. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">When
            going through &quot;the son's room,&quot; Paola comes across a
            letter from a girl that Andrea knew briefly, one summer, and the
            girl becomes a kind of unseen conduit, a means to reconnect with and
            eventually, let go of him. But when she presses Giovanni to contact
            Arianna (Sofia Vigliar), he resists, fearful that the slightest
            opening will allow all his finely tamped down pain to come rushing
            to the surface. At last, the family does meet with her while she
            passes through Ancona on a hitchhiking trip with a friend, and
            though charming and sweet, Arianna is also unexceptional. Still,
            this becomes significant: Arianna's ordinariness is in itself
            somewhat startling, and her youthful anticipation and lack of
            burden, become the means by which Giovanni, Paola, and Irene can
            begin to come to terms not only with their bereavement, but with one
            another, this realized in its closing image, as they wander into
            sunlight, separately, but as if drawn to the same warmth.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            film is something of a departure for Moretti, best known for his
            comedies (some call him &quot;the Woody Allen of Italy,&quot; as
            he's similarly a multi-threat artist: star, director, and writer).
            This makes <i>The Son's Room</i>, so dark, raw, and, perhaps
            especially, subtle, something of a surprise. It's a film that repays
            re-viewing, because it breaks down the pieces of grief in such
            detail. And it's a film that has been re-read since September 11,
            inevitably. A 24 February <i>New York Times</i> piece lines it up
            Todd Field's <i>In the Bedroom</i>, Tsai Ming-liang's <i>What Time
            Is It There?</i>, and Marc Forster's <i>Monster's Ball</i>, as one
            of several meditations on the aftermath of death, on survivors'
            efforts to live on. But while events have necessarily changed
            perspectives on <i>The Son's Room</i>, it maintains a gentle,
            respectful sensibility: characters' responses are erratic -- ranging
            from admirably self-aware to understandably irrational -- but not
            milked for pathos or grand pronouncements on the human condition. <o:p>
