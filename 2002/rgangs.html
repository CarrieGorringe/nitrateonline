            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>&quot;The blood stays on the
            blade,&quot; admonishes &quot;Priest&quot; Vallon (Liam Neeson, in a
            brief appearance) to his young son, Amsterdam, after the son tries
            to wipe away the remnants of his father's clumsiness during shaving.
            Vallon <i>père</i> is preparing for what will be his final battle
            against his arch-rival, William &quot;Bill the Butcher&quot; Cutting
            (Daniel Day-Lewis). Vallon and Cutting have come to their (quite
            literal) crossroads to decide once and for all which gang of men --
            and, by extension, which way of life and religion -- will prevail in
            the Five Points area of New York City in 1846. Will it be ruled by
            the Catholic immigrant Vallon or by the Protestant nativist,
            Cutting? The answer soon follows, as Cutting, living up to his name
            and his profession (yes, he's a butcher), finishes off Vallon with
            one clean stroke to the throat at the conclusion of a rather bloody
            street battle. He then exhorts his followers to cut off as many ears
            and noses as they please from any of the wounded and dying enemies
            around them, but none of them are to touch Vallon's corpse; Vallon,
            according to Cutting, was a man of honor and therefore should go to
            Heaven intact. Additionally, he even has some of his followers take
            the young Vallon to an orphanage in the hope that it might
            &quot;make a man of him.&quot; Cutting isn't an ordinary sociopath:
            he has a sense of what is proper in such post-martial situations,
            however antiquated and twisted it might seem.</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sixteen years later, Amsterdam
            Vallon (Leonardo DiCaprio) is released from the Hellgate Reform
            School and heads straight for the &quot;gates of Hell&quot; of his
            old neighborhood, eager to avenge his father's death. Cutting now
            has a solid control over the area (&quot;Each of the Five Points is
            a finger, and when I close it, it becomes a fist.&quot;), courtesy
            of his innate ruthlessness and his affiliation with Tammany Hall
            political boss, William Tweed (Broadbent). Amsterdam knows that
            Cutting holds a yearly ceremony to celebrate and commemorate his
            victory over both Vallon and the values he represented. Amsterdam
            hopes to ingratiate his way into Cutting's inner circle and get
            close enough to Cutting to complete his <b><i>coup d'état</i></b>.
            In the process, he simply neglects to provide Cutting with his last
            name. His progress to the top is swift, but soon is threatened by
            two factors. One is his attraction to the lovely pickpocket Jenny
            Everdeane (Diaz), whose past is also interwoven with Cutting's.
            Amsterdam also underestimates the strength of Cutting's charm; as he
            goes through the motions of being Cutting's right-hand man,
            Amsterdam soon begins to confuse reality with idealism, a situation
            not helped by Cutting's willingness to see the younger man as the
            son he never had (or, at least, the one that he didn't know about),
            or his continued, and oft-voiced, respect for Amsterdam's father
            (only religion divided them, Cutting declares during an unguarded
            moment). At his most vulnerable moment, Amsterdam must decide if,
            and how to commemorate his father, and at what price (&quot;It's a
            funny thing being took under the wing of a dragon,&quot; Amsterdam
            muses in a voice-over, &quot;it's hotter than you think.&quot;) Just
            to keep things interesting, Amsterdam's dilemma also happens to
            coincide with the Draft Riots (a four-day period in July 1863 when
            the Five Points -- and most of Manhattan -- erupted in fire and
            lynching over the exemptions from Civil War service for those rich
            enough to buy their way out), and that, it turns out, is the least
            of his problems.<o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The region in the Lower East Side
            of Manhattan that would soon become known as the &quot;ulcer of
            wretchedness,&quot; and make the name &quot;Five Points&quot; a
            symbol of misery and depravity world-wide by the mid-1830s, was
            created from geographical and financial considerations as well as
            the changes in manufacturing and demographics during the early
            nineteenth century. Created from the five-cornered intersection of
            Anthony, Orange and Cross Streets, the Five Points, as detailed by
            author Tyler Anbinder in his history of the area (and of the same
            name), seemed doomed from its very inception. It was, in the early
            1700s, a green pastureland, complete with a five-acre lake known as
            the Collect, where picnickers could gather on Bunker Hill and enjoy
            a peaceful afternoon. By the mid-1700s, however, it became the only
            area in New York City where slaughterhouses were permitted to
            operate (all residential development was now occurring northward
            rather than south). In the following fifty years, thanks to the
            slaughterhouses, the tanneries that accompanied them, and the stench
            from both, the area was declared a toxic nuisance. From 1802 to
            1813, an attempt to improve the situation was made by filling in the
            Collect and leveling Bunker Hill. The tanneries moved out, but
            families like the Astors and the Lorillards (soon to be of tobacco
            fame) moved in, quick to spot a get-rich-quick bargain in cheap real
            estate. They constructed two-and-a-half story wooden buildings,
            which served as a combined living and work space for independent
            artisans, as well as shopkeepers and other professionals. Although
            the ward had the lowest per-capita income in the city, it was still
            a &quot;respectable&quot; place to live in the 1820s.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">However, as manufacturing rose and
            independent artisans saw their incomes decline, artisans stopped
            taking out long-term leases on their property, and rented less
            living space for their employees. The concept of organizing
            neighborhoods by trade disappeared, resulting in a division between
            residential and occupational space. As immigration rose in the
            1830s, housing prices increased dramatically, and landlords found it
            more profitable to subdivide their two-and-a-half story buildings
            into small apartments for individual families. Since many of the
            families who lived there were unrelated, the buildings were known as
            &quot;tenant&quot; houses, later &quot;tenement&quot; houses. As
            impoverished immigrants moved in (the area was attractive to them
            because it would take no more than a twenty-five-minute walk to go
            anywhere in the city, so many of them went there by default and kept
            coming -- and demand for housing always exceeded the available
            supply), the more prosperous moved out and up north. Since the
            ground underneath these buildings was damp and unstable (thanks to
            all of the landfill), and the buildings responded dramatically to
            these conditions; floods and extreme settling was not uncommon.
            Since the germ-theory of disease was as yet unknown, and most
            illnesses associated with so-called &quot;vapors,&quot; very few
            wanted to live in the Five Points area, given a choice. Other
            aspects, such as the large number of immigrant and African-American
            residents, made it unattractive to those with nativist or racist
            sensibilities.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Worst of all, from the perspective
            of the rest of the city, the Five Points area had become the center
            of prostitution in the city by 1830, probably because of its
            centralized location. Add to this the desperation of thousands of
            immigrants who wanted to live as cheaply as possible in order to
            save enough money to bring over other family members and it's not
            surprising that Five Points inhabitants were left wide open for
            exploitation by potential landlords and employers. The larger, and
            even more horrible, tenement buildings that embodied the concept of
            a nineteenth-century slum for later photojournalists like Jacob Riis
            followed swiftly. Although it was not unheard of for Five Points'
            residence to experience upward mobility, it was a rare occurrence;
            wave after wave of immigration continually swamped available housing
            and employment, and nativist prejudice kept wages low and rents high
            by blocking immigrant access to better-paying work (it's a mentality
            inscribed by &quot;Bill the Butcher&quot; Cutting: &quot;That's what
            preserves the order of things: fear.&quot; It's a sense of order
            informed by his fight against what nativists like Cutting felt was
            an inexorably rising tide of so-called &quot;Roman Popery&quot;
            streaming in from the New York City docks, the erroneous theory
            being, of course, that Catholics' first loyalty would always be to
            the Vatican and not to the American Constitution).</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Moreover, this period would mark
            the beginning of organized crime and its pernicious influence over
            all areas of New York City life. In the introduction to his book,
            Asbury makes one of the worst, and inadvertently hilarious in
            retrospect, prognostications imaginable. He states, categorically
            (in 1928!) that &quot; it is quite unlikely that it [another
            gangland war] ever will [materialize] again&quot; because the
            protector of organized crime – the crooked politician – has had
            his day. Three years later, a bloody gang war would be initiated,
            and won, by &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano, and the rise of the
            &quot;Commission&quot; would consolidate Mafia control over the
            city. From the Irish, to the Jewish, to the Italian mobsters in the
            nineteenth and twentieth centuries, to today's Asian and Russian
            mobsters, it's clear that organized crime in New York City hasn’t
            been eradicated as much as it has ethnic overlap: immigrants who
            arrive at the bottom of the socio-economic ladder, and find their
            upward mobility blocked, have the potential to create parallel, if
            illegal, pathways to success.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If Carl Sandberg hadn't already
            claimed the description &quot;Stormy, husky, brawling, city of the
            big shoulders&quot; for Chicago, it would have been perfect for
            summing up the atmosphere conveyed to the audience by <i>Gangs of
            New York</i>. -- and &quot;atmosphere&quot; is the operative word at
            work here: screenwriters Jay Cocks, Steven Zaillian and Kenneth
            Lonergan may take liberties with the facts (the Five Points area had
            already undergone a few significant changes by the 1860s which
            aren't reflected in the film), but, as Anbinder noted in a current
            interview on National Public Radio, <i>Gangs</i> deserves an
            &quot;A&quot; grade for capturing the essence of what it would have
            been like for Irish immigrants who faced daily discrimination and
            repression in their own lives (and, even more unforgivably,
            political betrayal by their own people, in the form of the corrupt
            &quot;Boss&quot; Tweed). At over 160 minutes in running length, the
            film never lags in pace or content; you leave the theatre sated, but
            wanting more, simply because of the writers' skills. The visual
            style is pure Scorsese -- long tracking shots intercut with swift,
            almost violent, pans and rapid-fire editing (which is also a tribute
            to the skill of Scorsese's long-time editor, the gifted Thelma
            Schoonmaker). Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus adopts a marvelous
            visual feel for the film, veering from overexposed bleakness in the
            opening battle sequence, to warm interiors that are subtly saturated
            with sepia overtones, echoing the images of nineteenth-century
            photography. The result is a big, sprawling mass of historical
            verisimilitude, capturing the &quot;you are there&quot; atmosphere
            to perfection. It doesn't hurt that both of the principals --
            Day-Lewis and DiCaprio -- make strong impressions with their
            characters from frame one and sustain that strength throughout.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">Gangs of New York</font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">
            really is Scorsese's magnum opus through and through (<i>Taxi Driver</i>,
            <i>Raging Bull</i> and <i>Goodfellas</i>, for all of their
            considerable merits, have always felt as if the director was putting
            his own stamp on someone else's -- in all cases the screenwriters'
            – sensibilities). <i>Gangs</i> should also be the film that earns
            Scorsese his long-awaited, and long-deserved, Best Director and Best
            Picture Oscars. Whether or not, in this new, politically
            conservative era, a film which unequivocally slashes through the
            golden mythology of the immigrant experience can succeed in breaking
            through the usually conservative mindset of Oscar voters remains to
            be seen.</font></td>
