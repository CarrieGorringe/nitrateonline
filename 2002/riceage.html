            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Anxious coaches and general 
            managers at Twentieth Century-Fox, the studio distributing <i>Ice 
            Age</i>, were caught in a last-out, last-strike situation in advance 
            of their new animated film's debut. Their demoralized dugout was 
            filled with debris from earlier disastrous cartoon outings (<i>Monkeybone</i> 
            and <i>Titan A.E.</i> being massive shutouts) and they were feeling 
            like a pair of smelly old gym socks. Frantic, they called up minor 
            league pinch hitter Chris Wedge (a rookie director who socked a 
            homer back in 1998 with the Oscar Award winning animated short <i>
            Bunny</i>) from the White Plains' (New York) Blue Sky Studio, Fox's 
            wholly owned farm team. What were they expecting? A base hit? Extra 
            bases? Winning one for the gipper? Another sports cliché? Certainly 
            not the madness that ensued with the biggest opening weekend for any 
            film in March and the largest ever for a non-Disney animated 
            feature, even out-hustling last May's <i>Shrek</i>. With a mild 
            assist from the <i>Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones</i> trailer 
            attached to the front end of the witty and quick-paced 
            eighty-one-minute toon, Wedge (and co-director Carlos Saldanha) won 
            the game with one of the biggest grossing pix this spring. It's a 
            keeper.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Taking a Bob Hope-Bing Crosby &quot;road 
            to&quot; movie motif and bridging it with Chuck Jones/Roadrunner-style 
            passages starring a scrawny rodent (voiced by Wedge) struggling with 
            a prized plump acorn during the titular and turbulent chapter in our 
            planet's recent history, there aren't many runs scored for the 
            tried-and-true plot of a mammalian trio's quest to reunite a child 
            with its tribe (all the beasts speak English and the homo sapiens 
            just grunt, a point joked upon late in the film). Actually, if 
            you've been going to the movies at all over the last year, you've 
            probably seen many of the previews showcasing the antics of Scrat, 
            the sniffling half rat/half squirrel, including starting the last 
            big freeze-out (the film's opening bit) or being the frazzled target 
            of an Acme-esque stroke of lightning. The critter's seemingly given 
            more than a toon's allotted nine lives as each disaster would easily 
            classify it for road-kill status.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Although the Great Ice Age began 
            more than a million years ago, the filmmakers begin their tale just 
            twenty millennia ago, during the last great push of ice across North 
            America. The unsophisticated story aside, there is, however, a 
            wonderful charm to the camaraderie among the computer-generated 
            characters and the human vocalizations behind them. &quot;Everybody 
            Loves&quot; Ray Romano's mildly sarcastic New York mannerisms embodies 
            Manny, the woolly mammoth, in his unhappy yet reluctant partnering 
            with Sid, a silly sloth inadvertently left behind in the mass 
            migration. The latter is an annoyingly ingratiating buck-toothed 
            creature, perfectly represented by the nagging, whinny voice of the 
            always energetic John &quot;Freak&quot; Leguizamo. The triumvirate is 
            completed by a calculating saber-toothed tiger, Diego (Denis Leary, 
            ably juggling fire with comedy), a tracker whose ultimate, secret 
            agenda for the human infant they are caring for is not hidden from 
            Manny. The slapstick pairing of the knowledgeable mastodon and the 
            highly-devolved sloth mimic that same love-hate relationship that so 
            captivated audiences with Shrek and his sidekick, Donkey. Such stuff 
            everlasting friendships are made of. And sequels.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The trio head against the traffic 
            (&quot;up the street&quot; I believe one of them calls it) and prevailing 
            common sense of the frigid terrain, as Manny, Sid, and Diego battle 
            mean-hearted rhinos (Cedric the Entertainer and Stephen Root); a 
            multitude of melon-headed, militaristic Tae Kwan Dodos; bad weather 
            (as if there was such a thing as &quot;good&quot; climate back then); 
            cataclysmic geological changes; and Diego's tiger pack's vengeful 
            leader Soto (Goran Visnjic). Lorri Bagley and Jane (<i>Ally McBeal</i>) 
            Krakowski register hilariously in a brief stint as two attractive, 
            unattached female sloths taking a mud-bath with and a liking to Sid 
            and his &quot;family&quot; nature (as he cares for the infant). &quot;Yeah, all the 
            good ones get eaten,&quot; one commiserates to the other.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The startling digital colors and 
            vivid 3-D imagery, particularly the rendering of rain and soaked 
            animal fur, glow in your memory (and will not fade in the film's 
            profitable post-theatrical home video era). There's plenty of 
            amusing sight gags, a poop joke or two; hilarious junk food 
            commentary; witty banter; an icy amusement ride; some 
            sloth-boarding; a cute Star Trek reference; some somber and 
            sacrificial moments; a nice score by David Newman; and tons of 
            all-around fun up on the screen. Basically something for everyone. 
            Yeah, stick around for the credits -- there's a 20,000 years later 
            postscript.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">So the management of Fox is to be 
            congratulated on a bona fide hit. Outta da park. They have 
            miraculously scaled the walls surrounding the cartoon castles of 
            Disney and Dreamworks. The moats have turned to ice and the 
            skating's just begun. Grab your skates and join the fun.</font></td>
