            Holloway (Maggie Gyllenhaal) cuts herself. She hides a sewing kit in
            her bedroom, a box decorated with butterflies, where she keeps an
            assortment of razors, needles, and scissors that she uses to slice
            her thighs (where no one will see). Then she meticulously band-aids
            the wounds, making tidy rows of plastic strips. The process is
            precise, the pain exquisite, and the resulting sense of release and
            control all too fleeting. <o:p>

            has developed this ritual over time, and with good reason: it helps
            her to deal however unhappily and insufficiently, with her sense of
            constant distress. Goodness knows, her childhood has been difficult:
            her father (Stephen McHattie) is ineffectual and mad about it, an
            alcoholic who embarrasses her even when he tries his hardest to show
            his love. Her mother, Joan (Lesley Ann Warren), is beyond
            overbearing, always checking up on her, always nattering on about
            the pert perfections of Lee's sister (Amy Locane), exactly the
            person she doesn't want to be. <o:p>

            all of this going on, Lee feels trapped and forgotten at the same
            time. To wit: on the very day of her release from &quot;the
            institution&quot; (&quot;Bon voyage,&quot; says her shrink [Patrick
            Dachau]), Perfect Sister gets married, at home. The sun is out, the
            guests are chatty, the theme is pink. And there's Lee, standing off
            by herself in her baggy blue gown. It's a lost cause: no matter how
            hard she tries to avoid her family, they are everywhere. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">It's
            not long before dad is guzzling a beer and stumbling toward her:
            &quot;You look so beautiful,&quot; he burbles. &quot;Do you know how
            much we've missed you, pumpkin?&quot; Mom looks horrified. He gets
            sick. They want her to be happy. They can't (or won't) imagine
            what's keeping her so locked up inside herself. It's not long before
            Lee's back in her drab, sad bedroom, digging through the sewing kit.

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><i>Secretary</i>,
            winner of the won the Sundance Special Jury Prize for Originality
            (apparently, such characteristic deserves special notice), is about
            anxiety, depression, the inability to communicate. It's also about
            to turn into a romance, when Lee takes a typing class and gets a
            job, as a secretary for attorney E. Edward Grey (James Spader). This
            isn't just any secretarial position, though she does file and answer
            phones. This is Lee's calling. Not that she knows it at first. In
            the pouring rain, Joan drives her to the office, a cheesy, light-up
            sign outside announcing the position like it's a motel vacancy. Lee
            enters, soggy. The walls are deep green, the furniture dark, the
            draperies heavy. Ominous. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">As
            she sits for her interview, Edward, morose and fidgety, peers at
            her, asks invasive, illegal questions (&quot;Are you
            pregnant?&quot;), then tells her she's overqualified, that she'll be
            &quot;bored to death.&quot; She smiles, barely: &quot;I like dull
            work.&quot; And so she will have it. Each day, she takes dictation,
            types letters on a big old Selectric, makes coffee, and on occasion,
            &quot;freshens up&quot; the mousetrap. She has a routine:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>she needn't worry about meaning. <o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Lee
            works hard, but still, she makes mistakes, typos that Edward marks
            with a big red pen. Nervous and sniffly, Lee finds herself liking
            his reprimands. At the same time, he's noting her tremulous
            demeanor, the cuts on her legs, and, no small thing, her beautiful
            behind. Finally, Edward can stand it no longer: he confronts Lee. He
            instructs her: &quot;You will never, ever cut yourself again. You're
            over that now, it's in the past.&quot; And Lee obeys, glad that
            someone is telling her what to do, in particular, someone who
            actually sees her. She looks to Edward for directions on all her
            activities. She calls him at home, before she sits down to dinner,
            and he tells her what to eat: a spoonful of potatoes, four peas, and
            as much ice cream as she can eat. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Adapted
            by playwright Erin Cressida Wilson from a Mary Gaitskill short
            story, Steven Shainberg's film juggles several attitudes at once,
            observing Lee and Edward from various distances, so their behaviors
            might appear &quot;kinky&quot; and strange, as well as sympathetic.
            At the same time, you have singular access to Lee's lonely,
            thoughtful, admittedly unusual but also increasingly understandable
            existence. As she walks home from work, she's downright blissful,
            her voice-over revealing her budding self-confidence. &quot;He had
            given me permission to do this,&quot; she notes. &quot;I felt held
            by him as I walked along.&quot;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">And
            then one day, they step over a line. Following yet another mistake,
            he has her lean over his desk, pull down her panties, and he spanks
            her. She's thrilled. She starts making mistakes on purpose,
            anticipating the punishment. As long as he feels in control, they
            continue. Once he loses control -- masturbating over her exposed
            backside -- he panics. He's unsure how to want something, to lose
            himself, to give in. This leads to complications. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Okay,
            so you could think, at first, that Lee is losing herself in all
            this. But it soon becomes clear that she is, in fact, finding
            herself. She evolves into a willing partner in a liaison predicated
            on desire and self-knowledge. That her desire might not be yours
            complicates your relationship with her. But if Lee doesn't fit usual
            movie-girl categories, her perceptive, often funny articulation of
            her journey -- away from her hopeless family, toward a relationship
            that makes sense of her pain -- makes the film's focus less her
            &quot;issues&quot; than your willingness to go along with her, to
            give in to her world instead of insisting on yours. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Such
            willingness may depend on your acclimation to <i>Secretary</i>'s
            cues, some familiar from certain other films. Amy Danger's
            hyper-real set design and Steven Fierberg's saturated-color
            cinematography recall David Lynch's suburban underworlds, an effect
            helped along considerably by Angelo Badalamenti's characteristically
            ooky score. Besides that, Lee's experience, simultaneously mundane
            and extreme, is hardly unique. She fears displeasing her mother, she
            falls hard for her first lust-object, she must come to terms with
            herself. And while her gasping, sensuous appreciation of the raw,
            red handprints on her derriere may stretch your usual identification
            processes, it also highlights the vanilla tedium of romance
            conventions. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            most provocative aspect of Lee's devotion to Edward is their power
            dynamic, of course. This is S&amp;M. He's initially attracted by her
            seeming reserve (&quot;There's something about you. You're closed
            up, you're tight&quot;), then moved by her excessive vulnerability,
            her capacity for giving herself over, a power he sorely lacks. On
            the face of it, she's submissive and he's in charge, instructing her
            to walk home from work rather than take the routine ride home with
            mom. This would suggest that Lee's developing sense of
            &quot;independence&quot; is false, that she's only trading one
            domineering figure for another. But she's also learning to
            appreciate and acknowledge her own needs.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">This
            means recognizing that the normal life she thought she wanted, her
            sister's life, is not what she wants. So, she must deal with the
            fact that while she's been carrying on with Edward in his office,
            she's also gotten engaged to her pleasant, if clueless, childhood
            friend Peter (Jeremy Davies). Her decision to walk out on her
            wedding day, and the safe existence Peter offers, is staged as a
            rather hysterical romantic comedy finale, complete with Lee in a
            wedding dress. Only she's not flying down the aisle of a church to
            embrace her true love. Instead, she confronts Edward, who instructs
            her to sit at his desk until he tells her she can move, then
            abandons her, hoping she'll give up. He's too scared of their secret
            passion, their shared sense of urgency.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Lee
            does what she's told: she deposits herself at <i>his</i> desk, in <i>his</i>
            chair, until Edward finally comes to <i>his</i> senses. She knows
            just what she wants, and she sits there for days, peeing her pants,
            fainting for lack of food, to get it. His family berates her, her
            family cajoles her, the local news sets up camp at her marathon
            vigil, noting the extraordinary behavior of this ostensibly ordinary
            girl. Eventually, Edward gives in. That is, he realizes that he and
            Lee want the same thing, and they can want it together. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Though
            <i>Secretary</i> might have backed off its edge at this point,
            conjuring a &quot;happy ending&quot; that might allow you to leave
            feeling okay about what you've seen, it does not. The ultra-trite,
            slightly creepy resolution -- involving Lee's voice-over rapture
            about finding her place, &quot;part of the earth,&quot; while Edward
            lays her on a literal sod-bed -- does not retreat. And for that, you
            can feel grateful. <o:p>
