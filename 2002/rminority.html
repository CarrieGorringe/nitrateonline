            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The basic premise of Steven 
            Spielberg's new film <i>Minority Report</i> -- set in the year 2054, 
            a little over fifty years into the future -- couldn't be more 
            simpler or more resonant: a law enforcement officer who prevents 
            crimes by arresting people before they commit them finds out that he 
            himself is implicated in committing a &quot;future&quot; crime, and must 
            therefore find out how it is going to happen before it is due to 
            occur.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Based on a short story published in 
            the 1950s by Philip K. Dick, who spent much of his career 
            questioning what is, or is not, &quot;reality,” the film casts Tom Cruise 
            as John Anderton, an expert at interpreting the images transmitted 
            from a trio of &quot;pre-cogs,” a woman and a pair of twins who are kept 
            isolated at the Pre-Crime unit in Washington, D.C., hooked-up to 
            electrodes and partially submerged in a manner which, while we are 
            told causes them no discomfort, makes them appear to be virtual 
            prisoners, like the glass tubes that isolate and contain convicted 
            criminals in the film's version of a futuristic prison. (Inmates are 
            &quot;haloed,” then stored in the &quot;inferno.”) Eventually, the story works 
            out so that Anderton has to abscond with one of the &quot;pre-cogs,” the 
            pale, hairless Agatha, and it is the type of dramatic situation that 
            Spielberg loves to tackle, like a complicated puzzle for grand 
            masters. For one thing, security in the story's settings is very 
            much keyed to retinal scanning -- like fingerprints, no two retinas 
            or corneas are alike -- and Anderton has to figure out how to first 
            get into a building that will recognize his actual retina, then past 
            an inner security point that he can only get through using his 
            actual one. The way this is done is gruesome but not unamusing in a 
            macabre way (it also doesn't play to the infamous &quot;oh, gross&quot; levels 
            of <i>The Goonies</i>). It also figures into one of the film's 
            overall themes, which is of life in a society that has given up a 
            certain amount of secrecy. Along with routinely invading people's 
            homes to arrest them for acts they haven't yet committed, there are 
            scenes depicting passers-by and mall shoppers who are scanned by 
            electronic advertisements when then send personalized pitches for 
            products their way. (The film's use of recognizable brand and 
            company names seems partially like a nod to Kubrick's <i>2001</i>, 
            but it also draws us into wondering if we could ever find ourselves 
            living in such an environment of constant bombardment.) There is 
            also a scene where a building is searched by electronic spiders 
            which both save on manpower and are able to skitter anywhere, 
            checking people, both passive or not, for their identities&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Anderton's nemesis is Danny Witwer 
            (Colin Farrell), an emissary from the Attorney General's office 
            (and, in passing, a former seminary student) out to check and see if 
            the Pre-Crime unit is flawed or not -- he seems more than amenable 
            to the idea of breaking something that doesn't have to be fixed. But 
            the film throws in a neat turn about two-thirds of the way through, 
            making us realize that our presumptions were all wrong: the people 
            whom we had comfortably, even callously, assumed to be who they were 
            turn out to be quite the opposite, all along. We've come to live in 
            an age of certainties which, in turn, have bred a certain amount of 
            cynicism, and contempt -- and the filmmakers, here, seem to be out 
            to defy us.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Filmed in a smoky palette by 
            cinematographer Janusz Kaminski that takes out almost all bright 
            colors, <i>Minority Report</i> is, visually, Spielberg's darkest 
            film, and, thematically, his own &quot;film-noir.” Anderton's dilemma 
            causes him to question all that he believes in, and he ultimately 
            has to disassemble the &quot;perfect&quot; form of crime prevention that he 
            has up until them believed in (the &quot;pre-cogs,” it is learned, may 
            differ in how they each may interpret or perceive the images of 
            events they see, causing a disagreement among the three and the 
            &quot;minority&quot; referred to in the title)---a process that ends up 
            leaving him scarred, physically and emotionally, but also gives him 
            some renewed hope. The story takes Anderton and the freed &quot;pre-cog,” 
            Agatha (Samantha Morton), to the home where Anderton lived with his 
            wife, Lara (Kathryn Morris), before the disappearance of their young 
            son. Morton plays her character with a palpable sense of 
            vulnerability that's breathtaking, but she also provides the film 
            with its one aching moment, when she touches the wood in the 
            vanished son's room and quietly says, &quot;There was so much love, 
            here.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Cruise's reaction in this scene us 
            also his most affecting moment in the film. Cruise, God love him, is 
            so eager to please, so genuinely willing to want to give us his very 
            best. It's difficult not to notice how hard he's worked -- and, from 
            his musculature, how much work he's spent getting into shape -- to 
            do his very best in every aspect of this film. But he was so much 
            more communicative as an actor before he bulked-up, in films like <i>
            Born on the Fourth of July</i> and <i>The Color of Money</i>. He 
            works so hard to be &quot;genuine,” here, that he actually becomes 
            further from being genuine than less artful, or less handsome, 
            actors (or artful, but less handsome, actors like Philip Seymour 
            Hoffman, his co-star in <i>Magnolia</i>), like noticing the polish 
            without becoming engaged in the detail. (It should be noted that the 
            film is generally well acted from top to bottom, with two 
            particularly brilliant turns, one short and the other longer, by 
            Lois Smith and Max von Sydow.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And, beneath all the minutiae (in 
            recalling the film, there comes to mind what one reviewer said of <i>
            Batman Forever</i>, &quot;As for the plot...well, there's a lot of it.&quot;), 
            there's still the sneaking suspicion that we've seen it all 
            somewhere before. Spielberg loves movies and he loves the process of 
            moviemaking: watching the scene where Cruise's character escapes 
            from a car, only to end up seemingly imprisoned in another one 
            that's being assembled but which, then, turns out to be a mode of 
            escape, is to watch someone who, like Scorsese, loves making films 
            and the communicative process of films. Spielberg has also made no 
            bones about the fact that he draws on filmmaking's past (Scorsese 
            does it, as did Truffaut and Godard), and, in making his <b><i>film 
            noir</i></b>, there's a feeling of maybe having cribbed a bit too 
            much in order to fully realize this film. &quot;Careful, chief: you dig 
            up the past, all you get is dirty,&quot; one character tells Anderton, 
            and ghosts from Robert Mitchum and Raymond Chandler black-and-white 
            films seem to bleed through the new film's imagery: in one instance, 
            images from Samuel Fuller's postwar Tokyo crime drama <i>House of 
            Bamboo</i> literally do rise up behind the new film's imagery. One 
            wishes this film were made more innocently -- the way, as Orson 
            Welles put it, &quot;Adam named the animals&quot; in Eden. This doesn't mean 
            Spielberg should go backwards (please, no more <i>Hook</i> or <i>
            Always</i>), but, rather, a hope Spielberg will go forward upon a 
            valid path where he can express himself in his own way as no one 
            else has done before. Cunningly, though, Spielberg may be one step 
            ahead of us, here, as he ends this film with a depiction of Samantha 
            Morton's character, at peace, freed from the &quot;disease of images.”</font></td>
