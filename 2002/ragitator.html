            review by <a href="../kj.html" target="_top">KJ Doughton</a>, 21 June 2002</i></font><p>
            <font face="Verdana" size="5">28th Seattle International Film 
            Festival</font><p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Japanese director 
            Takashi Miike has made a living out of jolting filmgoers with the 
            most unconventional movies of the last few years. In 2000, he 
            unleashed <i>Audition</i>. Was it a black domestic comedy? A social 
            commentary on Japanese male chauvinism? A grisly, taboo-breaking 
            horror film? Its twisted tale of a waif-like ballerina turned 
            sadistic, leather-enshrouded femme fatale dodged formulas and 
            juggled genres. The same year Miike let loose with another warped 
            gem, &quot;Dead or Alive,&quot; that seemed to fire all of its cinematic 
            cannons in the first blood and sex-soaked fifteen minutes. 
            Ultimately, the unpredictable film ends up as a hilarious action 
            movie parody, where the chain reaction caused by a cops ‘n yakuza 
            gun battle literally blows up the planet. In a Takashi Miike movie, 
            the end of the world is the rule, not the exception.</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It comes as an unpleasant surprise, 
            then, that Miike’s <i>Agitator</i> is such a traditional, routine outing. 
            Aside from a scene of sodomy-via-karaoke-microphone, we’ve seen this 
            story of underworld betrayal before. A relatively muzzled gangster 
            epic, <i>Agitator</i> appears to be angling for mainstream acceptance by 
            a western audience, in much the same way that <i>Brother</i> did for 
            fellow Nippon director Takeshi Kitano.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After a yakuza punk torments 
            patrons in another crime family’s nightclub, he winds up dead at the 
            hands of such turf-defending rivals. Inevitably, this leads to 
            retaliation, including the death of Higughi, prominent underground 
            kingpin and boss of high-strung hothead Kenzaki.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Unable to let his mentor’s killing 
            go by the wayside, Kenzaki seeks payback. Predictably, this only 
            leads to more violence, as the bodies stack up on both sides.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Despite this tired framework, 
            <i>Agitator</i> heaps up some inventive twists and refreshing takes on 
            the gangster genre. Opening credits brand the screen during a 
            rip-snorting car chase. A prolonged, bare-fisted beating goes on and 
            on, until we’re wincing at every meaty explosion of fist against 
            face. Violence is juxtaposed by the refined sounds of classical 
            piano and strings, ala <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>, to deliriously 
            disorienting effect.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Perhaps the most unexpected turn 
            comes early, when a yakuza squadron of far-east reservoir dogs is 
            alerted that &quot;the boss has been shot.&quot; We follow the tense group of 
            thugs as they weave down stairwells and through dark corridors, en 
            route to their goodfella hideaway. We share their surprise when the 
            clan finds their leader calmly waiting, in perfect health and with a 
            stopwatch in hand. &quot;You clocked in at 18:36,&quot; he announces in a 
            disappointed tone. &quot;If this wasn’t just a test, I’d be dead by now.&quot; 
            Call it the crime family equivalent to a fire drill.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s clear that Miike is still 
            capable of squeezing new ideas out of a shopworn formula, but <i>Agitator</i>’s 
            delights are diluted by endless scenes of mob family gatherings, and 
            &quot;meetings of the capos,&quot; where the audience has to keep up with 
            confusing logistics. Who belongs to which gang? Which family was 
            dealt the last act of vengeance? Which gangsters have deflected to 
            the Yokomizos, and which remain with the Shiranes? Keeping track of 
            such details is about as headache-inducing as wading through the 
            bullshit intergalactic politics that neuter George Lucas’ joyless 
            Star Wars romps, <i>The Phantom Menace</i> and <i>Attack of the Clones</i>.
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Will Takashi Miike trade in the 
            weird darkness he previously inhabited, for the profitable light at 
            the end of the box office tunnel, ala John Woo? Time will tell. In 
            the meantime, let’s cherish <i>Agitator</i> as the latest offering from a 
            director as cool as Cronenberg and as daring as Lynch, who is about 
            to break big.</font></p>
