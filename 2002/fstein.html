Jennifer Westfeldt and Heather Juergensen ask me to wait for a second, while 
they snap a photo with the people who did their hair and makeup for today's 
press interviews. They pose with big smiles, angled so the poster for their 
first feature film, <i>Kissing Jessica Stein</i>, is prominent in the 
background. With this bit of memorializing completed, they inform me that 
they've been collecting such photos in all the cities they’ve visited during 
their promotional tour. When I ask if they've been writing names down, to keep 
track of who's where, they both pause, exchange looks, laugh. Oops. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Westfeldt and 
Juergensen are very easy with each other, a result of spending lots of time 
together since they met at a 5-day theater lab in 1996. They've described 
themselves as feeling, on occasion, &quot;married,&quot; though they both make sure to let 
you know that they're straight. While Westfeldt tends to talk more -- and faster 
-- they appear to share a wavelength. Their film reflects their comfy 
relationship: based on <i>Lipschtick</i>, an off-off-Broadway play they wrote a 
few years ago, <i>Kissing Jessica Stein</i> tracks the evolving relationship 
between two women -- Westfeldt's Jessica and Juergensen's Helen -- who meet 
through a personals ad in the <i>Village Voice</i>, in which Helen uses a Rilke 
quote that appeals to Jessica, almost in spite of herself. </span></p>

</span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">I know that 
Fox is platforming the film, and that you've both been attending screenings to 
answer audience questions. How has that been?&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Jennifer 
Westfeldt: </span></i></b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">
Last night we had a question we don't usually, about financing the film, which 
we're happy to talk about because it was the most grueling process. Sometimes 
we're asked, which is harder, the financing side or the creative side? </span>
</p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Heather 
Juergensen: </span></i></b>
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">And they're both so hard, 
but the creative part is hard in an exciting way, and the financial is just 
hard! </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">JW: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Right. That's Mount 
Everest, and you've got no shoes! </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">HJ: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">People think it's 
easier to get money than it is. We found an angel who invested $500,000, but 
while that's fantastic, I think people think you find two or three of those 
people, and you're set. But that doesn't happen. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">JW: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">We had to get together 
a lot of people, with $2000 chunks; we had like 60 investors. Most of the people 
thought they'd never see their money again, so in that vein, we've done pretty 
well. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">HJ: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">And some of them 
thought of it like a &quot;donation to the arts.&quot;</span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">CF: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">You've been compared 
to Ben Affleck and Matt Damon.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">JW: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">I wonder how Matt and 
Ben feel about that comparison. The difference is that they had Gus Van Sant and 
Robin Williams and a huge budget! </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">HJ: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">And that's &quot;indie.&quot; 
They must have had at least $15 million. We made our film for $980,000! </span>
</p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">CF: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Don't you think that 
has something to do with boys and girls in the industry?</span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">JW: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Yes, I do. Girls have 
a harder time. There are about 5 or 6 women who greenlight a movie, and many, 
many more men who can. So when you're talking about being unknown actresses, the 
roles are one-dimensional: the sweet, young girlfriend who just thinks he's 
great as he goes through all his complicated struggles. Or the &quot;wife who cries&quot; 
part. There's not much out there for women, and I don't think Hollywood has much 
faith that two female stars can carry a movie. There's <i>Thelma &amp; Louise</i>. 
Maybe <i>Stepmom</i> did okay, but that's the Julia Roberts factor. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">HJ: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">I think buddy flicks 
are a guy genre, but it doesn't have to be. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">JW: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Think of all the 
movies with two guy leads, like <i>Analyze This</i> or <i>Rush Hour</i>. So it's 
a double thing, we're unknowns, and there aren't a lot of women's roles anyway, 
even for the known people. </span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">CF: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">And you had to 
convince them you could write, as well. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">HJ: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">I think most actors 
think they can't write. But more actors need to write, because that's where the 
character-driven stuff comes from. </span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">CF: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">I know it started as a 
theater piece. How difficult was that transition? </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">JW: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">It was a pretty sharp 
learning curve, to become screenwriters, but the play had cinematic touches, 
like flashbacks and montages. So on some weird level, we were thinking 
cinematically, or that's where our writer-voices went. Our dialogue is 
naturalistic more than theatrical. Saturday night we closed and I went back to 
L.A. to shoot a television show [<i>Two Guys, a Girl, and a </i></span><i>
<span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Pizza Place</span></i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">] 
and Monday morning, my agent called saying all these studios wanted to option <i>
Lipschtick</i>. And we thought, &quot;That's ridiculous.&quot; You know, maybe five people 
from Los Angeles saw it. But that's how things work: the buzz travels. And they 
were all competing for who was going to get in on this. There's a thing in 
Hollywood where no one wants to miss out on something, if it does turn out to be 
good, and so it's all total bullshit, in a way. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">HJ: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">But we had only 
touched the surface with these characters and themes in the play, so in a sense, 
we were hungry to go deeper. And the screenplay gave us that opportunity. So we 
went a little nuts, with 160 pages in the first draft. You know, the sky's the 
limit in film, you can go to any location, meet as many people as you want.
</span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">JW: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Or you can establish 
something with one well-drawn picture that might take four pages on stage.</span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">HJ: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">So in a sense, the 
transition for us, creatively, was easy, we were ready to go there. But 
logistically, we had to buy the screenwriting software, and Jen took out all her 
scripts so we could check out the &quot;Cut To's&quot;. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">JW: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Heather was the 
mastermind of the manual. She was like, &quot;This is a Slug Line.&quot; And I'd be like, 
&quot;Okay, ANGLE ON, in caps: go!&quot; We were pretty dopey about it, because the 
dialogue was easy for us, but the structure part was new. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">HJ: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">I remember once 
someone asked Woody Allen if he was nervous about writing his first script, and 
he said, &quot;No. I knew what I wanted to see on the screen.&quot; So it was like that. 
We knew what we wanted to see these characters doing and what should happen to 
them. And so we wrote it. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">JW: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">It should be said that 
we were with another studio [USA Films] developing this film for almost two 
years. We became screenwriters, because we had to take notes that we thought 
were amazing or that we totally disagreed with. So in some ways, just being put 
through your paces that way, though it's hard and tedious, to be able to execute 
anything someone says, even though you think it's crazy, is a great 
screenwriters' workshop. By the end, we knew how we wanted to tell the story and 
how we <i>didn't</i> want to tell the story. So by the time we left there, we 
were pretty seasoned. Not that many people do 150 drafts of something. </span>
</p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">CF: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">As tight as the 
dialogue is, it looks like you're able to think visually: the film is so New 
York. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">JW: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Yeah. You get excited 
when you think, &quot;We can just put this on 6th Avenue!&quot; Or we can see the 
reservoir. We're both so in love with New York. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">HJ: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Also, our director 
[Charles Herman-Wurmfeld] and director of photography [Lawrence Sher] were a 
very visual team. We would all location scout, but they had a great sense 
together of how to frame, how to keep shots moving. We had a wonderful 
production designer [Charlotte Bourke]. The team was good, and complemented our 
work on the script. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">JW: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">For example, Jessica's 
apartment is my friend's, the one with the spiral staircase. They had all of 
these built-in shelves, with their books. And we had in the script that Jessica 
was kind of a &quot;quote person,&quot; and had all these quotes taped up on the walls, 
and I went there the night before, just to pepper the place with some of my 
personal things, and the production crew was there, unloading another 800 books 
on top of my friend's, so there were stacks of books everywhere. So then I 
thought, &quot;Yeah, maybe she is this cluttered and crazy,&quot; because she's kind of an 
extreme character. When I looked at the set, I thought, this is a world, more 
extreme than we had even written. I think we wrote, &quot;Cluttered but homey. Tons 
of books everywhere.&quot; And that became TONS OF BOOKS! And as an actor, it was so 
exciting to see our kernel of an idea exploded like that, to see our Slug Lines, 
or action lines, made real. And sometimes they came up with what seemed like the 
total opposite of what we had on the page, and we had to rewrite it on the set, 
or make it work. You figure it out as you go. </span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">CF: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">I'm wondering what you 
think about the question of representation, specifically of gayness or lesbians, 
on screen. Were you concerned with &quot;positive&quot; images? </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">JW: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">We found there's a lot 
of diversity within the gay community, who want to see different people and 
ideas represented. We wanted the film to be about individuals, not about groups. 
So, Helen's two gay friends have totally different angles on what she's doing: 
one is offended deeply, and the other thinks, &quot;Good for you, go girl.&quot; That sort 
of individuality is something we wanted to show. We didn't want a gay man to 
have a knee jerk response. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">HJ: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">And we wanted to get 
away from representing gay women as either butch or femme. But isn't that 
strange, that without labels, we get nervous? I think some people would say, 
&quot;Make a choice.&quot; But why should we have to? I hear about people who change jobs 
at 40, or at 60, it's never too late. We don't have a world that supports that.
</span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">JW: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">There's so much 
emphasis on labels, and we hope the film is about shedding labels. When you do, 
great things can happen. Whether you get your heart broken, whether it's messy 
or complicated, you're always going to live a fuller, deeper, richer life, which 
is what the Rilke quote speaks to. We feel like it's so oppressive, whatever box 
you put yourself in, whether it's &quot;I'm a Jew from Scarsdale,&quot; or &quot;a frustrated 
writer,&quot; like Josh [Scott Cohen]. Or Helen, &quot;I'm fine! I don't need anyone.&quot; All 
of these ways that we define ourselves become this myopic prison. We dare to 
say, &quot;What if we just drop that bullshit and let people explore their lives 
without necessarily knowing where the end is?&quot; Everyone asks if this is a 
straight film or a gay film. It's just a film. It's a people film. It was 
important to us to show different experiences within the film so that more 
people have more to identify with. Life is complicated. We don't have any 
answers; we just have kind of good questions. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">HJ: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">I think also with the 
subject of romantic love, if you go beyond it, and are operating out of a place 
of spiritual love, or original love, or whatever that thing is, if you're open 
to the world, I don't see why you can't love anybody. Or be in love with 
anybody. There is a biology to all of us, but actually loving someone -- this is 
what we get into in the film -- then where are you? What label can you use for 
that? Maybe that's the lesson: open yourself up to as much as possible. Life's 
short. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">JW: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Also, the people that 
we love, whether friends or romantic partners: it's hard to put into words why 
you love someone. It's &quot;that thing that that person does when his face goes like 
that&quot; or &quot;when she says it in that weird voice.&quot; </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">HJ: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">It's intuitive. </span>
</p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">JW: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">And the reverse, when 
we don't feel comfortable around someone. It's like, &quot;There's an energy about 
that person I don't like.&quot; We all become blithering idiots when we're describing 
why we like to be around somebody. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">HJ: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">This writer yesterday 
was raving about our chemistry together on screen, and I said, &quot;Why?&quot; Isn't it 
odd and mysterious? </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">JW: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">People want to 
rationalize. They want to say, &quot;Well, we have the same interests.&quot; </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">HJ: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">That's why we wanted 
the personal ad in the movie...</span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">JW: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">... the personal ad is 
the opposite end of that spectrum... </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">HJ: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">... here's my laundry

things I would like in a person... Anybody!? It's so contrived, it's ridiculous! 
Here's this graphic sexual thing you need to be interested in. And Japanese 
baths! And <i>this</i> philosopher. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">HJ: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">[laughs] Plus, a 
Mohawk! </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">JW: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">[laughs] People 
without Mohawks need <i>not</i> apply. People are crazy! I think the personal 
ads dates are a comment on where Jessica is at the top of the film, when she's 
too judgmental, and unable to open herself up to new things and new people. So 
she's got a laundry list. You don't have a Mohawk? Well, that's a deal-breaker! 
People do ask if we think we're men-bashing in the film with those bad dates. 
But we are seeing those dates from Jessica's point of view. But it's not so 
strange: we tend to say, &quot;Okay, just misused a word! Whooo-aww. Curtain down!&quot; 
There's something to that fast and furious categorizing that we do, that doesn't 
allow us to be surprised by people. </span></p>

<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">CF: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">And some language, 
like the Rilke, can bring you together. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">HJ: </span></i>

<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">JW: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">It's like that thing 
in Seinfeld's <i>SeinLanguage</i>, how it's hard to make friends in your 20s. 
When you're kids, anything can connect you: &quot;You like red bikes, I like red 
bikes, we can be best friends!&quot; Or, &quot;You're a girl, I'm a girl!&quot; [laughs] But 
when you get older, it's like, &quot;Sorry, all full up, not taking applications!&quot;&nbsp;

<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">HJ: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">That's why Zen 
scholars talk about keeping the beginner's mind as long as you can. If you can 
maintain that beginner's mind, you will see that red bike, or the thing that 
matters. The adult mind gets so active, so sophisticated, that it just gets in 
our way.</span></p>

<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">CF: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">And still, there are 
adults who can remain open, say, Judy [Tovah Feldshuh], Jessica's mother, who 
sees that her daughter is in love with Helen, even though Jessica thinks she's 
hiding it so well. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">JW: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">That was another thing 
that was important to us, as writers, that any bias that Jessica was dealing 
with, would be her own. That was a harder hurdle to leap, instead of, &quot;I can't 
do this because my parents won't understand.&quot; There's a lot of pressure from 
society, but that's an easy way to get out of things. If you're dealing with 
bias that's in you, that's a harder fight, or more interesting to us. </span>

structure, so that each character can have someone to &quot;share with,&quot; Helen with 
her friends and Jessica with her mother or her friend at the office? </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">HJ: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Yeah, they needed a 
place where they'd go and check in. Jessica comes from a strong family, and a 
Jewish family, and there's ritual there that provides structure, whereas Helen 
probably comes from Smalltown, USA, always felt a little bit different, with an 
artistic bent. And once she got to New York, that funky, downtown thing becomes 
her family. She feels more at home with those guys than with her own family.

<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">JW: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">That was the biggest 
transition from the play to the film, was making these women opposites. We 
thought, the more we can delineate them, the more interesting the comedy-drama 
will be when they come together. We struggled for that, for a long while, 
establishing their domains. </span></p>

<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">CF: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Does that have to do 
with comedy as a set of generic expectations? </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">HJ: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">There is definitely 
comedic tension there, but we wanted to explore the themes of the film from 
different vantage points. </span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">CF: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Was there ever a time 
when it wasn't a comedy? </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">JW: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">We wanted to use 
comedy to earn our poignant moments. It's hard to do relationship stories where 
they don't seem self-serious, or don't lose their audience. There's underlining: 
&quot;This is sentimental, don't you see? They're in love!&quot; I think life is peppered 
with humor and drama and pathos in equal parts, and in even in the worst times, 
there is always humor; otherwise, we wouldn't get out of bed in the morning. I 
mean, not only do we have Daniel Pearl, but [Andrea Yates], and that girl found 
this morning, burned and killed. I don't see how we could walk around the earth 
if we didn't have ways to make light of our own situation on the planet. It' 
like David Letterman paving the way after September 11th. We were all thinking, 
like, how can anyone ever come back to that format? And only Letterman could 
have like Giuliani and the firemen and Dan Rather. That was a great example of 
our resilience and need for humor. </span></p>

<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">CF: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Comedy is difficult to 
do, though. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">JW: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">There's that great 
quote, by somebody, that &quot;Dying is easy, comedy is hard.&quot; </span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">CF: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">You <i>are</i> Quote

<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">JW: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">I am! But it's true, 
in drama, you need to be present, but in comedy, people laugh or they don't. As 
actors, you have to play it so truthfully to get a laugh. You have to commit to 
it. Think of great comedians, just of our day, like Jim Carrey, as well as the 
three Stooges, or Abbott and Costello or Charlie Chaplin. People dismiss Jim 
Carrey, but there's a reason he gets paid $20 million. That guy does what nobody 
else can do. He can make a scene about a PEN! [This, in <i>Liar, Liar</i>.] He 
can make anyone laugh: I remember being on a plane, surrounded by people who 
didn't speak English, smiling from ear to ear. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">HJ: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">The other thing is, if 
you're in a stage production and you're not getting the laugh, people say play 
it totally straight, and that will often be what turns it. There's technical 
aspects, like timing, but it's about belief. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">JW: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">What's funny to us is 
that our movie gets what we call &quot;character laughs,&quot; as opposed to one-two-punch 
comedy. And I'm happy about that. It's my favorite kind of comedy. </span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">CF: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">You both also seem 
quite aware of audiences. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">HJ: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">That comes from 
theater, to an extent. But we both knew we wanted to reach as large a number of 
people as possible. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">JW: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">And the movie is, to 
us, about tolerance and inclusiveness. The more people we could appeal to, with 
universal themes, the better. We wanted to have gay people in it and straight 
people, and straight men who are not idiots and straight men who are idiots. And 
gay people with different opinions. So there's a little something for everyone. 
We find that certain art house films are great, but no one sees them, because 
they seem to be either marketed or made for one kind of audience. That's a 
shame. Why is it 2002 before you see a gay-themed mainstream film about two 
women? Whether our film will be that mainstream remains to be seen, but it's 
crazy that we're still waiting to see! </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">HJ: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">The marketing part of 
it remains the most tragic part, I think. The movie has to get out there, and 
the studio needs to position it. It's a process. </span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">CF: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">So festivals are where 
you start, for now. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">HJ: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Yes. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">JW: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">And word of mouth 
screenings are interesting for us: they find people in offices or in shopping 
malls and bring them to see the movie. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">HJ: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">And that's better, 
because at film festivals, viewers love films. At more random screenings, people 
have no idea what to expect. </span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">JW: </span></i>
</b><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">We always thought that 
we might alienate the far left and the far right with this subject matter, but 
if we could get everyone in between, it would be great. Part of delineating the 
characters in this way, having Jessica be someone who says, &quot;Yechh, lesbianism,&quot; 
at the beginning of the film, and then begging Helen not to leave her at the 
end, that's a wide jump for her. But it invites more conservative people to go 
along with her. That's the most exciting thing, in a way, if you can break down 
those biases. </span></p>
