            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In <i>The Country Bears</i>,
            five walking carpets with teeth are joined by a smaller, somewhat
            less threatening ambulatory ottoman to reunite the Country Bears
            Band and save Country Bear Hall from destruction.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Beary Barrington --
            &quot;Barry&quot; spelled with an &quot;ear,&quot; as in the
            &quot;Old German&quot; manner, according to his parents -- learns
            the truth from his spiteful older brother, Dex (Eli Marienthal),
            that, not only is Beary adopted, he was FOUND by his parents, in the
            woods (and Dex has the photos to prove it). An avid Country Bears
            fan, Beary (voiced by Haley Joel Osment) packs his backpack and
            leaves home for Country Bear Hall, where it doesn't matter whether
            you're &quot;different&quot; at all, only to discover that the place
            is on the verge of being repossessed, because of back mortgage
            payments ($20,000 worth), by heartless banker Reed Thimple
            (Christopher Walken -- yes, THAT Christopher Walken). So it's up to
            Beary to inspire the long-disbanded band members to get back
            together for a benefit concert, even if it means hauling the old
            tour bus out of storage from inside the barn and hitting the road,
            chickens and all. The running gag is that Dex Barrington is the only
            person in the movie who keeps pointing out that they're dealing with
            bears, here, and not people -- everyone else is blissfully unaware
            of the distinction -- while the Country Bears' music turns out to be
            greeted by the public with the same fond regard and warmth as that
            of the Eagles'. (In fact, Don Henley provides some of the musical
            vocals for the film, as does John Hiatt, who also wrote the original
            songs, and Bonnie Raitt.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The filmmakers have really tried to
            put forth their best efforts, here -- things are kept light and
            bouncy; the film's refusal to resort to vulgar humor is refreshing;
            little messages are tucked in about being &quot;different,&quot;
            finding one's &quot;higher purpose&quot; in life, the redemptive
            power of music, and the &quot;notes in the rafters&quot;
            (&quot;musical&quot; notes, that is); there's some rather good
            performances by, among others, Stephen Tobolowsky and Meagen Fay, as
            Dex and Beary's parents, and Diedrich Bader and Daryl
            &quot;Chill&quot; Mitchell, who play off each other with perfect
            comedic timing, as a pair of police officers; and lots of music and
            songs, including an impressive full-out production number featuring
            Jennifer Paige.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But there's just no getting around
            the fact that the Bears themselves are simply not very cuddly
            creatures to spend an hour and a half with. The animatronics used to
            bring them to life are highly elaborate, detailed, seamless, and
            even nuanced. The Bears are supposed to be down-home, comfy-cozy
            critters who chug down mugs of honey and scratch their furry tummies
            contentedly. From a distance, they also lumber along like real
            bears, which makes them no less threatening than real bears, either.
            In close-up, though, with their huge heads, eyes, and gaping mouths
            with teeth and fangs, they look positively terrifying, about as
            friendly as the creatures in a Godzilla film -- you keep expecting
            them to start scooping up people by the handful, like peanuts, and
            gobbling them down, while laying waste to downtown Tokyo. By the
            time the end credits started to roll, I was ready to bolt.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Then there's the un-bear-able waste
            of talent that marks Christopher Walken's performance.&nbsp; Walken
            acts completely unfazed over appearing in this picture as a
            caricature of a Disney villain -- all buffoonery and no real
            bite.&nbsp; Thimple's behavior is merely a series of over-the-top
            &quot;evil&quot; gestures that have long since been consigned to the
            &quot;threadbare&quot; category:&nbsp; he drives around in a car
            with a miniature wrecking ball as a hood ornament, and, in one
            scene, he amuses himself by placing a scale model of Country Bear
            Hall onto his office desktop, then drops a weight from above upon
            it. &quot;Oh, no! Country Bear Hall's been crunched!&quot; he says
            facetiously, then scoops the bits into a wastepaper basket, puts
            another scale model on his desktop, and does it all over again.
            Thimple is less <i>Snow White's </i>Evil Queen than Snidely
            Whiplash.&nbsp; Cruella De Vil would have used him as a doormat,
            covering him with enough high-heel marks to make the circuit between
            London and Hell Hall at least fifty times over.&nbsp; It's another
            reason to bolt.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"></o:p>
