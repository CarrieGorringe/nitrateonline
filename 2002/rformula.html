            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700">
            <font size="2">In Ronny Yu's mostly formulaic <i>Formula 51</i>, 
            Samuel L. Jackson plays Elmo McElroy, a chemical whiz busted for 
            smoking reefer on his graduation from pharmaceutical college in 
            1971. That this scene takes place under Buddy Miles' &quot;Them Changes&quot; 
            makes its banality slightly less irksome than it might have been. 
            But it's still irksome. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Cut to thirty 
            years later: declaring that he's invented the ideal party drug 
            (&quot;fifty-one times stronger than cocaine, fifty-one times more 
            hallucinogenic than acid, and fifty-one times more explosive than 
            ecstasy,&quot; using all over-the-counter ingredients), Elmo decides it's 
            time to abandon the drug cartel for whom he has been toiling since 
            his jail term (being a felon, he was unable to get legit 
            pharmaceutical work), and move on. This being an illegal and violent 
            business, he needs to exit in similar style, meaning, he blows up a 
            meeting of mucky-mucks, headed by The Lizard (Meat Loaf), the sort 
            of loutish egomaniac who refers to himself in the third person. Cue 
            spectacular explosion. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Elmo dons a 
            kilt, packs up his golf clubs, and boards a plane to &quot;Liver-f*cking-pool,&quot; 
            planning to sell his new product to some dealer, any dealer, 
            servicing the rave scene. All those kids, dying to get high: just 
            what he needs to make his fortune. Once in England, he meets up with 
            Felix (Robert Carlyle), chirpy henchman for local kingpin Leopold 
            Durant (Ricky Tomlinson), with whom he's scheduled to sign a $20 
            million deal. What Elmo doesn't know but is about to find out is 
            that he's being followed by an assassin, Dakota (Emily Mortimer, so 
            great in <i>Lovely &amp; Amazing</i>, so bereft of a role here); she's 
            been dispatched by The Lizard, who survived the explosion after all.
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Just before 
            Dakota's about to complete her mission, however, The Lizard gets the 
            bright idea that he wants Elmo's formula (deemed a &quot;personal visit 
            from God&quot;), so her new mission is to keep him alive and kill 
            everyone around him. This, she proceeds to do, sniping at her prey 
            with an automatic weapon from a hotel room across the street. Cue 
            spectacular gunfire and flailing bodies. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The only 
            survivors of this assault are Elmo and Felix, who, it turns out, is 
            Dakota's mournfully torch-carrying ex (the back story is sketchy, 
            but apparently, she left him to seek her own fortune in the States, 
            and hit it big in the execution business). Perhaps to ensure that he 
            remembers her, she uses the occasion of the assault to shoot Felix 
            in the arse, which bothers him for about ten minutes, during the 
            requisite car chase, Elmo driving like a madman through teeny 
            streets, cops charging along behind them, smashing into trucks and 
            buses and such. When they stop for a breath, Felix confesses his 
            undying love for this chick with the large gun: &quot;She's your guardian 
            angel,&quot; he tells Elmo. &quot;If she wanted you to be dead, you'd be 
            dead.&quot; Elmo starts hitting balls off the back of the garbage barge 
            where they've crash-landed off the pier. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">At this point, 
            you might be forgiven for thinking that maybe executive producer 
            Jackson wanted to spend some time in U.K to play golf, and arranged 
            a movie around his much-deserved vacation (is there a harder-working 
            man in the business?). The film is coy about why he's wearing the 
            kilt, though Elmo's last/slave-name, McElroy, rather gives a clue: 
            he's headed to the McElroy castle, hopefully with enough money to 
            buy the land and so, make some kind of statement about property and 
            birthright and reclaiming a sense of agency and dignity from the 
            system that oppressed his ancestors. While this joining up with the 
            oppressive class doesn't obviously make up for generations of wrongs 
            done to populations, Elmo's attitude seems much improved by owning 
            the name that once marked the fact that his people were owned.
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">This is a 
            potentially fascinating, even rousing story, even expanded by Poon 
            Hang Sang's creative camerawork and funky soundtrack beats by the 
            Headrillaz. But it is also remarkably muddied and depressingly 
            decelerated by the hijinksy plotline. For one thing, Jackson lapses 
            into the boomy speechifying that has become his signature (curse 
            Quentin Tarantino for writing that frankly brilliant &quot;when I lay my 
            vengeance upon you&quot; speech, as Jackson's been asked to repeat those 
            rhythms ever since). One eager listener is self-loving club overseer 
            Iki (Rhys Ifans), replacement buyer for dead Durant, made to look 
            silly because he wears colorful outfits and seeks instruction on 
            mediation from the &quot;comically&quot; fey Omar (Ade). Goofy and 
            enthusiastic, Iki pledges his allegiance to Elmo, whom he sees as a 
            fellow &quot;sky-high-atrist,&quot; adding, so endearingly, &quot;I'm very much 
            attracted by what you have to offer.&quot; </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">If only he 
            knew. While it's not particularly visible to Iki's doofus-eye, Elmo 
            does have a bit of a chip on his shoulder, and well he should. 
            Throughout <i>Formula 51</i>, he's dealing not only with 
            run-of-the-mill idiots, but also punks and bigots, though his 
            creative bits of vengeance tend to elicit groans as much as cheers 
            (he tricks a crew of bungling skinheads into downing handfuls of 
            pills that don't make them high, as promised, but make them puke 
            blood and sh*t their pants; feeling dominant, he tosses toilet paper 
            rolls at them: how clever). </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Boisterous and 
            obnoxious as it is, such body-fluids humor looks almost progressive 
            compared to the ostensibly &quot;good&quot; work Elmo performs. Under the 
            guise of bonding with his brand new boy Felix, he suffers a series 
            of black-penis jokes, and worse, he watches over Felix and Dakota's 
            re-ignited romance. Enough with the helpful black buddy, already.</font></span></td>
