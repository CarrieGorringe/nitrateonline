A Conversation with Phil Alden Robinson</font><font face="Verdana" size="6"><br>
</font><i><font size="1" face="Verdana">interview by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan 
Lybarger</a>, 
31 May 2002</font></i></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Phil Alden Robinson would seem an odd choice 
to direct an adaptation of Tom Clancy's pro-establishment espionage thriller <i>
The Sum of All Fears</i>. In his last theatrical movie, <i>Sneakers</i>, his 
computer hacker heroes bankrupt the Republican Party. He also wrote the Steve 
Martin comedy <i>All of Me</i> and adapted and directed the baseball fantasy <i>
Field of Dreams</i> (earning a Best Adapted Screenplay Academy Award 
nomination), all of which were far lighter in tone than his present offering.
</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That's not to say he can't handle weighty 
subjects. In addition to being a former broadcast journalist, he helmed the 
debut episode of the HBO World War II drama <i>Band of </i>Brothers and won a 
Writers Guild of America WGA TV award for co-writing the script for the TNT 
civil rights drama <i>Freedom Song</i>, which he also directed<i>.</i> </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>The Sum of All Fears </i>features Ben 
Affleck (<i>Changing Lanes</i>) as Clancy's heroic spy Jack Ryan. Affleck is 
taking the formidable role after Alec Baldwin and Harrison Ford have each made 
their mark with the character. In this outing, a much younger Ryan tries to 
discover why Russian nuclear scientists have turned up missing. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like his constantly stressed hero, Robinson has 
not had much of a break lately. After completing the grueling schedule of 
post-production on the film, Robinson arrived in Kansas City for a roundtable 
interview as part of whistle stop tour to plug <i>The Sum of All Fears</i>. 
Despite the fact that his flight had arrived at three a.m. that morning, 
Robinson seemed not only alert but eager to talk about making a movie that only 
a short time ago might have been dismissed as a paranoid fantasy.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Dan Lybarger:</b> How long have you been 
with this project?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Phil Alden Robinson:</b> I actually came on 
late. I came on in August or September of 2000. Ben [Affleck] was already on 
board. They had been trying to develop this for a long time.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>DL:</b> Having the younger Ben Affleck as 
Jack Ryan is really interesting change because he's in over his head.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>PAR:</b> That's the key to the whole 
franchise to me. There's a moment in the first film, <i>The Hunt for Red October</i>, 
that I used when I went to the studio. I said, &quot;Here's what this ought to be. 
You remember Alec Baldwin dangling from a helicopter in a storm in the North 
Atlantic banging against the submarine saying, 'I should have sent a memo.' 
Let's make <i>that</i> movie.&quot; [laughs].</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I was always trying to make [Jack Ryan] in over 
his head. That's why he's awkward when he meets the boss (Morgan Freeman). The 
first time he meets Morgan, &nbsp;he [Freeman] comments on his [Ryan's] clothes. The 
second time, they're together on the airplane, Ben is all dressed up, and 
Morgan's dressed casually. I always wanted to show [Ryan] not quite being in 
step. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That's part of the fun of having the guy be 
young. Let's embrace the fact that he's young. Let him have a girlfriend instead 
of a wife. He hasn't told his girlfriend where he works [the CIA]. We really had 
some fun with that stuff. By the time the action happens, you think, &quot;This is 
not your average action hero.&quot; This is a guy you worry about getting into a 
fight. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The studio, in a really smart decision, said 
let's not try to get some pale imitation of Harrison [Ford] be cause he won't do 
as well as Harrison. Ford did a great version of that Jack Ryan. Also, in the 
books, Jack Ryan is not only getting older, but he's getting higher up in the 
bureaucracy and becomes President in the next book or two. How many action films 
can you make with that guy?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As a result of this film, I think the next 
Clancy book is going to be about a young Jack Ryan. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With this film, we just decided to say screw 
the timeline and pretend that the other films didn't exist. We set in current 
day, and he's twenty-eight years old. It really threw a lot of people on-line. 
I'm sure you remember.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>DL: </b>Yeah, because Jeffrey Wells's column 
at
<a href="http://www.reel.com/" style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" target="_top">
www.reel.com</a> was initially critical. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>PAR: </b>Did you read his subsequent column? 
That was the best example. Wells was completely opposed till he read the script 
and saw what our plan was. Just last week, on <i>Ain't It Cool News</i>,<i> </i>
Harry Knowles and one of the other regulars gave the raves of all times. </font>
</p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>DL:</b> This seems in tone a one-eighty 
degree turn from <i>Sneakers</i>. If Affleck makes too many mistakes, millions 
could die.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>PAR: </b>The<b> </b>stakes are much higher 
in this, and it's a more of a real-world movie. <i>Sneakers </i>is by its nature 
a caper film, which is as much about movies as it is about the real world. <i>
The Sum of All Fears </i>was always intended to be about the world we live in.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>DL:</b> Speaking of the real world, has this 
movie been delayed because of 9-11?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>PAR: </b>It was always intended to come out 
(now). In fact, when I came on board in August of 2000, they said, &quot;This is a 
Summer-of-2002 picture.&quot; </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>DL: </b>There are some jokes reminiscent of 
your earlier movies like <i>In the Mood</i>, particularly the not-too-subtle 
potshots at Boris Yeltsin. How did you balance the humor with the serious nature 
of the material?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>PAR: </b>I've always been a firm believer 
that movies should be funnier than you think they're going to be. You have to 
when laughter will be appropriate. In this case, that's the first half of the 
film. If the humor is honest and comes <i>from</i> character, I think you're 
O.K. We had really adept actors. [The humor] was in the script. Paul Attanasio 
and Dan Pyne wrote a great script. As long as you're being true, you can't go 
wrong. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the editing room, we cut a bit out of the 
last half because I thought there were one too many [jokes]. It's a balancing 
act.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>DL: </b>You have Baltimore blown to bits, 
but…</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>PAR:</b> It's actually a very small part of 
the outskirts of Baltimore. Baltimore survives. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>DL: </b>With a lot of films on this subject, 
like <i>The Day After</i> and others, the filmmakers would have concentrated on 
the destruction, whereas you trusted your audience to interpret from a few 
scenes and spent more time chasing the villains. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>PAR: </b>The movie for me was always more 
about the response to terrorism, not about the terrorism [itself]. When we first 
started talking it, I said there's a real restraint shown in depicting violence. 
I don't have the need as a filmgoer to see it up close and as a filmmaker I have 
even less of a need to show it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I don't want to show the football stadium 
disappearing a blinding flash or a fireball or a mushroom cloud. I want to see 
the shockwave miles away as it affects characters we've got to know. We'll refer 
to the damage, but we did it in long shots. We were very careful to show the 
[nuclear] cloud on one side of the background, and there's lots of tall 
buildings on the other side. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That shot with the football stadium is actually 
a CGI (computer generated image) in a real aerial shot of Baltimore. We put it 
as far away from downtown Baltimore as we could. Then we put a voiceover of a TV 
announcer saying the blast radius was about a quarter of a mile. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As you said, the audience has to connect some 
of the dots. The big question was how do you show it? I just thought a little of 
that stuff goes a long, long way. We're asking the audience to take kind of a 
difficult concept. Let's not rub their noses in gore. We don't show anybody dead 
in the blast. We see the aftermath in a wide shot.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>DL:</b> Did you avoid using real NFL team 
names during the football scenes intentionally?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>PAR:</b> It was intentional on the NFL's 
part.&nbsp; They have a policy [against it]. I think Oliver [Stone] wasn't able to 
use team names either. It didn't have to do with the content of our film. They 
just have a blanket policy. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In fact, I wanted to get a star to sing the 
National Anthem, a real famous person. The studio said, &quot;Please don't do that. 
It'll be too close to reality.&quot; At the time I thought, &quot;Oh, come on! I want Ray 
Charles, or somebody like that.&quot; They said, &quot;No. You can't kill Ray Charles!&quot; 
You know, in the end, I think they were probably right.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>DL: </b>When Stanley Kubrick was making <i>
Dr. Strangelove</i>, he said he was bothered by the way that in other people's 
movies, world leaders have cool heads when nuclear crises occur, so his leaders 
were quite nervous. The leaders in your movie are equally stressed. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>PAR:</b> And if they're not calm, they're 
distraught in a focused way. Kubrick is the best who ever lived.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I have to believe that's what goes on behind 
closed doors. Once in a while, the President's emotions must get the best of 
him. Clancy once said, &quot;If you put the leaders of a country in a room and tell 
them the decisions they make might lead to blowing up the world, only a 
sociopath would not have an emotional reaction.&quot; The most reasonable people in 
the world, by virtue of their reason, are going to be emotional and distraught 
and kind of at wit's end at some point. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I thought, &quot;I've never seen that in a movie.&quot; 
We really worked hard on that. For the first scene where the President is 
getting on Air Force One, I said to the cast, &quot;I'm not going to give you marks. 
I'm not going to tell you where to go. You just get on the plane and find your 
own place. Don't wait for the previous guy to start his line. Step on the line 
before he finishes. If somebody is stepping on your line, talk over them.&quot; I 
said to the camera operators, &quot;Don't watch the rehearsals.&quot; For every take that 
we did, I moved the camera operators into different positions, so that they 
never fell into a routine of, &quot;If this guy moves here, I can swing here.&quot; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the middle of the rehearsals, I wanted to 
see how intense the chaos was, and it was pretty good. Ron Rifkin, who was 
playing the Secretary of State, stopped doing his lines and said, &quot;I can't get 
this f*cking chair to open!&quot; I said, &quot;Ron, that is great!&quot; He said, &quot;No, I'm 
sorry.&quot; I said, &quot;No, don't bother. Use it. Do it in every take.&quot; You never see 
that in a movie, in the middle of a serious discussion of nuclear war, where 
someone is frustrated by the chair. That was the most honest thing. We were 
really for all of that kind of reality.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At the first test screening, in the focus 
group, some people in the audience didn't like that scene. The facilitator asked 
them why not. They said, &quot;The President is nervous, and we want him to remain 
calm.&quot; It wasn't that they didn't like the scene. They just didn't like the 
thought that these guys are human. It scared them. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>DL:</b> Have you met with Clancy?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>PAR: </b>I still haven't met with him. I 
talked with him on the phone several times at great length. He was very generous 
with his time, and he can <i>talk</i>. He knows a lot of things about a lot of 
things.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">He had some suggestions and some criticisms, 
and we did a bunch of them. I'm going to meet him in two weeks. We're going to 
be watching the premiere in Washington.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ben actually went down to see him. He flew down 
to Baltimore when he was offered the job to go talk to Clancy, to get his 
blessing, to ask about Jack Ryan and to get Clancy's advice. They hit it off 
pretty well.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>DL: </b>The characters seem a bit more human 
than the ones in the Bond flicks.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>PAR:</b> I think these things—I don't mean 
the Clancy films, I mean action films—aren't usually smart. They're usually not 
about interesting characters, so when you give the audience that, there's 
something great about that. The audience is always smarter than we give them 
credit for. They're always more capable of assimilating complex thoughts. </font>
</p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>DL:</b> What do you think of the trailer? 
Doesn't it give away a bit too much?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>PAR:</b> [Sighs and shrugs his shoulders] I 
lost the argument. I asked them not to show any [of those scenes] in the 
trailer, and they actually precede those shots with the lines [that give away 
the story], which just drove me crazy. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's a very, very, very capable marketing 
department. They know what they're doing. My problem is that I think it affects 
the experience of seeing the movie. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The example they kept giving me was, &quot;That shot 
of the tidal wave in <i>Deep Impact</i> hitting New York really drove them into 
the theater.&quot; It gave away that surprise. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>DL:</b> That could be a problem, too because 
your movie isn't promising the Apocalypse on screen.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>PAR:</b> I like the marketing people; 
they're nice to be around. But I didn't like the poster [which features Affleck 
and Freeman's faces and a row of nuclear missiles]. I thought it was a very good 
poster if you just want to get in teenage boys. It says to me, &quot;If you like war, 
you'll like this movie.&quot; In fact, it's a film that says, &quot;If you don't like war, 
you'll think this is a good movie because it's about stopping a war.&quot;</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>DL:</b> Do you think there's room for a 
movie like this after 9-11 and considering the popularity of <i>Spider-Man </i>
and the new <i>Star Wars</i> episode?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>PAR: </b>I think there's a film like this 
for a couple of reasons: Because the film is really about the response to 
terrorism, and the second message of the film is that you don't rush headlong 
into violence. You get the information, and then you do it in a focused, 
multilateral way. You get all the nations involved. When we designed that 
message, it was a year before September 11<sup>th</sup>. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We screened the film so much after September 11<sup>th</sup>. 
Overwhelmingly, we kept hearing how grateful they were that it was restrained 
and that it had a positive, life-affirming message. They liked the fact that it 
was a real-world story. A year ago, this would have been a popcorn movie. Today, 
it's drama, and they appreciate this.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>DL: </b>The tone of the new film seems far 
different from movies like <i>All of Me</i>, <i>Field of Dreams</i> and <i>
Sneakers</i>.<i> </i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>PAR: </b>Part of that is my desire not to 
repeat myself. Part of [not repeating] is that it keeps <i>me</i> interested in 
the process. If I'm trying something I haven't done before, I feel challenged, 
and I don't get complacent. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There is, I have discovered, a common thread in 
all of them. They're all about a young man trying to grow up. I'll leave for you 
to decide what that says about me [Grins].</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Even <i>Freedom Song </i>is about that, and the
<i>Band of Brothers</i> episode [I directed] is about that. I've actually 
wondered, &quot;What if they had offered me the Harrison Ford version [of <i>The Sum 
of All Fears</i>], which wouldn't have had that element in it?&quot; Thematically, I 
don't think it would have appealed to me as much. It wouldn't have resonated as 
much. </font></p>
