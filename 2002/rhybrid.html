            review by <a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>, 2 November 2002</i></font><p>
            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Able to leap tall corn stalks in a 
            single bound, <i>Hybrid</i> had earned a bushel of recognition from 
            a host of film festivals (Slamdance, San Francisco, Atlanta, 
            Newport, et al), and has been welcomed in numerous cities. 
            Unfortunately for local arthouse filmgoers in my neck of the woods, 
            Washington, DC, has not been one of them. Yes, it's an eccentric 
            piece, starting out with ragged, scratchy silent footage overlaid 
            with the ruminations of director Monteith McCollum's grandfather, 
            Milford Beeghly, an Iowa farmer who believes his seeds of peace -- 
            those which grow into a golden hybrid corn -- can save the earth and 
            its starving millions from the war and anarchy that generally 
            accompany such hunger.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Notwithstanding it's political 
            implications, the film's inventive, non-conventional, and often 
            animated styling (briefly using a shot-through-burlap approach I 
            last saw on a film from 1927) is an absorbing quiltwork of 
            black-and-white images edited together by Ariana Gerstein, an 
            experimental filmmaker and collage artist, with McCollum juxtaposing 
            stark, grainy time-lapsed, landscapes with his ancestors' voices on 
            the soundtrack. These voicings, some made years earlier, sound very 
            much like private radio broadcasts about the family and its 
            sometimes unusual relationships. In one instance, sandwiched between 
            a Japanese beetle struggling to right itself and a worm squirming 
            through the soil is heard (presumably from the director himself), 
            &quot;Would you say he was closer to corn than his family?&quot; Milford's 
            daughter quickly, yet ruefully answers the interviewer &quot;Oh 
            definitely. That was his whole life.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">McCollum's hypnotic imagery is 
            enlightened by his own score, an improvised blend of violin, viola, 
            squeeze box, zither, and percussion that heighten the intended dour, 
            melancholic air.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Of course in a film all about corn 
            there is bound to be some corny material, like a 1950s television 
            commercial promoting the high-yield, disease-resistant, trademarked 
            Beeghley's Best Hybrid seed, in which the bespectacled Wilford 
            happens to drop in (he was in the neighborhood) to promote his 
            product. To keep the action interesting, there's even some sex 
            tossed in! In discussing the mating habits of corn, we learn that 
            eating corn on the cob is the equivalent of eating fertilized corn 
            ovaries. Gives a new meaning to the concept of oral sex, eh? And get 
            this: Corn has a tendency to play with itself! What next, corn 
            orgies? (Yup.) This can get more confusing than 12th grade physics.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Which leads to more about the 
            interesting life of Wilford, his determination and sanity. His son 
            talks of dad hiding his hybrid attempts behind the family barn 
            (wherein the director shows two ears of corn rubbing up against each 
            other on the earthen floor) for fear of ridicule. Yet, through hail, 
            drought, the slow recovery from the Great Depression, and other 
            discouragements in the 1930s, the pioneer persisted and succeeded.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Two of Wilford's three children go 
            on camera extensively. That Wilford and his three brothers were 
            generally a laconic bunch, keeping their comments to a minimum, 
            exacerbated Wilford's emotional distancing from his wife. That a 
            daughter, still in therapy, didn't really get to know her 
            well-traveled, constantly-on-the-road, closed-lipped father until 
            well into her 40s.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The family's oddities are as 
            obvious as an old family photo of Wilford, as a child, dressed as a 
            girl (because his mother had wanted a daughter and apparently called 
            him Mildred), his long curly hair caressing his shoulders, covered 
            by a white lacy frock. They're curious about all the pointed 
            questions, in much the way Alan Berliner's father was in that 
            filmmaker's family history documentary <i>Nobody's Business</i>, 
            although the subjects here are much more gracious with their time.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As the 92-minute film starts its 
            second third, the filmmaker chronicles the early days of 
            hybridization. In this short, kinetic segment, using extensive 
            animation of corn kernels and other objects over still photographs, 
            we overhear Wilford's lecture on inbreeding. This soon evolves into 
            a brief history of the family business (which closed in 1974), 
            focusing on the weathered faces of the workers and the ghostly 
            images of past profitability.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Then there are those lovely little 
            promotional items that businesses offer their salesmen and best 
            customers. Milford's son showcases a push-down toothpick dispenser 
            -- Milford having always picked but never brushed -- that looks 
            strikingly like a sexual aid. Or Milford's expertise as a champion 
            hog-caller. And yes, there's also a corn striptease. Ah the things 
            you can find to entertain yourself in the American Midwest are 
            indeed varied.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A highly unusual hayride through 
            the cornfields of old, <i>Hybrid</i> showcases the odd and eccentric 
            relics of a past culled from a family scrapbook filled barnyard 
            cobwebs and the echoes of mislaid affections. Milford, shown 
            silently suffering in his sickbed as he approached his 100th 
            birthday, passed away in January 2001, just shy of his 103rd. Quite 
            a fighter. With <i>Hybrid</i>, grandson/director
            <span style="color:black">McCollum</span> insures that his granddad 
            will always be with us, clad in his overalls and a 
            corporate-embossed hat, at play in the cornfields of the lord. 
            That's just outside of Pierson, Iowa.</font></td>
