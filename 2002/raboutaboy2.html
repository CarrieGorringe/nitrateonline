            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In <i>About a Boy</i>, Hugh
            Grant plays Will, who has settled into a comfortable, independent
            (his father is the composer of an execrable Christmas song which has
            become a standard), sluggish and self-absorbed life of late-thirties
            singlehood, enjoying his creature comforts while dating women with
            whom he can, when the time comes, break-up with easily without
            hurting their feelings too much.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Along comes Marcus (Nicholas Hoult),
            an eleven-year-old whose single mother, Fiona (Toni Collette), keeps
            going to pieces all the time. Figuring that the two of them need
            some help, he assesses Will and decides to target him as a potential
            father figure, starting off by resolutely ringing Will's doorbell
            every day to spend an hour watching television with him. Marcus
            figures that, sooner or later, he'll wear will down, and he does --
            Will initially starts putting up with Marcus' intrusions into his
            life with a resigned air, but, later, finds himself, much to his
            surprise, caring about what happens to the kid.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As potentially precocious as this
            set-up sound, the movie, fortunately, never succumbs to it. In fact,
            it turns out to be pretty well constructed and conceived, including
            the point, halfway through the picture, where the situation of an
            older man having a young boy visiting his house every day on a
            regular basis is called sharply into question -- Will finds himself
            admitting that not only does he have a genuine emotional investment
            in Marcus, but that it's entirely paternal, and this revelation
            causes him to make an honest accounting of the other areas in his
            life. The film was directed, in London, by the Weitz brothers, Paul
            and Chris, from a screenplay they adapted with Peter Hedges from a
            Nick Hornby novel, and they show a certain verve in the way they
            made this film that you wouldn't have particularly expected after
            having seen their previous <i>American Pie</i> films. Not only does
            the picture have an authentic feel in terms of its characters and
            settings, but the story is fully nuanced, as well.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Wearing the standard
            easy-to-launder uniform of the modern-day male (T-shirts and jeans,
            pop them into the wash, they don't need any pressing), and sporting
            what looks like the beginnings of a pot belly in some scenes (Will
            has devoted a regular allotment of &quot;units&quot; in his day to
            watching television, but I may be wrong about the pudge, as his neck
            and shoulders, in some shots, look like they've been down to the gym
            a few times), Hugh Grant is essentially too quick and debonair an
            actor to be totally convincing as a man who is gradually going to
            seed, but his skills as a performer bring Will's sly
            self-observations fully to life, along with the moments of blind
            terror that flash across his face and eyes as he realizes he's
            stepping into territory that is outside of what he has so carefully
            circumscribed for himself in life, and that he's doing so in such an
            irresistible manner that he may never get back to the same, comfy
            way of living that he has made himself so accustomed to. Grant's
            performance is matched fully by that of Nicholas Hoult, who has
            eyebrows that curve up like lines in a Hirschfeld drawing and keep
            his face from becoming too cherubic. Hoult performs very well,
            whether he's showing how Marcus draws his defenses up to get through
            the gauntlet of schoolyard bullying, trying to figure out how to
            approach a girl whom he's grown sweet on, or the way he calls upon
            the scruples he's developed<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>that
            are a part of the self-reliance he's had thrust upon him early in
            life. However, when he sings &quot;Killing Me Softly With His
            Song&quot; at the piano with Fiona, while an increasingly
            incredulous Will looks on, you can see how this is one of the things
            that Marcus and his mother share in such a way that it keeps them
            bonded as tightly as a mother and son can be.<o:p>

            opened shortly after the new <i>Star Wars</i> movie, and it was
            probably a good piece of positioning. If I were twenty years
            younger, I'd probably be crazy over the <i>Star Wars</i> and <i>Spider-Man</i>
            flicks right now, but I've found my tastes have changed, and I just
            haven't been running out to see the franchise films, lately. They
            stand like edifices, indifferent, taking the moviegoers' money, but
            it doesn't seem to make any difference whether you see them or not.
            Where's something with some human drama? While I will stop short of
            going completely off my head and proclaiming <i>About a Boy</i> to
            be the best thing that happened since sliced bread, I will say that
            it gave me the gratifying feeling, afterward, that it was worth my
            while to go out and see it on the big screen. That's what you hope
            to get from a movie, and that's what keeps us going back to them.</font></p>
