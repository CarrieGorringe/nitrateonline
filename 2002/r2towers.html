            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>With <i>The Fellowship of the
            Ring</i>, director Peter Jackson (who has come a long way from his
            horror-tinged comedies <i>Bad </i>Taste and <i>Meet the Feebles</i>)
            and a slew of talented collaborators have managed to make J.R.R.
            Tolkien's dense fantasy trilogy <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>
            eloquently cinematic. Now that Jackson has established his
            make-believe world, he can have fun with it. Unburdened by the
            exposition of the first installment, <i>The Lord of the Rings: The
            Two Towers</i> moves at a breathless pace and gives the characters
            room to grow. If you haven't seen <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i>
            in a while, you might want to watch it again, particularly in the
            new expanded cut that has just come out on video. Jackson leaps
            immediately into the new tale without stopping to explain.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In order to prevent the physically
            dead but spiritually potent lord Sauron from regaining control of
            Middle Earth, there are three separate developments that could
            maintain freedom and destroy the ring that gave and continues to
            give him power. The reluctant Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) is still
            carrying the ring around his neck and is desperately trying to make
            it to Mt. Doom so that he can destroy the evil jewelry. The task is
            Herculean because the ring has an addictive quality that taunts
            Frodo and tempts others who don't comprehend its lethal potency. He
            and his hobbit-in-arms Sam (Sean Astin) have an additional obstacle
            because their guide is a delusional, vindictive creature named
            Gollum (voice by Andy Serkis) who used to own the ring (&quot;my
            precious,&quot; he keeps whispering) and now eagerly wants it back
            even if it costs Frodo and Sam their lives.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meanwhile the prankster hobbits
            Merry and Pippin (Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd) have escaped from
            their Orc captors only to fall into the hands of an Ent named
            Treebeard (voice by John Rhys-Davies). It's an appropriate moniker
            because he and his fellow Ents look like the tall vegetation they
            cultivate and protect. Treebeard and his cohorts too busy trying to
            decide if Merry and Pippin are the destructive Orcs instead of
            trying to return the duo to their comrades. Their friends in the
            recently dissolved fellowship—dwarf Gimil (Rhys-Davies again), elf
            marksman Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and human ranger Aragorn (Viggo
            Mortensen)—have issues of their own to resolve. On their way to
            rescue Merry and Pippin, the trio discovers that the important
            kingdom of Rohan is about to be overrun by orcs led by Sauron's
            chief disciple Sarumon (eternal bad boy Christopher Lee). Rohan's
            troops are greatly outnumbered by the orcs, and a treacherous
            courtier (Brad Dourif) is giving the king bad advice. It doesn't
            help that the king (Bernard Hill) is under a spell that dulls his
            senses and ages him. Thanks to a surprise reappearance by the noble
            wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), who didn't really die in a mineshaft
            as was thought to in <i>The Fellowship of the Ring</i>, the odds
            don't seem quite so hopeless.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jackson and his cowriters Fran
            Walsh, Philippa Boyens and Stephen Sinclair miraculously handle all
            of these story strands without getting them tangled. Jackson and his
            cohorts provide the briefest of explanations to Tolkien's intricate
            world during three-hour running time. There is such a sense of
            commitment and detail that blinking during a quick plot point makes
            a viewer fell lost for only a second.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>This meticulousness pays off handsomely with Gollum. For a
            computer-generated image, he looks remarkably lifelike and is
            fantastically expressive. He gives the human performers a run for
            their money. The scene where he literally debates with himself over
            whether to kill Frodo and Sam (a la <i>A Beautiful Mind</i>) is
            suitably creepy.<i> </i>Careful viewers will notice how his
            mannerisms and Frodo's will look more and more similar as the movie
            progresses. The final battle scenes have a jaw-dropping vastness
            that would make Cecil B. DeMille proud. It really does look as if
            10,000 Orcs are coming to take no prisoners. While many of these
            images dazzle, Jackson thankfully places as much of his energy in
            the way the characters develop as he does on the special effects.
            It's a pleasure to see Merry and Pippin mature from being likable
            but annoying goofballs into full-fledged heroes. The sad-eyed Wood,
            who was born to play the tormented protagonist, gives his
            computerized co-star a worthy counterpoint.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now that viewers have had a chance
            to get oriented, <i>The Two Towers</i> is much faster than its
            predecessor, and the humor more focused and appropriate.
            Unfortunately, like its predecessor, it disappoints its viewers by
            making them wait yet another year for a resolution. It's a shame
            more recent films can't let us down in such a thrilling and
            enchanting manner.</font></p>
