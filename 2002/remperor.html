            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The makers of <i>The Emperor's Club</i> 
            can't be faulted for taking the task of adapting Ethan Canin's short 
            story <i>The Palace Thief</i> lightly. They've recruited a 
            formidable cast and deserve some praise for trying to tackle moral 
            dilemmas. It's also refreshing to see a film that lauds erudition 
            instead of mocking it. Still, <i>The Emperor's Club</i> frequently 
            drones on like a stodgy lecturer whose passion for a subject never 
            trickles down to the students. Feeling longer than its actual 109 
            minutes, the movie might have benefited from emphasizing its 
            characters over platitudes.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In some ways these priorities are 
            fitting because <i>The Emperor's Club</i> centers on William Hundert 
            (Kevin Kline, <i>My Life as a House</i>), a Western Civilization 
            teacher who can make previously indifferent teenage boys care about 
            the reigns of long dead Roman emperors. His blend of fussiness and 
            compassion wins over all of the lads in his class at the prestigious 
            St. Benedict's school except for one. Sedgewick Bell (played with 
            appropriate swagger by Emile Hirsch from <i>The Dangerous Lives of 
            Altar Boys</i>) is the son of a West Virginia senator and a 
            disruptive brat. When he isn't trying to make up for his lack of 
            studying by tossing off rude wisecracks, Sedgewick is leading the 
            rest of the lads into antics that could get them expelled.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Fortunately, there's the annual St. 
            Benedict's &quot;Mr. Julius Caesar&quot; competition, where the boys try to 
            outdo each other in how well they remember Roman history. Sedgewick 
            demonstrates a curiously unprecedented aptitude, and Mr. Hundert 
            takes unusual steps to encourage his student. He secretly alters 
            grades to keep Sedgewick on the straight and narrow. Mr. Hundert 
            learns to regret his decision when Sedgewick's newfound initiative 
            proves to be less than genuine. It takes <i>The Emperor's Club</i> 
            an inordinate amount of time to get to this point, and much of what 
            follows seems a bit anticlimactic. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Many times screenwriters toil to 
            strip down a work of fiction to where it fits comfortably into two 
            hours. With <i>The Palace Thief</i>, director Michael Hoffman (<i>One 
            Fine Day</i>) and screenwriter Neil Tolkin (the author of such 
            august fare as <i>Jury Duty</i> and <i>Richie Rich</i>) have to 
            augment Canin's short, internal narrative filmable.&nbsp; Their additions 
            bring little to the story and often slow down its more potent 
            aspects. In the movie but not in the story, Mr. Hundert pines after 
            a colleague's wife (Embeth Davidtz), but decorum and his own 
            standards prevent him from acting on his longings. All the scenes 
            that Kline and Davidtz share do little but remind the audience that 
            Hundert isn't gay. Similarly, the sequence where the lads discover a 
            girl's school literally across the pond kills time instead of 
            maximizing it.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hoffman and Tolkin kept none of the 
            subtleties of the short story. With the subject matter in Hundert's 
            classroom might lead both the teacher and the pupils to speak as if 
            they were reciting Socratic dialogs, <i>The Emperor's Club</i> would 
            have been more satisfying if Hoffman had allowed Kline to explore 
            Mr. Hundert through the character's actions instead of constant 
            pontification and a dull voiceover that occasionally borrows from 
            Canin's prose. Without the embellishments, the final reunion between 
            Mr. Hundert and his now-grown students would have been more 
            involving. Instead, it looks as artificial and obvious as Kline's 
            old-age makeup.</font></td>
