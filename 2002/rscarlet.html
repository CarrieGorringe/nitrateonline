            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">She can't even stop to get a cuppa 
            coffee! In the volcanic <i>Scarlet Diva</i>, Asia Argento plays Anna 
            Battista, an international star who, at one moment, is picking up an 
            award for Best Actress (the <i>Amarpolo d'or</i>), the next she's 
            fleeing from the attentions of an ardent producer who lures her up 
            to his hotel suite and ends up chasing her down the hallway wearing 
            only his boots (He's American, you know). In between, she stops to 
            get that much-needed first cup of coffee in the morning, first sip, 
            then -- &quot;Aye-e-e! Anna Battista! -- &quot;Two guys, on both sides of her, 
            snapshot, autograph, snapshot, how about those tattoos of her's? She 
            says they're fakes, then, &quot;ciao, ragazzi,&quot; out the door, into the 
            car, speeding down the road like a hunted animal. &quot;Where's she 
            going?&quot; one of the two men asks.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In Locarno, she's interviewed by a 
            man (Paolo Bonacelli) who, at one point, asks if he can hug her, 
            on-camera, and he presses his aged flesh as close as he can to the 
            young star. In Paris, she stops by to visit her friend Veronica 
            (Vera Gemma), only to find that she's been tied up and left alone in 
            her apartment by her sadistic boyfriend -- Veronica tries to 
            rationalize this horror like crazy, while Anna replies that she 
            should stop acting like those &quot;American housewives&quot; who &quot;get beaten 
            up and don't rat on their men.&quot; In Los Angeles, she shows up to do 
            tests for a movie, &quot;Cleopatra's Death&quot; -- where she's supposed to be 
            co-starring with Robert De Niro, and directed by Gus Van Sant -- 
            only to find it's all phoney-baloney and she walks off and ends up 
            at an IHOP with a friend. She also does a fashion shoot for &quot;Vogue,&quot; 
            posing in an indoor pool, only someone gives her a snort of 
            &quot;Special-K&quot; (the animal tranquilizer, not the cereal) and she almost 
            drowns. Back in Rome, a girl walks into her apartment as if she 
            knows the place, claims she and Anna know each other from before, 
            and then hops on top of the bewildered actress. Anna also gets a 
            call from her doctor, informing her she's pregnant, then, in the 
            next breath, he asks, &quot;What do we do now? Another abortion?&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Anna is tough (she's made 20 films 
            in 20 years), worldly (she speaks Italian, French, English, and -- 
            in one scene where she scores some drugs off a dealer played by rap 
            musician Schoolly-D, street argot), and, it turns out, she's looking 
            for love, the real, solid-gold-plated kind. Anna falls in 
            love-at-first-sight with Kirk (Jean Shepard), a musician from 
            Australia with disheveled hair who sings, in a neo-Jim Morrison 
            sound, fashionably alienated songs like &quot;Disillusionness Forever&quot; 
            (&quot;Your cage is painted picket-fence white....&quot;). She and Kirk get 
            together briefly, but it's obvious to us that he's only interested 
            in having a casual encounter, and Anna, who's not above having an 
            occasional ka-bing-ka-bang-ka-boom herself (as the film's opening 
            scene demonstrates), hasn't seemed to have fully figured out the 
            rules to this, yet.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Asia Argento, who currently appears 
            opposite Vin Diesel in the action flick <i>XXX</i>, made 17 films in 
            12 years prior to writing and directing <i>Scarlet Diva</i>; she 
            played two lead roles in films made by her father, the suspense 
            maestro Dario Argento, who co-produced <i>Diva</i>, and cast her 
            real-life mother, actress Daria Nicolodi, to play Anna's mother in 
            the film, who in flashbacks is seen scolding the young girl and 
            raising her to feel shameful about herself. (Nicolodi had guts to 
            take this role, considering the obvious conclusions most audiences 
            would leap to.) Asia films the scenes between Anna and Kirk so that 
            they have a dank, humid, hot-breathed quality to them, and the oily 
            blacks and colorless brights the digital cinematography lend to her 
            make Anna sometimes look as if she were a vampire crawling out of 
            her crypt.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But <i>Scarlet Diva</i> -- a movie 
            I expected to be perfectly demented from the advance word I'd heard 
            about it -- isn't some self-pitying vanity project, or a movie 
            that's just content with having a good roll around in the gutter. It 
            doesn't shy away from the seamier aspects of Anna's whirlwind life (Argento 
            has teasingly hinted that some of the sex in the film isn't 
            simulated, because she wanted to capture how people's faces really 
            looked while they were in the midst of copulation), but it also gets 
            some genuine human emotions into the proceedings. Argento records 
            Anna's carousel existence as a media celebrity, but she doesn't 
            whine about it or beg for our sympathy: this is what Anna chose, and 
            if she wanted to become a convenience store clerk, she most 
            certainly would. The movie is essentially the story of a girl who 
            thinks she's strong but isn't quite there, yet, which is why she 
            pushes her life and herself to such punishing extremes.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Argento also knows what she's doing 
            in directing the film -- the picture is fast, but focused, and 
            sometimes uproariously funny, the only real flaw being it's open, 
            rather frustratingly ambiguous ending (a problem with some of her 
            father Dario's pictures, as well) -- Argento has suggested, in one 
            interview, that the key to the film's ending is the religious icon 
            that Anna sees, not the mysterious, backlit male figure who faces 
            her. <i>Scarlet Diva</i> also has the best performance I've seen 
            Asia Argento give since she appeared in Patrice Chereau's 1994 <i>
            Queen Margot</i>. (There's this terrific moment, at the beginning of
            <i>Scarlet Diva</i>, where you see Argento's Anna in the back of a 
            closed care, looking out the window, looking at us, and you see how 
            totally off-guard she feels, and you feel how she must feel at that 
            particular moment.) She might be able to make some significant films 
            if she can slow down a bit -- making one film at full tilt is one 
            thing, making three or four the same way is another. In <i>Scarlet 
            Diva</i>, Argento shows a penchant for fearless, yet rigorous, 
            insight, a brave quality that could result in some film work that 
            would stand up on its own very well while giving her the last laugh 
            over any detractors.</font></td>
