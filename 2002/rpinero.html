            started stealing when I was eight.&quot; Standing amid a crowd
            gathered to meet and greet at the Nuyorican Poets' Café, the Café's
            co-founder and playwright Miguel Piñero (Benjamin Bratt) swaggers
            just a bit. Almost in spite of himself, he's working to impress a
            reporter with tales of his hard-case background. She's on him
            because his 1974 prison drama, <i>Short Eyes,</i> has just been
            nominated for six Tony Awards. Suddenly, &quot;Mikey&quot; is a
            celebrity, and it's intoxicating. Recalling his time in prison and
            on the streets, the terminally vibrant Piñero loudly resists the
            vaunted tradition of Latin American magic realism, insisting on the
            immediacy and authenticity of his own work, a poetry driven by the
            pains and joys, the intimacies and fragmentations of everyday life. <o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">This
            first scene in Leon Ichaso's film, <i>Piñero</i>, sets up a complex
            series of relationships between the artist and his demons -- or more
            pointedly, between the artist and the various audiences he sought to
            influence and astonish. The film is part biography, part
            bizarro-poetic license, part <i>Behind the Music</i> turned inside
            out and sideways. While it's plainly quite in love with its subject,
            it also reveals just how monstrous he could be, to those he loved as
            well as to those he rightfully railed against. While Piñero's work
            was surely expressive and innovative, it was also a form of
            reportage, a proto-hiphop declaration of sub-cultural truth, and
            something of a wake-up call to the mainstream, which was, in turn,
            happy enough to absorb and profit from this &quot;other&quot;
            experience (again, much like the phenomenon of hiphop, but on a
            smaller scale). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">When
            <i>Short Eyes</i> opened at Joseph Papp's (played here by Mandy
            Patinkin) Public Theater, it was lauded by critics and playgoers
            hungry for art they perceived as &quot;genuine&quot; -- street,
            underclass, muscular, and overtly &quot;political.&quot; <i>Short
            Eyes</i> delivered. Set in prison, its title slang for pedophile,
            its characters were full of fury and pain, in your face
            anti-stereotypes (that unfortunately, soon became stereotypes). The
            play was nominated for six Tony Awards and made into a 1976 film
            co-starring Piñero (who later acted in <i>Fort Apache The Bronx</i>
            and TV series like <i>Miami Vice</i>, <i>Baretta</i>, and <i>Kojak</i>).
            But even with his accomplishment, Piñero -- who called himself a
            &quot;philosopher of the criminal mind&quot; -- tried to hang onto
            his own anger, his opposition to the mainstream. Neither did he ever
            beat his &quot;street&quot; habits, or his longtime alcohol and
            heroin addictions. Jailed repeatedly for petty theft and dealing, Piñero
            died of complications owing to AIDS in 1988. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Though
            it conveys most of this information (it does not mention AIDS, but
            instead attributes his death at age forty to a more immediate cause,
            liver cirrhosis), <i>Piñero</i> is not a standard biopic. It offers
            no clear chronology; instead, selected events in Piñero's troubled
            life come tumbling at you, rushing, sometimes hard to decipher. The
            film flips back and forth between time periods, poetry and history,
            stage productions and moments from Piñero's experience,
            black-and-white and color footage, video and film stocks --
            cinematographer Claudio Chea's handheld cameras never rest, and
            David Tedeschi's editing maintains an equally manic pace. This
            riotous aesthetic coincides with Mikey's wildly complicated and
            contradictory sensibility, his careening rages and fears, deep
            passions and affections, fleeting interests and resistance to
            commitments. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">This
            combination of genres and effects also underlines the tensions among
            Piñero's own life-strands, his personal, familial, and community
            histories, and his connections to the world that produced and
            imprisoned, then embraced and consumed him. Piñero was among the
            first group of self-identified Nuyorican artists. The film is
            unusually sensitive to the many layers of identity and
            identification at work in the designation Nuyorican, and especially
            the political contexts informing it. Piñero and Rutgers literature
            professor/Café cofounder Miguel Algarin (Giancarlo Esposito) turn
            it into a rallying cry against racism and poverty. At the same time,
            <i>Piñero</i> reveals the difficulties of the identification: when
            the adult Piñero returns to Puerto Rico for a reading, he's
            rejected for what Puerto Ricans see as his rejection of his own
            heritage. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Moved
            at age seven from Puerto Rico to the Lower East Side, Piñero early
            feels jostled and anxious to fit in. His loving mother (Rita Moreno)
            does her best in a hostile environment, but abuse by his father
            (Jaime Sanchez) affects Mikey for the rest of his life. The film's
            time-jumping structure and sporadic references to the prejudices and
            class politics that shaped the young junkie's life suggest there are
            a number of reasons for his &quot;deviance.&quot; Still, the
            narrative weight granted the father-son relationship might suggest a
            reductive explanation: paternal abuse = homosexuality and
            self-destruction. When his long-absent father comes to visit Piñero
            as an adult, the son brutally rejects him, unforgiving, still
            grieving for his lost childhood. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            film hints at this childhood in quick images of young Mikey, dancing
            with his mother, street hustling, and thieving -- here he looks
            eager for experience, willing to be seduced and to grab at what he
            wants. For the adult Piñero, desire and pleasure become more
            fraught. He's demonstrably energized by the celebrity he achieves
            with <i>Short Eyes</i> (as is the film -- posters and allusions to
            it appear repeatedly), as well as his poetry and acting gigs (even
            though you see him asked to play junkie stereotypes much like those
            he resists in his own writing), he also has trouble reconciling his
            newfound relative wealth and his self-image. He gives away wads of
            cash (for instance, to a neighborhood bodega he once robbed), but
            instead of attending a theatrical opening as he's scheduled to do,
            he goes off on a tear with a friend, mugging a couple of women for
            their fur coats before being picked up by the cops. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Similarly,
            Mikey's sexual desires remain somewhat obscured (which isn't
            necessarily inaccurate, given his wide-ranging appetites and
            frustrations. The film doesn't show his sex with men as it does with
            Sugar, but it does hint at his messy sexual desires, through his
            relationships with the playwright Reinaldo Povod (Michael Irby) and
            a prostitute/actor named Sugar (Talisa Soto), and very brief scenes
            where he solicits or is solicited by a range of characters,
            including a transvestite who appears as a stereotypically
            knife-wielding, wig-tearing psycho, while he looks on as if he is
            the sober one in the room. While the romanticized relationship with
            Sugar gets the most screen time, it is also framed, part artifice,
            part dream: she performs his words, he applauds her performance, and
            he can never give himself over to her, never let go of his monsters.
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">For
            all the film's spectacle, its visual flash and edgy approximation of
            street &quot;realism,&quot; its most daring aspect is something less
            familiar. And that is its willingness to represent Piñero as a
            vicious, frightened thug. Certainly, it also works a familiar
            &quot;tortured artist&quot; angle, making Mikey pained and
            sympathetic, inviting you to understand his bad behavior, but it
            doesn't quite celebrate his meanness, no matter how well motivated
            it may seem. He remains a junkie and a thief, he betrays his friends
            (stealing appliances from Algarin, fucking with Papp's opening
            nights), and he never quite finds a way to fit into the downtown art
            scene or the Hollywood industry that keep finding ways to use him.
            At Piñero's funeral, Algarin reads from his friend's &quot;A Lower
            East Side Poem&quot;: &quot;Just once before I die / I want to climb
            up on a / tenement sky / to dream my lungs out till / I cry.&quot;
            If <i>Piñero</i> cannot be the realization of this aspiration, it
            can at least make it visible, briefly. <o:p>
