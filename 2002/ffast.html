<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700"><font size="2">Zacharias 
Kunuk and Norman Cohn work off each other. Emotional, psychic, spiritual -- they 
share rhythms that are difficult to pinpoint, fascinating to see. 
Director/co-producer/co-writer/co-editor Kunuk and his business partner, 
co-producer/co-writer/co-editor/cinematographer Cohn (American born, now 
Canadian) met with me to talk about <i>Atanarjuat, The Fast Runner</i>, the 
first all-Inuit directed, acted, and scripted feature film, and winner of six 
Genie Awards, among other honors. Based on an ancient Inuit legend, the film is 
gorgeous and exhilarating. The script by Paul Apak Angilirq (Kunuk and Cohn's 
longtime partner died during production, in 1998) concerns an evil shaman who 
brings evil to a tight-knit community, causing a rift between two brothers, 
Amaqjuaq (Pakkak Innukshuk), the Strong One, and Atanarjuat (Natar Ungalaaq), 
the Fast One. Atanarjuat falls in love the lovely Atuat (Sylvia Ivalu), who is 
promised to Oki (Peter-Henry Arnatsiaq): vengeance leads to tragedy, and the 
Fast Runner escapes on foot, sprinting naked over the snowy tundra. </font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Cohn does much of the 
talking, Kunuk being more reserved and apparently, exhausted, from their world 
traveling with the film, to film festivals. Cohn underlines that their primary 
objective in making the film, shot in widescreen digital betacam, was to &quot;follow 
the story&quot; laid out in Angilirq's screenplay, which, Cohn admits, was more like 
a 6-hour movie. They ended up with some 140 cassettes, over seventy hours of 
footage, then &quot;distilled.&quot; </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>Cynthia Fuchs: </b>
</i>How might you describe your process of distillation? </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>Norman Cohn: </b></i>
Well, we all bring a load of experience. There are hardly any videomakers on 
earth older than I am, because older than I am, video didn't exist. That goes 
back thirty-two years for me. Zacharias had the first video camera in the 
Arctic, and he goes back twenty-one years. Apak goes back even further, because 
he was part of this weird national training program in the 1970s. So you bring 
seventy years of video making experience to the digital film moment, and that's 
a lot of know-how. You apply that to a fabulous story, along with hardware, how 
video is different from film, bringing Inuit values to the process of 
filmmaking. But there's no Martin Scorsese. That's a socially inappropriate 
concept: the auteur cannot exist in Inuit culture. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>I have 
read that the process was horizontal rather than vertical. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>NC: </b></i>That's 
how the Inuit do everything. Seal-hunting, card-playing, filmmaking. </font>
</span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>Did you 
do a lot of work with the actors before shooting? </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>Zacharias Kunuk: </b>
</i>We got them locally, and Apak worked with them a lot. Sometimes the actors 
worked with themselves a lot, perfecting scenes. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>NC: </b></i>Nobody 
really directed the actors very much. I hear us saying this to people and it 
seems so unlikely, because that's what directors <i>do</i>, direct, and so many 
of our actors are first-time actors. So how do we do it? The answer is in the 
process, in the culture. The authentic script is &quot;written&quot; by the people it is 
about, and they go the extra mile to make sure everything is correct: the 
gestures, costumes. It's all checked by elders. By the time we all come 
together, we just have to be there, and let go. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>ZK: </b></i>So many 
of us were arguing all the time: &quot;I want that shot,&quot; or &quot;No, I want that shot.&quot; 
Even the actors got in on it. My only job is to get it going, to organize. 
Norman was able to throw the camera right in their faces. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>NC: </b></i>If you go 
back to early concepts in video, the focus is on the importance of process over 
product. You can't make a leftwing movie in a rightwing style. The process of 
your approach is imbedded in your result, if there is any result, because some 
things are pure process. When there's a result, an artistic result, an object, I 
always believed that the object looks like the makers -- Scorsese's films look 
like what I think he's like, good and bad. Our film is the result of the ways 
people are treated, respected, empowered to make the film with us, because we 
have a sense we're making it together. This was an important activity, not just 
a job or some foreign filmmaker coming in who needs an Inuit in the background. 
It's like anything, like the hockey playoffs. When you're really there and 
focused, your performance comes off at a different level. And it reveals that 
the conditions for that level of commitment must have been present. Our film 
shows that. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>What kind 
of video work led you to this project? It sounds like there's a politics here.
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>NC: </b></i>Yes, 
there is a politics of storytelling, a politics of behavior. I've been in an 
Inuit house, where someone will come in, sit down, visit, get up and leave, 
without saying a word. That's a very polite visit. Because Inuit think that if 
you come in and say &quot;Hello,&quot; everybody, no matter what they're doing, has to 
turn around and pay attention, and when I leave and say, &quot;Goodbye,&quot; I'm 
expecting an answer. Inuit consider that really impolite. So there's a sense of 
good manners that goes well beyond what Europeans think of as good manners. They 
believe that everyone has the right to be in their moment, whatever way they 
want to be, and to be themselves, however they can, to bring themselves to any 
experience and take away what they want, without having anything hammered into 
their heads. And you can make video like that. You don't see much of that on 
television or in the history of film, but video was a medium that either 
attracted people who thought like that, or gave people a tool that made it easy 
to do that, because you could let things run for a long time. Of course, one 
thread of video evolved into intellectual, narcissistic, self-referential 
postmodern bullsh*t, but it didn't have to be that way. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">There were values in 
videomaking that had to do with empowering people in their own voices, putting 
tools in the hands of people, letting them present themselves, in a non-didactic 
form, watching and listening rather than telling and being told. And it turns 
out those are Inuit values. I was making what I call portrait videos, witness 
people's lives; I can't describe them, you'd have to see them. But that work was 
well exhibited, and ten years before I met Zacharias, I was a famous video 
artist in an extremely small universe. And that universe was marginalized, as it 
should have been -- otherwise, you'd be worried that you were doing what 
everyone else was doing. It was new. Our film is coming from a different set of 
cultural and aesthetic values, different from what you're used to. It's taking 
you on a tour, which is what every movie is. Only this movie is the high-priced 
tour. The low-priced tour is when the tour-guide takes you by the hand and leads 
you through every step, pointing out every monument. The expensive tour is where 
you get dropped into the middle of the Peruvian jungle and no one is telling you 
anything; though you're given the tools, you have to figure out what to do with 
them. One day in that jungle, you're a little nervous, but you come out feeling 
like you were really there. By the end of that day, you feel proud, that you 
really went somewhere. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>Are you 
at all concerned what people do with those tools? As for instance, the awards 
this film is getting -- do you worry that the &quot;difference&quot; it offers serves as 
novelty or exotic object? </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>NC: </b></i>Well, 
even though I'm a bit older than Zac, we're both too old to take this response 
seriously. We know what we've been doing, and we were doing it when nobody was 
responding. When you're twenty-five and everyone responds this way, maybe you 
think it's you, but by the time you're fifty-five years old, you know that 
you've been you all the time, and that the only thing that's changing is the 
other guys. The other thing is, taking too seriously this kind of response on an 
individual level, like &quot;You guys are really fabulous,&quot; is extremely 
inappropriate from an Inuit cultural point of view. For Inuit, pride, vanity, 
taking personal credit, or if you give an Inuit a medal for bravery, they're 
going to look really uncomfortable. When you pull some guy out of the water 
who's fallen through the ice, that's something anyone would do, nothing special. 
So we're not taking too seriously the response to the film except to the extent 
that we can use it to make the film more available to more people. Because the 
film has objectives. It is a spectacular, entertaining action thriller, with 
three murders, two sex scenes, and nobody can forget the naked man running for 
his life across the ice. But the film also has tremendous political and cultural 
purpose, both to Inuit and for Inuit, and from Inuit to the outside world. It's 
not the Inuits' fault, or any native people's fault, that they are stereotyped 
and dehumanized to the point where nobody has paid any attention to the fact 
that they might have solutions to the sh*t we all find ourselves dealing with.
</font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>&quot;The 
killing ends here.&quot;</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>NC: </b></i>It's 
fairly timely. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>What 
struck me as well is that there are many mythic plots and structures used in 
films and other modern narratives, and most of them have to do with righteous, 
violent, somehow cathartic revenge. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>NC: </b></i>Our -- 
Western, Euro -- version of the hero is the person who follows his heart, sticks 
up for his own individuality, at all costs. The John Wayne figure, in Inuit 
culture, is socially irresponsible. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>In U.S. 
culture too, but no one seems to notice the pathology, except maybe John Ford, 
who gave that figure a context. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>NC: </b></i>Right. 
Our film is the antidote to the pathological heroism of the bloodiest century in 
history. Count the dead bodies piled up over the past hundred years, and look at 
the values that are being expressed in who's the good guy and who's the bad guy.
</font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>There is 
still a clearly defined good and evil in your film. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>NC: </b></i>Yes, it's 
a very moral structure we've set up. There's good and evil in the natural world 
and the supernatural world. It's made by people who believe in good and evil.
</font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>There are 
also appears to be a gender dynamic at work here. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>ZK: </b></i>Women's 
roles -- they don't talk much. But when they open their mouths, it's the most 
powerful thing, and we show that in the film. In the Inuit world, women are 
usually listening, because they are subject to more taboos than men. But when 
they speak...</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>NC: </b></i>Everybody 
jumps. But to me, the Inuit culture is one where everyone has different roles, 
without defining hierarchies of value and importance. You don't have to be a 
rocket scientist to see how that works -- men had to go out hunting for food, 
and if the women didn't sew his boots right, his feet would freeze. And the 
women's job was to make a society that made their lives different from animals'. 
Adding any layers of importance or power to these roles makes no sense. I cannot 
live without you and you cannot live without me, so why even talk about those 
things? And there were always Inuit women who hunted, and women who had two 
husbands, as there were men with two wives. Women shamans. And naming has 
nothing to do with gender: Zacharias has five names, that the last people who 
had them were all women. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>ZK: </b></i>Yes, 
names are handed down over generations. My father calls me &quot;mother,&quot; and he 
doesn't tell me what to do. He would be happier if I told him what to do 
sometimes. I have a twelve-year-old son named after my brother, and he calls me 
&quot;Older Brother,&quot; and I call him &quot;Younger Brother.&quot; And he sometimes tells me 
what to do, that's the culture. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>What is 
the experience of moving back and forth between cultures? </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>ZK: </b></i>Right 
now, Inuits have to have educations up to grade twleve, to help you communicate 
with the outside world. But once you step back inside, you have to know how to 
survive, how to hunt, and when a blizzard hits you, you need to know how to get 
back home. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>NC: </b></i>Zac is in 
a generation that hasn't existed in many cultures in history. I remember Apak in 
1987, he led an expedition, of five guys and three dog-teams, from Igloolik to 
Greenland, retracing a historic immigration route, of a group who ran away from 
a shaman war, to Greenland, and repopulated that area. So Apak was an expedition 
leader, able to run a dog team 3000 miles, and while he did it, he made five 
half-hour television programs about it. And I remember thinking, he was probably 
the only person on earth who could do both things. And Zac: he wakes up in the 
morning, goes into the office, checks his email, puts on his parka, starts his 
skidoo, drives out onto the ice and catches a seal. What world is he in? I can't 
even fathom it. For me, the equivalent is flying back and forth, which is always 
very weird, like &quot;Beam me up, Scotty,&quot; like <i>Star Trek</i> travel. But he was 
born into this world, nine years old before he got off of that land. And now 
here we are, in DC, in Paris. And he's completely fluent, in both worlds. To 
think about bilingualism in essential cultural terms, it creates a kind of 
intelligence that most people never have a chance to experience. What I wonder 
sometimes, are you ever out there on the ice, thinking about your email? Or does 
your mind really go through one door and into another door? </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>ZK: </b></i>No, I'm 
not thinking about email. Out there, you're running away from the office. </font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>NC: </b></i>It's like 
each life is so absorbent. I can't do what he can do, I travel along, and I'm 
lucky if I don't fall through the ice. I'm famous for driving right in his 
track, because I figure if he went there and I go there, I won't do something 
fatally stupid. That's part of the attraction for me, I like being able to 
time-travel, occupy another person's body, for a while, through my art. But this 
life we're in right now, is pretty extreme. It's hardest when there are 
distractions -- we have a company, and we have contracts, people send us 
scripts. There's a lot of noise. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">But when the noise level is 
reduced, lateral travel like that is amazing. I imagine it's what time travel 
might be like. When you're making the videos we've made, before this one, you're 
on the ground, and it's like you're feeling the people who were right here, 5000 
years ago; you can almost hear them. This filmmaking, from a personal point of 
view, is about projecting yourself into another world, as far as we're able to 
do, because we're not sorcerers or shamans yet. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>ZK: </b></i>We're 
shooting a scene, and you start to see the way the actors look, as if they're 85 
years ago. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>NC: </b></i>They look 
the same, they talk the same, and it's like, whoa! </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>It must 
make you aware of how your context -- on so many levels -- defines you. We like 
to think we're coherent individuals who remain consistent over time and space, 
but this experience shakes that notion up. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>ZK: </b></i>Just like 
I'm listening to the radio in Inuit, and watching the TV in English. I can live 
with that. But if they're both in English, I get distracted. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>NC: </b></i>Now <i>
that</i>'s very interesting. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>ZK: </b></i>Yes, like 
working on two channels. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>NC: </b></i>Not only 
context becomes part of the meaning of experience, but the thing that fascinated 
me from the very beginning about video is the way time is a quality of 
existence. There really is a fourth dimension, where the way we're brought up 
and trained, to formulate the illusion of reality out of the molecular soup that 
we're in, we're trained not to see time. But we're all floating in it; the 
essential soup you're made of is this fourth dimension. When you start to create 
work that experiments with making time what I'll call &quot;visible,&quot; because I don't 
have a word for the fourth dimension, maybe &quot;risible,&quot; the awareness of time, 
when you can see it or sense it, adds a level of awareness to the other 
qualities of everything. Both individuality and the total absence of 
individuality. When you can see time as a quality of things, I can see you 
floating in your own time, and you can see me floating in my own time -- that 
highlights the extraordinary difference between you and me, and at the same 
time, it makes you and me be exactly the same thing. The Inuit have these 
enlightening ways of thinking about some things. So, the past is ahead of you: 
In English you would say, &quot;The past comes before us,&quot; which you can understand 
as the past is behind, but it can also mean the past is in front. In Inuit, the 
past is ahead of you; you are following your ancestors. Time is what? Is it a 
line, where you fall off the end? </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>ZK: </b></i>We talk 
like that: children are behind us, fathers are ahead of us. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>NC: </b></i>What does 
that really mean? Our film doesn't talk about anything like that. It's not an 
educational film, it's not health food, but at the same time, these things are 
there. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>I'm 
assuming that you guys have these kinds of conversations. How do you talk about 
putting these ideas in a film? </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>NC: </b></i>You can't 
talk about it like that. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>ZK: </b></i>We go to 
the old sites where people used to live, and imagine what it's like. </font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>NC: </b></i>And we're 
like an old couple; we've been together seventeen years, we don't have to talk 
about any of this anymore. But really, we talk about this stuff all the time. We 
go out somewhere and get stuck, and spend hours, sometimes we call it 
brainstorming. Your brain just starts traveling around. A lot of it has to do 
with imagining and believing that other times really exist and existed. The time 
we live in is so focused on &quot;me.&quot; To really have a sense of yourself in the flow 
of history isn't something you usually do, but Zac and I, we do. I mean, we made 
this film, very deliberately. And because we have so much shared experience, 
much of what happens can happen with a minimum of conversation at the time. But 
we get what each of us knows what we really want. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The other thing about Zac 
and me is that we're hat's known in the industry as &quot;shooters.&quot; We're used to 
working through the camera, not directing other people. But you know, sometimes 
you've really got it, and sometimes you know you really don't got it. And 
sometimes when you got it, everyone's got it. The light is coming down on the 
guy you want, the actors are on a roll, and god is on your side. Suddenly, it is 
just unbelievable, you know when that's happening, and you know when the 
opposite is happening, and this scene is going to be shit no matter what you do. 
For a mysterious reason you cannot explain, sometimes the camera is right on, or 
sometimes the camera is three frames behind the action. It's intuitive, but it's 
also extremely structured, because of your experience.</font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>So were 
you ever surprised by what you had, when you had, in the editing room? </font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>ZK: </b></i>No. We 
knew what we had, otherwise we'd have to go back outside in the cold and do it 
again! </font></span></p>
