            <font size="2">A onetime Oprah Book Club selection and monumental 
            bestseller, Janet Fitch's <i>White Oleander</i> now comes to 
            theaters, courtesy of award-winning British director Peter Kosminsky. 
            The result is a hardworking, episodic saga of one girl's journey 
            from scary childhood to sensitive young artist-hood. Beginning with 
            a bad mother and ending with a good man, this expedition takes a 
            number of years and spans various classes in Los Angeles. Proudly 
            unsubtle, it's the kind of movie that gives chick flicks a bad 
            name.&nbsp; </font></span><span style="font-family: Verdana">
            <font size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Astrid 
            Magnusson (Alison Lohman) loves her mom, the lithe and steely artist 
            Ingrid (Michelle Pfeiffer). But, as Astrid explains in her lilting 
            voiceover, she knows that Ingrid probably isn't the healthiest 
            influence to be around. &quot;I belonged to her,&quot; Astrid sighs, adding 
            with wistful irony, &quot;Being with someone so dangerous was the last 
            time that I felt safe.&quot; The film goes on to explore this ostensible 
            opposition (and emotional collapse) between safety and danger, by 
            tracking Astrid's movements from foster home to foster home, all the 
            way through to the end credits, accompanied by Sheryl Crow's remixed 
            and suddenly much-beloved, following her dramatic performance at the 
            2002 VMAs, &quot;Safe and Sound.&quot; You can never appreciate the 
            significance of security, it seems, until you've felt endangered.
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The 
            dangerous-but-safe-seeming Ingrid thus embodies an important object 
            lesson for Astrid, namely, don't let your desires overpower you. At 
            first, she appears as a romantic heroine to her young daughter, 
            gorgeous (she is Michelle Pfeiffer, after all), ardent, energetic 
            and earnest. Reading her poetry aloud on the rooftop, she appears to 
            Astrid (and the camera) almost magical, her hair blowing softly in 
            the breeze. She trains Astrid in all aspects of art appreciation, 
            fiercely insisting that she <i>look</i> at mom's collages before 
            saying she likes them: &quot;You can't be an artist,&quot; she says, &quot;if you 
            don't see.&quot; </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Ingrid's 
            dedication to her daughter is boundless, until she meets Barry 
            (Billy Connolly), who appears mostly from Astrid's point of view, at 
            a fuzzy distance. When he stops calling, Ingrid's rage and grief are 
            overwhelming, especially for Astrid, who can only observe as her 
            mother unravels. The climax comes when, one morning, the cops come 
            to take Ingrid away on first-degree-murder charges. Seems she's 
            poisoned Barry with crushed white oleanders, a poetically overheated 
            metaphor that grants the film a frightful tagline (&quot;Oleander can be 
            poisonous... so can a mother's love&quot;). In a flashback that recurs 
            when Astrid goes to visit mom in a maximum-security prison, Barry 
            comes pounding on the door, &quot;You can't do this to me!&quot; (Imagine this 
            situation: knowing you are poisoned, smashing your murderer's 
            windows, to no avail: shades of Edmond O'Brien.) Ingrid responds, 
            equally wrathful but infinitely icier, &quot;You don't know what I can 
            do!&quot;&nbsp; </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Incarcerated, 
            Ingrid becomes, in her daughter's eyes, rather mythic, because she 
            can take what's dished out (she appears with face bruised, slightly, 
            but her hair is ever-silky) and because the first foster mother is 
            the alcoholic and fervently born-again Starr (Robin Wright Penn), 
            fond of spandex and makeup, and married to pretty-boy carpenter Ray 
            (Cole Hauser). He's immediately attractive to Astrid, who is, of 
            course, more like her mom than she knows. During one prison visit, 
            Ingrid spots a post-baptism crucifix on Astrid's neck, and recoils 
            in disgust, telling Astrid that such white-trashy religion is for 
            the weak: &quot;We're not like them, we're the Vikings.&quot; Desperate to 
            emulate her mother's potency, Astrid heads back to the trailer to 
            assert herself. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">While Starr 
            drags Astrid and her own kids off to church regularly, Ray wears a 
            t-shirt and works on his truck. &quot;If there's a God,&quot; he tells Astrid, 
            &quot;He ain't worth prayin' to.&quot; This makes sense to Righteously Angry 
            Girl, but when she and Ray start exploring other similar interests, 
            Starr explodes, and Astrid's sent off to the depressing state home 
            for unplaceable kids, McKinney Hall (not quite so harsh as the 
            joints where Linda Blair repeatedly found herself, but in the 
            ballpark). </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Here she meets 
            an aspiring comic-book artist, Paul (Patrick Fugit, as sensitive an 
            object of a young girl's affection as ever graced a movie screen). 
            But just when they start feeling tight, Astrid is assigned to 
            another foster home, this time that of sweet and needy Claire (Renée 
            Zellweger). She has a nice dog and beachfront home, working 
            occasionally as an actress; treating Astrid as the sister-friend she 
            never had, she regales her with tales of her slasher movie 
            experience, by way of a video clip of Zellweger's work in <i>The 
            Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation</i>, and moans about 
            her often-absent commercial director husband Mark (Noah Wyle, 
            unctuous as ever). </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">If you've 
            stayed focused, you will have noticed by now that blonds are the 
            kiss of death for Astrid (also blond), and so it continues: Claire 
            insists on meeting Ingrid in prison, who puts a zap on her head, 
            which leads directly to tragedy. When Astrid confronts her mother, 
            Ingrid waxes instructive: &quot;Loneliness is the human condition. Love 
            humiliates you. Hatred cradles you.&quot; Oi. Thank goodness that 
            Astrid's next foster placement is not blond, but the dark-haired 
            Rena (Svetlana Efremova), a robust Russian émigré who buys and sells 
            used clothing, including Astrid's. Astrid toughens up, dyes her hair 
            anti-mom black, gets multiple piercings, and dresses like she's 
            auditioning for a goth-girl part on <i>Buffy</i>. She must be truly 
            independent now, as she's finally acting out in a fashion that truly 
            annoys her all-powerful mother. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Amid all this 
            emotional twirling, Lohman comports herself well, especially in the 
            company of her scene-chewing elders. But the film gets in her way, 
            repeatedly. As much as Fitch's novel evidently moved its readers 
            (and I'm not one of them), Kosminsky's <i>White Oleander</i>, 
            adapted by Mary Agnes Donoghue (best known for adapting <i>Beaches</i>), 
            seems stuck in first gear, grinding through a series of very &quot;safe&quot; 
            clichés.</font></span><!--webbot bot="Include"
