            review by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 13 December 2002</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>For a while it seemed that there
            was a rule of thumb in predicting the quality of the most recent <i>Star
            Trek </i>movie. You could almost hear the Frankenstein monster
            moaning, &quot;Even number: <i>Good</i>. Odd number: <i>Bad</i>.&quot;
            The more enjoyable entries in the series always seemed to be the
            even numbered ones. <i>Star Trek: The Motion Picture</i> proved once
            and for all that special effects alone can make for a pretty dull
            movie, but <i>Star Trek II: The Wrath of Kahn</i> was a treat.
            Similarly, <i>Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home</i> and <i>Star Trek:
            First Contact</i> were more consistently entertaining than their
            odd-numbered peers. This may explain why the newer installments
            don't have a number in title for fear of being outed as an
            odd-numbered movie. <i>Star Trek: Nemesis</i> breaks this trend.
            It's even numbered (the tenth), but it's also flat and uneventful.
            The worlds that the crew of the Enterprise explores in this mission
            aren't terribly engaging to explore. The setup offers loads of
            possibilities, but the emphasis on explosions puts a photon torpedo
            through any real narrative momentum.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Next Generation&quot; captain
            Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) and his crew are drawn into one
            more voyage when the Federation's long-time enemies the Romulans
            unexpectedly announce they want peace. It sounds a little too good
            to be true, but the prospect of bringing the end to intergalactic
            cold war is just too good to pass up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>On their way, the crew finds a robot that's an early version
            of their own Data (Bent Spiner). When Picard and his shipmates
            arrive near Romulus, they also discover that the entire Romulan
            government has been overthrown by a human named Shinzon (Tom Hardy).
            Not only is his head as hairlessly shiny as Picard's, but he's
            actually a genetic copy. The Romulans raised him to be a sort of spy
            and then left him to rot in the mines on the nearby planet Remus
            (get it?). Understandably, he's more than a little upset. Merely
            conquering the Romulans isn't enough to satisfy him. Shinzon wants
            to take out Earth as well. Because he and Picard are the same man
            with different experiences, the two have to outwit each other in
            order to succeed.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This premise (by John Logan,
            producer Rick Berman and Spiner) offers loads of possibilities, but
            the script by Logan never really lets those ideas develop. It asks
            an important question: Is a person's character solely shaped by
            experience or is there an internal quality that supersedes fate's
            acts of cruelty? The answer would seem more relevant if as audience
            members we weren't able to guess Picard's or Shinzon's next movies
            before either of them catches a clue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Further, while Hardy shares Stewart's bald head and UK
            accent, he doesn't have that deep, resonant voice that makes Stewart
            seem born to lead. When both are stuck with the same lackluster
            dialogue, Stewart sounds so much smarter and commanding that it
            seems like a mismatch for the beginning. Director Stuart Baird (<i>Executive
            Decision</i>) winds up killing the film altogether when he
            shortchanges the psychology and decides to make a movie about
            spaceship envy.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Logan has written a really good
            play, <i>Never the Sinner</i>, and a first rate biopic about the
            making of <i>Citizen Kane</i> titled <i>RKO 281</i>. Both of these
            projects were clearly labors of love where the enthusiasm ran off
            the page. <i>Star Trek: Nemesis</i> clearly isn't such a project for
            him. It's nice that the current Enterprise crew is allowed to step
            off the bridge before they become as worn out as one of William
            Shatner's old toupees. Still, when it comes to making a film that
            stands with the best of the series, <i>Star Trek: Nemesis</i> can't
            make it so.</font></td>
