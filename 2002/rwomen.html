            <span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="5">Expectations</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700">
            <font size="2">Ana (América Ferrera) is graduating from Beverly 
            Hills High School. But, unlike her privileged classmates, she can't 
            count on going to college. For the past four years, Ana has been 
            riding the city bus from her home in East Los Angeles to school, 
            where her teachers extol her intelligence, talent, and promise. When 
            she gets home each day, however, she lives another life. </font>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">That life, in
            <i>Real Women Have Curves</i>, is centered on Ana's family, in 
            particular, her mother Carmen (Lupe Ontiveros). The youngest child, 
            Ana represents all sorts of ideals for Carmen, and some fears as 
            well, for instance, that her own life will remain unchanged, that 
            her hard work has led her to disappointment, that her youth and 
            dreams are past. And so, as Ana is preparing to leave home, even 
            considering the possibility, Carmen reminds her that her first 
            obligation is to her family, not herself. The decision is made: Ana 
            will work fulltime in the sweatshop owned by her sister Estela 
            (Ingrid Oliu). </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Much as she has 
            been expecting it, Ana can't help but resent this turn of events. 
            After all, her favorite teacher, Mr. Guzman (George Lopez), has been 
            encouraging her to pursue her studies, indeed, to apply to Columbia, 
            where he has connections (thus enabling her to send in a late 
            application). He goes so far as to come by Ana's house, 
            unfortunately during her family-only graduation party, to urge 
            Carmen and Ana's father Raul (Jorge Cervera, Jr.) to let her go. 
            Carmen is offended by the intrusion and the challenge to her 
            authority. Raul, caught out at the very moment when he only wants to 
            celebrate his daughter's achievement, looks stricken. </font></span>
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Amid all this 
            adult turf-marking, Ana stands distraught. How can she explain to 
            her teacher -- much less her parents -- her many responsibilities, 
            frustrations, and ambitions? Young Ferrara's face registers a range 
            of complex emotions in a matter of seconds -- hope, disappointment, 
            pride, fear, and stubborn idealism. It's a remarkable moment, 
            happily one of many for Ferrara, whose sophisticated, intelligent 
            performance grounds the film even when it occasionally lurches into 
            soapy predictability and contrivance. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">True, the film 
            did win the Sundance Film Festival's Dramatic Audience Award this 
            year. But <i>Real Women Have Curves</i> has more going on than 
            rousing &quot;humanism&quot; or a collection of coming-of-age clichés. 
            Directed by Patricia Cardoso, and written by George LaVoo and 
            Josefina López (based on her play), the film frames Ana's story as a 
            series of confrontations with Carmen. Equally willful and 
            impassioned, mother and daughter argue repeatedly and vigorously, 
            over concerns that are specific to them, for example, their 
            side-by-side jobs at the sweatshop. Ana, understandably, rejects the 
            prospect of &quot;becoming&quot; her mother: the last thing she wants is to be 
            sitting at the same sewing machine twenty-five years later. Also 
            understandably, Carmen begrudges Ana's seeming disdain, and wants 
            her respect. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Also 
            complicated are Ana's decision and purposeful plans to lose her 
            virginity. While she has no illusions about being saved by a Prince 
            Charming, she chooses to date a gringo from school, the well-meaning 
            Jimmy (Brian Sites), a practical, sensible choice. And in another 
            welcome twist, even as Ana engineers all sorts of subterfuges to 
            hide her dates from her mother, it is Carmen who has a pregnancy 
            scare. This is brought on by any number of needs and fears, not 
            least among them that Ana is looking to leave her. Further 
            displacing her fear of abandonment by lashing out at Ana, Carmen 
            criticizes her daughter's curvy body, suggesting that it limits her 
            marriage prospects. She goes so far as to monitor what Ana eats, 
            telling her that, though she likes flan, she can't have any. Don't 
            you know: the reverse shot has Ana deliberately spooning the desert 
            into her mouth.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Mature and 
            self-confident, Ana rejects such traditional notions of a woman's 
            worth, insisting that, if she enjoys and respects her body, boys -- 
            and her mother -- can just deal with it. (In one bracing scene, she 
            strips to her underwear while working at her ironing station, 
            horrifying her mother, but rallying her fellow workers to recognize 
            and appreciate their own bodies, perhaps especially apt, given their 
            setting, in the steamy sweatshop.) </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Ana also takes 
            it on herself to help Estela negotiate some difficult situations at 
            work. Though exasperated by her own assignment -- every day, hour 
            after hour, she irons dresses that an upscale downtown department 
            store will buy from Estela for $18 apiece, then mark up to $600 -- 
            Ana begins to appreciate Estela's aspirations. The older sister once 
            had hopes and dreams as well, once imagined her factory as a way to 
            escape the barrio, not to be trapped forever. While Estela is 
            increasingly overwhelmed by day-to-day details, Ana brings another, 
            less weary perspective, making use of the code-switching skills she 
            has learned during years of negotiating different class, race, and 
            gender expectations, crossing between Beverly Hills and her 
            neighborhood and back again. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Ana's wisdom 
            and healthy self-awareness make her refreshingly different from most 
            high school movie girls. And if <i>Real Women Have Curves</i> 
            concludes a little too neatly, it treats its protagonist with 
            uncommon respect. It's a movie about a high school graduate that 
            leaves out the usual anxieties, about whether a girl's wearing 
            glasses or will have sex on prom night. Instead, it focuses on 
            issues that actually concern most graduates, whatever their 
            backgrounds or body types: making peace with the past while 
            imagining what comes next. </font></span></td>
