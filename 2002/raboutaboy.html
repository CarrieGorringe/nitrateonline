            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><b>Watching Hugh Grant on the 
            screen as the leading man in a romantic comedy is always, at least 
            for this reviewer, a somewhat schizophrenic experience, if for no 
            other reason than the difficulty experienced in trying to sort out 
            the various aspects of his public/private persona, the latter of 
            which has sometimes been on extremely embarrassing public display 
            (remember Divine Brown?). There's just an unease that he seems to 
            bring to this sort of role that's hard to place and to shake off, 
            mainly because it's sometimes difficult to ascertain exactly what 
            level of sincerity he actually brings to the part of the bumbling, 
            yet charming and dashing, fop;&nbsp; there's just enough underlying 
            oiliness and coldness in his portrayals that tends to prevent this 
            leading-man image from seeming completely credible.&nbsp; This thought 
            leads to the inevitable question about which role suits him better: 
            the bumbling but charming clod from <i>Notting Hill</i>, or more 
            like the sardonic theater director in <i>An Awfully Big Adventure</i>.&nbsp;</b>
            </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In <i>About a Boy</i>, Grant is 
            given the opportunity to straddle both sides of this dilemma.&nbsp; Will 
            Freeman (Grant) is proud of his position as a self-confessed 
            &quot;shallow&quot; person.&nbsp; His personal needs are well-met, thanks to the 
            substantial royalties generated from his father's brief but 
            profitable song-writing career (a one-hit wonder&nbsp; of seasonal tripe 
            entitled &quot;Santa's Super Sleigh&quot; which everyone in the film keeps 
            singing, much to Will's eternal embarrassment).&nbsp; Thanks to this 
            legacy, Will has taken up the career of professional layabout, 
            dividing his life into &quot;units&quot; in which he watches TV, gets his hair 
            cut, and lounges in the tub drinking high-end beer, all done, of 
            course, on schedule.&nbsp; Indeed, the only distress in Will's life 
            resides in the chic recycled barn-door screen inside his spotless 
            ultra-modern flat; it adds an ironic counterpart of real life to his 
            wastrel lifestyle.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Will's only real interest revolves 
            around the pursuit of women, especially ones whom he can snag, shag 
            and shed with the same monotonous regularity that he brings to the 
            rest of his life.&nbsp; He takes his pursuit seriously (to the point 
            where he infiltrates an Amnesty International phone-a-thon in order 
            to chat up new prospects).&nbsp; Will sums up his attitude toward life 
            thusly:&nbsp; &quot;A person's life is like a TV show.&nbsp; I am the star of The 
            Will Show, and The Will Show is not an ensemble drama.&quot;&nbsp; This 
            doesn't mean, of course, that he isn't adverse to having a 
            occasional guest star in his life – until he becomes uncomfortable 
            and panics about the inevitable slide from of a particular woman 
            from being a bit player into a more permanent co-starring role.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">At one point, having run out of 
            women to torment, his desperation leads him infiltrate a 
            single-parents group.&nbsp; After having lied his way into the group's 
            confidence, and, by chance and a few complicated plot twists, he 
            encounters a twelve-year-old boy named Marcus (Hoult, in a winning 
            performance).&nbsp; Marcus' life exists in a 180-degree realm from 
            Will's:&nbsp; Marcus suffers at the hands of his mother, Fiona (Collette, 
            equally as winning), whose mental disorder frequently culminates in 
            one suicide attempt after another.&nbsp; Even when she isn't trying to 
            kill herself, she has extremely adverse effects on her son: her 
            hippie clothing and bohemian behavior has also caused Marcus to 
            suffer at the hands of his classmates, who abuse and bully him for 
            his mother's awful&nbsp; insistence that she accompany him to school.&nbsp; As 
            if she couldn't torment her son any further, she calls out, &quot;I love 
            you&quot; after him as he walks past the school bullies straight into the 
            classroom.&nbsp; It somehow seems appropriate that her tastes in &quot;modern&quot; 
            music run more to Roberta Flack than to rap, because, in the process 
            of raising her son, she is, to quote the lyrics from her favorite 
            song, &quot;killing him softly.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Will's assistance following one of 
            the suicide attempts, and his casually-tossed out &quot;See you around&quot; 
            after the whole affair leads Marcus to believe that Will really 
            means it.&nbsp; Soon thereafter, he begins to make regular – and 
            unwelcome -- appearances at Will's flat.&nbsp; During the next eighty 
            minutes or so, Will has to cope with Marcus and the emergence of a 
            new woman named Rachel (Weisz) in his life. Having suddenly 
            discovered a use for Marcus as chick bait, Will puts him to work, 
            only to find that an entire lifetime of habitual infidelities – at 
            all levels of life – may just catch up with him at the least 
            opportune moment.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Filmmakers Chris and John Weitz&nbsp; 
            (the co-directors of <i>American Pie </i>and the co-screenwriters of
            <i>Antz</i>) want to take this scenario and turn it into a 
            delightfully playful meditation on the old no-man-is-an-island 
            theory.&nbsp; The symbolism used in the film telegraphs the ironic 
            changes that will occur in the narrative (Will as a &quot;free man&quot;; the 
            paralleling of Fiona and Will's obsessions with sex and death, 
            respectively, etc.), and it is, admittedly, cleverly accomplished 
            without being heavy-handed, if somewhat simplistic.&nbsp; However, <i>
            About A Boy</i> eventually leaves the film floating in a credibility 
            limbo, because of its treatment of its characters, particularly in 
            regard to their development along the course of the film.&nbsp; Many of 
            those changes, as a matter of fact, are so sudden that, 
            collectively, it results in a somewhat hollow feeling at the film's 
            very center.&nbsp; Even Grant's spot-on performance, treading the fine 
            line between the self-mocking and the sincere (this is one role that 
            brings out this aspect of Grant's acting style to winning effect) 
            and his fine interrelationship with Hoult's character can't conceal 
            the problem, because it is, unfortunately, part of the central 
            problem.&nbsp;&nbsp; It's redundant to state that comedies in general are not 
            obligated to provide a satisfactory closure at all levels, but it 
            shouldn't feel as if something has been put over on the audience – 
            at least, not without its consent.&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Of course, if you're able to ignore 
            this central issue, and some of the more trite aspects of the film 
            (and, admittedly, it can be done, provided you don't think too hard 
            about what you're seeing),&nbsp; then <i>About A Boy</i> is probably a 
            warm and fluffy alternative to, say, <i>Star Wars Episode II:&nbsp; 
            Attack of the Clones</i>.</font></p>
