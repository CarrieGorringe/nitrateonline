            from the '50s melodramas of Douglas Sirk (<i>Written on the Wind</i>,
            the remake of <i>Imitation of Life</i>), <i>Far From Heaven</i>
            depicts the life of an upper-class family who is about to face
            social disaster.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>On the
            surface (isn't that always the way?), Cathy and Frank Whitaker
            (Julianne Moore and Dennis Quaid) seem like the perfect 1950s
            couple.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>perky and perfectly coiffed, always happy to sip a couple of
            pre-dinner daquiris and dish dirt with the girls, especially with
            her best friend Eleonor Fine (Patricia Clarkson).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>He:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the epitome
            of the classically silent, rugged and handsome American husband, and
            a good provider, courtesy of his executive position at the Magnatech
            Corporation;<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>the Whitakers so epitomize the concept of the ideal family
            (complete with two children – a boy and a girl, naturally) that
            the corporation features them in its advertising campaign.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </span>Then, as might be expected, something goes horribly wrong
            that rips the façade right off Mr. and Mrs. Magnatech's bucolic
            life in suburban Connecticut.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Frank,
            it turns out, has a secret life, and the consequences reverberate
            beyond the walls of the Whittaker home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Under the stress of her husband's revelations, Cathy allows
            her ultra-liberal (by then-contemporary standards) opinions to lead
            her into making decisions that threaten to undermine more than her
            social standing and that of others. She befriends her
            African-American gardener (Dennis Haysbert), and the line between
            doing good deeds and her personal feelings begins to blur very
            dangerously.</b><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Director Todd Haynes and Julianne
            Moore have worked together before, on her breakthrough role in <i>Safe</i>
            (1995), a trenchant satire on cults and the solipsistic lifestyles
            of the '90s.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>In <i>Heaven</i>, Haynes showcases her considerable
            talent with ease.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As in
            her previous film, <i>World Traveller</i>, Moore is required to
            carry the film's emotional weight, and here she does this
            brilliantly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As the
            film moves from broad satire to serious drama, Moore's sensibilities
            shift with exquisite subtlety; she glides imperceptivity<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>through the process. She infuses Cathy with just the right
            mixture of winsomeness, sensuality and vulnerability from frame one
            and never falters throughout (it's truly an Oscar-caliber piece of
            work).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>For his part,
            Haysbert conveys a sense of quiet strength without slipping into a
            parody of the '50s concept of the &quot;noble Negro&quot; (à la
            Sidney Poitier in any number of Stanley Kramer productions). The
            overall &quot;look&quot; of the film is stunningly and uncannily
            accurate (Haynes has stated that he and production designer Mark
            Friedberg – the latter was responsible for the spot-on historical
            1970's details in <i>The Ice Storm</i> – combed through back
            issues of <i>House &amp; Garden</i> to arrive at this level of
            historical authenticity).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Unfortunately,
            the script doesn't possess this same attention to detail in terms of
            effective plotting:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>through
            the transition from broad satire to what is, in the end, overly
            simplistic, obvious and ineffective social comment, the film shifts
            gears clumsily and too drastically, as if in an attempt to make up
            time after lingering too long on the atmosphere.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>What should have been a smooth transition between satire and
            melodrama isn't, making the film's final half seem unconvincing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Only Moore and Haysbert's performances provide enough
            chemistry to drag the film through to its pat and all-too
            predictable ending.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As
            an homage to Douglas Sirk's oeuvre, it falls flat. Despite all the
            overblown dialogue and situations, the hallmark of a Sirkian
            melodrama was its underlying belief that there remained real people
            with real issues of loss and vulnerability who had something to
            lose; Sirk never appeared to be patronizing its audience.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>In this case of Heaven, all that remains is tiresome tragedy
            and the sense that fine actors have been cast in roles unworthy of
            their talents (Sirk would never have allowed his lead character to
            have been treated so shabbily, as Cathy is).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The overall result makes it appear as though Haynes has
            abandoned his usual sureness of hand and doesn't have much
            confidence in his material.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Far
            From</i> <i>Heaven</i> is a film that strays too far from its lofty
            ambitions and becomes far from persuasive.</font></p>
