            <span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="5">Wanting </font>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700">
            <font size="2">Sean Bateman (James Van Der Beek) is bored and angry. 
            As usual. It's getting late, his face is bruised from a recent 
            beat-down, and he's scouting potential action at the End of the 
            World Party. True, he's already f*cked most of the desirable girls 
            at Camden College. But, as he puts it in voiceover, &quot;I'm a vampire, 
            an emotional vampire. I feed off of other people's real emotions.&quot; 
            And so he pursues his prey. &quot;Who would it be?&quot; he wonders, in 
            voiceover. The blond by the pool table. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">She's his best 
            option now, if only because he's already been rejected by the girl 
            he thought he wanted because he thought she wanted him. Lauren Hynde 
            (Shannyn Sossamon) imagined for a minute that Sean was nice, but 
            quickly discovered that, in fact and in spite of his efforts to the 
            contrary, he's unpleasant, and that he slept with her roommate, Lara 
            (Jessica Biel). And so, on this End of the World Party night, Lauren 
            is also looking for a partner. More precisely, she's looking to lose 
            her virginity before the night's over. Ignoring Sean with the sort 
            of coldness that afflicts girls recently betrayed by crushes, she 
            pretends to be interested in a film student's pseudo-philosophical 
            rap. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Lauren's 
            voiceover reveals that she used to want to get with Victor (Kip 
            Pardue), but he's nominally unavailable, supposedly dating Lara, 
            who's more &quot;experienced&quot; (she gets around, a mini-flashback 
            revealing that she once &quot;did the whole football team&quot;). Determined 
            to change her own life, Lauren drinks enough to pass out in the film 
            student's room, then wakes to find herself being videotaped by said 
            student, as his buddy rapes her. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">At the same 
            time that these two movements come to tawdry climax, Paul Denton 
            (Ian Somerhalder) is trying to make his own predatory dreams come 
            true. Having been rejected by Sean, he hits on a football player, 
            who looks, maybe, like he'd be interested. Bad idea. Even if he was 
            so inclined, Pretty Jock Boy can't possibly engage in such activity 
            in his dorm room; he has a reputation. He makes a grand display of 
            kicking Paul out the door, so the girls in the hall are sure to know 
            that he's Not Gay. Because, well, it's important that they know 
            that, you know. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">All these bits 
            of stories unfurl at the beginning of <i>The Rules of Attraction</i>, 
            Roger Avary's adaptation of Brett Easton Ellis' 1987 novel. And if 
            the stories sound vaguely familiar, if a little meaner-toned than 
            some, they come at you in more surprising ways. They come at you 
            forwards and backwards, intimating an arty simultaneity and, more to 
            the point, the limitations (narrative, emotional, aesthetic) of 
            linearity. So: as Lauren's section (the first one you see) ends, the 
            film speedily rewinds -- on both visual and audio tracks, the latter 
            creating a sinister, vaguely &quot;The-walrus-is-Paul&quot; effect -- until it 
            picks up some anonymous someone who leads you to the next story, 
            Paul's, and then again, when his section is done, the film zips back 
            once again to show the onset of Sean's ghastly prowling. </font>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The rewinding 
            trick escalates after these first scenes, which actually constitute 
            the end of the story. From here, the movie goes back in time to the 
            beginning of the semester, before everyone has turned so miserably 
            self-destructive and terrible to one another. The nonlinear 
            structure and the rewinding might have seemed merely gimmicky (and 
            there are other aspects of the film that are, including the drug 
            dealers who assault Sean, as twitchy-thuggy-clichéd as they come), 
            but here it makes thematic as well as stylistic sense. Paul, Sean, 
            Lauren, and Lara live in a kind of accelerated isolation, afraid to 
            connect and afraid to be alone, afraid to move and always in motion. 
            (Perhaps the most compelling instance comes in the insta-recap of 
            Victor's European tour, a little over a minute on screen, 
            accompanied by his restive voiceover, listing brief impressions: 
            Amsterdam, Paris, Dublin, Barcelona, Switzerland, &quot;like a Polanski 
            film&quot;). </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Avary comes by 
            his aesthetic excesses honestly, at least in the sense that he has 
            apparently absorbed and now redeploys his own past. He co-wrote <i>
            Pulp Fiction</i>, then made the decidedly creepy <i>Killing Zoe</i>. 
            As imperfect as these earlier ventures might have been, with <i>
            Rules of Attraction</i>, he's found his ideal point of departure. He 
            transforms the novel's dodgy kids-on-collision-courses concept into 
            a crisp, unnerving dissection of human desires and cruelties. Where 
            Ellis got at different, simultaneous points of view in the usual way 
            -- brief, separate, sequential prose sections, each named for the 
            character speaking -- Avary goes for a less literal, more dazzling 
            visual commotion.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">A dark 
            rejoinder to conventional &quot;college movies,&quot; <i>The Rules of 
            Attraction</i> offers little in the way of broad humor or endearing 
            characters, romance or resolution. And it will upset some viewers, 
            its violence and malice lingering, without overt salvation attached. 
            That's not to say the characters don't comprehend the abject nature 
            of their milieu. But their self-awareness leads not to resistance, 
            but to immersion. School is an endurance test, leading nowhere they 
            want to go. Usually, they skip classes. When Lauren does attend a 
            &quot;tutorial,&quot; her professor (Eric Stoltz, star of <i>Killing Zoe</i>) 
            invites her to give him a blowjob, to guarantee her grade. Instead 
            of going to classes, they party desperately (despite Lauren's 
            efforts to dissuade herself, by looking at medical textbooks 
            picturing the effects of venereal diseases). Instead of imagining a 
            future, they descend into a furious, ongoing present, focused on sex 
            and drugs. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Paul, for one 
            example, focuses his energies on Sean (brother of <i>American Psycho</i>'s 
            Patrick), whom he wants more than he can say. He starts believing 
            that Sean's occasional visits to his dorm room to listen to his &quot;faggoty 
            synth-pop CDs&quot; mean something, other than demonstrations of Sean's 
            vast boredom and derision. Frantic to catch Sean's attention, Paul 
            finds himself called away by his difficult mummy Eve (Faye Dunaway), 
            who needs him to smooth out an engagement in the city, with her 
            friend Mimi Jared (Swoosie Kurtz), where Paul watches the ladies be 
            horrified by the outrageous, outraged performance of his friend Dick 
            (Russell Sams). Alarming parental units is, apparently, the most 
            affecting form of entertainment the kids can conjure. The familial 
            upset lets Paul off the hook, however, and he rushes back to campus, 
            in hopes of securing Sean's attentions for the evening. Sean, 
            meanwhile, quite willfully has no idea that he's being so pursued, 
            and when he does find out, dismisses Paul as cruelly as he can.
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Sean is a 
            half-assed dealer, apparently just to be one (&quot;Sometimes I can't 
            believe the sh*t that drops out of my mouth&quot;), which means he must 
            negotiate not only with those savage local thugs, but more 
            infuriatingly, with nonpaying clients. His visit to heroin addict 
            Marc (Fred Savage) ends not in payment, but in the client's 
            self-preserving exegesis of &quot;time&quot;: Marc holds forth on clocks: 
            &quot;They interfere with your ability to adjust time to suit your 
            needs.&quot; This makes a kind of sense, or it might, if Sean wasn't in a 
            hurry. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Sean distracts 
            himself, from himself, by believing that the lavender love letters 
            appearing in his otherwise empty mailbox are from the luscious 
            virgin Lauren. This makes her seem, momentarily, desirable, a vague 
            source of redemption and bad poetry. The film allows him a single 
            moment of rightness, stunningly devised. He and Lauren walk through 
            a classroom building on a Saturday, coming from opposite directions, 
            lost and looking, for what they may not know. As they approach one 
            another, the screen splits, so that they appear to be walking into 
            one another's spaces, and as they meet in a hallway, the split 
            screen merges, and they gaze on one another, two beautiful young 
            people, in any other movie destined to be together. They speak and 
            smile. It's a lovely first moment, full of possibility, 
            spectacularly framed by that dramatic camera trick, and then: gone.
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The film does 
            occasionally take time to take a breath, and more importantly, to 
            make you take one. In fact, it rather screeches to a dreadful, if 
            temporary, halt when one student commits a bloody bathtub suicide. 
            Though her reasons remain a mystery to her fellows, you know she's 
            driven because she feels invisible, unnoticed by the callow object 
            of her affection (and while she has many choices of callow objects, 
            she picks the worst of all). Most disturbingly, the death sneaks up 
            on you, makes you question your own response to it an to all that 
            comes before and after. With this scene, the film most visibly 
            constructs a fragile moral framework, quite beyond the comprehension 
            of its protagonists, who remain immersed, exiting the film 
            devastated yet unenlightened. Their fleeting associations only 
            underline their losses. Attraction is not comprised of rules, only 
            missed opportunities.</font></span></td>
