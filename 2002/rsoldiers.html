            wasn't so long ago that U.S. war movies opened like other movies,
            with premieres attended by movie stars and journalists who describe
            what they're wearing. Nowadays, the context is changed, and war
            movies like <i>Black Hawk Down</i> are opening with solemnity and a
            sense of mission, with ceremonies attended by non-Hollywood notables
            like Donald Rumsfeld or Dick Cheney and the Mrs. The latest movie to
            garner such attention is <i>We Were Soldiers</i>, which star Mel
            Gibson screened for G.W. at the White House on 27 February. </b><o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Using
            big, splashy Hollywood movies to promote patriotic spirit and
            domestic enthusiasm for U.S. war-making is hardly a new concept:
            think John Wayne, Audie Murphy, Gary Cooper, even Yankee Doodle
            Dandy Cagney. Though the thorny U.S. involvements in Korea and
            Vietnam (goodness, even Hiroshima) made such high profile self-love
            projects more difficult, they did not make them impossible.
            Aggressively anti-war in Vietnam movies were, of course, extremely
            visible -- from <i>Taxi Driver</i> (1976), <i>The Deer Hunter</i>
            (1978), and <i>Apocalypse Now</i> (1979), to <i>Platoon</i> (1986), <i>Full
            Metal Jacket</i> (1987), and <i>Boyz N the Hood</i> (1991), not to
            mention the less visible, but influential Oscar-winning documentary,
            <i>Hearts and Minds</i> (1974): no one who's seen it can forget
            General Westmoreland observing that the &quot;Oriental&quot; lacks a
            Westerner's regard for human life, while the film cuts to a
            Vietnamese woman throwing herself into her dead son's grave.
            Released just before the fall of Saigon in April 1975, this was a
            chilling image of the man who had been leading U.S. troops into
            battle. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Today,
            wars tend to be fought without the ideological padding of such overt
            racism, though carefully inculcated, dehumanizing bigotry remains
            the most efficient way to get young soldiers to kill other young
            soldiers (and &quot;collateral damage&quot;). But war movies (with
            the notable exception of David O. Russell's <i>Three Kings</i>)
            still make out like any old racism will do: the &quot;enemy&quot; in
            recent movies -- and on CNN and Fox News -- looks exotic,
            inscrutable, and overly committed to a cause that remains
            unfathomable to innocently by-standing &quot;Westerners&quot; (read:
            mostly white, mostly middle to upper class, mostly U.S.). <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's
            no surprise that those movies released after 9-11 are being deployed
            to boost wartime &quot;morale,&quot; even though they were plainly
            conceived and completed before 9-11: these include <i>The Last
            Castle</i>, <i>Behind Enemy Lines</i>, <i>Black Hawk Down</i>, <i>Hart's
            War</i>, and <i>We Were Soldiers</i> (films must plainly be
            &quot;historical&quot; to be counted as serious). Each movie
            reframes a past U.S. war by revising popular conceptions (for
            instance, that the Mogadishu raid was disastrous, or that the Nazis
            were the only outright racists during WWII). And, at least in the
            cases of <i>BHD</i> and <i>We Were Soldiers</i>, the subjects are
            complex, confusing moral and military engagements, if not outright
            failures, however you define such a thing in terms of war, where,
            arguably, no one can &quot;win.&quot; <o:p>

            Gibson himself seems to be under few illusions regarding war:
            &quot;It's all about money, isn't it?&quot; he says in <i>Esquire</i>
            (Feb 2002). And yet, the once-and-ever Road Warrior clearly
            understands the values and functions of representing it in
            particular ways, having worked hard to get &quot;it&quot; right in <i>Gallipoli</i>,
            <i>Braveheart</i>, and <i>The Patriot</i>. It's perhaps instructive
            that he played characters who were part of the more or less
            &quot;underdog&quot; contingents in each of these films, fighting
            back against notoriously oppressive regimes, while in <i>We Were
            Soldiers</i>, well, he's part of the invasive outsiders' force. As
            Gibson puts it, the North Vietnamese &quot;had a grievance. I mean,
            what would <b><i>you</i></b> do if someone came into your
            country?&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            is surely a question worth asking, repeatedly, even now, when the
            U.S. is in the long-term process of responding to such an attack.
            But while Gibson (no doubt sincerely) believes that <i>We Were
            Soldiers</i> is an anti-war movie, and not only an anti-war in
            Vietnam movie, it is also being used otherwise by the powers that
            be, or perhaps better, the powers that can't help themselves. Touted
            and received as a movie about heroic soldiering, it's not going to
            convince anyone that the U.S. needs to reconsider the upcoming
            increase in the Pentagon's budget. On this, Gibson is right: war is
            about money (the WTC and Pentagon assaults demonstrated that the
            so-called &quot;first world&quot; is not the only body that thinks
            this way). And money is always connected, intimately and painfully,
            to property and payback. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Against
            this dense and difficult background, <i>We Were Soldiers</i> is,
            above all, an earnest film. It works hard (and a long time -- at
            almost three hours) not to be a standard U.S. war movie where the
            good (white) boys fight against diabolical &quot;others.&quot;
            Though it is most certainly about U.S. troops' fear and bravery when
            sent on an insane, impossible operation, it also attempts to show
            the Vietnamese as noble adversaries. So, while Gibson's Lt. Colonel
            Hal Moore and men roar around up top, the regulars of the North
            Vietnamese Army (NVA) appear in tunnels, planning their resistance
            and preparing for battle (they even have subtitles so you can
            understand them, and one has a photo of a girlfriend that he carries
            with him into battle -- and this dooms him, of course, as it would
            any movie soldier), and then, waging able and brutal war against
            their enemies. While this representation isn't revolutionary, it is
            more apparently respectful than that in the best known anti-war
            movies set in Vietnam -- from the most heartfelt (<i>Platoon</i>),
            to the most rock n' roll (<i>Apocalypse Now</i>), to the most
            aggressively intelligent (<i>Full Metal Jacket</i>). <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still,
            most of the time, <i>We Were Soldiers</i> just can't get out of its
            own way. For one thing, it only takes this &quot;equal&quot;
            deference business so far. This is likely a &quot;money&quot; thing,
            too. Surely, it's easier to sell a movie (during wartime and not)
            that takes a &quot;rousing,&quot; pick-a-side approach, than one
            caught up in balanced viewpoints. Viewers, the common wisdom goes,
            need to be able to root for a team. To this end, Randall Wallace's <i>We
            Were Soldiers</i> tends to fall back, too easily, on its star (who
            also powered, and directed, Wallace's screenplay for <i>Braveheart</i>).
            Gibson's Lt. Colonel Hal Moore (whose book, <i>We Were Soldiers
            Once... And Young</i>, written with journalist Joe Galloway, is the
            film's basis) is a rock of a character, gallant, tender, smart, and
            above all, heroic -- when he walks through gunfire and explosions,
            he seems awesome. (But when Robert Duvall's Colonel Kilgore does the
            same thing in <i>Apocalypse Now</i>, he looks psychotic.) <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            use of the rally-round-him hero is to be expected in a
            commercial-minded movie, but it's still disappointing, since <i>We
            Were Soldiers</i> does raise some dicey questions (even if it does
            mostly drop them). It opens on a battlefield, the camera panning the
            Ia Drang Valley in South Vietnam's Central Highlands. (Actually,
            this bit of scenery has been shot near Fort Hunter Liggett in
            Central California, U.S. filming as in Vietnam is still... how to
            say?... impractical.) This image is accompanied by an earnest
            voice-over by reporter Joe Galloway (Barry Pepper), asserting that
            what follows is a &quot;tribute to the people who died&quot; in the
            legendary battle of Landing Zone X-Ray, 14-16 November 1965, the
            first major battle between U.S. troops and the NVA. The people who
            died, in other words, include Vietnamese as well as Americans. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">To
            tell the story, Galloway continues, he must &quot;go back to the
            beginning,&quot; represented here as French troops who are about to
            be chased out of Vietnam in 1954 (after maintaining some form of
            colonialist fight with the Vietnamese since the 1850s). The camera
            continues to move across the landscape, as a French captain
            (Nicholas Hosking) lists the reasons he hates the war he's in: the
            &quot;f*cking heat,&quot; the &quot;f*cking grass,&quot; the
            &quot;f*cking country.&quot; Within seconds, the captain is killed. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            choice of &quot;beginning&quot; illustrates the dangerous sense of
            superiority and entitlement that convinced all varieties of invaders
            they would march into Vietnam and &quot;win&quot; (even if the
            choice does omit many other possible &quot;beginnings&quot; -- for
            examples, Vietnam's wars with China and Japan. Indeed, the U.S. used
            Japan to set up a &quot;common enemy&quot; connection between a
            youthful and democratic-minded Ho Chi Minh, whom the U.S. would then
            abandon to the French... and, etc.) This choice also conveniently
            leaves the French bearing the bad colonialists' weight and lets the
            film's U.S. heroes-to-be operate without such political baggage. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">These
            heroes -- the Army's First Cavalry Division (Airmobile) -- are
            delivered by helicopters into the horrendous (&quot;hot&quot;)
            Landing Zone, where they are faced with all kinds of gun, tank, and
            missile fire, then picked up and carried away afterwards, whether
            dead, wounded, or alive. As crazy as it sounds, this plot only hints
            at the absurdity facing U.S. soldiers told to &quot;take&quot;
            ground and then abandon it, kill thousands (some 2000 Vietnamese
            died during the two day battle, along with 79 U.S. casualties), and
            then go to another site and kill some more. And the film spends a
            good long time underscoring the terrors of this particular battle,
            as it also represents what's to come. And the terrors come pretty
            relentlessly, as soon as the guys are dropped off those choppers
            (one piloted by Greg Kinnear, an alarming thought in itself; he

            Geoghegan, Edwin Morrow's Pvt. Godboldt, Mark McCracken's &quot;Too
            Tall&quot; Freeman) end up looking bland compared to Moore's
            towering charisma. That this performance includes recognition that
            war is hell and Moore, though he's very good at it, hates it too, is
            part of the formula. He tells his men before they leave that he will
            leave no one behind, that they will all come back with him, dead or
            alive. It's a heck of a speech, and Moore delivers it with a pride
            that's part paternal and part self-involved. You get the feeling
            that this is one reluctant hero is totally ready and even determined

            Julie (Madeleine Stowe) is especially sad, perhaps because she knows
            that he's been obsessively studying Custer's Last Stand (this is not
            a little distressing, as is the fact that he leaves her in the
            middle of the night without waking her to say goodbye: must be a
            stoic soldier thing). Moore is also a superb dad to five kids (I
            think I counted five), including one adorable cherub in a nightgown
            who asks him to define &quot;war,&quot; which he does by saying that
            it's &quot;something that shouldn't happen, but it does.&quot; She's
            not quite satisfied, so he continues, it's &quot;when some people
            try to take the lives of other people, and my job is to go over

            men into battle, he's right about the that &quot;some people try to
            take the lives of other people,&quot; and that he tries to stop 'em.
            But <i>We Were Soldiers</i> is not about tactics or even character.
            It's about the demands of war that no one can imagine ahead of time.
            There is really no way to describe the &quot;job.&quot; So the women
            (including Jack Geoghegan's pregnant wife, played by Keri Russell)
            are left behind to contemplate their imminent losses, while finding
            ways to spend their time at the base (planning lunches, locating the
            best off-base markets) and peering out their windows, dreading the
            cab driver who will arrive with &quot;Regret to Inform&quot;
            telegrams in hand (ironically, the U.S. military was notoriously
            terrible at handling death when it came to informing relatives of
            U.S. personnel). <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Such
            scenes are harrowing. But the film's time and place -- 1965 Georgia
            -- means that it must address at least a smidgen of the women's
            daily lives, including racism. That it deals with racism via the
            women's group rather than the men is an remarkable choice in itself,
            and, like the choice of the war's &quot;beginning,&quot; it's
            slightly disingenuous. The Big Moment comes when one of the white
            wives, chattering in front of the group's only black wife, mistakes
            a &quot;Whites Only&quot; sign for a direction as to what laundry
            goes in what machine. That she must be instructed as to the actual
            meaning of the sign is upsetting, of course, but the wives are all
            so mutually supportive and sweet that she doesn't feel too horrible.

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            the weird part is that you don't feel too bad either. And if
            anything, this scene should make you cringe. That this is a myth
            that pervaded (and continues to pervade) white America has
            everything to do with the longer book's title, <i>We Were Soldiers
            Once... and Young</i>. Naïveté is not a good excuse for ignorance
            or racism. The film -- in its ad campaign as well as in its thematic
            focus -- clearly ants to include domestic effects of war (the words
            that most soldiers say when they die on the battlefield are,
            &quot;Tell my wife I love her&quot;). And so this scene with the
            wives stands out, as one where the reasons that U.S. soldiers go to
            war -- to defend freedom and civil rights -- were, then and now, in
            constant jeopardy, at home as well as &quot;over there.&quot;</font></span><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"></o:p>
