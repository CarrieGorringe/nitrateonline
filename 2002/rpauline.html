            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">To the growing list of actors 
            convincingly playing the mentally diminished – Russell Crowe, Sean 
            Penn and Judi Dench most recently – add 73-year-old Dora van der 
            Groen. The fact that most filmgoers (including me) have never heard 
            of this “national treasure” of Belgium only aids in the appreciation 
            of her affecting portrayal of an elderly retarded woman as genuine 
            devotion to an actor’s craft. No one is likely to accuse this 
            obscure veteran of seventy films of Oscar-chasing.</font></b><p>
            <font face="Verdana" size="2">Pauline ages within a life that is as 
            simple as her mind. She lives with Martha, the eldest of her three 
            sisters in a Flemish village, where her biggest daily decision is to 
            choose jam or chocolate spread for her toast.&nbsp; She is drawn 
            irresistibly to beauty, cuts pictures of flowers for a scrapbook, 
            and is easily distracted from her errands to the butcher by the 
            delicate window displays of her sister Paulette’s fussy boutique.</font><p>
            <font face="Verdana" size="2">Paulette (Ann Petersen) finds her 
            sister’s mooning to be an irritation, disrupting her matronly 
            orderliness and annoying her customers. Yet the two have much in 
            common. Paulette rules over her shop and frilly apartment like a 
            perfumed lavender poodle, and commands the village’s operetta as its 
            grand diva. She surrounds herself with the fragile and the precious, 
            and bristles at Pauline’s disruptive interest.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When Martha dies, her will demands 
            that either Paulette or youngest sister Cecile (who lives in 
            Brussels) care for Pauline to release the estate. First Paulette 
            tries, then Cecile. It’s clear and no surprise who Pauline prefers.
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As the first feature for director 
            Lieven Debrauwer, it bursts with quality and refreshes by honestly 
            showing the ugly distaste many display when confronted with the 
            special needs of another. The butcher’s wife is only minimally 
            patient with Pauline as a customer, and seldom conceals her disdain. 
            Cecile’s French boyfriend, while otherwise charming,&nbsp; feels no 
            compunction about displaying his resentment of Pauline’s intrusion 
            into their carefully constructed routine. Pauline’s neediness is 
            unrelenting, unable to tie her own shoes, spread her own jam or 
            remember her instructions reliably. As offenses, they are mild, yet 
            we sympathize with Paulette’s desire to get on with her own 
            dwindling days.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In this touching story of two 
            sisters learning to accommodate each other late in life, Debrauwer 
            consistently conveys the essence of being firmly settled. One senses 
            a larger metaphor looming, one for Belgium itself, smug in its 
            European elegance and comfort. The festival of flowers that Cecile 
            and Pauline enjoy in the Brussels square is a model of Flemish 
            orderliness: beautiful, methodical and remote. The film’s nagging 
            limit is that it never acknowledges such a theme, preferring its own 
            feel-good warmth, and consequently feeling like it hasn’t got much 
            to say. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Such confinement might, to an 
            intellectual viewer, be as frustrating as trying to help someone 
            like Pauline. Yet, after the award-conscious earnestness of so many 
            Hollywood attempts, van der Groen’s unflinching and authentic 
            performance is also a welcome relief. </font></td>
