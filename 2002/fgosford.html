<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In this year's voting by
the Kansas City Film Critics Circle, hometown director Robert Altman lost out to
<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Lord of the Rings</i> helmer Peter
Jackson. This might seem a slight because Altman was not only born there but had
learned his trade at the local Calvin Company, which made industrial promotional
films. From there, he later rose to fame directing movies and TV shows like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Bonanza</i>,
<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Alfred Hitchcock Presents</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Combat!</i>
and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Tanner 88</i> (for which he won an Emmy). When someone lamented that the
town's favorite son candidate should have won for his most recent entry <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Gosford
Park</i>, another critic retorted, &quot;He doesn't need our help this
time!&quot;</b></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">His hometown may have passed
Altman over because <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Gosford Park</i> has
already earned him Best Director honors from the New York Film Critics, the
American Film Institute and the Golden Globes. The Directors Guild of American
didn't vote for him, but this week Altman is on his way to get a lifetime
achievement at this year's Berlinale.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Altman, who turns
seventy-seven this month, is back in commercial and critical favor. Like his
previous movies <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">M*A*S*H</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Nashville</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Player</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Gosford
Park</i> features documentary-like camerawork and overlapping dialogue. As with
his western <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">McCabe and Mrs. Miller</i> and
his Philip Marlowe mystery <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Long
Goodbye</i>, Altman turns genres inside out. An intriguing blend of Agatha
Christie whodunit and backstairs class struggle, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Gosford
Park</i> follows the skullduggery that occurs among both the masters and
servants during a rural shooting party in 1932 England. Thanks to a tight,
detailed script by Julian Fellowes and a dream cast of British thespians like
Dame Maggie Smith, Sir Derek Jacobi, Sir Michael Gambon, Jeremy Northam, Emily
Watson and Kristin Scott Thomas, the film is a welcome addition to the
director's formidable canon. Contacted by phone in Los Angeles last December,
Altman proved that age hasn't made him any less defiant, articulate or relevant.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">Dan
Lybarger:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i> </i>Some people were
surprised that you were willing to take on a British period film like this one,
but this film has a lot of the overlapping dialogue and other trademarks we
associate with you.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Robert
Altman: </i></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">I'm surprised that people
are surprised. It's an English picture, but, my God, we're all so familiar with
all that stuff, aren't we? I think most of American culture is all little
brothers of the Brits.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>DL: </i></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
many ways the world in the movie is as foreign for younger Brits as it is for
us. A lot of the things you see the servants doing in the movie are a lost art.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">RA:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>It is. Just the equipment, the artifacts that were invented and manufactured
or made during that period were all about serving people. They were fantastic.
That stuff doesn't exist any more. They're antiques. We had a butler, a
housemaid, and a cook who were all in their late 80s who were all in the service
during the time the picture takes place. They were on the set all the time. I
was determined to get it right technically, so I wouldn't be criticized by the
English. &quot;What's an American coming over here and doing a picture about our
culture?&quot; I wanted to be sure we were right about all that stuff. I had the
time of my life doing it.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>What exactly did you like about shooting in that environment?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">RA:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>It was the best experience I've ever had. I think it was the actors, always
the actors, and the crews as well. They're just not like [Hollywood].<br>
<br>
One, I didn't see any agents [laughs]. This film couldn't have been made in
America. You couldn't have had that quality of actor standing around in that
kind of ensemble. They'll say, 'I'll come in for six of seven days.' But we shot
for ten weeks, and all those people were there almost all of the time.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>The logistics for that must have been tricky, nonetheless.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">RA:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>We shot all of the upstairs stuff and the exteriors at the beginning. Then
the servants' hall, that whole big area down on the bottom floor, was on the
soundstage. That was a set, and the attic, where the servants' rooms were. That
was a set. We couldn't shoot in sequence. It was great. It was fun.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>With all the awards and critics prizes you've won, it must be great to know
there is a market for this kind of film.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">RA:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>Is there one? I hope so [laughs]. I don't know.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>The social structure in the film is rigid but more complicated than it
initially appears. The newly rich Sir William (Gambon) is more comfortable with
his servants than he is with his own family and in-laws.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">RA:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>He's not of that class either. The social structure of the downstairs [where
the servants operate] is really more complicated and structured than the
upstairs [where the rich and the upper classes live]. The upstairs people really
have less to do. They really are isolated and insulated in their little society.
The downstairs, which mimics that society, is more complicated. There's more
stratas [sic] in it.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>In some ways this structure reminds me of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Nashville</i>.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">RA:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>My films all come through me. They all pass through me, so they're going to
all have vaguely the same shape. Those things are just going to happen. There
are similarities. There's no question about it.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Gosford Park</i> isn't the only movie
you've made that's far from your roots in Kansas City. You've only done two
movies there (1957's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Delinquents</i>
and 1996's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Kansas City</i>) and a lot of
your other movies are set in places where you'd come in as an outsider.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">RA:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>I was an outsider in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Kansas City</i>,
the jazz film. I hadn't been to Kansas City for years. I was visiting some place
between my father's stories and my memory. I love that film. My films have a
terrible time in Kansas City. They've never been really successful there. I
don't know why that is except it always seems that way. You can't go home again.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>It is there with the Calvin Company, where you learned a lot of your trade.
For those industrial films, you had to learn all of the technical skills. Other
noteworthy filmmakers never did. Kurosawa, for example, claimed he couldn't
handle a still camera.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">RA:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>I learned all that stuff. It's part of the tools. It's like a painter. If
you're going to paint a mural, the more you know about the paint, the brushes
and all the various tools you have, the easier it'll be for you to get your idea
across.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>Sound has been one of your specialties. You shift emphasis by adjusting the
volume of certain noises or lines instead of moving the camera.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">RA:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>The sound is very important to us to what we communicate. What we see and
what we hear may come at different times. We're able to split our senses and use
them all. They're all feeding information to our brains, and our brain is ending
up with an opinion.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I just try to get the
audience to do the same thing and not have it served up for them. With so much
television, everything is served up. A guy can sit there and get up in the
middle of a television drama and get a beer and when he gets back, he says,
&quot;Did he kill her yet?&quot; because he knows what's going to happen. He
doesn't even really have to witness it. There's no surprise, and these things
are told six or seven times to you. I try to set a film up to put the audience
on notice very, very early that you'd better pay attention or you're going to
miss it. Or if you don't want to pay attention, you'd just as well leave because
you're not going to like the movie.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>Speaking of that, it took me a couple of viewings to appreciate <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Gosford Park</i>. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><o:p>
</o:p>
</i></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">RA:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>You have to see it twice. That's the problem. The first time you see it, I'm
talking about a film that's any good, you're playing whodunit. By the time
you're through the plot or the whodunit part of it—I'm not referring to the
murder in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Gosford Park</i>; I'm talking
about every little detail; then you go to see it again, and you're able to look
at the corners and into the detailing of it, and you really see a different
film.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>It seems a lot funnier the second time around.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">RA:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>It is funnier. There's lines in it that you can't possibly get the first
time because you don't know where they're going. There's lots of little details.
That's the problem with movies. The convention is you see the movie once, and
you've got to get it all. So they keep it pretty simple, it's not hard to get. I
just feel there's so many interesting things going on in the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">process</i> of doing what the plot is that are much more interesting
than the plot [itself]. There's only six plots.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I know it's defeating the
success of these films by doing this, but I just have to say, if you like a
film, any film, you should go back and see it again, and you'll see a different
film. You go to see it a third time, and your own life experiences will change a
little bit. That's not the phrase I hear and have heard all of my life, and it
distresses me, and I hate it is: &quot;We're going to see so-and-so tonight. Do
you want to go?&quot; And they say, &quot;No, I've seen it.&quot; Well, that's
too bad that we accept that if you've seen it, you've taken two hours out of
your life and looked at it, and everything is digestible and understandable in
that two hours, than it's really been a waste of your time.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal">DL:</b>
</i>You still seem eager to take those kinds of risks with your films, even if
the market is saturated with popcorn flicks.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>RA:
</i></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The day I stop taking risks is the
day I'll stop working. I have no interest in those films. I'd have nothing to
officer. I couldn't do one of those films because I'd be afraid I'd be late for
work (laughs).</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>You had made some controversial remarks about Hollywood and a possible
relationship with the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. Could you explain
what you've said and how your own movies figure into this statement?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">RA:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>When I said that about the 9-11 thing, I didn't exclude myself although it
was reported that way. They came out and said, &quot;Altman blames
Hollywood.&quot; Once again, I'm in the doghouse. I didn't say that. I said WE
all have to look at what we've done and what we do and hold ourselves
responsible for this sort thing because I think we did make the training film
for those guys. There's still films that will never be released now I hope about
hijacking and things like that.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This body count thing. I
remember some film where DeNiro and Pacino (Michael Mann's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Heat</i>)
and a bunch of stars were in it, and there were cops and robbers. There were
forty policemen killed in a holdup that went awry. And then the next day,
they're talking and there's nothing in the newspaper about it. Forty policemen
were killed in Los Angeles, and you never heard any more about it. That's just
ridiculous. I think it's irresponsible. When eight-year-old and nine-year-old
kids see those things, they can't make those distinctions. They just assume
that's the way you do things. They think you can kill somebody, and it doesn't
cause any harm. These are people in black suits that don't have any identity.
They don't have any children, any parents, wives or friends. They're just
ciphers. I think that's terrible, and we have to take responsibility for putting
that kind of behavior in people's minds. If I say it, I just get in serious
trouble for it. I included myself in that just as much as I did anybody else.
But I do think that as a culture we have to be responsible.</font></p>

salesman saying, &quot;This is the best bathroom. Here is the bedroom. These
stairs lead up to the so-and-so.&quot; I'm telling you things that you're
seeing. For me to just talk or bring up an incident or something that occurred
to me, by the time I finish another sentence, it's on to another scene. It's
very hard to do those things, I think. I don't know what the reason is. I don't
know that I like them, but I'll continue to do them. I really think that nobody
sits down and listens to everything. They just pick up little details. I don't

because they don't really give a sh*t what you say, if you can sell it. The
ultimate choice of where the money goes to make these different films is where
they think they can get money back. Basically, in some other city like Denver,
where [Viacom chairman] Sumner Redstone and these guys live, these companies,
these corporations are only in it in pursuit of profit. They're all accountants.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the film business, they
have to deal with artists. Because they can't do it. We say that in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The

we've got something here.&quot; The closest they come to it is with animation,

them. That's not to say that people haven't tried to take them away from me or
that people haven't squashed them and sat on them and not let them out. From my
standpoint, it's been a great career. It is a great career because I do what
occurs to me, and I'm able to do it. I've never been without a film. So I don't
have any complaints other than the fact that I must speak out about what the
basic philosophy of this industry is to sell tickets to seventeen-year-olds.

only popcorn films can actually hurt a studio's bottom line because bad action
movies have no shelf life, whereas more unusual films can sometimes perform
better during late marketing or video.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i>RA:
</i></b>That's very rare in these studios. Most of them think their jobs are
only going to last about a week…and I hope they're right. Everything is just
for the moment. Nobody thinks about the shelf life or the late marketing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Look what's happening to my films now. They do have the DVDs, but nobody
can gather those all under one label. They're all owned by weird little people
that end up owning the negative. It's shame that, whether it's me or Paul Thomas
Anderson or <a name="_Hlt250918954" target="_top">Budd Boetticher</a>— who died just
recently and made some terrific films—or anybody, but they're owned by all
these different companies, and now everything's owned mostly by European
companies. I've chased down everything except <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Images</i>,
and I finally found that the negative of that is owned by I think a French
company.</font></p>

Gould with a .45 stuck in his hand, cigarette hanging from his mouth and a
blonde behind him, the film did not do well because they tried to sell Elliot
Gould as Humphrey Bogart. We stopped it and said, &quot;This is not
working.&quot;</font></p>

In Kansas City, my films aren't very popular. I am. My films aren't. They don't
know about most of them. I'll never forget. I went to visit my grandmother in
the 50s, and I was doing the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Bonanza</i>
television show. I went through Kansas City. &quot;Grandma, I've got a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Bonanza</i>
on tonight.&quot; That's when they were on Saturday night, opposite of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Perry

She said, &quot;Oh, boy we saw it. There your name was: 'Robert Altman.' It was
just wonderful.&quot; I said, &quot;Did you like it?&quot; She said, &quot;We
didn’t see the show. We never miss <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Perry

<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Perry Mason</i>.&quot; I thought,

doing next is this film that Alan Rudolph has written for me (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

shot around there, but I've never shot in New York before. My office has been
there for twenty-seven years. This is about an aircraft parts factory out in
Long Island, and it all takes place in that compound.</font></p>
