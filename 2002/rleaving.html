            review by <a href="../kj.html" target="_top">KJ Doughton</a>, 8 March 2002</i></font><p>
            <font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>Before Leaving (Avant de Partir)</i>, 
            the French documentary directed by Marie de Laubier, is sardine 
            can-packed with more human drama than an afternoon’s worth of 
            television soap operas, talk shows, and classic Hollywood movies. A 
            mother bickers with her daughter concerning family decisions, <i>
            Terms-of-Endearment</i> style. Some friends enjoy romantic views of 
            the Eiffel Tower from aboard a river-prowling ferryboat. A crooning 
            man serenades an older woman with heartfelt ballads, in the 
            sentimental spirit of <i>Moonstruck</i>. People die. Companions 
            gather together to don protective eyewear and view a lunar eclipse. 
            A gaggle of ladies relax and enjoy the pampering of a beauty salon 
            attendant as their hair is washed and styled. There are raucous, 
            festive birthday parties that rival <i>Titanic</i>’s foot-stomping 
            steerage shindigs, with a dozen voices belting out traditional 
            French tunes and twice as many hands clapping along. </b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With so much on hand to entertain 
            the viewer, why is it that de Laubier’s film struggles to find 
            distribution? Could it be that unlike such current 
            multiplex-haunting youth fodder as <i>The Fast and The Furious,</i> 
            and <i>Crossroads</i>, <i>Before Leaving</i> is a subtitled foray 
            into the lives of elderly nursing home patients? The film’s editor, 
            Paul deLaubier (brother of Marie), honestly admits that <i>Before 
            Leaving</i> lacks the sexy spin of such big-budget products. He 
            explains that partially because of its pesky subtitles (&quot;a big 
            no-no,&quot;) and its commercially risky subject matter, U.S. television 
            broadcasters rejected the pioneering movie.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Let’s be honest,&quot; he concedes. &quot;Do 
            people want to see old crazy people in a nursing home? PBS doesn’t 
            think so, although it’s a shame. But I’m not surprised. I think we 
            are afraid of contemplating our future, and are more comfortable 
            going by the established clichés about nursing homes as being too 
            depressing.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Indeed, <i>Before Leaving</i>’s 
            setting, a facility in the Paris suburb of Sarcelles referred to as 
            M.A.P.I. (the acronym denotes a company that manages 150 nursing 
            homes in France), should be familiar to many Stateside citizens. 
            Statistics show that nearly 2 million Americans are currently 
            residing in approximately 16,000 nursing homes around the country. 
            Meanwhile, gerontology experts claim that nearly thirty percent of 
            all United States inhabitants will spend some time during their life 
            in a nursing home, staying on average nineteen months. With these 
            striking numbers in mind, it’s likely that the very people currently 
            being entertained by the frat-house-level hi-jinks of <i>American 
            Pie</i> and <i>Slackers</i> will eventually encounter the 
            omnipresent culture of long term care. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Perhaps in the sunset of their 
            lives, such filmgoers will find themselves unable to independently 
            engage in such daily activities as bathing, feeding, toileting, and 
            maintaining grooming and hygiene, requiring a nursing home stay for 
            lengthy rehabilitation. Perhaps they’ll endure the memory-squelching 
            throes of Alzheimer’s Disease, and reside in a special dementia unit 
            under constant supervision.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Perhaps they’ll enter the field as 
            employees, hacking it out on the grunt-level CNA staff to bathe and 
            feed patients, transferring them from bed to wheelchair using 
            hydraulic hoyer lifts. Eventually, they might rise up in the ranks 
            to Administator status and run the place, like Ms. Yamina Abbes, a 
            friend of the filmmaking team who takes center stage in <i>Before 
            Leaving</i>. An energetic, sincere brunette, emoting empathy and 
            understanding with a newly-admitted patient who only wants to know 
            when lunch begins, she can also be assertive and stern, as when 
            persuading a would-be boarder that he’s too healthy and independent 
            to reside at M.A.P.I. Meanwhile, many patients proclaim, &quot;You have 
            great teeth,&quot; expressing their appreciation for her inviting smile.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;It was obvious that Yamina herself 
            very quickly forgot about the crew,&quot; observes Paul, &quot;inasmuch as a 
            two-woman crew is discreet. But she enjoyed showing her work, and 
            sometimes went to Marie to inform her that some situation developing 
            one floor below would be interesting to her. Sometimes she would ask 
            Marie and Emmanuelle [Colinot, the director’s camerawoman] not to 
            shoot, mainly out of respect for her diminished residents.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Acting as our esteemed tour guide 
            down M.A.P.I.’s multi-storied labyrinth of hallways, dining areas, 
            resident bedrooms, nursing stations, field trip buses, and 
            administrative offices, Ms. Abbes brings viewers along for a 
            bustling day of coordinating admissions, counseling family members, 
            and putting out the emotional fires for her dependent masses. As <i>
            Before Leaving</i> begins, a nurse informs us that two 
            classifications of patient reside there: those with Alzheimer’s, who 
            can recall older memories, but not current events, and psychotic 
            patients who have been institutionalized most of their lives for 
            schizophrenia-like conditions. Watching the film, however, one 
            notices that each patient transcends such classifications, revealed 
            as a singular individual with peculiar quirks, eccentricities, and 
            mannerisms all their own.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Take, for instance, Ms. Abbes’ 
            initial interview with Ms. Colizza, a stubborn matriarch who takes 
            fierce pride in once managing 400 workers as a Human Resources 
            Director. Failing memory and trembling, weakened legs have made this 
            self-proclaimed &quot;boss of everyone&quot; a dangerous liability at home. As 
            her long-suffering daughter reluctantly admits Colizza, the defiant 
            mother proclaims, &quot;Thank you for a dreadful day. You’re trying to 
            get rid of me!&quot; Scoffing at the notion of being confined to M.A.P.I., 
            she crosses arms across her chest and spews sarcasm like <i>The Lion 
            King</i>’s conniving villain, Scar. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After a few minutes with Ms. Abbes, 
            whom she admires as a fellow leader, Colizza mellows out, reassuring 
            the administrator that &quot;I think we’ll get along just fine.&quot; When Ms. 
            Abbes asks why, the new resident’s response is a telling commentary 
            on what this intensely independent woman values in life, even when 
            mind and body are compromising such self-reliance. &quot;We both have the 
            same authority,&quot; Colizza explains with a mischievous, 
            &quot;between-you-and-me&quot; smile. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A few moments pass, and the 
            incredibly busy nursing home coordinator is overseeing the 
            orientation of another new client, Mireille. After remarking on her 
            colorful head of hair, Ms. Abbes is scolded. &quot;You called me a 
            red-head,&quot; screeches Mirielle, who recently escaped from a 
            psychiatric ward with her boyfriend and was refused re-admittance 
            there. &quot;Don’t call me that.&quot; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ms. Abbes works her magic, 
            introducing the perpetually grinning, toothless woman to the 
            facility’s food services coordinator after being told by a caregiver 
            that Mirielle’s favorite part of the day is &quot;lunchtime.&quot; &quot;You’re 
            nice,&quot; says Mirielle, warming to the considerate administrator. &quot;I 
            love you with all my heart.&quot; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;A central theme with Yamina,&quot; 
            explains Paul, &quot;is to give her residents the same respect and 
            attention you would to your own friends. Never to infantilize them. 
            She says herself that she, as a person, learns more from her 
            residents that anyone else. She also makes it a point of knowing 
            them on a personal basis. After all,’ she says, ‘we practically live 
            together. More than that, I work where they live.’&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;It’s clear to me,&quot; he continues, 
            &quot;that the attention she gives them, along with the trust they 
            develop in her, are the keys to running a successful home, where 
            success is measured not in French Francs or Euros, but in harmony 
            and friendship.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Even so, <i>Before Leaving</i> 
            makes it clear that M.A.P.I.’s success is a team effort, dependent 
            on the strengths of other gifted professionals, such as the nursing 
            team that must alert family members to a loved one’s death. Entering 
            the room of a long-time resident and finding her stiff and lifeless 
            in bed, they dress the body in a favored wardrobe and brush her 
            hair. It’s clear that the deceased women’s care team, so 
            instrumental in serving her during these senior years, know best how 
            she would have wanted to appear at this final stage. As viewers, we 
            consider such final post-life rituals with new understanding. 
            Someone has concluded her arc of life, and as a C.N.A. slowly shuts 
            the room’s window shade and the scene fades into darkness, the 
            finality is devastating.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In extreme contrast to such 
            emotionally gripping moments, <i>Before Leaving</i> devotes most of 
            its time to the hustling, bustling, <i>carpe diem</i> vibe that 
            inhabits this vibrant elderly community. Rather than come across 
            with the grim, somber feel of a funeral dirge – the common 
            assumption made by outsiders concerning what skilled nursing 
            facilities are like – the M.A.P.I. is more akin to a colony of 
            scurrying, scampering bees. Center-stage is their queen, the 
            ever-present Ms. Abbes, who is referred to by one grateful 
            home-dweller as &quot;Mrs. Master of the Poor.&quot; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Another staff member providing a 
            light, life-affirming mood is Tom, who dutifully takes M.A.P.I.’s 
            residents out on shopping trips while he isn’t serenading guests of 
            honor at lavish, upbeat birthday parties in the facility’s lively 
            dining room. &quot;Are you the Coco of my heart?&quot; he asks a celebrated 
            centurion. &quot;Let’s leave here on a horse. Let’s go crazy!&quot; With a 
            flirty, dismissive chuckle, Coco shoos off the would-be suitor, 
            turns to another resident, and giggles, &quot;I don’t believe a word of 
            it. It passes the time, I guess.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">During such high-spirited moments, 
            there’s a sense of positive regard and tactile affection that 
            appears innocent and fresh. A silver-haired gent named Mr. Simon 
            emerges to kiss his beloved Suzanne. A C.N.A. is seen caressing a 
            woman’s hair, or greeting an emerging partygoer with an affectionate 
            peck on the cheek. Maybe it’s a French characteristic, 
            representative of that country’s less inhibited vibe. In this age of 
            &quot;hands-off&quot;, politically-correct coldness in U.S. health care 
            policy, such signs of genuine mutual love make one lament how much 
            we’ve lost in an effort to escape the liability of having such 
            natural contact misconstrued. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Another feel-good highlight of <i>
            Before Leaving</i> occurs in the film’s opening scenes, as residents 
            behold a lunar eclipse with special glasses. The scene brings to 
            mind an audience of rabid midnight movie fans fitted with 3-D 
            glasses to watch some hokey &quot;B&quot; movie, and was the catalyst for the 
            film’s ever being made. &quot;Marie came up with the idea after I pushed 
            her to go somewhere to enjoy the total eclipse of the sun in August, 
            1999,&quot; he explains. &quot;Why not to the M.A.P.I., where Ms. Abbes was a 
            common friend. Marie went, shot a little bit, and decided that there 
            maybe was a film to be made.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Paul estimates that the final 
            production cost around $60,000 dollars, provided by several grants 
            and company sponsorships. However, <i>Before Leaving</i> has yet to 
            find broadcasters either in France, or abroad, despite the editor’s 
            success in translating and subtitling it into English to reach a 
            wider audience. It has found success during festival screenings, 
            winning the Jury Awards at North Carolina’s Doubletake Documentary 
            Film Festival and the Newport Film Festival. The movie’s optimistic 
            take on a seldom-explored subject leaves viewers at such events 
            moved and revitalized.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;In festivals, where people come to 
            see something different, we get great reactions,&quot; confirms Paul. 
            &quot;The film touches people because many of them have dealt with the 
            issue. They would come up to Marie and I and thank us for the film. 
            In many cases, it helped them. What better compliment, for a 
            filmmaker?&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Before Leaving</i>’s impassioned 
            editor sums up the movie’s unique appeal by citing its 
            cliché-bashing imagery. &quot;It think it is, paradoxically, almost a 
            feel-good movie, in a sense. We are reminded that life can be fun, 
            no matter the age or state of mind.&quot; </font>
