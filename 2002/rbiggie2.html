            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700">
            <font size="2">A week or so ago, <i>Imus in the Morning</i> featured 
            a phone interview with Suge Knight, CEO of Tha Row, formerly Death 
            Row Records, onetime home to Dr. Dre, Snoop Dogg, and Tupac Shakur. 
            Expressing his admiration for Suge, who comes with a rep for being 
            &quot;aggressive&quot; in his business dealings, Don Imus reported that Snoop 
            -- no longer smoking dope and still on Bill O'Reilly's bad side -- 
            had recently called Suge a &quot;bitch.&quot; It's hard to say exactly why 
            Imus would want to broach this topic with Suge (and he talked about 
            it for some minutes before Knight even came on the line, 
            anticipating his reaction). Still, the broad stakes seem clear: the 
            host was looking to goad Suge, inspire more name-calling and tough 
            guy outrage. Despite Imus's persistence, Suge didn't bite. Yay for 
            him. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The fascination 
            gangsta rap holds for outsiders -- those who would never take on the 
            genre's violent performance or posturing for themselves -- is surely 
            not new. In fact, many attribute this appeal as a primary reason for 
            the genre's rapid rise among suburban middle-class consumers, 
            traditionally (if such a word might be applied) young, male, and 
            mostly white. A combination of titillation and fear -- like that 
            displayed by Don Imus -- drives CD sales even as it fuels anxieties 
            and prejudices. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Nick 
            Broomfield's <i>Biggie and Tupac</i> starts out looking like it's 
            going to be another such exercise. It opens on a famous photo of the 
            two artists, each seemingly doing his best to out-thug-pose the 
            other. Biggie Smalls stands with his head tilted to the side, his 
            black headrag pulled low over his large eyes, as Tupac Shakur, 
            equally artful, throws his hand up in a big old &quot;f*ck you&quot; to the 
            camera, not hating so much as representing, the way he did. </font>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">As the camera 
            passes over this image, frozen in time, Broomfield's voiceover 
            explains the occasion for his film -- Tupac was shot to death in 
            Vegas on 7 September 1996, and Biggie was murdered just six months 
            later, outside a party in L.A. He wonders aloud how these two 
            friends and mutual supporters in hard business came to an apparently 
            fatal enmity. But this introduction to the vagaries and tragic costs 
            of gangsta rap is only a hook. Broomfield's film ends up being much 
            less interested in Biggie and Tupac per se than in the 
            simultaneously extraordinary and mundane circumstances surrounding 
            their deaths, in particular, the go-nowhere investigations. </font>
            </span></p>
            <p><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Biggie and 
            Tupac</font></span></i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
            picks up arguments made elsewhere, by others, including ex-LAPD 
            officer Russell Poole (who claims his investigation was thwarted by 
            superiors) and Randall Sullivan, author of <i>LAbyrinth</i>, that 
            the murders resulted from a combination of gang and cop vengeance 
            plots and have since been covered up by a variety of conspiracies. 
            (It also argues against a recent <i>L.A. Times</i> story's 
            suggestion that Biggie paid to have Tupac killed and was in Vegas at 
            the time of the shooting.) Poole's story has been told before, in 
            2001 articles in <i>Rolling Stone</i> (8 June) and <i>The New Yorker</i> 
            (21 May), as well as a <i>Frontline</i> documentary about LAPD 
            corruption that same year. Essentially, he makes connections among 
            several LAPD officers, Rafael Perez, David Mack, and the late Kevin 
            Gaines among them, the Ramparts scandals and the Biggie and Tupac 
            murders. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Broomfield 
            comes at all this as he comes at all of his filmic subjects -- as a 
            Columbo-like outsider, stammering, wryly commenting when it suits 
            him, and asking aloud the kinds of questions that might occur to 
            anyone without a background (and some with a background) in the 
            particulars and personalities. Much like his previous films -- for 
            instance, <i>Kurt &amp; Courtney</i> (1998), <i>Heidi Fleiss: Hollywood 
            Madam</i> (1995), <i>Aileen Wuornos: The Selling of a Serial Killer</i> 
            (1992) -- this one pushes at the limits of traditional documentary. 
            Broomfield presents himself as a pseudo-valiant, persistent pursuer 
            of &quot;truth,&quot; liking especially to look for it in places where others 
            have not, and implicitly acceding that everyone has his or her own 
            truth to tell. His films don't feature much objectivity. Rather, 
            they give the concept a good going-over, so that, by the end of 
            each, you're likely to be less sure of your own reading abilities 
            than you were at the beginning. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">This can be a 
            very good thing. And <i>Biggie and Tupac</i> is best when it's not 
            making assertions (most of which are not new and most of which are 
            going to be tedious to anyone who's read anything about the cases in 
            the past), and is instead challenging the very idea of making 
            assertions and there are certainly points in <i>Biggie and Tupac</i> 
            when the ostensible goal takes a back seat to the process, exposed 
            as equally ludicrous, methodical, accidental, and/or fortuitous.
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Tracking people 
            who may have known Biggie when he was rhyming on the sidewalk 
            outside a Brooklyn barbershop, Broomfield sticks his mic in 
            someone's face, and she hides: &quot;He de bomb,&quot; she says, but &quot;I don't 
            want to be on TV.&quot; (In fact, her attitude might be understood as 
            refreshing, given how eager so many folks are to be on TV, 
            especially those with nothing to say.) </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Then Broomfield 
            trundles off to visit Tupac's former bodyguard, Frank Alexander, 
            recently born again and living with several Rottweilers, still 
            fearful even after writing an autobiography. When Broomfield asks 
            Alexander about his assertion, in the book, that &quot;words circulated&quot; 
            concerning Suge's part in Pac's murder, he hems and haws, 
            underlining that these are not his words, but someone else's that 
            &quot;circulated.&quot; Or again, Broomfield goes to see one &quot;witness&quot; to LAPD 
            planning and shenanigans, a guy named Mark Hyland, &quot;the Bookkeeper,&quot; 
            suffering from Tourette's Syndrome and depression (he's also in jail 
            on thirty-seven counts of impersonating a lawyer). He literally 
            cries while recalling his money-moving schemes. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The assertions 
            the film does make are clearly based on Broomfield's own obvious, 
            openly stated affection for Voletta Wallace, Biggie's mother, whom 
            he calls a &quot;former schoolteacher... who appeared in the video for 
            'Juicy'&quot; (at which point you see her in the video, as well as her 
            son's visible respect and love for her). She plays a role 
            reminiscent of Kurt Cobain's aunt in <i>Kurt &amp; Courtney</i>: 
            solicitous, kind, earnest. Not only is Miss Wallace charming and 
            helpful in the filmmaking (when Broomfield can't get an interview 
            with Lil Cease, she has him sit and wait at her home while she calls 
            Cease, and gets him to come on over right that minute), but she is 
            also generous with her time and fond memories of Biggie (&quot;My son was 
            a poet&quot;). The same cannot be said for Pac's mom, Afeni Shakur, whom 
            Broomfield describes as a &quot;former Black Panther&quot; (which everyone 
            knows already, but somehow it seems part of a legacy of &quot;violence&quot; 
            here) and as keeping a tight control on materials and 
            still-to-be-released tracks, and to this end, she's affiliated with 
            Suge Knight.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Afeni won't be 
            interviewed. Suge, however, will. To get access to his big &quot;get,&quot; 
            Broomfield must go through several intermediaries, including the 
            prison warden at Owl Creek, where Suge's serving time (he's out now, 
            as Imus reminds us). One of Suge's reps warns Broomfield not to try 
            to &quot;use&quot; Suge like he obviously used people, say, in <i>Heidi Fleiss</i>, 
            to &quot;elevate&quot; himself and make them look stupid. If Broomfield screws 
            up, this guy says, &quot;Anybody who's black in the prison won't be 
            speaking to you.&quot; Articulating the race difference that underlies 
            the business of gangsta rap, this threat also leads to a scene in 
            the prison, where the black and Latino inmates look askance at the 
            camera as Broomfield and crew make their way along the sidewalk. 
            This would be the &quot;courageous&quot; part of the pursuit of &quot;truth.&quot;
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Broomfield also 
            makes a few dry observations. His cameraperson opts out of the trip 
            to see Suge in prison, concerned for &quot;self-preservation,&quot; and the 
            filmmaker must agree to Suge's own terms: &quot;No slander and funny 
            stuff!&quot; This leads to the actual interview, as uninformative and 
            foolish as you might expect. Seated on a bench in the yard, his head 
            shiny with sweat in the sun, big cigar in his mouth, Suge talks 
            about his desires to help the next generation, to warn them off of 
            his own past: &quot;Peace positive for the kids,&quot; he says, Broomfield 
            rapt, nodding as if his life depended on it. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">As if ensure 
            his own credibility (which, more likely, he doesn't much care 
            about), Broomfield does mention here in voiceover, that Snoop is 
            &quot;terrified&quot; regarding Suge's imminent release, and has increased his 
            security force. The film doesn't leave you that way, though, 
            returning to one last visit with Voletta, unscary as can be. While
            <i>Biggie and Tupac</i> has little to say that hasn't already been 
            told, she provides it with a bit of welcome grace. </font></span>
