            Australian director James Bogle cannot be faulted in the imagination
            and invention departments. In 1988 he made an unusual little horror
            film called <i>Kadaicha</i> and he continued in the vein with his
            second feature, a 1992 black comedy called <i>Mad Bomber In Love</i>.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So
            it was a change of pace for Bogle to adapt his third film, <i>In the
            Winter Dark</i>, from a primary source written by someone else.
            Based on an eerie, spare book by noted Aussie writer Tim Winton, <i>In
            the Winter Dark</i> focuses on four people who live in a secluded
            and marshy rural area of Australia called &quot;The Sink.&quot;<o:p>

            has been mutilating and killing the farm animals and Maurice Stubbs
            (Ray Barrett), his wife Ida (Brenda Blethyn) and neighbor Murray
            Jacob (Richard Roxburgh) are determined to track it down. They're
            aided by Ronnie (Miranda Otto), a self-destructive, pregnant woman
            who lives across the way.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Bogle's
            film avoids the pop excitability of most recent Aussie imports and
            tells volumes in its quiet, unspoken stillness. As a psychological
            drama it's a stark, complex movie about isolation and a terror that
            cannot be seen. &quot;Something black, I don't exactly know&quot; is
            how<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>narrator, Maurice,
            describes it. The blackness may be within Maurice himself as his
            demons and the emptiness of a joyless marriage to Ida finally erupt
            into fear and violence.<o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Indeed,
            over the course of a few days and desolate nights the quartet form
            an uneasy alliance and bond which is shattered by tragedy and the
            emergence of ghosts from the past. <i>In the Winter Dark</i>, which
            was released Down Under in 1998, emerged during a stretch of time
            that brought more nihilistic, relentless fare from the usually loopy
            Australian cinema. Indeed difficult and repugnant dramas like Rowan
            Woods' 1997 <i>The Boys</i> permeated theaters and even carted off
            awards from the Australian Film Institute.<o:p>

            is a horror film in its own rite, earning three nominations from the
            AFI in 1998 - for Cinematography, Best Actor for Ray Barrett and
            Supporting Actress for Miranda Otto and the nominations are telling
            in pinpointing the film's strengths. Like <i>Who's Afraid of
            Virginia Woolf</i>, of which the film is strongly reminiscent, the
            actors are its asset, managing to make some semblance of a story out
            of what is essentially murky action that takes place in the mind.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></span></font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Martin
            McGrath's cinematography also added to the queasy tone with its
            purples and blues and shadows. But despite these high points, <i>In
            the Winter Dark</i> is too internalized and segregated to rate as a
            successful film. Because we see from Maurice's eye and through his
            mental state of being it's near impossible to find the perspective
            (or the compassion and empathy) that would allow us access to the
            other characters. Ronnie and Murray are essentially enigmas and poor
            Ida, pained and miserable, is just too sorrowful to reach. Even her
            single moment of drunken joy with Ronnie is pervaded by the past and
            dominated obliquely by Maurice. These are people that we hope to God
            we never meet, much less spend two hours with, no matter how much
            vision and atmosphere surrounds them and how well the actors perform
            and reenact their dismal, dank lives. <o:p>
