            <br>
            <b>Robert Altman blazed his cinematic trail through the seventies by
            deconstructing and demystifying genres, at once satirizing or
            undercutting the conventions while excavating the dramatic weight
            under the quirks and the comedy of his surfaces. The sprawling casts
            and weaving stories and roaming camerawork became a trademark, and
            perhaps a weakness. Confronted with a story and script as meaty and
            rich as <i>Nashville</i>, he and his cast had a solid core to spin
            their improvisations and character explorations around and his weave
            brought out dramatic designs and colors impossible in more formal
            structures. When working with lesser scripts that paraded the
            quirkiness of characters in place of personality (think <i>A Wedding</i>
            and <i>Health</i>, all that was left was color and cleverness. Even
            Altman enthusiasts generally agree that his last top-flight work was
            the 1993 <i>Short Cuts</i>, a rich and restless film that I
            nonetheless find sour and lacking in the empathy of his best works
            of the 1970s and 80s. I last saw the genius of Altman in his
            brilliant HBO shot-on-the-run mini-series <i>Tanner</i>, a
            magnificent political satire written with sharp wit by Garry Trudeau
            and infused by Altman with the generosity of character that makes
            casts ready to dive deep within caricatures and draw out living,
            breathing people full of the passions and contradictions that make
            us human.</b><br>
            <br>
            <i>Gosford Park</i> is a twenty-first-century return to form for
            Robert Altman, a sprawling character piece in the costume drama
            idiom remade into that gorgeous Altman weave of humanity. On the
            surface it looks like a wry, devious twist on the Merchant-Ivory
            genre by way of <i>Upstairs Downstairs</i> and a shaggy Agatha
            Christie mystery, but underneath is a kind of <i>Rules of the Game</i>,
            with Altman's personal take on the humanist understanding that
            &quot;everybody has their reasons.&quot;<br>
            <br>
            The Gosford Park of the title is a the manor house of Sir William
            McCordle (Michael Gambon), the working class industrialist who made
            his millions and married into the aristocracy. Our entry into the
            social shark infested world of his hangers-on are Constance,
            Countess of Trentham (Maggie Smith), a creaky old dowager clinging
            to privilege though she has little money, and her young maid Mary
            Maceachran (Kelly MacDonald), a <b><i>naïf </i></b>altogether
            uneducated in way of social convention. Constance has such a young,
            untrained girl because she's cheap, but through all her disdain and
            cynicism and cutting remarks about both the masters and the servants
            around her, she can sense she kind of likes the youth and <b><i>naïveté</i></b>
            of Mary. They make quite the pair, with Constance hanging on Mary's
            gossip from the servants quarters with perhaps the only smile she
            cracks all weekend, and Mary getting an earful of the aristocratic
            naughtiness from Constance, a born gossip.<br>
            <br>
            Constance is aunt to Lady Sylvia (Kristin Scott Thomas), Sir
            William's haughty, fanged wife, an aristocrat of the most bigoted,
            class-conscious breeding who never fails to belittles him in front
            of company. In fact the entire clan of Lady Sylvia's relatives only
            mask their contempt for the boorish working-class man made good, as
            if his common stock was some kind of affront to their cultured
            existence. His tastes and talk still echo with the rawness of the
            street and they hate him all the more because it's his money and his
            work that allows them their lives of leisure. Among the leeches that
            have gathered to alternately insult him and beg for his money are
            Sylvia's two sisters Louisa, Lady Stockbridge (Geraldine Somerville)
            and Lady Lavinia Meredith (Natasha Wightman) and their husbands Lord
            Stockbridge (Charles Dance) and Lt. Commander Anthony Meredith (Tom
            Hollander), the horrid Freddie Nesbitt (James Wilby) who married the
            daughter of a factory owner only to discover her family fortune a
            pittance, and Lord Rupert (Laurence Fox), a penniless aristocrat
            courting William's daughter Isobel (Camilla Rutherford) while his
            status-conscious friend Jeremy Blond (Trent Ford) insists he can do
            better. A sort of emotional feeding frenzy leaves the social waters
            bloody as Sylvia lords her family name and manners over her grumpy,
            uncouth husband, while Freddy's sneering jabs at his wife's common
            roots are even nastier than those Sylvia slaps in the face of her
            husband. All the while Constance spouts a steady stream of withering
            remarks, dropping her commentaries with an almost dotty disregard
            for the emotional damage they leave in their wake.<br>
            <br>
            While the titled jockey for position upstairs, Mary is swept into an
            entirely different world of class distinction downstairs. The faded
            upper-crust bourgeois boors cling mightily to this outdated system
            of privilege and rank and class (&quot;He thinks he's God
            almighty,&quot; sneers footman George [Richard E Grant in fine
            snotty form] about Sir William. &quot;They all do.&quot;) and their
            servants seem to have caught the disease. Head manservant Jennings
            (Alan Bates) and housekeeper Mrs. Wilson (Helen Mirren) hold their
            own kind of court downstairs, right down to the seating arrangements
            at the table. They hold with the old ways, thus the servants are
            called by the names of their masters and are seated by their
            hierarchical importance (&quot;Since when does a Baronet outrank a
            Duchess?&quot; sniffs Jennings as he puts Mary in her
            &quot;rightful&quot; place near the head of the table). The pecking
            order is only complicated by the arrival of guests' servants,
            including the hawklike valet Robert Parks (Clive Owen), a fiercely
            detached man with a pride bordering on insolence that the house
            servants would love to cut down, and the pushy, suspicious Henry
            Denton (Ryan Phillippe), a valet whose phony Scottish accent and
            unprofessional behavior make him a mystery and an outcast. Only the
            cook, Mrs. Croft (Eileen Atkins), and Probert (Derek Jacobi), Sir
            William's valet, seems to be above the fray. Croft has her one
            little world in the kitchen staff and clashes constantly with Mrs.
            Wilson, while Probst, for all his manners and sense of decorum, is
            oddly egalitarian with all of the servants. Off on her own is Elsie
            (Emily Watson), the plain-spoken housemaid who takes a protective
            interest in Mary and her misguided fantasies of the aristocracy.
            She's Mary's guide through the intricacies of the mock aristocracy
            upstairs, much like Constance upstairs.<br>
            <br>
            The salve between the classes is self-described court jester Ivor
            Novello, the real life actor and music hall singer (the only
            historical figure in the cast) played with deft self-mocking
            deference by Jeremy Northam. He sings his silly little ditties to a
            room full of titled snobs too high class to enjoy his lovely voice&nbsp;
            (&quot;Don't encourage him,&quot; sniffs Maggie Smith) while the
            hired help crowds around the doors enchanted by the ridiculous songs
            and his film star fame. Such matters of popular fame are, naturally,
            too coarse to be acknowledged by the aristocrats, but they bring a
            giddy schoolgirl rush to Mary. Altman manages this balancing act
            throughout the film, both appreciating and satirizing class
            difference while always maintaining the dignity of the individuals.<br>
            <br>
            A perfect example is American producer Morris Weisman (Bob Balaban),
            brought to party by Novello.<br>
            Weisman is here to soak up a little atmosphere for his new Charlie
            Chan film but is oddly, wonderfully oblivious to the class
            distinctions around him. Addressing servants as &quot;Mr.&quot;
            (&quot;No, it's just Jennings, sir&quot;) and conversing with titled
            aristocrats as if they were but mere mortals, he's at once too
            thick-headed to pick up on the very atmosphere he came to study and
            too American to want to. Balaban plays Weisman as part classless
            American rube, the butt of jokes of class conscious guests he
            doesn't even notice, and part egalitarian everyman of the new world.<br>
            <br>
            The drama heads into <i>Rules of the Game</i> territory with a
            morning bird shoot that quotes Renoir's famous hunting scene, with
            an appropriately deflating twist. Sir William is &quot;nicked&quot;
            by a bullet (&quot;They probably drew cards for William,&quot;
            Constance drolly suggests to Lady Sylvia). Is it the hint of an
            assassination attempt or pure chance? Before the morning there will
            be a murder and the list of suspects that makes it a veritable game
            of &quot;Clue,&quot; with a clueless police Inspector (Stephen Fry)
            fumbling for answers. He's an obsequious snob who ignores his
            working-class assistant's insights, holds that servants are below
            his interest, and tiptoes around the titled guests like a toady. In
            delicious Altman fashion the tidy little mystery will be gleefully
            turned on its head in a manner that would make Miss Marple spin in
            her grave. The final solution might seem far fetched in less
            sensitive hands, but Altman makes the dramatic anchor so solid that
            it doesn't merely work as an answer to the narrative riddle, but as
            a heartbreaking revelation of character.<br>
            <br>
            The mystery is, in the words of another famous auteur, pure
            Maguffin. More revealing is the way protocol is shattered over and
            over again: by housemaid Elsie, who impulsively leaps to the defense
            of Sir William during one of Sylvia's cutting tirades, denying her
            servility in front of the aristocrats and inadvertently revealing
            her affair with William (which was known to all but politely ignored
            until this moment); by the mystery valet Henry, whose phony accent
            and curious relationship to his American master is revealed to be
            what both servant and served view as a betrayal; by Novello, who
            acknowledges his role as social curiosity with a smile somewhere
            between bemusement and wounded pride, yet plays and sings his dumb
            little songs (and he knows they are silly) as if for a rapt
            nightclub audience.<br>
            <br>
            Altman is working with an almost entirely new crew here, many culled
            appropriately enough from Britain: cinematographer Andrew Dunn (<i>The
            Madness of King George</i>), composer Patrick Doyle (<i>Sense and
            Sensibility</i>, Kenneth Branagh's <i>Hamlet</i>), and
            Merchant-Ivory costume designer Jenny Beavan, along with Ang Lee's
            regular editor Tim Squyres, join Robert's longtime production
            designer (and son) Stephen Altman to sculpt a film in different key.
            While the film is quintessentially Altman, with his trademark
            searching camera weaving the stories together and alighting briefly
            on telling background details, there's a different feel to it as
            well, and perhaps just a bit more distance. Where he usually
            luxuriates in rich bright colors, there's a muted palette here and
            an art direction in white and brown.&nbsp;<br>
            <br>
            He's also working with a new screenwriter, Julian Fellows, who
            scripted from a story idea by Bob Balaban and Robert Altman.
            Finally, after playing with the cute, inoffensive, and paper-thin
            eccentrics of such films as <i>Cookie's Fortune</i> and <i>Dr. T and
            the Women</i>, he's working from a script worthy of his talents, and
            he's inspired. With a story rooted in real drama, characters painted
            in varying shades of gray, and a setting rife for social satire with
            a bite, he's building a film on a foundation that can support
            character drama of substance.<br>
            <br>
            What he finally delivers is his most rounded set of characters since
            <i>Nashville</i>. The cast is huge and putting names to faces and
            structuring the pecking order is made no easier by the &quot;old
            ways&quot; (servants are called by their masters' names in the
            downstairs), but Altman manages to illustrate such distinctions in
            the everyday, face-to-face conversations: you don't have to memorize
            the relationships when you can see it played out their behavior.
            More than master versus servant and self-important stuffed shirts
            (both upstairs and downstairs) waiting to be punctured, this is the
            story of people trapped by the limitations in their own sense of
            identity, in a world of petrified codes of class cracking and
            crumbling before their eyes. It's <i>Rules of the Game</i> with a
            hearty sense of sympathy for the players and a willingness to look
            beyond the facades to find the beating hearts inside. Everyone has
            their reasons, but Altman is more interested in their
            vulnerabilities, their resolve, their fears. For the first time in
            years I feel living, breathing, scared, angry, curious, callous,
            determined, uncaring, deeply caring, wounded and wanting characters
            radiate from the screen, neither hero nor villain, but a whole box
            of surprises.</font><p align="left">&nbsp;
