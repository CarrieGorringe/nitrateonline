            <font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Smart and sassy, here is one 
            helluva terrific word-of-mouth feature. Watch it, then tell all your 
            friends to see it. This romantic comedy about two women who find 
            love and laughs in New York City, is a charming winner of hearts. 
            And Woody Allen is no longer the only neurotic poster child for the 
            Empire State's biggest city; Heather Juergensen's semi-introverted 
            Jessica Stein is a beautiful, winsome gal. Sometimes she dresses up 
            as Annie Hall. Sensitive, straight, and straightforward, even if 
            she's particularly overwrought in the simpleminded, 
            &quot;self-deprecating&quot; men that she meets. Well-read (the books and 
            magazines cover the floors of her quaint Manhattan apartment) and an 
            aspiring, albeit private, artist, she suffers a dead end job and 
            just a few containers of left-over Chinese in the fridge. Jessica's 
            a hopeless romantic who can't find the right guy in a 
            ninety-six-minute film (life is longer, so who knows…)—or have her 
            overbearing Jewish Mother find him for her. So when Kismet strikes 
            her apparently only emotional chord (through the <i>Village Voice
            </i>personal ads, of course) in hip, sexy, gregarious, and bored <i>
            shiksa</i> Helen Cooper (Jennifer Westfeldt), manager of the trendy 
            Schuller Gallery, both women experiment with their first lesbian 
            encounter</b>&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's an affair of comically 
            confusing proportions. Two steps forward, one step back, and a few 
            cross town—with Helen's gay friends Sebastian (Carson Elrod) and 
            Martin (Michael Mastro) offering some amusing <i>Lesbianism for 
            Dummies</i> wisdom—for good measure as they stumble into their first 
            kiss (with Barry White warbling <i>I'm Gonna Love You Just a Little 
            More, Baby</i>), their first sex, and what might be love. The how-to 
            books and pamphlets follow later. Then the high-fives. The 
            exceedingly loquacious Jessica is turned on by Helen's marinating 
            personality and her ability not to make linguistic missteps, a pet 
            peeve that has destroyed most of Jessica's previous dates and 
            relationships. And boy can they have fun discussing beauty tips, 
            clothing, and lesbian accessories. It's like guys talking sports, 
            getting all excited. They become lovers and best friends.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jessica's life, as it is, has been 
            revolving around her job as an assistant copywriter at <i>The 
            Tribune</i>, an alternative news weekly. Josh Meyers (Scott Cohen), 
            her boss and former lover, has his own case of writer/lover's block 
            that figures prominently in the film, and Jessica's early funk turns 
            downright morose when her brother (and Josh's college buddy) 
            announces his marital engagement. Toss in Jessica's friend, 
            co-worker Joan (Jackie Hoffman), a wacky, pregnant, and very 
            entertaining snoop, and you might end up thinking these people's 
            daytime antics are merely soap opera scripts. Not true. The dialogue 
            elevates them above the mundane.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">From the opening scene you're won 
            over. Set in a suburban New York synagogue on Yom Kippur, the Jewish 
            day of forgiveness, Jessica, her mother Judy (a marvelous spin on an 
            old-fashioned stereotype by Tovah Feldshuh) and her grandmother 
            Esther (Esther Wurmfeld, the director's and producer Eden Wurmfeld's 
            grandmother) are deep in thought…about men, while the rest of the 
            congregation is deep in prayer. Judy is <b><i>kvelling</i></b> over 
            Ben Feldman, a Vice President with J.P. Morgan, while Jessica is 
            getting upset with the constant pile of men her mother is throwing 
            at her, even if it's only with the best of intentions. The tension, 
            and their voices, escalate above the small din in the sanctuary, 
            until Jessica blurts out &quot;Will you shut up! I'm atoning!&quot; Cue the 
            congregants wide-eyed amazement and the opening credits. The fun is 
            only just beginning.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color:black">A few 
            technical notes, because they're interesting. The film's genesis 
            began as a night of New York sketch comedy, of two Laura Ashley-clad 
            &quot;girly-girls&quot; meeting to negotiate how to become lesbians. That 
            evolved into a play <i>Lipschtick</i> (&quot;the story of two women 
            seeking the perfect shade&quot;), which ran for a brief, six-night 
            off-Broadway engagement. Hollywood knocked, but the project faltered 
            until the women got the rights back in turnaround. Juergensen and 
            Cooper expanded their material, and with their own and the 
            Wurmfeld's friends and family investing time and money, a 
            &quot;three-year rehearsal process,&quot; and twenty-two days of production, 
            an indie classic was born.</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color:black">There's a 
            lot that shines here. The enlightened story, the tasty performances, 
            the sweet sentimentality. Tovah Feldshuh's memorable mother, a 
            forcefully positive figure that could sell Israel Bonds to Arafat.
            </span><i>Kissing Jessica Stein</i> is everything that Edward Burns'
            <i>Sidewalks of New York</i> had hoped to be (and which failed at 
            just about everything). But let's not dwell on last year's Big Apple 
            mistake. Rather rejoice that something as nuanced and deliciously 
            simple as <span style="color:black">Jennifer Westfeldt and Heather 
            Juergensen's film (yeah, it was directed by Charles Herman-Wurmfeld, 
            but the women are the creative force behind this gem as writers, 
            co-producers, and stars) can be such a poignant and passionate 
            statement on unexpected friendships.</span></font><hr size="1">
