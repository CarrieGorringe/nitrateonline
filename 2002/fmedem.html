<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700">The 
films of Spain’s Julio Medem are as much about his country’s distinctive 
landscapes and natural mysteries as they are about the restless and obsessive 
characters that wander through his world. <i>Vacas</i> (<i>Cows</i>) (1992), his 
debut feature, is set in the rolling hills and thick forests of Northern Spain, 
where two clans feud and flirt through the three generations between the Carlist 
Wars of 1875 and the devastating Spanish Civil War, and seen through the dull, 
unimpressed eyes of ever present cows. <i>The Red Squirrel</i> (1993), a dense 
mind game of cinematic delights, is a squirrel’s eye view of a relationship 
built quite literally on a complex web of lies and deceptions spun in a remote 
forest campground. <i>Tierra</i> (<i>Earth</i>) (1995), to date his most vital 
and vivid work, begins in the heavens and lands in the red dust of a remote wine 
growing region, a world both primal and alien where the enigmatic wood lice 
lives underground and angels live among the humans above. </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Lovers of the Arctic 
Circle</span></i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana"> (1998) 
brought his work to larger international audience. Swooning with romantic 
abandon, Julio Medem’s fateful love story weaves reality, fantasy and memory 
into a narrative tapestry of recurring images like musical motifs as two 
frustrated lovers narrate their own stories in parallel self-titled chapters and 
offer dream variations one another’s stories. With <i>Lovers</i> Medem 
established himself firmly, in this critic’s mind at least, as the most engaging 
and exciting filmmaker to come out of Spain since Carlos Saura -- and that 
includes Pedro Almodovar. His unique, organic style is a different kind of 
cinematic experience. Medem doesn’t direct so much as weave his films: 
distinctive landscapes, fumbling characters, criss-crossing stories and 
recurring images and motifs intertwine, blur, and transform through time. His 
films burst with narrative games, visual puns, and a passionate embrace of fate, 
fantasy, and the illogical power of love.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Medem came to Seattle 
in June of 2002 with the local premiere of his fifth and most recent film, <i>
Sex and Lucia</i>, his latest tale of obsessive love, tragic twists, and 
romantic fate. This densely plotted, time-hopping drama once again weaves the 
criss-crossing stories of a handful of characters through primal landscapes (a 
deserted, sun-washed Mediterranean island beach, the dark caves that snake 
through the center of the island) and emotional trials, and reverberates with 
the thematic foundation of all of Medem’s stories: we don’t exist in a vacuum. 
Our lives affect others, and that gives us a responsibility. For the record, the 
film earned him the festival’s audience award for Best Director and Best 
Screenplay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">I had the great 
pleasure and honor of interviewing Julio Medem while he was in Seattle to be 
honored as an &quot;Emerging Master&quot; at the Seattle International Film Festival, ten 
years after SIFF give the American premiere to his debut feature <i>Vacas</i>. 
As far as I was concerned he had emerged years ago, but the honor was really 
just an excuse to bring a world class director to Seattle to talk about his 
films. The 42 year old director spoke a little English in our brief introduction 
but when it came to the interview he spoke in Spanish through interpreter 
Carolina Manriquez. The result reads less like an interview than a series of 
creative reflections, so I’ve structured it that way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Julio Medem on his 
creative process:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">There is of course the 
first moment, the epiphany, when the idea first comes, an idea strong enough to 
motivate you to write. The idea always comes to me with an image, an image that 
defines the narrative tone, the visual tone, and the atmosphere. It all comes 
together with the idea. The essence of what I want to portray. And it’s usually 
something that comes from the subconscious, like I’m in a half dream state when 
I get these inspirations and that’s how it all starts. The story is not clear at 
the beginning. It’s more like a mystery that I have to solve. I open doors and 
let the ideas come out. I walk one step at a time and experience each step. The 
path I follow is not a linear path, it’s sinuous and I don’t know where it’s 
going to take me. There’s nothing structured, it’s just walking through the 
idea, opening the doors in front of me, and taking the ideas that come out one 
at a time. When I get to the end of the road I look back from above, like a 
bird’s eye view, and try to look at my journey objectively. In a sense it’s like 
the image of an explorer that goes into a new landscape and hikes around and 
when he gets to the top of the mountain looks back and draws the map. When I 
look back on the landscape, I see certain repetitions. Themes start emerging, 
narratives start appearing. My work in making this path is to get them to flow 
together and make sense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">On <i>The Red Squirrel</i>:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">I met Emma Saurez on <i>
Vacas</i> and she inspired some of the ideas for <i>The Red Squirrel</i>, like 
the lie that she brings to the situation. The story of <i>The Red Squirrel</i> 
started confabulating during <i>Vacas</i>, so when I went to write <i>The Red 
Squirrel</i> I wrote characters specifically for [<i>Vacas</i> stars] Emma and 
Carmelo Gomez. They were meant to be in it because it the idea had been 
conceived among them. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">The inspiration for <i>
The Red Squirrel</i> came while I was camping. I was worrying: &quot;Will I ever be 
produced again? Will I ever make another movie?&quot; And I could hear all these 
noises up in the trees, and feel pine nuts and little cone pines thrown at me, 
and I though that these squirrels were making fun of me. I realized I couldn’t 
be part of that world as they hid up in the trees, chattering and pelting me 
with pine-cones, and that’s when the idea of <i>The Red Squirrel </i>came from. 
It comes from their perspective, what they do, how they go about the world, how 
they laugh about us humans, and the gap between the squirrels up in the tree and 
me on the ground camping and trying to sleep. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">In <i>The Red Squirrel</i> 
there are two levels of lies. I wanted to address, especially in Spanish 
culture, men having so many social advantages over women. It’s a total 
patriarchal system, men dominate women. That part of lie is very visible: Jota (Nancho 
Novo) is controlling what’s going on. He picks her to become his girlfriend and 
controls the visible part of the situation. But then there’s also the irony, the 
contradiction, the way she makes fun of him. She has her own plan and a way of 
dominating the situation at another level that is less visible. Like the 
squirrel, which sneaks around behind the scenes. She uses less visible means. In
<i>The Red Squirrel</i> I’m satirizing his macho attitude, because at the end of 
the story it all turns around and you find that she’s been pulling the strings. 
We see something similar in <i>Sex and Lucia</i>, where Lorenzo gets punished 
for his lies and the way he tries to control the situation. You get the sense of 
a hand dominating the situation, Lorenzo’s hand: he’s writing the story and he’s 
in control, Lucia is hopelessly in love with him. And because he’s the dominant 
figure he suffers the most. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">On <i>Tierra</i>:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">The character of Angel 
in <i>Tierra</i> had been written for Antonio Banderas, who had originally 
agreed to make the movie but then declined, and I had written the character of 
Patricio [the husband of the Emma Suarez character) for Carmelo, because 
Carmelo’s dad was a farmer and it was a world he knew. Carmelo was all set to do 
that character, so when Banderas dropped out of the movie I had to talk Carmelo 
into being Angel. He didn’t want to be Angel because he was so focused on 
Patricio, the character that had been written for him, the character he was 
meant to be. It was hard work to convince him to take the role of Angel. </span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Obviously the character 
had to change. The way the character is built is both through my vision and the 
actor’s interpretation of that vision. Their own identity comes into play to 
while the build and create this character. If the actor changes the character 
has to change because he brings in all his experiences and identity into the 
role. When Carmelo read the script for Angel he commented to me &quot;He seems like 
you, he’s very similar to you.&quot; When I watched the finished film and saw Carmelo 
portraying Angel and building the character, I told him &quot;Angel is like you, he’s 
definitely like you.&quot; It’s in essence a coming together of two forces into this 
one character, and you can see both of them in the character.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">It’s a symbiotic 
relationship, everything influences everything else, and it’s easier to work 
with the same actors over and over again because you get to know them better, 
you learn how they work, you get to know them personally. The interaction and 
the maturation of my ideas are easier to accomplish with people I know already.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">The landscape is of 
course a central part of the story and there’s a mutual relationship between the 
landscape and the characters. To me, <i>Tierra</i> is about a man that’s alone 
on this Earth, a fragile man who feels very small on this world and in this 
life, and the redness of the landscape increases this sense of loneliness and 
isolation and how small we are. The landscape can also be subjective and 
contradictory. I like my films to play out on natural landscapes, on open 
landscapes, because I think it’s easier for characters to find their essence on 
these open landscapes, to let their instincts come out as they work through 
their problems and find answers to their primal questions. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">On <i>Lovers of the </i>
</span><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Arctic Circle</span></i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">I knew that the movie 
had to end in the forest because of the development of the story. As kids, their 
first kiss happens in a geography class in front of an atlas open to a map of 
the Arctic Circle, so the cycle has been established: something important must 
happen in the Arctic Circle. It’s like they have a date in the future in the 
Arctic Circle. The strange thing is that the story is directed to this place 
that is cold and inhospitable, and in a love story we think of warmth and 
passion. It’s also a place where, in a sense, time stops, and in a sense time 
stopped with that first kiss. When I was filming <i>Vacas</i>, I went to the 
festival of the midnight sun, which celebrates a time when the sun never sets in 
the Arctic Circle, and when I saw the sun that never set I felt that life 
stopped right there. That’s when I first got the idea that I later incorporated 
into <i>Lovers of the Arctic Circle</i>, relating it to that first kiss, and 
then bringing everything together in the Arctic Circle. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">On <i>Sex and Lucia</i>:</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">A week before I started 
shooting <i>Lovers of the Arctic Circle</i>, I went to the island where <i>Sex 
and Lucia</i> was conceived [Formentera, an island just off the coast of Spain] 
and I fell in love with the island. I was leaving for Finland but I knew that 
the place was waiting for me and I wanted to make something happen on that 
island. It was very hard for me and for the crew to deal with the heaviness and 
the death of a major character in <i>Lovers of the Arctic Circle</i>, so when it 
was finished I went back to the island and played with my video camera. Without 
knowing the story I went there to explore it. I rode my motorcycle around and 
saw the beautiful sunsets and the full moon and the only thing I knew is that I 
wanted to make something happier, something lighter, something clearer than what 
I had just finished. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">One day while I was 
walking around I found the lighthouse and a hole next to the lighthouse. My 
first thought was to give the hole a sexual connotation. This was before I’d 
even thought about the first part of the movie -- sex in the past. I kept 
finding these holes and it felt like the island was carved out, and that’s when 
I came up with the idea of the island floating on the water [&quot;like a lid,&quot; says 
one character] and becoming a refuge for lost souls, a hiding place. There’s 
also the idea that it is a hole through which you can escape. These holes are on 
the edge of the island, on the shoreline, so there’s a limit to how far you can 
escape. And you can fall through the hole and come back to your past, but to the 
point in your past from which you escaped, so it’s like a circle around your 
present and your past, escaping and returning.</span></p>
