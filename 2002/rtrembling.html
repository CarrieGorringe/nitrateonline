            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sandi Simcha DuBowski's remarkably
            emotional documentary therefore hits a little closer to my home in
            its frank discussion of the emotional conundrums facing Orthodox
            Jews that are gay and lesbian. Not that I'm Orthodox. In seeking
            divine guidance for their sexual proclivities, many of the subjects
            in this award-winning film hide behind shadows and silhouettes to
            spare themselves or their families embarrassment. Most unenlightened
            viewers would wonder what all the fuss is about, but no matter where
            you stand with religion—Jewish or not—<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Trembling
            Before G-d</i> will place you squarely in the middle of a very
            disheartening controversy. There is a constant sense of uneasiness
            at all sides of this discussion, and while DuBowski's film reveals a
            semi-secret group of individuals yearning for acceptance without
            abandoning their religious convictions (apparently after twenty-five
            years in some cases), the ultimate manner of co-existence and inner
            peace that they hope to find is not the stuff of documentary
            storybook ending;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>rather,
            it is left open, like an non-healing wound. The pain of
            strong-willed beliefs, at times, is nearly unbearable.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Among the secularly religious,
            particularly the reform and conservative branches of modern Judaism,
            such &quot;outcasts&quot; are actually welcomed members of many
            congregations, but in the stricter disciplines of the
            ultra-religious Orthodox and Hasidic Jews such same-gender liaisons
            are stringently prohibited. These fundamentalist Jews consider
            homosexuality a sin against the curator, according to the Torah and
            the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Shulchan Aruch</i>, a centuries-old code of Jewish law. It strikes me
            that this dilemma is not dissimilar to Firesign Theatre's comedic
            mind-bending assumption &quot;How can you be in two places at once
            when you're not anywhere at all,&quot; except there's nothing funny
            about the situation portrayed here.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Building his film around several
            individuals who speak openly, although often masked from the camera,
            about their faith and the personal decisions that have shattered
            their lives or devastated those close to them, DuBowski and his
            co-director Susan Korda spent five years collecting footage shot in
            Brooklyn, Jerusalem, Los Angeles, London, Miami, and San Francisco.
            The filmmakers sometimes resort to subtitles in deciphering the
            Israeli accents or translating some of the Hebrew phrases unfamiliar
            to the Jews and gentiles in the audience.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The traumatic message is all too
            clear, however. The question of mixing ultra-structured religious
            identity with the illumination of a person's innermost need for
            sexual exploration has no easy answers. A psychologist talks of the
            tumultuous conflicts from one patient, a fifty-six-year-old father
            of twelve, who has struggled with his homosexuality for forty years.
            David, an openly gay Jew living in Los Angeles, was told by his
            learned rabbi to eat figs and said a prayer for months to ride
            himself of his feelings. Such absurd aspirins of denial are probably
            more likely prescribed (although several do admit to taking
            tranquilizers) to exorcise the sexual aberration as a control issue.
            A decade or more later, David reconnects with his teacher, now
            suggesting celibacy, yet realizing his reversal therapy bore the
            wrong fruit. David, tearfully, seeks happiness and peace with God in
            a letter he places in a crack in Jerusalem's hallowed Western Wall.
            He's reduced to tears and we all can collectively weep with and for
            him.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In Florida we meet Malka, a rabbi's
            daughter, and Leah, lesbian lovers for ten years who commiserate in
            misery as they kneed dough for Challah and pray that their many
            mitzvahs will merit them a better place in the next world. They are
            both detached from their families, the only connection a short phone
            call from parents—blind to the love of their child—every Friday
            afternoon, wishing them a quick good Shabbos greeting before an
            abrupt hang-up.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In Brooklyn, Michelle describes
            herself as the quintessential New York Chassidic lesbian. Having
            suffered through a failed marriage of convenience to accommodate her
            family, she hasn't seen her baby sister in seven years and her
            ostracism is all the more obvious as the camera watches her walk
            through her old neighborhood, unexpectedly meeting an uncle unaware
            of her &quot;condition.&quot;</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The angst of low self esteem
            pervades frame after frame, each subject struggling with their
            testimony before the camera. There are some small sadness-laced
            victories, of fifty-year-old Israel Fishman in Brooklyn, a former
            Yeshiva student turned tour guide, happy in a quarter-century
            relationship with partner Carl Navarro. Israel desperately wants his
            daddy, he cries, with whom he hasn't spoken in thirty years. When
            the contact finally arrives in a phone call, Israel is more
            disappointed than elated. &quot;He doesn't hear,&quot; the son tells
            us, not referring to his father's physical condition. Carl sits in
            the back, shaking his head with regret.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The supreme deity, not to belittle
            the filmmakers, gives no clear cut answers as the film's subjects
            shudder before us. Rapture is not near. Sandi Simcha DuBowski's
            cautionary tale will open the debate much, much wider, but the
            profound question of where the passion of Judaism and homosexuality
            come out, way out, from an invisible past makes <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Trembling
