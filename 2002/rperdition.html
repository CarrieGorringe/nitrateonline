            <font size="2">&quot;I'm something of a rarity. I shoot the dead.&quot; 
            Maguire (Jude Law) is only partly right. A freelance photographer 
            scrounging for work during the Depression, he specializes in images 
            of corpses, and, rather ingeniously, secures his employment by 
            murdering his own subjects. But in <i>Road to Perdition</i>, Maguire 
            is only one of several professional killers, men who repeatedly loom 
            in low-angle shots, pursuing their victims relentlessly in sinister 
            shadows and driving rain, all the while trying to figure out their 
            familial relations. In fact, Maguire's most singular aspect is his 
            lack of a traumatizing father-son relationship. That, and his ratty 
            hair. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">By contrast, 
            Maguire's latest assignment, Irish mafia hitman Michael Sullivan 
            (Tom Hanks), has plenty of trauma and plenty of hair. The 
            anti-heroic protagonist of Sam Mendes' latest dysfunctional family 
            saga, Sullivan initially appears possessed of a pleasantly upper 
            middle-class existence, ensconced in a large, elegant home with his 
            quietly supportive (and quickly dispatched) wife Annie (Jennifer 
            Jason Leigh) and two young sons, Michael Jr. (Tyler Hoechlin) and 
            Peter (Liam Aiken). The family's routine is established via stock 
            nostalgia imagery: kids in knickers, mom in the kitchen, low-angle 
            shots, slightly gray lighting. The kids ride their bikes home from 
            school and dutifully do their homework. Mom makes dinner. Dad 
            arrives. No one says much. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Sullivan is 
            introduced by way of Michael Jr.'s perspective, in a poignant, 
            affecting scene. Sent to fetch his father for dinner, Michael pauses 
            in the hallway outside his parents' bedroom, watching his father 
            through the narrow frame: the camera moves closer to approximate 
            Michael's focus: dad is removing his keys and change from his 
            pockets, laying them carefully on the bed. And then, he removes his 
            gun. He never turns to see his son. Cut back to Michael's face, 
            partly shadowed, partly alarmed, wholly intrigued, a fleeting image 
            that makes completely clear the child's complex mix of fear and love 
            for his father. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">It's one of 
            many ominous images in the film inspired by its source, Max Allen 
            Collins and Richard Piers Rayner's 1998 graphic novel, a suitably 
            gloomy evocation of murder as corporate business, something that 
            Sullivan does during working hours in order to provide for his 
            family, to whom he appears intimidating and mysterious. Though 
            Michael knows enough not to ask what his father does for a living -- 
            namely, kill people for Chicago boss John Rooney (Paul Newman) -- 
            he's also curious enough to check it out for himself. The film's 
            major and ongoing trauma begins one stormy night, when Michael stows 
            away in the back of his dad's car. &nbsp;</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Thunder 
            crashes. It happens that Sullivan and Rooney's obviously troubled 
            blood-son Connor (Daniel Craig) are out on a job, and they end up 
            murdering several men, Tommy guns blazing. Michael sees the whole 
            thing, having slipped out of the car so that he can peer under a 
            doorway. He's also seen, of course. And though Sullivan assures 
            Connor that the kid's okay and won't tell, Connor, who is paranoid 
            and mean on a good day, takes it all very badly. In fact, he takes 
            it as an excuse to get back at Sullivan, whom he has forever seen as 
            a rival for his own father's affection and trust. And in this case, 
            his paranoia has been justified -- though the elder Rooney has a 
            &quot;thing&quot; about family, he does sincerely love Sullivan, preferring 
            his loyal, efficient, and appropriately mournful adoptive son to his 
            whiny, inept, and conveniently villainous blood relative.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Rooney drops by 
            to pat the boy on his head, and it's clear that nothing will be all 
            right. Whatever familial equilibrium the Sullivans and the Rooneys 
            have pretended to share all these years is now destroyed. And so, 
            Sullivan and Michael go on the run, which means that <i>Road to 
            Perdition</i>'s father-son romance begins in earnest. The film is 
            deeply invested in this theme, and if you've seen any of the many 
            interviews with Hanks or Newman or both, you'll know that they've 
            been asked repeatedly about their own fathers, their own sons, and 
            their own views on the whole family &quot;thing.&quot; While it's surely an 
            interesting theme, it's also one that's received a lot of attention 
            over the past few hundred years. And so, the story here won't be 
            very surprising. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Michael's 
            voice-over structures David Self's script, so you know from the 
            beginning that his six weeks on the road with dad during the winter 
            of 1931 will be life-changing, and that he will come to admire the 
            man he has until then barely known. Emulating the <i>Lone Ranger</i> 
            stories Michael loves to read under his blanket with a flashlight, 
            their adventure entails a series of lessons: his father teaches him 
            to shoot, to drive, to keep watch. They embark on a series of 
            Midwestern bank robberies, as Sullivan seeks to hit the Chicago mob 
            where it hurts, conveyed in a nifty montage that looks like a 
            graphic novel in motion, the camera panning over robbery 
            scenes-like-panels, as the pair rack up the loot. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The film's 
            well-founded reverence for its source -- manifested in its artful 
            darkness (repeated shots of rainy nights, bodies rising and falling 
            in silhouette), and precise composition (a scene toward the end, 
            where a brightly lit beach house becomes a backdrop for blood, 
            everywhere) -- makes for a magnificent look. Shot by Conrad L. Hall, 
            the film's perfectly grim surface evokes eons of pain, as well as a 
            highly stylized contemporary sensibility, not so much cynical as 
            skeptical and self-aware.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Such sheer 
            beauty almost makes up for the film's tired plot (Eastwood and 
            Costner's <i>A Perfect World</i> comes to mind), in which a boy sees 
            his father (figure) redeemed by good intentions, if not acts, 
            exactly. Michael's becoming-a-man story is, finally, less classic 
            than contrived; he doesn't witness most of his dad's shadowy 
            brutality, and when you see it, the thugs and gangsters are so 
            easily identifiable as such that the moral dilemma that's supposed 
            to emerge never does: instead, you see Tom Hanks shooting the bad 
            guys. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Perhaps 
            appropriately, <i>Road to Perdition</i>'s most complicated, 
            unsympathetic, and compelling character is the scuzzy hitman-photographer 
            Maguire. Not in the novel, Maguire is Self's creation, a perverse, 
            po-mo commentary on all that's laid out before you -- the 
            conventions, the legends, the gorgeous images, the sociopolitical 
            allusions. For Maguire, killing is a business and an art, and his 
            attention to detail aligns him -- creepily, if you think about it -- 
            with the film's own meticulous aesthetic. Introduced as he's 
            photographing a not-quite-dead subject (listed in the credits as 
            &quot;Living Corpse,&quot; and played by someone named, so evocatively, 
            Monte), Maguire looks annoyed that he has to finish the job to get 
            his shot, smothering the guy, who's already quite bloody, thanks, 
            with a big butcher knife stuck in his chest. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Maguire takes 
            pride in his vocation, but he's too sinister and self-loving to see 
            much else. His first encounter with Sullivan has them conversing 
            across separate diner booths, mirroring one another in their dark 
            topcoats and hats (Sullivan's is a standard fedora; Maguire's a 
            natty bowler). As yet unaware that Maguire is hired to kill him, 
            Sullivan asks about his camera, which Maguire is deftly loading with 
            film: &quot;Is that your profession or your pleasure?&quot; Maguire smiles, 
            winds his film ferociously, then clunks the instrument on the table 
            before him: &quot;Both I guess. To be paid to do what you love, ain't 
            that the dream?&quot; Sullivan and Rooney, and even Connor, see 
            themselves as engaged in serious, family business. It's strangely 
            gratifying that Maguire has less grand delusions.</font></span></td>
