            review by <a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>, 30 August 2002</i></font><p>
            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Back with her second concert film 
            -- after <i>I'm the One That I Want</i> -- master comedienne 
            Margaret Cho will have her many free-spirited fans roaring with 
            laughter within seconds and the rest of the audience hoping its 
            collective gut won't be spilling out into the aisles. Except for 
            that one gray-haired patron, obviously with something stuck up her 
            derriere, heard in the theater lobby after the film had ended, &quot;That 
            was just dreadful. How can people think that's funny?&quot; Obviously her 
            prissy Republican sentimentality would have been better served by 
            Charlton Heston in an N.R.A. promotional spot, but, given the film 
            was a free preview screening, why the heck did she stay through the 
            whole ninety-five minutes if she hated it so much? Sado-masochists 
            aside, it's apparent that some people will remain steadfastly 
            clueless in lieu of this healthy dose of wacky hysteria.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The rest of us have already clued 
            in on Cho's raunchy social commentaries, and her latest presentation 
            will certainly win over new converts. Simply put, she's a hoot.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now I can't review <i>Notorious 
            C.H.O.</i> for its cinematic elegance or breathtaking vistas. It's 
            basically just a filmed performance, although director Lorene 
            Machado does add some nice bookends to the one-woman show, watching 
            the gloriously rainy day, expectant crowd as it shuffles into the 
            Paramount Theater in Seattle late last year, and later as it exits, 
            with everyone from the orchestra to the balcony reveling in an 
            evening of overstuffed entertainment. The stage is dressed with bare 
            necessity: five Greek columns, a stool, and a couple of bottles of 
            mineral water. Director of photography keeps Cho in focus, mostly in 
            closeup, thankfully only occasionally breaking for an audience 
            reaction shot. The gift to everyone else (i.e. those of us watching 
            in the movie theater), is a marvelously funny document presenting 
            Cho's large body of work and her bawdy take on politics, sex, 
            family, and other ripe targets. A good portion of screen time is 
            spent allowing for the roar of the audience to calm down from its 
            many fits of laughter. And that's quite okay, as you do need to 
            catch your breath that much.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There's a bonus South Park-ish 
            animated short subject at the head of the film, featuring Cho and a 
            black friend pontificating on racial misunderstandings and 
            disparaging labels. It's a brief, great sendoff, miles away from 
            Cho's cartoon contribution to <i>Rugrats</i>.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Often compared to Lenny Bruce and 
            Richard Pryor, among others, Cho mixes the grace of a bulldog, the 
            energy of a stand-up cyclone, and the irreverent sluttish pride of a 
            freewheeling comic genius. She doesn't get this from her parents, 
            Korean immigrants who raised the thirty-three-year-old Margaret in 
            San Francisco. More likely she was a child of her environment, 
            living and learning from the hippies, drag queens, and other '60s' 
            burnouts that bypassed her on Haight Street.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Margaret proudly shows her parents 
            on-screen as they scramble for words to explain their daughter to 
            the viewers. Margaret turns the table on her traditional mom, 
            scrunches up her face, squints her eyes, pitches up her voice, and 
            becomes…an amusingly impious alter-mom. This proud momma is one of 
            the many characters side-splittingly portrayed by Cho, yet still the 
            one with the most deserved screen time. Special treatment is given 
            to Julie, a whiny, dyslexic colon-hydro-therapist/amateur actress, a 
            loony, bubbly creation assisting Cho with her first colonic 
            irrigation (eeeww!). Cho's side-splitting approach to this &quot;medical 
            procedure&quot; is divinely entertaining. Equally inspired is her raucous 
            what-if commentary on the redneck male approach to having a woman's 
            period, mixing heavy flow days, the Super Bowl, old socks, coffee 
            filters, and the newspaper sports section.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When she's in self-mode, sans 
            extra-charestial makeup, she tears into all things American. Gays, 
            drag queens, prejudice, S&amp;M sex clubs (&quot;They're bossy!&quot;), 
            video-store late fees, the elusive search for her G-spot (Mapquest 
            didn't help), sexual techniques (putting &quot;Who's your daddy?&quot; to much 
            better use than Dana Carvey in <i>The Master of Disguise</i>), and 
            food and obesity (reflecting on her younger days battling numerous 
            eating disorders). Even in this post 9/11 day and age, she proudly 
            talks of her lewd contribution to the Ground Zero rescue workers. 
            And the audience offers it patriotic approval.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There's never a dull moment here. 
            Yet within the laughter is a fair dose of self-esteem. <i>Notorious 
            C.H.O.</i> is a Genuine R.I.O.T.</font></td>
