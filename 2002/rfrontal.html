            early morning, Nicholas (Blair Underwood) leaves his white-on-white
            bedroom and heads to JFK. There he meets Catherine (Julia Roberts),
            a reporter doing a major magazine feature on him. They fly to L.A.,
            where he's shooting a film with Brad Pitt; as she probes him about
            his role, Nicholas talks about his career moves and his choices,
            then fesses up: he's playing &quot;the sidekick.&quot; During the
            cross-country flight, they eat and talk, and he starts thinking
            she's falling for him, mostly due to a letter on red stationary he
            finds in his seat, a note in which the writer declares desperate and
            undying love for him. The more emphatically she says that she didn't
            write the note, the more he thinks she's his secret admirer (&quot;I
            am onto you, girl!&quot;). And so on. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            Steven Soderbergh's <i>Full Frontal</i>, Nicholas and Catherine are
            characters in a movie-within-the-movie called <i>Rendezvous</i>,
            played by actors named Calvin and Francesca. In <i>Rendezvous</i>,
            they appear on 35mm and Catherine wears a wig. When they're not in
            the movie, they're on video, grainy and handheld, you know, gritty
            and &quot;realistic.&quot; Calvin and Francesca hardly speak. In <i>Rendezvous</i>,
            Nicholas and Catherine are headed toward a corny romance, pushed
            along, apparently, by Nicholas' lengthy speech about the lot of
            black men in the business: no sex scenes, especially with white
            costars like, say, Catherine-Francesca-Julia. &quot;Can't a brother
            get some love?&quot; he asks, riding in the studio car taking them
            to the movie set. &quot;That's the state of being a chocolate
            leading man in Hollywood today.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Calvin,
            by contrast, is getting some love, most visibly from his white
            mistress, Lee (Catherine Keener), a personnel director. Or rather,
            not very visibly, as their afternoon tryst is shot in blurred out
            video, so the figures' races and lusty passions are clear, but their
            faces are unrecognizable. You only see who they are -- or rather,
            who Lee is, as Calvin is the only black man in <i>Full Frontal</i>
            -- when they're done, bickering their way to a break-up. Can't a
            brother get some love? It turns out that Calvin does have a steady,
            Lucy (Erika Alexander), who has little to do except show up at a
            party scene late in the film and watch Calvin kiss a little industry
            ass. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still,
            the question hangs over the rest of the film, which is about white
            folks feeling bereft and beleaguered in their privileged existences.
            Lee's distress reaches a kind of boiling point when Calvin drops
            her, but she's so cruel to her own employees earlier in the day (her
            assignment for the day that takes up <i>Full Frontal</i>'s time is
            to perform a &quot;bloodbath&quot;) that even her meltdown is less
            moving than troubling. Her sister, Linda (Mary McCormack), is a
            masseuse to wealthy Beverly Hills types, including the producer of
            the moment, Gus (David Duchovny), posing as Bill and offering money
            for a hand-job. Lee is married, vaguely unhappily, to Carl (David
            Hyde Pierce), a writer for <i>Los Angeles</i> magazine, which
            apparently runs a Brad Pitt cover every month. Not only is Carl
            responsible for the dreck that is <i>Rendezvous</i>; he's also
            working on another script with his writing partner, Arty (Enrico
            Colantoni), currently directing a play they've written, <i>The Sound
            and the Führer</i>, with an annoyingly supercilious actor playing
            Hitler (Nicky Katt). <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Written
            by Soderbergh and his frequent collaborator Coleman Hough, <i>Full
            Frontal</i> is a smug movie about smug characters in a smug
            environment. On one level -- and it has many too-clever levels -- it
            explores the tensions between reality and fiction in film, the
            ostensible appeal of &quot;realism&quot; and the arrogant folly of
            it. On another, it works themes from 1989's <i>sex, lies &amp;
            videotape</i>, including sex, intimacy, desire, and fear. On
            another, it's more of Soderbergh's own Me Show, as when you notice
            that, on Nicholas and Catherine's plane, across the aisle, sits
            Wilson (Terence Stamp), the ferocious anti-hero of <i>The Limey</i>.
            He appears here in an insert from that film, just as <i>The Limey</i>
            so famously included inserts from another Stamp film, 1967's <i>Poor
            Cow</i>. So wily, so multi-layered! <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And
            on yet another level, it's all about Acting with a capital A. In
            casting <i>Full Frontal</i>, Soderbergh issued a list of rules:
            actors had to provide their own costumes, makeup, and meals, and
            they had to come up with in-character answers to interview questions
            he asked during the eighteen-day, $2 million shoot. These interviews
            are run as voice-over in several scenes. It's all so low budget, so
            arty, so penetrating. And so smug.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            manifest self-satisfaction makes <i>Full Frontal</i>'s gears grind.
            While you're watching, you may be inclined to think that the
            melodramatic plot and silly characters are deliberate devices, such
            that the absurdity and annoyingness of the &quot;real&quot; (video)
            sections comment doubly (or triply, as there is yet another layer of
            film-within-the-filmness here) on the absurdity and annoyingness of
            the &quot;unreal&quot; (film) sections. So, Hitler
            &quot;really&quot; is a jerk, and he mistreats his director as well
            as his girlfriend. Hence, he has no name except &quot;Hitler.&quot;
            Or, you might think, Francesca is a shallow movie-star-diva because
            she picks at her tuna fish sandwich and orders her lackey to bring
            her wet-naps. Not exactly an original observation of a star, but
            okay. Then, she meets someone small, an extra from her past, and she
            treats him well, apparently glad to meet someone who knew her before
            she was a shallow movie-star-diva. Gee, Francesca's not
            &quot;really&quot; so bad after all. Her egotism and condescension
            are a self-preserving illusion. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Or,
            you watch Lee resist her dull but stable marriage to a decent man
            and pursue an exciting but cheerless liaison with a vain one and
            conclude that she must be &quot;damaged.&quot; Just in case you need
            some help in that deduction, Carl's voice-over lays out that she is
            genuinely troubled, owing to a childhood trauma: &quot;She's like a
            dog that was hit by a car. She's still walking, but some very
            important things inside her are damaged.&quot; In other words, Lee's
            meanness and insecurity have &quot;real&quot; causes, so maybe she's
            not so bad, either. Maybe Carl can save her, after all. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Pretentious
            and common, these storylines might appear to be glosses on the
            pretentiousness and commonness of most movie storylines. And that's
            one way to read <i>Full Frontal</i>, as an unoriginal but somewhat
            ambitious self-parody. Soderbergh, however, says otherwise, and if
            this is more of the parody, it's pretty good, or at least good
            enough to get over on the <i>New York Times</i>' Elvis Mitchell.
            Soderbergh has Mitchell believing that the film explores levels of
            &quot;reality,&quot; that it's a small-scale consideration of the
            &quot;pact&quot; between viewers and films. In this light, he says,
            it is, like all his films, about &quot;our efforts to connect.&quot;
            (Um, whose efforts?) Here, much as in Soderbergh's other movies,
            these efforts are at cross-purposes, resulting in repeated
            frustration and occasional revelation.</font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Whatever
            Soderbergh thinks the film is doing, however, is pretty much beside
            the point. Its layering of fear and intimacy, realness and
            unrealness, does indeed recall <i>sex, lies &amp; videotape</i> (the
            film that he and Miramax evoke by opening <i>Full Frontal</i> on the
            same date, thirteen years later), namely, the ways that deceptions
            (playing roles, fabricating stories, preserving fantasies) sustain
            as well as spoil relationships, the ways that they are integral to
            human &quot;connections.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><i><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Full
            Frontal</span></font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">
            is also one of Soderbergh's celebrated &quot;alternate&quot;
            projects -- the &quot;little&quot; ones he makes in between the <i>Erin
            Brockovich</i>es and the <i>Oceans Eleven</i>s -- in order to remind
            everyone that he's not just a skilled mainstream director, but also
            thoughtful and self-conscious, an artist who recognizes the ugly
            effects of his chosen business. What this new film doesn't seem to
            acknowledge is its own participation in such effects. Even at its
            smartest, <i>Full Frontal</i> points out the obvious: celebrity
            culture is unreal, reality is contrived, and movies provide
            sustenance. Does anyone really worry about this anymore? <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Given
            the banality of these observations, it's either ironic or little
            wonder that the film's least pretentious appearance is Brad Pitt's.
            He plays the cop to whom Calvin's Nicholas plays sidekick, and he
            shows up a couple of other times on <i>Los Angeles</i> magazine
            covers, hanging in Carl's office, with headlines like, &quot;The Zen
            of Brad Pitt.&quot; When Pitt is moving on screen, it's mostly on
            playback video: he runs to the camera, through a smattering of
            passersby (&quot;Outta the way!&quot;), chasing some unseen criminal
            for his cop-buddy flick, directed by David Fincher. Calvin/Nicholas
            puffs along beside him. Before you can ask, &quot;Can't a brother
            get some love?&quot; director Fincher is bestowing much of it on
            Brad Pitt, so full of Zen, and ignoring the sidekick. The moment is
            as &quot;real&quot; as <i>Full Frontal</i> movie gets.</font></span></td>
