            review by <a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 8 November 2002</i></font><p>
            <span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="5">Bait and Switch</font><font size="2">
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700">
            <font size="2">Two years ago, Eriq Ebouaney starred in Raoul Peck's 
            stunning, under-seen <i>Lumumba</i>. This year, in Brian De Palma's
            <i>Femme Fatale</i>, he's playing a thug referred to only as Black 
            Tie. Chances are that more people will see him in this film, and 
            that's too bad.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Black Tie first 
            appears -- in the attire for which he is named -- entering a swank 
            Cannes hotel room occupied by Laure (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos). She's 
            lying on her bed, in her panties, with her back to the camera, 
            watching <i>Double Indemnity</i> on TV. Just as Barbara Stanwyck 
            confesses to Fred MacMurray that she's &quot;rotten to the heart,&quot; Black 
            Tie steps into the frame, chastising Laure: she's not ready for her 
            mission. Laure stands, her back still to the camera but facing Black 
            Tie. When she speaks, he slaps her so hard that her face whips round 
            toward the camera. She gathers herself and leaves the room, ready 
            for her mission. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">This moment is 
            startling, even a little audacious. A black man hitting a beautiful, 
            nearly naked white movie star, here making her first effort to carry 
            a project other than MTV's &quot;Sexiest Videos Countdown&quot; -- you just 
            don't see that every day. And yet <i>Femme Fatale</i> uses this 
            shook-up moment in the least interesting way possible, to establish 
            sympathy for the girl. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Thus 
            established, Laure appears next outside on a red carpet, where she's 
            fronting as a photographer for a film premiere at the Palais des 
            Festivals, surrounded by famous film luminaries as themselves: 
            Sandrine Bonnaire, Gilles Jacob, Dorothée Grosjean, the director 
            Régis Wargnier. One of Laure's photo subjects is a breathtaking 
            starlet (Rie Rasmussen) wearing a bejeweled serpentine rig that 
            barely covers her nipples. Within minutes, Laure and Starlet are 
            making out inside a bathroom stall, while Black Tie crouches in the 
            adjacent stall, slipping fake jewelry under the partition to replace 
            the real jewelry Laure removes from Starlet, who sighs and moans 
            with pleasure. As the women writhe and press against the semi-opaque 
            stall wall, the camera passes over Black Tie's face in sweaty 
            close-up. And so, the audience and the &quot;sides&quot; become unclear: is 
            Starlet in on the heist? Is she performing for Black Tie? Is Laure 
            performing for Starlet? And does Black Tie even have a real name?
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Arresting as 
            they might seem -- at first -- these two scenes only comprise small 
            bits of <i>Femme Fatale'</i>s grandiose, fifteen-minute opening, 
            which includes tension-making cuts between Laure and Black Tie's 
            fellow thieves, wielding standard caper-movie gadgetry, like video 
            cameras, body-cables, laser cutters, and night vision goggles -- all 
            under a smartly souped-up version of &quot;Bolero,&quot; by Ryuichi Sakamoto. 
            Well choreographed and sinuous as it is, this lengthy opening 
            business makes little narrative sense. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">This illogic is 
            exacerbated once the theft goes bad. Laure absconds with some $10 
            million in diamonds, bloodied bodies gasping behind her: perhaps 
            she's not so compliant or conventionally &quot;sympathetic&quot; as she first 
            looked. In fact, she's tough and oddly moralistic: &quot;You said no 
            guns!&quot; she hisses at one betrayer who is, at that moment, leaking 
            fluids all over the white marble floor. She makes her way out of the 
            supposedly super-secure theater, eventually making her way to a 
            meeting with her partner and fence, Starlet in a fashionable 
            camouflage outfit: how appropriate. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Laure's nerve 
            and ingenuity are especially impressive in a Brian De Palma movie. 
            She also lucks out, incredibly, when she's mistaken for someone else 
            (by that someone else's parents, no less), and so is accidentally 
            rescued from the vengeful Black Tie and his partner Racine (Edouard 
            Montoute). Following a series of increasingly implausible 
            coincidences, Laure (who is not French, but poses as French, and 
            somehow convinces all her French acquaintances that her French and 
            her accent are genuine) leaves the country, then returns, &quot;seven 
            years later.&quot; Now she's living in Paris with a new husband, 
            Ambassador to France Bruce Hewitt Watts (De Palma regular Peter 
            Coyote), as well as a security guard (another regular, Gregg Henry), 
            wearing white designer coats, white scarves, and big, hyper-stylish 
            sunglasses. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Mysterious 
            women and mistaken identities, European intrigue and bloody 
            violence, sunglasses and white scarves -- it all sounds familiar. 
            And so it appears that, after several recent diversions (among them,
            </font></span><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
            Mission: Impossible</font></span></i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
            and <i>Mission to Mars</i>), De Palma has returned to his favorite 
            endeavor: remaking Hitchcock movies. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">This time, it's 
            mostly <i>Vertigo</i>, with Romijn-Stamos not quite evoking Kim 
            Novak. She's charismatic in a wifty, occasionally fascinating, way, 
            and she's obviously used to striking seductive poses. And she 
            honestly has a tough job of it here, with dialogue that you wouldn't 
            wish on your worst enemy: who, after all, could make sense of &quot;You 
            don't have to lick my ass, just f*ck me!&quot; That is, no one is going 
            to mistake Romijn-Stamos' performance in <i>Femme Fatale</i> for a 
            &quot;breakthrough.&quot; (De Palma has compared selecting her to selecting 
            Kevin Costner for <i>The Untouchables</i>: I rest my case). While 
            she's apparently pushing her limits by playing two characters (which 
            mostly entails wearing different wigs), Romijn-Stamos does look 
            amazing in her skimpy costumes, and she humps a pool table like no 
            one else. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Her central 
            function, in other words, is looking great and so, confounding 
            various men around her: Black Tie, the Ambassador, and, of course, 
            the poor sap standing in for Jimmy Stewart/Fred MacMurray, 
            inexorably sucked into her vortex. In this case, he is 
            grizzle-faced, reluctant-but-very-good-at-it paparazzo Nicolas Bardo 
            (exceedingly good sport Antonio Banderas). Desperate for money, he 
            shoots some pictures of the Ambassador's wife, which are in turn 
            plastered all over Paris (because, inexplicably, the U.S. 
            Ambassador's wife is deemed worthy of tabloid coverage). </font>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Laure (now 
            passing as &quot;Lily&quot;) determines to seduce the photographer, who is, in 
            turn, willing to believe she is in danger. Obviously, he's never 
            seen a De Palma film, or a Hitchcock film, for that matter. And so, 
            he's lured in, despite his better (or worse, who can tell?) 
            judgment. When he drops her off at the Sheraton (where he has just 
            prevented her from shooting herself with a gun he watched her buy at 
            a &quot;sex shop,&quot; then spent the afternoon regaling her with tales of 
            his wayward youth), Nicolas is stunned when Laure strips to her 
            expensive underwear, long legs lithing all over the furniture. Jaw 
            dropped, he asks, seemingly undone by his good fortune, &quot;Are you 
            flirting with me?&quot; (Gee, you think?) Incredibly, she has an answer: 
            &quot;All your boyhood stories make you so damn lovable.&quot; Clinch. </font>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Because you've 
            seen Laure in action previously, you have a good idea what she's up 
            to, and so the &quot;flirting&quot; doesn't have quite the same effect on you 
            as it seems to on hapless Nicolas. Defenseless as he is against 
            Laure, you may be forgiven for hoping that Black Tie's inevitable 
            reappearance will lead to some emotional tangling, some expression 
            of intelligence or desire that's not a pose. But no. He emerges from 
            prison, still in his tux, declaring that he's spent all his seven 
            years inside thinking about that darn femme. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">In the end, <i>
            Femme Fatale</i> can't get out of its own stylized way. For all De 
            Palma's famously extravagant and often exhilarating technique (deep 
            focus, split screens, foreboding close-ups, crazy-sharp camerawork, 
            here by Luc Besson's usual DP Thierry Arbogast), the film remains 
            spectacularly uninvolving. </font></span></td>
