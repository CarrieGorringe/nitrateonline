            review by <a href="../paula.html" target="_top">Paula Nechak</a>, 10 May 2002</i></font><p>
            <font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>It would be easy to dismiss Adrian 
            Lyne’s verisimilitude movie, <i>Unfaithful</i>, as a close-clone of 
            his overwrought pleasure, the 1987 hit, <i>Fatal Attraction</i>, but 
            it would be a big mistake. <i>Unfaithful</i>, unlike <i>Fatal 
            Attraction</i>, doesn’t play at being a grown-up. It carries the 
            weight and wisdom of age - Lyne’s, the times, the actors, who for 
            their gorgeousness, tote a script by the sturdy Alvin Sargent toward 
            a lovely, ambiguous ending that’s mature and sensibly, if 
            frustratingly smart.</b> </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There’s a quiet gravity that 
            fragrances <i>Unfaithful</i> with slow-moving, unexpected depth. As 
            in all of Lyne’s movies (<i>Flashdance</i>, <i>Jacob’s Ladder</i>,
            <i>9 1/2 Weeks</i>, <i>Fatal Attraction</i>, <i>Lolita</i>) we enjoy 
            his inspirationally perfect set and costume designs (in this case 
            filtered through choke-inducing smoke machines that were pumped onto 
            the set to filter the color) as well as his attention to urban 
            detail, but he’s given us more to chew upon this time around than 
            eye candy. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While Lyne made all those visual 
            elements converge just as wonderfully in <i>Fatal Attraction</i> the 
            heated, alarmist response to the film and its garish bloodbath of an 
            ending overshadowed its real intent -- that mistakes happen in 
            quiet, unobtrusive ways and can tear at the fabric of trust. 
            Instead, the focus was on the &quot;kill the bitch&quot; mentality that needed 
            to annihilate Alex Forrest instead of understanding her illness and 
            motivation. The film-going masses had to assuage some universal 
            guilt and maintain their illusion of happy family rather than accept 
            her pathology. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The wonderfully seductive 
            subversiveness of Lyne’s new film lies instead in its calm. He takes 
            the first hour to give us a sense of who the Sumner family is. He 
            invites us inside their gorgeous upstate New York home and 
            languishes us within the seemingly perfect veneer of their life 
            together. &nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For awhile there are no cracks, 
            just a comfort that gives us comfort. There are no spurned women 
            tossing acid on the Sumner car or boiled bunnies on the stove. It’s&nbsp; 
            a radically different vehicle that drives <i>Unfaithful</i>, which 
            in its everyday, upwardly mobile malaise, works because its act of 
            infidelity is so unexpected and unwanted. It looks inward instead of 
            outward for its reasons and it takes great responsibility for 
            itself, much to our relief. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If there is joy in watching the 
            film, there’s greater joy in the work that Diane Lane, as Connie 
            Sumner, musters. Has there been a performance as extraordinary as 
            this one this year? I think not. She is so sympathetic, likeable and 
            agile that we’re willing to go along with her, unlike the selfish 
            Michael Douglas character in <i>Fatal Attraction</i>. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Connie loves her husband 
            (well-played by Richard Gere) and son but she becomes overpowered by 
            the erotic thought of Paul Martel, the handsome, street-thuggish 
            Frenchman with whom she collides on a windy Manhattan day, and who 
            invites her up to his unbelievably trendy loft after she scrapes her 
            knee on the cobbled Soho street. Paul, played by Gallic heartthrob 
            Olivier Martinez (<i>The Horseman on the Roof</i>), is an enigma, 
            full of bad come-on cliches and pumped with an immature urgency that 
            nearly makes him narcisstically and voyeuristically icky. </font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">He likes seducing this married 
            woman and he doesn’t give a whit about her husband and son. He 
            preens in his conquest and there’s a threat of violence in him. But 
            when the film changes color in the last third, and husband and lover 
            meet, he becomes docile and deflated. Perhaps it’s because he’s 
            confronting another man - Gere’s wounded spouse - and for a moment 
            feels empathy instead of crowing like a cock at his bedding another 
            man’s wife. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We like him for a few minutes - too 
            late as it may be. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Unfaithful</i> was adapted by 
            Sargent from the 1968 Claude Chabrol film, <i>La Femme Infidele</i>, 
            and&nbsp; if it looks quintessentially American, even with Martinez’ 
            presence, it also feels European. American films don’t let women 
            characters have the range of emotion or the rich and textured inner 
            life that Connie reveals. And Lane, the child star who splashed in
            <i>A Little Romance</i>, later fell off the face of the earth only 
            to re-surface with a wonderful turn in television’s <i>Lonesome Dove</i> 
            miniseries a decade and a half ago, has been building, after fine 
            performances in films like <i>A Walk on the Moon</i>, into a force 
            of nature to reckon with. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Witness her riot of feeling as she 
            struggles, after first sleeping with Paul, on the train ride back 
            home: she weeps with pleasure, catches herself, feels guilt and pain 
            and then sudden pleasure again at a memory of his touching her. She 
            trembles with desire and reins herself in as she gains cognizance of 
            the graveness of her slippage. A world travels through her in just a 
            few screen seconds. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film belongs to her entirely. 
            Gere is solidly good and highly credible and his climactic move, 
            which slaps us in the face and brings us full-circle to all that has 
            gone before, is desperately succinct. But though the film shifts 
            into his hands in its final act, it is the thought of Connie’s face, 
            at first passingly lovely, then flushed and radiant in her 
            re-discovery of her&nbsp; sensual and sexual self - finally tired with 
            the full knowledge of the repercussions and ramifications of her 
            infidelity and the wound it has inflicted upon her family, that 
            embeds in our brains. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Lyne avoids condemnations, blame, 
            judgement and moral cruxes, instead relying upon that pervasive 
            calm, foundation and nebulous territory to close his film. In that 
            stillness there is a power and resonance that understands the 
            complexity of human relationships far more fully than the finality 
            of a gunshot. </font>
