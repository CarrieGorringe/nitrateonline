            <font face="Verdana" size="5">28th Seattle International Film 
            Festival</font><p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">In a career 
            replete with masterworks (<i>Return of the Secaucus Seven</i>, <i>
            Eight Men Out</i>), director John Sayles has added another to his 
            repertoire with &nbsp;his wonderful new film, <i>Sunshine State.</i> 
            Ostensibly the tale of how a developer is attempting to desecrate 
            the traditional way of life in a small seaside town in the &quot;sunshine 
            state&quot; of Florida (in the name of erecting high-end condos and 
            &quot;plantation&quot; homes), the film's title is a play on prevailing social 
            conditions and tensions. This being a John Sayles film, no detail is 
            devoid of metaphorical significance: there are naturally two 
            &quot;sunshine states&quot; at work in this not-so-sleepy little town. In 
            addition to the beautiful surroundings, there is the obligatory 
            &quot;sunshine state&quot; in which most of the inhabitants find and place 
            themselves: they paper over worries and resentments with the usual 
            thin veneer of &quot;happy talk&quot; and formal behavior, but it's never 
            quite enough to conceal the socio-political tectonic plates rumbling 
            and grinding against each other just below the surface. </font></b>
            </p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In the midst of this, the lives and 
            crises of two women stand out. Desirée (Angela Bassett) returns home 
            with her new husband, a successful anesthesiologist (James McDaniel) 
            to the home of her estranged mother (Mary Alice). The constant 
            presence of Desirée's husband by her side is her armor against 
            reality, but whether or not her marriage will be effective in 
            helping her to confront and surmount aspects of her obviously deeply 
            troublesome past is debatable . Marly (Edie Falco) is the proprietor 
            of a run-down nearly-beachfront motel inherited from her father 
            (Ralph Waite). Once an aspiring oceanographer, she must decide 
            whether or not it's worth selling off the family property to a group 
            of eager developers, or holding on to the familiar, if 
            uncomfortable, life she now has; her decision isn't given much 
            encouragement by her father (Ralph Waite), who has his own ambiguous 
            feelings about a possible sale. Around the trials of these two women 
            swirl issues of race and class: the developers who are interested in 
            Marly's motel are also trying to buy up what was once a segregated 
            beach for the black middle and upper-middle classes, now prime real 
            estate for whites who are trying to create &quot;paradise&quot; by American 
            middle-class standards (snidely, if aptly, defined by an outside 
            observer as &quot;nature on a leash&quot;). This sets off protests by the few 
            black community leaders remaining in the town, protests that 
            threaten to mar the attempts of civic boosters to improve their 
            town's image by creating a new tourist attraction : the &quot;Buccaneer 
            Days&quot; festival. These disparate, yet interconnected events play 
            themselves out over the course of a long weekend, and, as might be 
            expected in this type of film, reveal to the characters exactly what 
            they already know about themselves.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">What places <i>Sunshine State</i> 
            above other films of this type is the meticulous plotting that is 
            Sayles' hallmark. As a screenwriter, Sayles practices what might be 
            called &quot;efficient economy&quot; in developing his characters; he 
            instinctively knows how much detail and which ones to utilize in 
            formulating the life of a particular individual. The result is a 
            character full of authenticity, one with no mannerisms that appear 
            forced. He never rushes his characters into situations, giving the 
            character development both time to develop on screen and for the 
            audience to take the information in. By doing this, Sayles further 
            secures a character's sense of legitimacy for the audience. Finally, 
            the director eschews so-called &quot;A-list&quot; casting, opting instead for 
            talented actors who can interpret the material without star personas 
            interfering with the process (this is especially true in the case of 
            Edie Falco, whose standout performance here is so utterly different 
            from her role as the long-suffering mob matriarch on <i>The Sopranos</i> 
            – both in mannerisms and appearance -- as to be unrecognizable). 
            When this is combined with a narrative crafted with equal skill and 
            thoughtfulness, the result is a film that is smooth in style without 
            either losing its depth or becoming stridently didactic. It's a 
            delight to watch on all levels. </font></p>
