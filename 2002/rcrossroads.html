            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In her very first scene in
            &quot;Crossroads&quot;, the pop star Britney Spears is seen wearing
            a pair of white briefs, a short knit top, and cowboy hat, bouncing
            around in her bedroom while singing to Madonna's &quot;Open Your
            Heart&quot;. The effect is the same as the getup she wears in the
            music video for the song (&quot;I'm Not a Girl, Not Yet a
            Woman&quot;) that she recorded for this film, which is to draw your
            eye directly to her bared midriff and navel. A few scenes later, in
            the movie, she turns up wearing a pink lace brassiere and matching
            panties. Is this how she figures she'll start getting considered for
            roles in &quot;A&quot;-list motion picture projects? What she's
            doing is more like flesh-peddling than acting.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I don't know if Britney Spears can
            act -- she doesn't have the granite-walled reserve that Madonna
            showed in her most recent motion picture appearance -- but it turns
            out that there's not much a movie, here, to begin with, and she
            doesn't have a whole lot to do. All the big dramatic scenes have
            either been given to the other performers (who handle then capably),
            or they take place off-camera. When Spears' character has a reunion
            with the mother whom she hasn't seen for 15 years, just as things
            start to get going, the film suddenly cuts to the next scene: Spears
            ends up telling us what happened between the two. (&quot;She didn't
            want me! I was a mistake!&quot;) The result is that she's mostly
            called upon in the film to be pretty and warm. And she gets to sing
            a little. The first time, it's when a song comes on a car radio, and
            when she starts singing along with it, Spears' co-star Anson Mount,
            who's driving, grimaces in a decidedly noticeable manner:
            &quot;Ewwwwww!&quot; (Later, he explains that his reaction is simply
            because he has a thing about &quot;chick things&quot;, although,
            considering he's driving three girls cross-country from Georgia to
            Southern California, it makes you wonder what he's doing there in
            the first place.) Later, in New Orleans, he watches while Spears
            does a karaoke version of &quot;I Love Rock and Roll&quot; in a
            club, and when she starts trying to wow the audience, the film cuts
            back to his reaction, eyes widening yet, nonetheless, trying, ever
            so hard, to grin and act like he's really digging it. The poor guy!
            He doesn't look comfortable at all, and the really hard stuff is yet
            to come, when he has to decide whether or not to go to bed with this
            girl. (And, like several other sequences in the film, this is
            photographed in a dreadfully unflattering manner.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The story has to do with three
            girls who were at one time best friends but, by the time high school
            graduation rolls around, they have drifted apart: one (Taryn
            Manning) lives in a trailer park and has a baby that's on the way;
            another (Zoë Saldana) is a teen queen, and is engaged to a guy
            who's attending U.C.L.A.; the third (played by Spears) is the class
            valedictorian who has worked so hard during the school year that she
            never had any time to have fun. Manning suggests the trip to
            California, ostensibly because of a contest that could lead to an
            audition for a recording contract, but it's also to see if the girls
            can renew their friendship (they do); to visit Saldana's fiance and
            find out if he's been faithful to her (he's not only been unfaithful
            to her, he's been VERY unfaithful to her); and for Spears to drop
            in, out of the blue, to see her estranged mother in Tucson.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The mother is played by Kim
            Cattrall, and when she asks why this strange young girl is on her
            doorstep, Spears replies, &quot;I came to see you.&quot;
            &quot;Why?&quot; asks the mother. &quot;&quot;Cause you're my
            mother.&quot; &quot;And why is that?&quot; Cattrall's character
            replies. While I understand that a teenage girl needs some things
            that only a mother can provide, for this Spears' character has
            blown-off someone who, by all appearances, is a caring father (Dan
            Aykroyd) who raised her, on his own, back in Georgia: she left home
            without telling him, calls him twice, then hangs up on him twice.
            (It also leaves us to wonder how two people who look like Kim
            Cattrall and Dan Aykroyd could have produced someone who looked like
            Britney Spears.) But, hey! it's all part of the learning experience,
            along with the fact that, once they've not only hit the road but are
            well on their way on it, the girls find out that they don't know how
            much money they have to spend, where they're going to stop for the
            night, or how they're going to afford to eat. There's also the fact
            that the guy who's driving them (Mount's character) just got out of
            jail after having served a sentence for killing a guy. (&quot;You
            mean I'm on a road trip with a killer?!&quot;)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Tamra Davis directed this film,
            presumably so that she could provide a &quot;woman's
            perspective&quot; on things. The results look not so much made, put,
            or slapped together as moved together, the way a straw moves ice
            cream and syrup around at the bottom of a soda fountain glass. The
            film is supposed to be a little loose, but it's so loose that it
            barely seems to be on the screen. There will, however, probably be
            much merriment made over this film in the press, with lots of bad
            writing that makes bad puns and references to the title of Spears'
            album &quot;Oops! I Did it Again&quot;. My advice is: it's early in
            the year, guys, save your ammo for later.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"></o:p>
