            <font face="Verdana" size="5">28th Seattle International Film 
            Festival</font><p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In <i>Merci pour 
            le chocolat</i> (<i>Nightcap</i>), Huppert re-teams with one of her 
            favorite directors, the legendary Claude Chabrol, to play out a 
            different interpretation of repression and madness. Huppert plays 
            the icily dignified Marie-Clare (&quot;Mika&quot;) Muller, heiress to a Swiss 
            chocolate company fortune. On the surface, her life is nothing but 
            paradise: her company is a success, allowing her to donate 
            generously to her dearest social causes, and she is a respected 
            businesswoman, not a mere figurehead. She has been able to remarry 
            her ex-husband, André Polanski (Jacques Dutronc) eighteen years 
            after they divorced. Now Mika, André, and his eighteen-year-old son 
            from his second marriage, Guillaume (Rodolphe Pauly) are now 
            comfortably ensconced in Mika's mansion in Lausanne, Switzerland.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Problems begin, however, when a 
            young woman named Jeanne Pollet (Anna Mouglalis) becomes aware of 
            the rumor that she and Rodolphe, both born in the same hospital, 
            might have been switched at birth. Intrigued, she seeks him out and 
            discovers André. André, in turn, is impressed by the promise she 
            shows as a pianist, and he encourages her to come by regularly for 
            training. Mika seems content with this arrangement, even 
            encouraging, but Jeanne can't shake a sense of suspicion about Mika. 
            Jeanne's suspicions are confirmed when, one night, Mika spills some 
            of the hot chocolate she had prepared for Guillaume. Jeanne has it 
            tested, only to discover that it has been laced with a narcotic. 
            When she informs Guillaume of the test results, he brushes them off, 
            until he recalls that his mother had drunk some of Mika's special 
            nightcap before she was killed in a car crash…</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In this, his fifty-third film, 
            Chabrol, like Hitchcock, further reworks the theme of psychological 
            tension that is his trademark. Here, his emphasis upon framing a 
            majority of shots in a medium-long to medium close-up range fixes 
            everything at a merciless remove; the audience's gaze begins as that 
            of a voyeur, then shifts to that of a jury, judging every element 
            with mistrust. The audience is now always on edge, waiting for the 
            next gesture or element to emerge from the clinically cold, but 
            evil, surfaces that comprise Mika and her house. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Without a strong actress in the 
            role of Mika, the entire film would fold in upon itself. Chabrol, 
            however, placed his trust in Huppert for the fourth time, and she 
            has repaid him fully. Her interpretation of Mika is so 
            unquestionably flawless, both because of her acting skills and that 
            milky-skinned, angular face; at the center of Mika's perfect face 
            and demeanor lies a mirror that deflects attention from her 
            homicidally ruthless streak -- until it is (perhaps?) too late. As 
            with her performance in <i>The Piano Teacher</i>, Huppert projects a 
            quietly unrepentant sense of menace, but one with an ostensible core 
            of vulnerability that adds to her mystery, especially when, as in 
            this case, the audience isn't given many details about her 
            character's psychological state. Is Mika merely a sociopath who is 
            unable to effectively conceal her criminal actions, or is she simply 
            so desperate for life on her own terms that she'll do anything in 
            order to achieve it? This is the situation that drives <b><i>
            Chocolat</i></b> (and its audience) through to its final, 
            tension-laden, frames.</font>&nbsp;</p>
