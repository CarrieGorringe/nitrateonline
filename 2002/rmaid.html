            Lopez can't forget to stay real. To her, it's like breathing.
            Apparently, she doesn't want you to forget it either, given that she
            keeps singing about it. The genius of this repetition is that it
            makes the &quot;real&quot; seem (almost) real: you hear it enough,
            it feels like, well, breathing. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Even
            if what's real for her and what's real for you aren't exactly the
            same thing, the J. Lo version clearly has its appeal. Her
            up-from-the-Bronx story has everything going for it, from early
            desires (those shots of young Lopez in dance class that appear on <i>Driven</i>
            suggest she once had an almost endearing vulnerability: she's so
            energetic, so eager), to rapturous romances to tabloidish thrills. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">In
            the retelling, the story expands. As Diane Sawyer puts it,
            &quot;She's not just a star. She's a kind of supernova.&quot; And it
            has inspired the J. Lo machine to monumental acts of imagination,
            not to mention reiteration (&quot;I'm still, I'm still...&quot;).
            Recently, she's taken to dropping a realness-affirming single at the
            same time she's appearing in broadly unreal romantic comedies. So,
            for instance, she'll proclaim, &quot;I'm Real&quot; (in original and
            remix versions), while starring in <i>The Wedding Planner</i> and
            planning a marriage, say, to Cris Judd. (The record and movie opened
            at the tops of their respective charts in 2001; the marriage did
            less well.) <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">This
            year, Lopez is working the same combination, with the release of a
            fourth album (<i>This is Me... Then</i>, selling 314,132 copies in
            its first week: but who's counting?), a hit single (&quot;Jenny From
            the Block,&quot; featuring homegirl with very real-looking MCs
            Jadakiss and Styles), a non-meltdown interview with Diane Sawyer
            concerning her big pink diamond from the Sexiest Man Alive (&quot;He
            is my partner, he is my best friend&quot;), and, of course, the
            feel-goody Cinderella movie, <i>Maid in Manhattan</i>. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">As
            the marketing for the album included -- or morphed into -- marketing
            for the movie and the marriage makes <i>This Is Me... Then</i> seem
            almost anti-climatic. Still, it handles its business much like her
            previous albums have done: it's pleasant and insubstantial, less
            dancey than ballady this time, attributed to her so very sincere
            love with La Ben (though her slender voice is hardly the sort to
            manage big sound). Laced through with hiphop beats and dreamy
            keyboard work, <i>This is Me... Then</i> is blithely out of touch,
            because it can be. Her representation of a &quot;real&quot;
            Jennifer, then or now, needn't expose anything beyond the wealth of
            non-information (and gossip that passes as news and information)
            that's already out there.<o:p>
            </o:p>

            can be anything you need,&quot; Lopez coos at the end of &quot;The
            One&quot; (which borrows concept, sound, and lyrics from &quot;You
            Are Everything&quot;). And it's true, that is precisely what Lopez
            can be, much as her first (and very smart) video, for &quot;If You
            Had My Love,&quot; narrated, with its emphasis on fantasy and
            voyeurism. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            new CD comes with a mini-brochure for &quot;Glow,&quot; her
            &quot;fresh, sexy, clean&quot; fragrance-body lotion-shower gel
            line, and that's pretty much what it feels like -- a means to sell
            you something else, mostly, Lopez the Dream Girl. The tracks cover
            limited thematic ground, mostly having to do with her inspiring new
            romance. Both the deft opener, &quot;Still,&quot; and the cover of
            Carly Simon's &quot;You Belong to Me&quot; feature surprisingly airy
            arrangements, with the elegant Omar Hakim on drums. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">In
            keeping with Lopez's penchant for profitable duets-with-rappers, the
            album also includes a respectable duet with LL Cool J, &quot;All I
            Have,&quot; which they performed with earnest charm on the <i>Today
            Show</i> last Friday (6 December), for the students at Kips Bay High
            School, her alma mater. The kids loved the show, and no wonder: they
            can almost imagine being Dream Girl, making the leap she's made,
            with limited skills, ferocious determination, and an apparently
            unshakable faith in herself. A little girl asked her,
            &quot;Jennifer, how important are family values to you?&quot; Do you
            wonder what she said? In fact, after affirming the value of family,
            she recalled childhood details, sincerely: &quot;I hated Spanish
            music... All you ever ate was Puerto Rican food and... for variety,
            you wanted something else. Can we have McDonald's? Can we have
            pizza? Will you please make some spaghetti? You know what I
            mean?&quot; The kids nodded; they knew.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Lopez's
            love songs are less sincere-seeming. Inspired by you-know-who, these
            include &quot;Loving You,&quot; &quot;Baby I Love You,&quot; and
            &quot;Dear Ben,&quot; are syrupy-synthy declarations of foreverness,
            the last with these lyrics: &quot;I think God made you for me, / A
            mix of passion and fidelity.&quot; You're happy for her, and for Ben
            too, but the point's made already, more than once and in more than
            one venue. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Then
            again, again, Lopez has a gift for repetition. Still relatively new
            to the industry's mega-echelons (as compared to Whitney Houston or
            Mariah Carey), J. Lo has early on figured out how to use the
            overexposure to her advantage. She's not fighting it, but rather,
            turns it back around on the would-be invaders, who are, of course,
            renowned for repetition. Feature writers and interviewers (print and
            TV) like to rehearse her history, so public in its repetition:
            &quot;Fly Girl&quot; to <i>Selena</i> to <i>On the 6</i>, as well as
            her relationships, marriages to &quot;waiter&quot; Ojani Noa and
            &quot;choreographer&quot; Judd, press-ready romance with Puffy, and
            now, the engagement with Affleck. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">As
            lovely as Lopez appears in almost every public appearance -- is
            there a star who smiles more readily for photographers? -- the
            best-selling narratives remain the ones where she's a
            &quot;diva&quot; demanding candles and 250-thread count sheets (and
            recently, according to the <i>Star</i>, a pre-nup); a serial bride
            (she's already been compared unfavorably to Liz Taylor); or a
            selfish temptress: Noa dissed her in the <i>New York Mirror</i> (29
            November 2002), claiming that she dumped him and will dump Affleck.
            &quot;Jennifer does what Jennifer wants,&quot; he says, &quot;To
            hell with anyone else.&quot;<o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Her
            response to this doubtless daunting coverage is actually admirably
            calculated. She meets it head-on. When paparazzi beleaguered her
            with the new beau (even more than they had with the others, save
            Puffy), Jen and Ben took their own show to the media, holding hands,
            smooching for cameras, and, in the video for &quot;Jenny From the
            Block,&quot; doing it all again to a beat. (She tells Sawyer on <i>Primetime
            Live</i>, &quot;A lot of times they catch us... They'll be across
            the street and then we'll see them after and be like, is that a
            camera across the street, underneath that car?&quot;) In MTV's <i>Making
            the Video</i>, Affleck appeared frequently, hanging out on set as
            well as performing as Ben Affleck for the video scenes that emulated
            press harassment (the movie star swore that he wouldn't do another
            music video: &quot;They don't make any sense,&quot; he whined, and
            he's right, but then, neither do most movies).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

            appears variously dressed and undressed, and everywhere --
            introduced in her room, she's shot by a voyeuristic video camera,
            suggesting that she's monitored even in her &quot;private&quot;
            moments. The media vultures (not pictured here) shoot her through
            windows, reading <i>Inquisitor</i> magazine, on the video set, on a
            yacht, at the Barefoot Bar and Grill, at the gas station. Repeated
            freeze frames suggest that the couple has little respite: every time
            they turn around (and even when they don't), someone's snapping
            their picture. Lopez knows how to play this game: she comes right
            back with the sappiest of lyrics and the tritest of beats, just
            daring you to forget the damn song. <o:p>

            phony, don't hate on me,&quot; Lopez sings. &quot;What you get is
            what you see.&quot; Now, you know that's not true: everything about
            Lopez is coiffed, polished and perfected. But the video appears to
            grant you views of the private, spontaneous Jennifer, juxtaposed
            with the primped, shiny-bodied, and shopping Lopez. The fact that
            these private images are &quot;explicit&quot; (with her naked
            breasts blurred out for MTV consumers, and her topless sunbathing
            and watery frolicking with Ben are framed as &quot;playfully
            seductive&quot;) briefly landed this video in the secondary press as
            an object of titillation, and in the &quot;dirty vs. degrading&quot;
            debate recently raised by MuchMusic (including, no surprise, Xtina's
            vid for &quot;Dirrty,&quot; as well as the usual hubbub over
            Britney, Trina, Kim, et. al.). <o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            very imprecision of this distinction -- dirty or degrading -- is
            addressed by &quot;Jenny From the Block,&quot; however obliquely.
            The &quot;morality&quot; of display, of the difference between
            private and public, is partly determined by the presumed producer
            intentions (pornography intends stimulation; gallery art might not),
            but it's more precisely a function of cultural anxiety. Lopez has
            refined her design: she's at ease with her spectacular body and
            offers just enough of it for view -- on magazine covers (in recent
            months: Spanish language <i>Maxim, Ladies Home Journal, Vanity Fair,
            Latina, GQ, InStyle, Harpers Bazaar, Details</i>), in videos, in
            movies -- that she's repeatedly voted &quot;Sexiest&quot;
            woman-latina-star-artist-body. She also claims to appreciate this
            appreciation, giving props to what she calls &quot;my public,&quot;
            by listing them, along with her life and God, as objects of her
            genuine affection. Whether or not you believe her, the refrain of
            &quot;Jenny&quot; -- &quot;Used to have a little, now I have a lot,
            / No matter where I go, I know where I came from&quot; -- underlines
            the fantasy poles that mark her self-definition. She's real.
            Remember it. <o:p>

            Based on a John Hughes story, written by Kevin (<i>Working Girl</i>,

            &quot;ethnic&quot; modification of <i>Pretty Woman</i>-meets-<i>Working

            referencing her fantasy self and her real self. With

            Arnold cozied up to in <i>Collateral Damage</i>), then takes the
            subway to the Upper East Side, where she works as a maid at the
            upscale Beresford Hotel. <o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Stunning
            in her form-fitting uniform, Marisa &quot;strives to be
            invisible&quot; and treats guests with utmost care and attention to
            detail. This sets up the film's basic Cultural Insight: rich,
            &quot;upstairs&quot; people are vain and selfish, and
            &quot;downstairs&quot; people -- including Marisa's maid-buddy
            Stephanie (Marissa Matrone) and butler-father-figure Lionel (Bob
            Hoskins) -- are earthy and compassionate. To illustrate: Marisa
            &quot;creatively&quot; leaves a bundle of lavender on the pillow of
            one notorious diva, but Caroline (Natasha Richardson) only tosses it
            aside, distracted by a phone conversation about her favorite topic,
            her own ridiculous love life. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">This
            moralized split is underlined by a raced one: the hotel clients and
            managers (those with speaking parts, anyway) are white, and the
            maids are mostly Latina, black, and Asian. This makes the
            &quot;us&quot; and &quot;them&quot; dynamic more interesting to
            think about than it is to watch, in that the film assumes viewers'
            identification with the maids. This connection is somewhat mediated
            by the fact that Marisa's best friends are simple stereotypes, for
            instance, the lusty &quot;big black mama,&quot; but their central
            function is to boost Marisa. And she looks fabulous: diligent,
            reliable, smart, and energetic. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">And
            real, of course: though she wants to apply for a management
            position, she also knows that &quot;maids&quot; (however you
            understand that term to resonate here, in terms of race or class)
            are rarely moved up that particular ladder. When Stephanie submits
            an application for her, their boss (Frances Conroy) sniffily agrees
            that she just might make the grade, because &quot;Anything is
            possible.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Whatever
            Marisa's ambitions, this distinction between classes remains in
            place until she meets the man of her dreams, a classically beautiful
            scion of a wealthy political family and U.S. Senate candidate-to-be,
            Chris Marshall (Ralph Fiennes). The crossing over is helped by the
            fact that he walks in on Marisa while she's trying on Ms. Super
            Snob's Dolce &amp; Gabbana white wool suit, and mistakes her for
            someone &quot;like him.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">That
            said, Chris is also coded as a &quot;rebel&quot; who might consider
            dating out of his class, when you see that he'd rather play with his
            dog than adhere to the schedule set up by his nitty manager, Jerry
            (Stanley Tucci, who has now, officially, played this type too
            often). Chris is the cardboardiest of Prince Charmings, hanging onto
            every word that Marisa utters concerning life in the projects
            (because, she admits vaguely, she grew up around there, and besides,
            he's plainly clueless and happy being so), resiliently unaware that
            Marisa is lying to him for days and, once they share a blissful
            night together, willing to marry her even when he learns of her
            elaborate deception. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">More
            tiresomely, Marisa's service industry friends all aid in her
            deception, dressing her in a gorgeous gown, matching slippers, and a
            Harry Winston necklace for a ball (or, a fundraiser). Stephanie
            sends her on her way, teary with delight: &quot;For one night,
            you're living it for all of us!&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">In
            the world of &quot;Jenny From the Block,&quot; this is a serious,
            vaguely honest reverie. Even if Lopez looks unreal, she really is
            real. No matter the entourage, the super-duper mainstream fiancé,
            or the diva rep, she knows where she came from. &quot;Don't be
            fooled by the rocks that I got,&quot; she sings. &quot;I'm still,
            I'm still Jenny from the block.&quot; She's living it for all of us.
