            <p><font face="Verdana" size="5">Stratospheric Imagination</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Like a lot of sequels, <i>Spy
            Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams</i> lacks the freshness of the
            original. Fortunately, writer-director and jack-of-all-trades (he
            does his own editing and cinematography and even plays some of the
            music) Robert Rodriguez makes up for this deficiency by flexing his
            imagination into several delightfully bizarre directions.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Shot on digital video for only $1
            million more than its predecessor, Rodriguez crams in enough exotic
            creatures, fancy gadgets, humor and action to make the movie's
            contents practically leap out of the frame.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In this installment, Carmen and
            Juni Cortez (Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara) find themselves part of a
            much larger Spy Kids organization. Even though they saved their
            superagent parents Gregorio and Ingrid Cortez (Antonio Banderas and
            Carla Gugino) in the last movie, they are now only deemed fit to be
            Level 2 agents instead of the elite Level 1.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Worse, Gregorio's well-deserved promotion winds up going to
            fellow agent Donnagon Giggles (<i>Beavis and Butt-Head</i> creator
            Mike Judge). Donnagon 's ascent seems especially suspicious because
            his children Gary and Gerti (Matthew O'Leary and Emily Osment) now
            receive all the plum assignments.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Juni and Carmen quickly get the
            chance to prove their mettle when thieves get their hands on the
            U.S. President's top-secret device that can render other electrical
            gismos useless. Carmen's relentless computer hacking leads the two
            of them to a remote uncharted island off the coast of Africa.
            Uncharted and invisible to radar, the area is home to a tormented
            (but not exactly mad) scientist named Romero (the appropriately
            sullen Steve Buscemi). His experiments have populated the island
            with flying pigs, spider monkeys (half arachnid, half primate) and
            feisty skeletons that would make puppet animation guru Ray
            Harryhausen proud.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If Rodriguez had merely settled on
            making just these imaginative beasts, <i>Spy Kids 2</i> would have
            been sufficiently engaging, but the director has a seemingly endless
            gift for surprises. There's an amiable insect-shaped robot named
            Ralph, and he even takes the time to introduce Ingrid Cortez's fussy
            parents (Holland Taylor and Ricardo Montalban). While her dad might
            have lost the use of his legs, his flying wheelchair helps explain
            how his progeny has managed to have such a knack for operating
            gadgets. It also doesn't hurt that Montalban projects enough sly
            charm to compete with Rodriguez's hyperactive visuals and pacing.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To be fair, the director has a
            facility with flesh and blood performers. As in the last movie Vega
            and Sabara frequently carry their scenes, and Rodriguez is able to
            get an energy and zeal out of Banderas that most other American
            directors can't. In a few brief scenes in Rodriguez's movies,
            Banderas gets to show the same wit and flair he consistently
            demonstrated in fellow Spaniard Pedro Almodóvar's flicks.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For the most part, the director's
            fondness for excess pays off handsomely. If one special effect looks
            a little too much like a computer-generated image (Donnagon's
            enormous office), the next one (a carnival ride where guests are
            actually juggled) manages to impress.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Every now and then, though,
            Rodriguez revels in sophomoric humor that seems out of place in a
            kid flick. <i>Spy Kids 2</i> opens in them park where ill-prepared
            passengers frequently lose their meals on the proprietor's umbrella.
            While Bill Paxton plays the role with enough bemused detachment to
            make the gag work, one wonders what Rodriguez could have done if he
            had spent less time thinking of how to fit vomit and camel dung into
            a movie. At least the latter gets points for being rare in cinema.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The digital photography still looks
            a little too grainy for my taste. The first movie was shot on 35
            millimeter, and has a much crisper sheen. To his credit, Rodriguez
            is able to shoot exteriors without getting that bleached out look
            that mars some otherwise fine digitally shot films like <i>Lovely
            and Amazing</i>.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Because of the relative
            inexpensiveness of digital video, Rodriguez is able to dish out a
            smorgasbord of crazed make-believe for a fraction of what it cost to
            make such special effects snoozes as <i>Men in Black 2</i> and <i>Attack
            of the Clones</i>. If Rodriguez has consistently proven one thing,
            it's that all of the production money in world can be pretty boring
            in the wrong hands. By keeping his budgets low and his imagination
            in the stratosphere, Rodriguez has left just enough room for the
            thrills that more profligate filmmakers don't seem to offer.</font></p>
