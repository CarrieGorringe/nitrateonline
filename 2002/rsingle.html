            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Watching <i>The Singles Ward</i> 
            was a little like revisiting a strange planet, or a foreign country 
            -- one where I lived, for three years, during the late Seventies and 
            early Eighties, with a certain amount of bemusement and 
            incomprehension, where people spoke about respecting other's 
            &quot;personal standards,&quot; guys worried about whether girls were just 
            sizing them up for marriage or whether they really, really liked 
            them (while the guys themselves felt like they were in a 
            race-against-time to get married, settle down, and have children), 
            and where any misstep in terms of abstinence or behavior could 
            result not only in catastrophic consequences in the immediate world, 
            but in the Hereafter, as well.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jonathan (Will Swenson) is a BYU 
            graduate who served his time in the L.D.S. mission field and now 
            lives in Provo, Utah, working as a stand-up comedian. He was once 
            married, until he came home one day to find his wife, in a foul 
            mood, smoking and drinking (simultaneously -- a beer in one hand, a 
            lit cigarette in the other). Now a divorcee, he doesn't want to 
            attend the local &quot;singles ward&quot; -- attending the &quot;married ward&quot; 
            means running the risk of finding yourself sitting one pew ahead of 
            a flock of noisy kids to all but completely drown out whatever is 
            being said at the podium. Being on the &quot;singles ward&quot; membership 
            list, though, makes one liable to finding strange people you don't 
            know pounding on your door at all hours of the day and night, 
            enticing you into participating in activities like 
            cheesecake-sampling -- &quot;the reconnaissance tactics of fellowship and 
            reactivation.&quot; Jonathan manages to reproof any and all comers, but 
            he nevertheless is fated to meet up with Cammie (Connie Young), 
            who's pretty and intelligent and spirited and can match him riposte 
            with riposte. (To his credit, Will Swenson -- who is required to 
            spend a good deal of time talking directly to us onscreen -- is 
            pugnacious, agreeably cocky, and has genuine comic verve. He may be 
            something of a find.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thus it is that <i>The Singles Ward</i> 
            reveals itself to be the first L.D.S. dating movie. I don't know if 
            the world is quite ready for this. There are a lot of L.D.S. insider 
            references, some of which turned out to be so obscure I had to ask 
            somebody about them. (And what's with all the business about 
            bungee-jumping -- with cars? I haven't been this mystified over 
            something since I last caught some of &quot;Jackass&quot; on M.T.V., which is 
            blocked, by the way, on most of the Provo Valley cable systems.) The 
            guys in the film use their own home-made brand of euphemisms to 
            substitute in cases where they might otherwise use swearwords: 
            examples: &quot;Oh, flip! She's a cutie&quot; &quot;Oh, my holy fudge!&quot; This is 
            actually refreshing after some of the language I've heard passing 
            for dialogue in some of the movies that have come out this year. One 
            of the characters (played by Robert &quot;Bob-O&quot; Swenson) is the 
            goofy-but-lovable non-member roommate, and there is also a requisite 
            L.D.S. African-American buddy (played by Terance Edwards). Some of 
            the jokes and gags in the movie work, and some of them fall flat -- 
            real flat, in some instances. But there are also some rather good 
            things: the way Jonathan's three closest friends are introduced with 
            a &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;-like group walk; Cammie's reaction when she 
            discovers Jonathan ragging on the Church during his standup comedy 
            routine. Jonathan and Cammie follow a fairly predictable courtship 
            ritual involving sparring, relenting, dating, then being driven 
            apart by something. In this case, it turns out that Cammie has 
            already put in her papers, not long before her first meeting with 
            Jonathan, to go on a mission, and she gets called at a penultimate 
            moment in the story, during which Connie Young gets to deliver what 
            must be a first in motion picture ultimatums: &quot;And, despite what I 
            think, there's something I know: the Lord needs me in Australia.&quot; 
            Jonathan, whose commitment to the Church is already shaky, slips off 
            the track -- he plays pool, imbibes, shoots dice, and starts reading 
            &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; -- and when he goes home with the lithesome female 
            bartender (Michelle Ainge) at the comedy club where he works, she 
            tells him that the &quot;view on the balcony is incredible,&quot; whereupon 
            Jonathan throws open the curtains and...well, it's the same thing 
            that he looks at during an all-night vigil in his car during which 
            he decides whether he's going to stay in the boat or get out of it.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film is at its best when it is 
            light, which turns out to be most of the time. (There are a number 
            of cameo appearances, including a bizarrely&nbsp; humorous one by former 
            NFL player Steve Young, and another by Richard Dutcher which is 
            definitely one of the funniest things I've seen all year.) There is 
            also a certain amount of confusion regarding the ending (stop here 
            if you don't want it spoiled), in which it is uncertain whether one 
            of the lead characters stays or goes. A second pass at the film 
            actually reveals that this question is answered in a line exchanged 
            between Steve and Cammie in one of the very last scenes, but it is 
            very easy to miss. It opens the possibility for the film becoming a 
            first in another way, though: usually it is the woman who is 
            expected to wait patiently for the man to return home.</font></td>
