            Hollywood people lie. And Viktor Taransky (Al Pacino) is one of
            them. At the beginning of <i>Simone</i>, the self-proclaimed auteur
            is trying to keep a rein on his portentous star, Nicola (Winona
            Ryder), a &quot;supermodel with a SAG card&quot; who's peeved that
            her trailer is not as tall as someone else's. He's behind schedule,
            running out of money, and really tired of removing the red
            jellybeans from Nicola's contract-specified munchie bowl. To top off
            Viktor's bad day, he's fired off his own movie, by the Amalgamated
            Film Studio suit who happens to be his ex-wife, Elaine (Catherine
            Keener).<o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Even
            as he is encouraged to persevere by his frighteningly well-adjusted
            daughter, Lainey (Evan Rachel Wood), Viktor is, for the moment,
            despondent, believing that his career is over. And then his life
            changes: while leaving the lot late at night, he's approached by
            twitchy, unhinged-looking computer geek Hank (Elias Koteas). Feeling
            Viktor's pain, Hank offers him the solution to all his problems:
            software. <o:p>

            One,&quot; or &quot;Simone&quot; (or even &quot;s1m0ne,&quot; as the
            film's title is sometimes written), is the consummate performer,
            precisely because she is &quot;not real.&quot; As such, she marks a
            rote opposition between &quot;real&quot; humans and
            &quot;unreal&quot; fantasies (&quot;Who needs humans?&quot; fumes
            Hank, himself dying of a tumor developed by spending all his time
            with his machinery). You can make her look any way you want, say
            anything you want, insert her in any situation, opposite any other
            performer; she never complains, never makes demands, never has
            &quot;artistic differences,&quot; never says a word except the ones
            you script (or, as Viktor does, speak) for her. She is perfect,
            particularly if you're a middle-aging man feeling anxious about your
            lack of clout and in need of unambiguous adoration from a gorgeous
            young thing. <o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">She
            is also Viktor, reflected back to him. And <i>Simone</i> considers
            the ways that such reflections shape those who gaze on them. It's
            about movies and money, deceit and desire, and how hard it is to see
            the differences between what's &quot;real&quot; from what's not.
            Locked up in an empty soundstage, surrounded only by monitors and
            the computer running the Simone program, Viktor rhapsodizes,
            &quot;We have stepped into a new dimension. Our ability to
            manufacture fraud has exceeded our ability to detect it.&quot; While
            such rhetoric seems a reaction to last year's <i>Final Fantasy</i>
            scare (actors will be replaced!), it's also a familiar theme for
            writer-director Andrew Niccol, who wrote and directed the haunting <i>Gattaca</i>
            and wrote the overrated <i>Truman Show</i>. He says <i>Simone</i> is
            about the Dream Factory, telling the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>:
            &quot;We live vicariously through celebrities. People used to say
            that celebrities are America's royalty; now I think celebrities are
            the world's royalty.&quot; Like I say: newsflash.</span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">To
            elaborate on what seems obvious, <i>Simone</i> works a series of
            sardonic metaphors. On receiving Hank's package, Viktor emerges from
            his beach house a significant nine months later, with his new protégé
            in tow. Or rather, in <i>Sunrise Sunset</i>, replacing Nicola. Tall,
            willowy, and blond (composed of bits/bytes from Viktor's own
            favorite icons, including Audrey Hepburn and Grace Kelly), Simone
            (Rachel Roberts, digitally reworked) is an instant star. (AOL is
            encouraging you to vote a collective &quot;Simone,&quot; using
            facial parts from today's stars, including Catherine Zeta-Jones,
            Penelope Cruz, Cameron Diaz, et. al. -- this would be the current
            state of &quot;interactive media.&quot;)<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Though
            her performance, as far you see it, is stilted at best, Simone
            receives &quot;rave&quot; reviews. Initially cynical at the grand
            success of his deception (&quot;A star is digitized,&quot; he
            muses), Viktor soon accepts the love: as &quot;the man who
            discovered Simone,&quot; he's deemed a genius and a star by
            association. No longer an art-house nobody, Viktor signs a three
            picture deal with Amalgamated, and soon taps out his next
            masterpiece, the aptly titled <i>Eternity Forever</i> (in which
            Simone utters the immortal line, &quot;Love is like a wildflower,
            but that flower only grows on the edge of a very high cliff&quot;).</span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>

            all eyes on Simone, the celebrity-making system kicks into high
            gear: Simone does an interview by remote (she's &quot;on
            location&quot;), pitches a perfume, appears on magazine covers (<i>In
            Style</i>, <i>Time</i>, <i>Us</i>), wins an Oscar, and becomes a pop
            star, complete with an album, <i>Splendid Isolation</i>, and a live
            show before a stadium throng who doesn't (want to) perceive that
            she's a holographic image, with Mary J. Blige providing vocals for
            &quot;(You Make Me Feel Like A) Natural Woman.&quot; The crowd, as
            they say, goes wild. At show's end, Simone gushes, &quot;Never stop
            believing!&quot;<o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Presuming
            that you know better, the film skewers characters who do believe.
            Aside from sucker-fans, <i>Simone</i> mocks box-office-obsessed
            execs; self-serving &quot;talent&quot; (Simone's costar, Hal [Jay
            Mohr], rides along in her wake, pretending he's met her to up his
            cool factor); and stupid-cow reporters. These last, of course, are
            represented by the requisite tabloid hacks, Milton (Jason
            Schwartzman) and the unsubtly named Max Sayer (Pruitt Taylor Vince),
            who lusts after his subject so completely that he convinces himself
            that Viktor's fake hotel room layout is &quot;real,&quot; fondling
            &quot;her&quot; lingerie, laying on &quot;her&quot; bed, tasting
            &quot;her&quot; toothbrush. <o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">This
            scene, like most everything else in <i>Simone</i>, takes aim at an
            easy target (who doesn't revile the bottom-feeding bloiders?). The
            broad-comedy-as-insider-critique is at once cursory and smug. As the
            only nonbeliever in sight, Viktor provides a particularly
            contemptuous position from which to observe the proceedings; his
            disdain for Simone's zillions of disciples intensifies as they
            increasingly overlook his brilliance, and he resembles more and more
            his namesake, Victor Frankenstein, overwhelmed by his own creation. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>

            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">No
            surprise, Viktor and Simone provide the film's most detailed,
            compelling relationship. Or perhaps more accurately, Viktor and
            Viktor. He sees his most attractive, resourceful, and prolific self
            in Simone: &quot;I'm so relaxed around you, I'm so myself,&quot; he
            coos to her image. Her responses are his to himself, spoken into a
            mic and returned in the voice he's conjured for her. Her gestures
            mirror his, her expressions are his transformed. One of the film's
            more hysterical scenes (in all senses of the word) occurs as Viktor
            dons lipstick in order to put Simone's &quot;kisses&quot; on
            autographed photos, at the same time that he's engineering her
            concert performance from a sound booth. All his manic activity leads
            to chaos. On one hand, he appears oddly transgendered, emulating and
            simultaneously producing Simone's &quot;feminine&quot; appearance.
            On another hand, when he's discovered with lipstick smeared all over
            his mouth, he looks to be Simone's lover, so consumed with passion
            for her that he's lost control over his own &quot;manly&quot;
            appearance. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">You
            know better: he's been making love to himself. And this is <i>Simone</i>'s
            key insight, the elaborate gendering, de-gendering, and re-gendering
            processes that allow all levels of self-love in La-La Land. Viktor
            doesn't quite understand this aspect of his fantasy, believing that
            he's in charge. At wit's end over Simone's mammoth popularity (and
            his declining importance), he tries to fess up to Elaine, declaring,
            &quot;I made Simone.&quot; Elaine, at once jealous of his rumored
            romance with his star and capable of a more realistic view, corrects
            him: &quot;Viktor, Simone made <i>you</i>.&quot; <o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Like
            everyone else, Viktor believes what he needs to believe. His
            eventual, inevitable realization, that he resents his reflected
            glory and wants to &quot;be&quot; his own man, leads to efforts to
            destroy Simone. First he tries to ruin her reputation (having her
            appear to be a sluttish, brainless, big-mouthed drunk, as if this
            would turn anyone off a celebrity), and then he infects her with a
            virus, using a big old 5-1/4 inch disk (conveniently labeled
            &quot;Plague&quot;) that causes her pixels to fall away in a corny
            cascade. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">But
            Viktor can no more kill Simone than he can kill himself. It doesn't
            matter what's &quot;real&quot; or &quot;fake,&quot; or even what
            movie made the most money last weekend. It only matters what you
            believe. And if, in a culture suffused with tie-in marketing,
            flag-waving, and party politicking, you can believe you have
            dominion over what you believe, so be it. <o:p>
