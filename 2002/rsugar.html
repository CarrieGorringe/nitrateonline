            <font face="Verdana" size="5">Ya don't stop</font></p>
            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The first single off the <i>
            Brown Sugar</i> soundtrack is Erykah Badu's &quot;Love of My Life (Ode to 
            Hiphop).&quot; A lush, sweet declaration, with supple lyrics and 
            lingering beats, it narrates a romance with hiphop: &quot;I met him when 
            I was a / Little girl, he gave me / He gave me poetry / And he was 
            my first.&quot; For the video, Badu and her man Common trade lyrics, 
            while she walks through the &quot;history&quot; of hiphop, with costume 
            changes and nods to several phases (including Chuck D's cameo as a 
            militant rapper, with blueprints, and MC Lyte's freestyle, to which 
            Badu adds a few crisp lines). Like most every Badu project, the 
            video is upbeat and smart, breezy-cool and sea-deep. </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The opening scenes of Rick 
            Famuyiwa's film, <i>Brown Sugar</i>, offer an ode of their own. A 
            series of hiphop artists -- including Common, Kool G Rap, Pete Rock, 
            Talib Kweli, Big Daddy Kane, ?uestlove, Black Thought, Method Man, 
            and Russell Simmons -- describe how they &quot;fell in love with hiphop.&quot; 
            They make for a dazzling array of invention and inspiration, and 
            while they're supposedly answering a question put to them by the 
            film's protagonist and narrator, hiphop journalist Sidney Shaw (Sanaa 
            Lathan), their answers don't appear to be scripted. Rather, they 
            offer genuine assessments of their relations to the culture that 
            sustains their passions and shapes their worldviews, no matter the 
            occasional frustrations. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">From here, Sidney goes on to detail 
            her early experience with hiphop, recalling the moment on July 18, 
            1984 when heard her first MCs (Doug E. Fresh and Slick Rick, of all 
            people). In this backstory-flashback (where she's played by Aaliyah 
            Hill), Sidney also has her first encounter with her lifelong friend, 
            Andre (Marc John Jeffries, who will grow up to be Taye Diggs). They 
            exchange adorable glances and nod their heads to the beat: true 
            love, no doubt. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film fast forwards to the 
            moment when Sidney is leaving her job as hiphop writer for the <i>
            Los Angeles Times</i>, headed to NYC, where she'll be editing at <i>
            XXL</i>. It's also where she'll be reunited with Dre, now a mad 
            successful producer at Millennium Records, whose head-suit Simon 
            (Wendell Price) describes their mission like so: &quot;We make hits. You 
            want to keep it real, you go to Rawkus. Here, you keep it 
            profitable.&quot; Until Sidney comes back on the scene, Dre's ostensibly 
            happy with this set-up: he's rich, respected in the business, and 
            affianced to lovely upper-crusty lawyer Reese (Nicole Ari Parker, 
            here standing in for Tyra Banks in <i>Love &amp; Basketball</i>, in 
            which Sanaa Lathan almost didn't get her man Omar Epps). Sidney 
            reminds him that real hiphop is not about profits. He begins to 
            rethink his priorities. Sort of. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As it is a romantic comedy designed 
            to &quot;cross over,&quot; <i>Brown Sugar,</i> has a series of boxes to check 
            off: beautiful lovers meant to be together, obstacles to their being 
            together, supportively comic sidekicks. That said, it isn't so 
            annoying in its box-checking as <i>Sweet Home Alabama</i>, which 
            reduces its talented cast to a series of down home Southern jokes.
            <i>Brown Sugar</i>'s got jokes, to be sure, but they're a little 
            less tired, if only because hiphop is a little less well-worn, 
            movie-wise, than that down home bidness. As overriding metaphor, 
            history, and setting, hiphop helps the film maintain a certain 
            perspective and connectedness too: the characters have careers, 
            experiences, and interests that grant them existences beyond each 
            other. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That said, the hiphop metaphor 
            comes on very strong, particularly in Sidney's voiceover (probably 
            not so necessary), as she frequently reminds you that hiphop is her 
            first love, that it sustains and instructs her, and keeps her 
            honest. And for some reason, her gig with <i>XXL</i> is framed as if 
            it's less of a sell-out than Dre's with Millennium Records: he's 
            producing acts like the Hiphop Dalmatians, a.k.a. Ren and Ten (Erik 
            Weiner and Reggi Wynns), complete with spotted fur jackets, whose 
            first single is a cover of Paul McCartney and MJ's &quot;The Girl is 
            Mine,&quot; restyled as &quot;The Ho is Mine.&quot; If Sidney is self-conscious and 
            vocal about her allegiance to the &quot;real&quot; hiphop, Dre serves as the 
            cautionary tale, an original acolyte who loses his way, distracted 
            by the fine accessories and prestige.&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sidney's return to the East Coast 
            not only brings her back together with Dre (whom she actually 
            watches propose to Reese, through a glass wall at a pool party), but 
            also with her eminently sensible cousin Francine (Queen Latifah). 
            Aside from the fact that the role -- the eminently sensible girl 
            sidekick -- is so distressingly rote, Latifah brings charm to burn 
            (she <i>needs</i> her own movie). Francine notes right off that 
            Sidney's really in love with Dre (helping her unpack, months after 
            she's returned, Francine finds a contraption that Sidney insists is 
            an electric back massager: the point is made). No slouch, Francine 
            warns her cuz that she's &quot;turning into a Terry McMillan character&quot; 
            (which, in fact, Lathan was, in HBO's <i>Disappearing Acts</i>), 
            pushing her to make her feelings known before her man up and marries 
            that other skinny girl. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sidney, apparently pretending to be 
            a slouch in order to accommodate the requisite plot machinations, 
            insists that she and Dre are only best friends since childhood. (And 
            Francine has an answer for that as well, that if Sidney hooks up 
            with him, she gets the &quot;buddy and the booty.&quot;) This despite the fact 
            that Sidney visibly cringes whenever she sees Dre snuggle up to 
            frosty Reese. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">More complications arise when, 
            after the wedding (during which ceremony Francine makes much raucous 
            coughy noise at the &quot;or forever hold your peace&quot; part), Sidney takes 
            up with flashy New Jersey Nets star Kelby (Boris Kodjoe), whom she 
            meets during an <i>XXL</i> interview (in fact, that job is looking 
            better and better: she never has to work -- you see her lay out the 
            cover once, I think -- and her most excellent reputation precedes 
            her no matter where she goes). Kelby persuades her to marry him, or 
            at least set a date and start planning, and since Dre is already 
            busy, well, she figures why not? </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What she doesn't know, for a 
            minute, and you do, is that Dre has finally had it with the 
            Dalmatians, and he quits his high-power job to start his own label, 
            &quot;Brown Sugar.&quot; His first contract is with cab driver/MC 
            extraordinaire Chris (Mos Def), who makes Dre pay for his trust by 
            cleaning out his cab. While this may appear to be a way of bringing 
            Dre back to his roots, maybe even smudging his designer sweater, it 
            also looks like one of those weird bonding rituals that men 
            perpetrate in movies and nowhere else. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That said, Chris serves a couple of 
            hiphop-related purposes worth noting. Primarily, he re-authenticates 
            Dre, makes him worthy of Sidney's real love, but he also 
            authenticates the movie. Along with the film's opening interviews 
            with artists, Mos Def brings realness (plus honest acting talent 
            too, not to mention wry and well-timed comedy). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mos Def, Lathan, Diggs, and Latifah, 
            might all be doing something other than a mainstream romantic 
            comedy, slightly tweaked with hiphop inflections, and so might 
            Erykah Badu and Common be doing something other than contributing to 
            a movie soundtrack CD. But in doing it, they can invite non-heads to 
            understand what Badu terms the &quot;simple true love&quot; of hiphop art, 
            politics, and culture, but from the same distance that marks most 
            consumption of mainstream product: possession without investment. In 
            doing it, they can also (further) blur lines between mainstream and 
            margin, mix up the spirits, just as hiphop -- so-called real hiphop 
            but also, in its way, brashly commercial hiphop -- has always done. 
            The Dalmatians may be a price to pay along the way, as might the 
            break into romantic comedy. But what's most important emerges in 
            Badu's pointed hook: &quot;Hope this sh*t ain't clear,&quot; she repeats. It's 
            on you to work toward understanding. </font></td>
