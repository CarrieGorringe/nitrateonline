            <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 19 April 2002</font></i><p>
            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Whatever else there is about <i>The 
            Other Side of Heaven</i>, it has what will probably become one of my 
            most favorite opening scenes for any film this year. The camera 
            follows close behind some college-aged guys and gals as they rush up 
            the steps of a building, rush through a set of doors, and then 
            plunge into the midst of a jitterbug dance that's in full swing with 
            a live band accompaniment. Only then does a title appear on the 
            screen: &quot;Brigham Young University, 1953.” BYU might've been a little 
            staid when I was there, but, from the looks of this film, at this 
            time at least, it really knew how to jive.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">One of the band members, playing 
            trumpet, spots a girl dancing near the bandstand, and jumps down and 
            decides he's going to dance with her. He deftly cuts in between her 
            and the guy she's already dancing with. The other guy, then, cuts in 
            on him. The cutting contest continues apace, with both of the guys 
            (and the girl they're dancing with) really knowing how to move on 
            the dance floor. It gets the movie off to an exhilarating start, 
            which carries through into the next scene, when the trumpet player, 
            John (Christopher Gorham), strolls with the girl, Jean (Anne 
            Hathaway, recently of &quot;The Princess Diaries&quot;), concluding with their 
            kissing beside a reflected moon -- the energy of the previous scene 
            seems to chase away any corniness that might've arisen out of this. 
            It's too good to last, though. John gets a letter, at his home up 
            the road in Idaho Falls, informing him of his LDS mission 
            assignment, to Tonga, and the movie almost immediately thereafter 
            falls apart into what will become an exasperating mess.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">John is shipped out, back and forth 
            across the Pacific, for eighty-three days, before arriving at the 
            island where he is to serve. Without any explanation, he arrives 
            with no knowledge of the native language or customs. The only way 
            he's going to talk to the people about the Gospel is to learn along 
            the way. (The film does not indicate if the Mission Training Center, 
            through which all young men must pass before going out into the 
            mission field, was in existence at this time or not.) There is a 
            pre-existing LDS ward on the island, but it is only hazily defined 
            regarding its membership or size. A rival minister is on the island, 
            as well, but, except for a couple of scenes, he's out of sight for 
            most of the film.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Tongans are depicted as being 
            simple, remote and rather unknowable, and they're virtually 
            undifferentiated. What do they think about this white guy coming to 
            them and telling them that they must convert to this particular 
            religion? (John's native-born mission companion says at one point 
            that, if John came all this way to talk to them about it, than what 
            he says must be true.) How does it relate to their existing way of 
            life? By comparison, Richard Dutcher, in his 1999 film, <i>God's 
            Army</i>, at least gave us some idea of the pattern and structure 
            that made up the lives of the missionary characters he depicted, and 
            which in turn gave us some understanding as to what their work meant 
            to them and how it affected their lives. In this picture, we aren't 
            even sure how long John's supposed to be out on Tonga. Two years? 
            Four?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Even when he's starving to death 
            after a typhoon, letters fly back and forth between John and Jean -- 
            who, for some reason, never saw him off when he left the States (if 
            a girl isn't going to see her guy for several years straight, she's 
            going to see him off) -- and she appears, occasionally, walking 
            along the shoreline in a flowing white dress and throwing chastely 
            flirtatious looks at the camera. In the meantime, a native Tongan 
            girl (Miriama Smith) approaches John and, as an act of veneration, 
            offers herself to him, and John is shown going buddity-buddity and 
            doing everything except saying the most obvious thing -- that he 
            can't have sex while serving a mission. &quot;Take a day off!&quot; the girl's 
            mother exclaims, but John isn't shown coming up with a quick answer 
            to that, either.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Although based on a real-life 
            person, John, in the movie, is a rather dull person to be stuck with 
            for two hours, and at the end, Gorham, who has been coasting by on 
            the strength of his ingenuous face and strong eyebrows and 
            cheekbones, doesn't look any different when he leaves the island 
            than he did when he arrived. The miasmic ending, which is supposed 
            to show John and Jean finally entering into matrimony after waiting 
            for a good deal of time, is capped by a title card which informs us 
            that the real John and Jean got married in 1957 (which would make 
            John's mission a four-year one), after which they went right back 
            out and performed more mission work among the peoples of the 
            Pacific. John is shown as coming from a large family whose offspring 
            included a total of five brothers alone, plus some sisters. Didn't 
            John and Jean, two strapping, healthy young people, want to start a 
            family of their own? Have some kids to whom John could pass on his 
            experiences among the Tongans, something not a whole lot of people 
            in Idaho Falls would have a chance to do? What exactly did John get 
            out of his experiences with the Tongans? <i>The Other Side of Heaven</i> 
            ends with a scene where John is put up for the night in a modern 
            hotel room, while on his way back to the States, and, unable to use 
            the bed, rolls out his sleeping mat on the floor and goes to sleep 
            there. It's a scene which another motion picture would have used as 
            just the starting point for telling a more richer, insightful story. 
            Here, the quality that charmed John and Jean into going back to the 
            south Pacific never communicates through to the audience.</font></td>
