            <font face="Verdana" size="5">Fascist Santa </font></p>
            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The most original idea in 1994's
            <i>The Santa Clause</i> was its premise: killing off Santa. This 
            bizarre gambit left unhappily single (and perfectly initialed) dad 
            Scott Calvin (Tim Allen) with the burden/gift of replacing Jolly St. 
            Nick, which allowed him to impress his child and feel &quot;needed&quot; 
            following the breakup of his marriage. As he learned that being 
            Santa is a hugely daunting task during a certain season, no matter 
            that the abundant vacation time, Scott's alternate moments of 
            awkwardness and derring-do made for some sweet comedy that has made 
            the film something of a holiday rental favorite. </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now comes Michael Lembeck's 
            8-years-in-the-making sequel, <i>The Santa Clause 2</i>, where the 
            best idea is not its premise -- that Santa must be married by 
            Christmas Eve of a certain year, this one, or the automatic &quot;de-santification 
            process&quot; will rob him of his powers and children everywhere of their 
            favorite holiday forever. Instead, the best idea this time out is 
            the offshoot of that plot-starter, which is the creation of a 
            second, emphatically plastic Santa (also played by Allen, under much 
            ruddy-cheeked goop), concocted by Scott's book-smartest elf, Curtis 
            (Spencer Breslin), so that Scott can head off to the burbs to find a 
            mate before deadline, leaving behind the imitation, so the other 
            elves won't feel nervous. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Before he heads south, Scott calls 
            together the Council of Legendary Figures, who mostly offer cute 
            remarks and complaints about their own gigs. Solo girl Mother Nature 
            (Aisha Tyler) is easily the toughest and most charismatic of her 
            group, warning the boys off teasing her, because she's &quot;pre-El Niño&quot; 
            (though she generally seems quite pleased with &quot;the power vested in 
            me, by me&quot;). She is, however, surrounded by whiners and slowpokes -- 
            Father Time (Peter Boyle); the Tooth Fairy (Art LaFleur), who wants 
            more than anything to change his name; Cupid (Kevin Pollak); and 
            barely cognizant, always snoozing Sandman (Michael Dorn, better 
            known as Worf, <i>Star Trek</i>'s Last Angry Black Man) -- who make 
            Scott look positively energetic for coming up with that harebrained 
            sham Santa plan. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still, everyone else seems all 
            right with it, at least at first. The elves, for a few hundred, are 
            easily placated: though Fake Santa is frighteningly shiny and stiff, 
            the elves all say okay and go back to tap-tapping on their doll 
            houses and choo-choos. Santa 2, on the other hand, catches on fast. 
            Initially timid, being virtually non-minded and newly manufactured 
            and all, Santa 2 soon reads the handbook and resolves that none of 
            the multi-culti elves are following the rules and all of the kids 
            expecting gifts have been more naughty than nice. And so, he 
            proclaims, everyone will get coal in their stockings. To enforce his 
            decision, Fascist Santa -- complete with military uniform and 
            epaulets -- makes use of the very toy-making machine that made him, 
            and creates an army of clunky, smiley-faced, 8-foot wooden soldiers.
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Back in burbsville (and this is the 
            film's most fatal flaw, its cutting between the North Pole and the 
            Old Neighborhood -- as Scott's trajectory is far less amusing and 
            far more perfunctory than Fascist Santa's), Scott is losing his 
            Santa-ness, which means that instead of growing a belly and 
            whiskers, as he did the first time around, he's losing same. He 
            drops in on troubled son Charlie (Eric Lloyd), who's been tagging 
            school walls with pro-Christmas graffiti (and so has ended up on the 
            Naughty List, much to dad's chagrin and embarrassment), and his 
            humdrum mom Laura (Wendy Crewson) and Bill Cosby-sweatered stepdad 
            Neil (Judge Reinhold). They try to be helpful, setting up Calvin 
            with a woman who &quot;likes Christmas&quot; (Molly Shannon in a Santa sweater 
            and full of ghastly, strained vivacity, the kind she's already 
            overdone on <i>SNL</i>). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Less noisy but no less pathetic, 
            Laura and Neil make what seems to be a sincere effort to discuss 
            Charlie's &quot;issues&quot; by trundling home with bags full of McDonalds 
            provisions: sitting in their domestic paradise of a kitchen, 
            stuffing fries in their mouths, the clueless twosome offer their 
            opinions. At this point, you're probably wondering why Scott gives a 
            darn about any of 'em. They <i>deserve</i> coal in their stockings.
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still, he persists in looking for 
            the ideal Mrs. Claus to fulfill the second clause. And so he finds 
            her (as you know he must, this being a seasonal franchise picture), 
            in that most unlikely-likely place, right in front of his nose. 
            Charlie's very own principal, Carol Newman (Elizabeth Mitchell), 
            turns out to be the imminent rosy-faced mama figure, despite and 
            because of her preliminary uptightness and grousing about Charlie's 
            tagging activities. Of course, she's a forlorn little girl inside, 
            lonely and afraid, having lost sight of the true meaning of 
            Christmas and feeling all sexually repressed -- until Scott whips 
            out some snow and mistletoe. Then, she's a wildcat. (Just kidding.)
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Given that it's a generically 
            family/holiday film, <i>The Santa Clause 2</i> has nothing new to 
            say about anything, and looks back extra-fondly on the days when 
            women's most admirable ambitions involved giving up their 
            personalities and lives for the men they loved, especially men who 
            wield weird and wonderful magic and control a labor force of, maybe, 
            looks like, hundreds (the film's $65 million cost is hard to spot on 
            the screen, where everything -- from the animatronic reindeers to 
            the pointy-eared elves to the North Pole set -- looks cut-rate). You 
            might hope for a split second that Carol comes to her senses and 
            runs off with the dashing Mother Nature, but no such luck. Though 
            she does ask whether she'll still be able to be a principal if she 
            marries Scott (oh yes, the elves all nod and beam, we have a school, 
            though they don't), everyone knows Carol is doomed to be a 
            grey-haired, ever-aproned version of Wendy with the Lost Boys, 
            teaching the elves to stay just the same as they are. The 
            non-Fascist Santa likes it that way. </font></td>
