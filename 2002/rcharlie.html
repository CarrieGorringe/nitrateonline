            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Did Jonathan Demme burn out a 
            bearing while making the calamitous <i>Beloved</i>? His new film, <i>
            The Truth About Charlie</i>, a remake of <i>Charade</i> and his 
            first feature in four years, is a woozy, roisterous, exhausting 
            mess, and the off-beat casting of its two leads turns out to be as 
            ill-starred as you might expect.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As a woman who comes to Paris to 
            discover that her dead husband is not who he was cracked-up to be 
            and doesn't know who to turn to for help, Thandie Newton is lovely 
            and unexpectedly, and indirectly, evokes the lilting sound of Audrey 
            Hepburn in her voice (Hepburn played the same role in the 1963 
            film), but she only seems to be vaguely engaging the camera most of 
            the time, and her performance seems a tad too weak to fully engage 
            us (and, in the end, she's reduced to being merely tremulous and, 
            worse, agape). She's miles ahead of Mark Wahlberg, though: you can 
            see why he was cast, for the way he can shuttle between boyish charm 
            and menace in a flash, but, while it turns out that he can wear a 
            beret without looking foolish, the guy still can't act -- you find 
            yourself yearning for Matthew Modine in <i>Married to the Mob</i> to 
            come in and show him how this sort of thing is really done. Wahlberg 
            stands in the middle of his scenes and holds his ground with the 
            paused intensity of someone waiting for a really long traffic light 
            to change.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The story in the original film, 
            with its constantly shifting alliances, quadruple-crosses, and 
            unexpected plot turns, made more sense than what's going on, here: 
            things are further complicated by bobbing camerawork, switches 
            between 35 mm. and HDV that keep us off-balance (the cinematography 
            was by the superb Tak Fujimoto, a longtime Demme collaborator, so 
            the colors are terrific), and loads of movie references. Part of the 
            action takes place in a hotel named the Langlois; one scene is set 
            on a Ferris wheel in the Tuilleries, and specifically evokes <i>The 
            Third Man</i>; Hannibal Lecter's glass cell even turns up in a 
            closing scene. One character makes a reference to <i>Shoot the Piano 
            Player</i>, which is then followed by a clip from the Truffaut film 
            with Charles Aznavour, which is then followed by Aznavour himself, 
            singing to the characters and to the audience. There's also a 
            musical cameo, in a tango bar, by the great French <b><i>nouvelle 
            vague</i></b> muse Anna Karina. (Aznavour's voice is a bit on the 
            rough side; Karina, on the other hand, is terrific, before, now, and 
            always. The film, despite all else, has one of the best musical 
            soundtracks this year, loaded with French pop, rap, and Afro-pop, 
            along with two cuts from Malcolm McLaren's <i>Paris </i>album.) But 
            trying to keep up with everything is a bit of a stretch: the film 
            feels like it's taking place inside of a Mixmaster, with any scenes 
            which would have drawn us into the story and characters getting 
            thinned-out.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Tim Robbins turns up as a U.S. 
            government official, representing a department with a phony-sounding 
            name, and who gets Newton's character to trust him -- he bugs his 
            eyes during his very first scene and signals to us that he's a loony 
            from the start. (Robbins is best when he's not playing a villain.) 
            There are two breathtaking appearances by Magali Noël, though (it 
            would have been nice if she'd had some dialogue, too), and the best 
            scene in the movie is one at the very, very end between Robbins and 
            Frederique Meininger, who plays the distraught mother of the title 
            character -- it has the kind of humor which first drew us to 
            Jonathan Demme's films, and which he hopefully will find again.</font></td>
