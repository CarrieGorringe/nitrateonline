            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;All right, who wants to drown?&quot; 
            asks the young Vivi (Ashley Judd) of a group of kids playing in the 
            placid waters of a lake. There's no emergency, but her daughter, 
            Sidi, gladly obliged and sinks below the surface, waiting for her 
            mother to come to the rescue, which she does, swimming back to shore 
            while telling Sidi, with some amount of steely admonition, &quot;Make it 
            look good.&quot; The question of why a child such as Sidi would so 
            readily submit to such a request, and why her mother would make it, 
            is made somewhat clear once we see, from Sidi's point-of-view, the 
            figure of her mother, like a beautiful dolphin, sweep over her 
            before scooping her up, to the successive approval of friends and 
            family back on the shore.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film, <i>Divine Secrets of the 
            Ya-Ya Sisterhood</i>,&nbsp; has a very interesting idea at its center, 
            that of how women who, sharing a close bond with their mothers, are 
            afraid that they'll end up acting as crazy and neurotic as they do, 
            and how this same matriarchal behavior is passed down through 
            generations. The adult Sidi (Sandra Bullock) is a playwright whose 
            remarks in a <i>Time</i> magazine interview about her childhood are 
            misconstrued by Vivi (Ellen Burstyn), who uses them as an excuse to 
            go into a tizzy, with the intention of throwing Sidi into a tizzy, 
            as well. Sidi, in turn, sees this as another in an endless series of 
            vengeful reprisals against her by her mother, for which she is 
            supposed to feel responsible, and her frustration over that leads 
            her to start emulating the same sort of behavior that she so 
            dislikes seeing in her mother, even to the point of where she 
            wonders whether to call off her wedding to her fiancé (Angus 
            MacFadyen), not wanting to run the risk of, inevitably, treating her 
            children the same maddening way that Vivi has treated her.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As it turns out, Sidi feels a 
            long-term resentment for a period, when she was still a child, where 
            Vivi abandoned her family, only to return, become an alcoholic, and 
            fall into terrifying fits of psychosis. Unable to marry the man whom 
            she really loved, Vivi became wed to Shep, a well-meaning man whom 
            she eventually comes to openly despise and scorn. As the older Shep, 
            James Garner brings a wonderful resonance to this character, who has 
            resigned himself to being more of a faithful companion to his wife 
            rather than a husband: he and Sidi share a common bond of being 
            outsiders who have been locked-out by the same woman whom they 
            nonetheless keep turning to for emotional approval.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Callie Khouri -- who wrote the 
            original screenplay for <i>Thelma and Louise</i>, as well as the 
            1995 Julia Roberts picture <i>Something to Talk About</i> -- 
            directed this film and wrote the screenplay, which is based on an 
            adaptation by Mark Andrus made of a popular novel by Rebecca Wells 
            and its sequel, <i>Little Altars Everywhere</i>, and the picture (at 
            least from this seat in the house) credibly takes care not to depict 
            the characters as being totally one-sided, nor to indulge in the 
            kind of pseudo-Southern kitsch female mannerisms that the story's 
            setting, Louisiana, sometimes evokes from filmmakers. The 
            characters' histories, and reasons for their behavior, are parceled 
            out, like bread crumbs, well over the course of the narrative, and 
            the effect, along with the device of not having the adult Sidi and 
            her mother meet onscreen until the picture is almost over, softens 
            things a bit in a way that not only fails to evoke meaning at 
            important points of the story but also fails to connect up all the 
            dots in the narrative itself. (Sidi has three other siblings, seen 
            in flashback, that are otherwise never seen or heard from during the 
            rest of the picture.) One brief scene depicting Vivi's own parents 
            (played by David Rasche and the superb Cherry Jones) tells us all we 
            need to know about how the dynamics of their marriage had turned 
            terribly against Vivi's mother and caused her to act spitefully in 
            turn towards her daughter. On the other hand, we don't get a really 
            good idea of what prompts Vivi to return to her family after she 
            leaves them, or why she would turn her anger against her own 
            children. The effect has a tendency to point up the more sunnier 
            aspects of Vivi and Sidi's past history, including an instance where 
            mother and daughter take a ride on a fairground biplane: Sidi wants 
            to go up in it, but she is also afraid and she doesn't tell her 
            mother until late in the day. &quot;Nobody ever got anywhere by bein' 
            frightened!&quot; Vivi says, whereupon she craftily contrives a way so 
            that Sidi gets her ride in the biplane, even when it's long past 
            quitting time. While Vivi's show of fortitude in this particular 
            instance is admirable, you still feel like saying, no, sometimes you 
            can't always go up in the biplane, and life is what you do when you 
            have to reconcile yourself to those situations.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Part of the glue that holds things 
            together for the characters in the movie is the Ya-Ya Sisterhood, a 
            secret sorority which Vivi and her three closest friends established 
            when they were young girls, calling upon the power of the great 
            warrior women and queens that came before them. The girls meet and 
            wear funny-looking headdresses and hats, and when they continue to 
            meet years later, they still wear the same funny headdresses and 
            hats. Khouri got three formidable actresses with proven track 
            records -- Shirley Knight, Fionnula Flanagan, and Maggie Smith -- to 
            play the three aging, but still rambunctious, friends, and while 
            they treat the goings-on with a bit of a wink and a nudge, it's 
            really supposed to mean something. The woman drop whatever they're 
            doing in life&nbsp; and rush to stage an intervention between Vivi and 
            Sidi, spiriting Sidi off to a sort of &quot;safe lodge&quot; by a lake, where 
            they play cards, tell stories, and commiserate as needs be. It's as 
            improbable as all get-out, but there's an appealing camaraderie that 
            springs up in the scenes, along with a few hearty laughs. It would 
            be nice if we all had such time to spare.</font></td>
