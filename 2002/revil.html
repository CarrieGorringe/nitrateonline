            is a masterpiece of modern cinema. You'll laugh. You'll cry. You'll
            scream at every awful, creeping, crawling terror and -- who are we
            kidding? Let's not delay the inevitable, folks. This movie is duller
            than dirt.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There is a story, but there's so
            little of it that the filmmakers don't seem to mind whether you
            notice it's there or not. A group of paramilitary soldiers are
            assigned to break into an underground complex, composed of both
            corporate offices and a biotechnology lab, located beneath
            &quot;Raccoon City.&quot; They're not told why they have to go in,
            or what they're going in for, and nobody ever seems to question why
            the place has such radically serious security devices, such as laser
            rays that can cut through the human body like butter, which they
            have to either break or get past. Tagging along, forcibly, is Milla
            Jovovich, whom the soldiers were told to take with them just
            because: she's an amnesiac, but she has flippety-flop,
            lightning-fast flashbacks which may have something to do with what's
            been going on inside the locked-down lab facility. As it turns out,
            the place has been manufacturing viruses, one of which can bring the
            dead back to life, with a vengeance. That virus, rather than the one
            that offers a cure for the common cold, is the one that's broken
            loose, and so the characters have to fight their way back out the
            facility after fighting their way in.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The movie is based on a video game,
            and it's still a video game, made up of scenes of people either
            stalking around or being chased. The director, Paul W.S. Anderson
            (who replaced George Romero -- !!! -- during the production),
            earlier made the dung-colored <i>Mortal Kombat</i> -- also based on
            a video game -- and he portions out the story in such little dollops
            that he keeps the characters (and the audience) in the dark about
            what's happening most of the time, and the results are insufferable.
            When something does finally happen, the camera flails around while
            people and things flail around in front of it. This may be all right
            for those who just want to just watch something that slaps things on
            the screen for an immediate jolt, regardless of whether it has any
            meaning or not. But even the <i>pieces de résistance</i> that one
            would presume to find in the movie's second hour -- this is about
            hoards of fast-moving zombies that are looking for anyone to take a
            bite out of -- never materialize. (The movie doesn't even make good
            on its promised hard-rock soundtrack of songs from musicians ranging
            from Marilyn Manson to the hellacious Slipknot.)<b><i><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Standing in the middle of it all is
            Milla Jovovich, who spends vast amounts of time staring vapidly into
            space: she looks like she's waiting for someone to tap her on the
            shoulder and tell her what to do. Slightly to one side is Michelle
            Rodriguez, a talented actress who isn't given very much more to do
            than Jovovich, but she's in there working anyway, trying to create
            some sort of character who's tough and spirited. (She's the only one
            in the movie whom you find yourself caring about what happens to her
            by the end of the story.) The rest of the cast are stuck with
            characters that are so undefined that they end up turning into the
            &quot;faceless,&quot; stalwart casts that could be seen in the more
            squarish science-fiction movies in the 'Fifties.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jovovich ends up on an examination
            table with a whole bunch of white tubes stuck into her body,
            including two that are stuck right into the side of her head. (Which
            she then pulls out. OUCH.) Is she in the room next to Elizabeth
            Taylor's at the make-over clinic in <i>Ash Wednesday</i>? The
            filmmakers are going to have to resort to intravenous methods if
            they're going to keep audiences in their seats during this movie.</font>
