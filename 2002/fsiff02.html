      <font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Last year, it was Tarantino, Takeshi, and 
      Twyker. This year, it’s Miike, Medved, and Medem at the Seattle 
      International Film Festival, which exploded in late May with a 
      five-theatre menu of films running seven days a week, and continued until 
      the event’s final spool of celluloid exited the projectors on June 16<sup>th</sup>. 
      This year’s <i>SIFF</i> shares many characteristics that have branded past 
      versions of America’s largest film-going experience. Even so, 2002 also 
      boasted a distinctively unique flavor.</b> </font>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Just as director Quentin Tarantino chewed 
      the fat with Seattle International Film Festival fans and gave 
      hyperventilating praise for overlooked genre director William Whitney in 
      2001, conservative critic Michael Medved shared the stage with other 
      cinema authorities this year for a similarly enlightening gabfest. The 
      timely topic pondered by Seattle’s local icon was &quot;Why America Cannot See 
      (or Doesn’t Want to See) Movies for Grownups.&quot; </font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">German director Tom Twyker dazzled past 
      Seattle International Film Festival audiences with his breakthrough films
      <i>Run Lola Run</i> and <i>Princess and the Warrior</i>, and was dubbed an 
      Emerging Master<i>.</i> This year, Julio Medem was one of four new 
      directors chosen for the category, and his latest film<i>, Sex and Lucia</i>, 
      represented the latest in an ongoing tidal wave of popular Spanish titles 
      that began with <i>Amorres Perros</i> and <i>Y Tu Mama Tambien.</i> </font>
      </p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While last year’s bullet-riddled <i>
      Brother</i> introduced legions of crime film aficionados to the dry, 
      laconic style of Japanese legend Takeshi Kitano (also known as &quot;Beat&quot; 
      Takeshi when taking on &quot;actor&quot; mode), fellow Asian cult celebrity Takashi 
      Miike unveiled two new, characteristically genre-bending epics, <i>
      Agitator </i>and <i>Happiness of the Katakuris</i>. Miike was also 
      selected this year for Emerging Master status.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Lurking about in the shadows of <i>SIFF</i>, 
      director John Waters brought his pencil moustache and a vintage copy of <i>
      Female Trouble</i> to Egyptian Theatre audiences salivating to be in the 
      presence of Baltimore’s own Baron of Bad Taste.</font></p>
      <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For a sampling of this year’s typically 
      diverse platter of over 170 features from 40 nations around the world, 
      gorge yourself on the <i>SIFF</i> hors d’oeuvres listed below. Choose from 
      escargot (<i>Uzumaki</i>, the Japanese chiller that’s heavy on spiral, 
      snail-shell imagery), birthday cake (featured in the opening scenes of <i>
      Agitator</i>, before a perverse karaoke party that you’d never want to 
      attend), and lots of wine (chugged down by Trudi Styler’s sloshed matron 
      in <i>Me Without You</i>). <i>Bon </i>A<i>ppetit</i>!</font></p>
