            first scene in Walter Hill's <i>Undisputed</i> is a fight. It takes
            place at a high-security, Oz-like panopticon prison called
            Sweetwater out in the middle of the Mojave Desert. Two inmates go at
            it inside a huge cage, surrounded by other men who roar and thump
            their approval against the bars. The camera circles, rises, peers
            through the bars, seemingly unable to keep still. It's all a
            fitting, if overwrought, metaphor, as the film concerns prisoners
            who fight to maintain their sense of individual honor, or at least
            to gain respect from the bar thumpers. Masculinity, integrity,
            brutality: Hill's usual themes. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Then
            comes a little tweak in the predictability, in the
            &quot;entertainment&quot; staged between bouts (the prison
            administration apparently permits such proceedings to go on for some
            time). Hey, it's Master P. He raps a little, gets the cons chanting
            &quot;rock n' roll,&quot; the camera gaga and restless all around
            him. Then, before you can say &quot;Unnhh,&quot; he's gone.<o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">This
            has to be one of the oddest film roles in history. In a movie whose
            score is dominated by the Cash Money Millionaires (that is, not his
            own No Limit crew), Master P gets prominent mention in the credits
            (albeit as &quot;Rapper 1&quot;) and, with his head-rag and platinum
            teeth, he's surely recognizable. He makes a second appearance late
            in the film, once again introduced by Ed Lover as the emcee, this
            time leading Rapper 2 and Rapper 3 (played by his real-life
            brothers, Silkk the Shocker and C-Murder, who is himself currently
            jailed awaiting a murder trial), and assorted cage-side cons in a
            hiphoppish version of the national anthem. In all his eighty seconds
            or so on screen, P has not a word of dialogue. And so, you might
            wonder, <i>what</i> is he doing here? <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Or,
            you might not. In fact, this isn't a question likely to occur to
            many viewers of <i>Undisputed</i>, perhaps only those who have taken
            note of the trailers, in which Master P's name is invoked, as if he
            is a &quot;star&quot; in the film. Some won't even register his
            existence, and others will attend to the film's central action,
            namely, a much drawn-out battle between two mighty boxers, played by
            two charismatic and extremely hard-bodied performers. The trappings
            -- the hackneyed plot, the stock characters, the references that
            might have been topical when the movie was shot and then shelved a
            couple of years ago -- are as inconsequential as Master P's brief
            appearance. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">In
            its focus on its opposing forces, <i>Undisputed</i> is much like
            Hill's other films (most like those he's directed, like <i>Hard
            Times</i> or <i>Trespass</i>, though also related to the <i>Alien</i>
            series, which he's produced and co-written). Inspired in part by the
            Mike Tyson saga -- the pre-biting part, when he was convicted for
            the rape of Desiree Washington -- the film begins when heavyweight
            champion Iceman Chambers (Ving Rhames, who's reportedly been working
            out to play Sonny Liston, such that his usually imposing figure is
            extra-honed) comes to Sweetwater, choppered in rather than taking
            the usual long hot bus ride.</span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">&nbsp;<o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Many
            of the other inmates -- and the white warden (Denis Arndt) and white
            head guard (Michael Rooker) -- resent his black celebrity and are
            wholly unimpressed by his protestations of innocence, and the film
            includes repeated bits of a television interview by his victim
            Tawnee Rollins (Rose Rollins), in which she insists that she didn't
            want to hurt him, only to assert her regular person's rights (these
            images closely echo one of Desiree Washington's interviews, plainly
            invoking whatever feelings you might have concerning the Tyson
            case). While she looks tremulous on TV, Tawnee announces she's suing
            Iceman in civil court for $75 million. This brings on a cash flow
            crisis, of which Iceman is reminded repeatedly by his lawyers. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">As
            Hill and co-writer-producer David Giler noticed, this story is
            intriguing -- the complex cultural background and fallout of a major
            athlete's rape conviction, the girl's frustration at the hate mail
            she receives, media hysteria and community protests over the case.
            But that film has already been made: Barbara Koppel's provocative
            documentary <i>Fallen Champ</i> considers the cultural production
            and use of the &quot;monstrous&quot; Mike Tyson, via the rape case:
            its conclusions are not clear-cut, but acutely critical of the
            systems (economic, professional sports, celebrity) that made Tyson
            who he is. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Hill
            and Giler's movie takes quite another tack, using the conviction as
            a point of departure. Unlike <i>Fallen Champ</i>, <i>Undisputed</i>
            does not challenge the idea that a man's &quot;honor&quot; can be
            attained and preserved by violence, whether organized as
            &quot;sport&quot; or let loose on the street. <i>Undisputed</i> is
            centered on guy stuff, which in this case means not too much
            introspection, less conversation, and lots of training montages. The
            political critique, such as it is, has to do with how marginalized,
            hard-time men make their own order and icons out of the leftover lot
            they're dealt. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">That
            doesn't mean the guys in <i>Undisputed</i> don't fall in lockstep
            with mainstream values, revering the strongest and the fastest,
            fearing the low-downest, resenting but also yearning to be the
            richest, etc. Iceman proves a useful target for much frustration
            because he likes himself too much, expecting everyone else to bow
            down when he shows up. For the most part, they do, including his
            cellmate Mingo (Wes Studi, who starred, magnificently, in Hill's <i>Geronimo:
            An American Legend</i>), who schools him, very gently, on how to get
            along inside. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">One
            guy stands up to Iceman. Lifer Monroe Hutchen (Wesley Snipes) has
            been winning Sweetwater bouts for ten years (despite the fact that
            his &quot;trainer&quot; is a weasel played by Fisher Stevens). An
            ex-California state boxing champion convicted for beating his wife's
            lover to death with his bare fists (a moment of dire angst revealed
            in a black-and-white flashback, another device borrowed from <i>Oz</i>),
            he's gen-pop's beloved and undisputed champion: even the skinheads
            like him. Sullen and silent, Monroe survives, he says, by
            &quot;living inside my head.&quot; The movie translates this to his
            building bridges and pagodas out of toothpicks -- images that make
            him look commendably, if eccentrically, abstemious. Rumor has it
            that he was so Zen-like in the film's first cut that Miramax
            demanded new scenes to make Monroe -- the hero, after all -- more
            &quot;likeable.&quot; (For the record, Snipes objected to such
            additions.) <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Once
            Monroe puts on his hooded robe and starts concentrating on his
            workouts, though, he mostly looks like Hurricane Carter by way of
            Denzel, now the prevailing representation of the Serious Black Man
            in Prison. Snipes is a taut, well-disciplined movie star, and brings
            some gnarly edge to Monroe, but he has precious little time on
            screen. The movie presents Monroe's low-key-underclass heroism as a
            matter of faith: you identify with the prisoners, and since they
            like him, so do you. (Still, this assumption that you'll take the
            inmates' choice is interesting in itself, given mainstream culture's
            customary inclination to hate on them.) <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Unfortunately,
            <i>Undisputed</i>'s climax -- the big fight in the cage -- reasserts
            a routine schematic opposition: Iceman is a convicted, wealthy,
            celebrity rapist who refuses to be responsible for anything; Monroe
            is a wouldabeen who's accepted responsibility for what he's done.
            The self-described &quot;gladiator&quot; Iceman (because &quot;You
            play a sport like baseball, but you don't play at boxing&quot;) is
            set against the admirably ascetic Monroe (who tends not to explain
            himself). <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            fight, as a literal event, is arranged by feisty Mafioso and boxing
            student/historian Mendy Ripstein (Peter Falk), aided by ambitious
            Jesus (Jon Seda). The fight, as a symbolic event, needs to do too
            much: it's the showdown between sort of good and sort of evil, the
            big action finish, and the moment of truth for the bodies that have
            been preparing for ninety minutes (and no namby-pamby slow motion
            stuff, just hard-charging, train-rush wallops and collisions,
            accompanied by harsh whooshes and crashing sounds, underlining the
            bloody, ugly spectacle of boxing, whether for &quot;masses&quot; or
            for bigwigs in evening wear). And oh yes, it's the occasion for
            Master P's return, about twenty seconds worth.<o:p>
