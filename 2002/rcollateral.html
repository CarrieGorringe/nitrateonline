            was literally an hour and a half after the terrorist attack. My wife
            and I, we took the kids to school, and on the way to school, my wife
            turned to me and said, 'You can forget about <i>Collateral Damage</i>
            right now.'&quot; Recalling his own version of September 11 for Matt
            Lauer on <i>Today</i> (6 February), fifty-four-year-old Arnold
            Schwarzenegger looks like he always does on talk shows, perfectly
            pleased to be his famous and much-adored self. Lauer asks him if, on
            that terrible day back in September, he considered that maybe his
            career was about to change forever (no more <i>Terminator</i>s, only
            a long line of <i>Kindergarten Cop</i>s stretching into
            eternity...). And Schwarzenegger says exactly the right thing:
            &quot;You know, I wasn't thinking about my career at all at that
            point, because I think the whole country was so wrapped up in what
            has happened, the huge tragedy, the thousands of people that lost
            their lives... [My career] became so little compared to what
            happened to so many people's lives.&quot; <o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Think
            what you want about Arnold Schwarzenegger as an actor, athlete,
            Republican supporter, politician, director, or husband, the guy is a
            magnificent movie star, gracious, hard-working, and utterly
            self-confident. Hitting the talk show trail to pitch <i>Collateral
            Damage</i> -- about an LA fireman who exacts mighty vengeance from
            terrorists who kill his wife and child -- he's handling the
            unsurprising questions with the patient assurance of someone who's
            done his homework. When asked to explain why the movie is
            release-able now, just four months after 9-11, he's ready: Within
            weeks of the attacks, he says, he was reading reports of rising
            rentals of &quot;movies such as <i>Die Hard</i> and <i>True Lies</i>,
            all those kind of terrorist movies.&quot; So, he concludes,
            apparently quite thoughtfully, people &quot;wanted to see this with
            a positive ending, they wanted to see entertainment mixed in with
            it, something that was typical Hollywood, over the top, not like the
            real situation, where we're hunting down the terrorists with no end
            in sight. They wanted to see an end in sight...&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">&nbsp;<i>Collateral
            Damage</i> delivers that end. A lot of it. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">At
            the start of the movie, Gordy Brewer (Schwarzenegger) is on the job,
            inside a fiery building, busting through walls and floors in efforts
            to save the poor tenants, including an elderly woman who speaks only
            Spanish (this is the usual preemptive movie trick, wherein the hero
            reveals that he really doesn't hate everyone who speaks Spanish
            (carries &quot;suspicious&quot; suitcases, wears a mustache, is
            black or looks &quot;Middle Eastern&quot;); see also <i>True Lies</i>,
            where Arnold works with the &quot;good Arab-American&quot; against
            the &quot;bad Arabs&quot;). Brave and big-hearted, as well as strong
            enough to carry the woman through the hot, smoky hallway, Gordy is
            also an amazing dad and spouse. When he gets home at six a.m., he
            doesn't go to bed or get a shower; rather, he spends some quality
            time with his adorable little boy, giving mom a chance to sleep. All
            this perfection, of course, bodes ill: within minutes, Gordy's late
            to meet the wife-and-child at some outdoor café, unfortunately
            located next door to a terrorist target, the Colombian Consulate. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Given
            the film's title, you won't be surprised to hear that it lingers on
            this bit of exposition: not only does Gordy actually exchange a few
            words with the bomber, who comes disguised as an LA traffic cop (not
            unlike the T-1000 in <i>T2</i>), but the little boy plays with a toy
            his dad has given him, and then Gordy waves at the family just at
            the moment they blow up. This is surely an ugly moment, but the
            point is not to make you feel sad or even horrified, as much as it
            is to make you understand (and support) Gordy's emotional shift,
            from courageous life-saver to really pissed-off life-taker, making a
            serious dent in the bad guys' capacity to kill more Innocent People.
            (Unsurprisingly, the film spends little time considering the
            collateral damage inflicted by Gordy or even the U.S. military.)<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">This
            undertaking makes Gordy something of an ideal Everyman, down but not
            out, wounded but resilient, distraught but eager to &quot;get
            justice for [his] family,&quot; as one CIA guy puts it. Or, as
            Schwarzenegger described the whole shebang to the guys on <i>Fox NFL
            Sunday</i> (27 January), &quot;There's some serious butt-kicking
            going on.&quot; Okay. You expect that much in a movie that,
            pre-9-11, was touted as a kind of comeback vehicle for the man whose
            last two films, <i>End of Days</i> and <i>The 6th Day</i>, didn't
            exactly destroy the competition at the box office. It helps,
            post-9-11, that this &quot;butt-kicking&quot; is performed by
            someone whose enemies keep calling him &quot;the Fireman,&quot; as
            in, &quot;He's just a Fireman!&quot; or &quot;What about the
            Fireman?&quot; (to which the villain's oh so clever response is,
            &quot;Let him burn in hell!&quot;). Not that real firemen kick
            butts, but if they had to, they'd do it like Arnold. Yay, team! <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Gordy
            hardly needs more motivation than what he's got (the dead family),
            but this increasingly psychotic film provides it anyway, first, in
            the form of an obviously odious villain, code-named El Lobo, a.k.a.
            The Wolf, a.k.a. Claudio Perrini (played by Cliff Curtis, looking
            much like he did as Pablo Escobar in <i>Blow</i>). Not only is
            Claudio sneaky, cruel, and calculating, he's also well known to the
            U.S. Intelligence Community (and even gets some positive press, when
            a local news crew interviews a supportive &quot;activist&quot; whom
            the FBI is monitoring but not stopping). The feds inevitably let
            Claudio &quot;slip away,&quot; back to Colombia, so that Gordy can
            hunt him down. Though Claudio hides in a jungle (specifically, in
            the Guerilla Zone) rather than desert tunnels, and though he doesn't
            appear to be financed by his family's oil and banking interests,
            he's bound to recall a certain other infamous terrorist who's mad at
            U.S. interventions in his homeland's political and economic
            infrastructures, and who makes it a habit to release videotapes
            detailing those grievances. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">But
            Claudio is an old stereotype more than he is modeled after anyone in
            particular: even if he doesn't glower and strap bombs to his body,
            he comes up with plenty of other evil deeds: he thinks little of
            endangering his own family, knows how to use the media for maximum
            scary-effect (his videos feature an irate figure in a ski-mask), and
            kills one screw-up by forcing his mouth open and sending a snake
            down his throat (this is, amazingly, even more awful than it
            sounds). You keep wishing, actually, that the film would give
            Claudio more screen minutes, mainly because Curtis can be unnerving
            and fascinating at the same time, but here, his mission is pretty
            clear: encourage viewer sympathy for Gordy, then get out of the way.
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">At
            one point, Gordy learns that Claudio has his own reasons to be
            bitter, that his child was &quot;collateral damage&quot; of a U.S.
            assault, and so, perhaps the two men are not so different after all
            (or at least this is a story he hears, and given the propensity that
            all Gordy's acquaintances show for lying, maybe it's simply not
            true). Yet, whether or not Claudio has suffered his own (personal or
            community) pain, there's never a doubt that Gordy should be beating
            the bejesus out of him, or, in one crowd-pleasing scene, biting a
            henchman's ear clean off. This despite the fact that the movie is,
            ostensibly, about the pain and suffering caused by &quot;collateral
            damage.&quot; Or, as Schwarzenegger tells eonline.com, the film is
            about the dilemma presented by terrorism: &quot;You can't fight
            terror with terror. America has tried that in the past, and it has
            created a cycle of violence that has nations hating you and looking
            to pay you back.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Like
            they say, payback is a motherf*cker. The solution that <i>Collateral
            Damage</i> comes up with is distinctly Arnoldian: total
            annihilation. Gordy heads off to Colombia and terrorizes the
            terrorists, or at least he does until U.S. forces show up with
            choppers and shoot missiles all over the place: &quot;Keep shooting,
            says Brandt from under his helmet, sounding just a little
            Kurtz-like. &quot;Kill everyone!&quot; At this point, Gordy has been
            making trouble for the CIA, which means he's potentially going to be
            turned into &quot;collateral damage&quot; himself. &quot;With any
            luck,&quot; smirks CIA Agent Brandt (Elias Koteas), this gadfly will
            be found &quot;dead on the side of the road somewhere.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">And
            in case you're thinking in something resembling practical terms,
            that, say, the Fireman might better leave this work to
            &quot;experts,&quot; rest assured: no one else can do it. A Senate
            Intelligence Hearing cuts funding for anti-terrorism activities in
            Colombia, because Brandt's team hasn't gotten the job done (the
            Senate is feeling particularly beset because Gordy's story is all
            over the news). And so, Gordy is not only driven not only by a
            personal desire for vengeance, but also by patriotic zeal that can
            be shared by everyone even vaguely annoyed at their government for
            not doing its job. He means to set the world order straight, to
            provide that &quot;end in sight&quot; that everyone &quot;wants to
            see.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            route to this end is slightly complicated by a couple of sensational
            stunts (including a leap off a waterfall recalling another of
            director Andrew Davis's action pictures, <i>The Fugitive</i>) and a
            few offbeat characters. These include a chatty Canadian expatriate
            (John Turturro) whom he meets in jail and holds a precious pass to
            the Guerilla Zone, and Felix (John Leguizamo), a wannabe hiphopper
            who wears a Metallica t-shirt and runs a cocaine manufacturing
            operation in the Zone. (You may pause to wonder how come Turturro
            and Leguizamo appear in these little roles, playing sort of comic
            sidekicks to the durably macho Gordy, but then again, you may not.) <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Most
            importantly, on the way to his very own &quot;heart of
            darkness&quot; (traveling upriver, hitching rides on various boats),
            Gordy encounters yet another helper, the mysterious Selena (the
            Italian actor Francesca Neri, whose first U.S. picture was <i>Hannibal</i>).
            She comes equipped with a beautiful little boy, Mauro (Tyler Parker
            Garcia), who <i>can't talk</i>, who is, in other words, as
            symbolically innocent and pure, as close to angelic, as he can
            possibly be. He takes a liking to Gordy, who is soon saving the boy
            from a series of perils, from Colombian terrorists and the U.S.
            military. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">It's
            in this relationship that the strange but predictable hysteria of <i>Collateral
            Damage</i> emerges. As Mauro finds in Gordy the perfect protector,
            it's hard not to be reminded of Sarah Conner's description of the
            best father for her son John: &quot;The Terminator would never
            stop.... of all the would-be fathers who came and went over the
            years, this thing, this machine, was the only one who measured up.
            In an insane world, it was the sanest choice.&quot; Of course. The
            Fireman will always be back (for instance, in <i>True Lies 2</i> and
            <i>Terminator 3</i>, both due out next year). And so, <i>Collateral
            Damage</i>, so ill-conceived and seemingly endless, finds an end in
            sight, after all. <o:p>
