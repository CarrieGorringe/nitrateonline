            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>&quot;Crikey!&quot; says Steve
            Irwin as he shows us what appears to be a standard-issue tarantula
            alighted on a piece of bark. Not so: this spider is capable of
            leaping out of the hole it makes its home and attacking its prey
            with a pair of fangs which are about the same size as those of a
            rattlesnake, and which Irwin gently coaxes the spider into showing
            for us. It's the kind of spider which most well-trained experts
            would probably want to steer clear of. Irwin, however, is not just
            anyone. Before the end of the day, he will also handle two type of
            venomous snakes -- with his bare hands. And that's even before he
            gets to wrestling with a crocodile bigger than he is.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Irwin knows what he's doing,
            though, and he isn't afraid to let us know that even he gets a
            little nervous sometimes (&quot;Take a look at that, will ya?
            Sweatin' bullets!&quot;). But when he shows us the fangs on the
            &quot;bird-catching spider&quot;, it's because he's genuinely amazed
            at how this insect has been equipped to survive in the wild. Irwin's
            enthusiasm could, I imagine, be off-putting to some people (he seems
            to turn every second or third word into an exclamation), but I found
            myself both disarmed and entertained by him in <i>The Crocodile
            Hunter: Collision Course</i>, which follows Irwin, his (Oregon-born)
            wife Terri, and their dog Susie as they spend a day driving through
            the Queensland, Australia outback (which is where they operate the
            Australian Zoo wildlife preserve), picking up snakes so they can be
            relocated and not come into &quot;conflict&quot; with other humans,
            rescuing an orphaned kangaroo &quot;joey&quot;, and, later, having
            to deal with a very large crocodile which is annoying some of the
            locals. Actually, in relocating the crocodile, you get the notion
            that Irwin thinks it's the humans who are annoying the animals, but
            Irwin's enthusiasm is also combined with what appears to be a deep
            and abiding streak of anti-cruelty. Irwin relies on rope, a knife,
            and his own abilities to subdue a crocodile so that it can be
            restrained and then safely moved without any harm, and the knife
            comes into use only to cut the lashes holding the animal when Irwin
            gets ready to release it -- the Irwins appear to carry no firearms
            or tranquilizing guns, and about the strongest language Steve ever
            uses is &quot;Holy smoke!&quot; (And, no kidding, that really IS a
            crocodile Irwin is shown engaged with in several scenes in the
            movie: no animatronics, here.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Crocodile Hunter</i> is actually
            two movies, one with the Irwins which is shot in standard screen
            ratio and has them directly addressing the camera, just like on one
            of Steve's Animal Planet television programs; the other, filmed in
            widescreen, is some malarkey about a satellite component which falls
            to Earth and winds up in a crocodile's gullet (guess which
            crocodile), and some U.S. intelligence operatives who are out to
            retrieve it. There is also a crusty old rancher (Magda Szubanski,
            who delivers all of her dialogue out of the corner of her mouth) who
            wants to shoot same said crocodile (well, it's been bothering her
            dogs, as well as some livestock), and a game warden (the talented
            actor David Wenham) who tries to tell her she can't. You keep
            wishing the movie would cut back to the Irwins before it's too late;
            luckily, it does.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There are some deconstructivist
            moments when the characters seen in the widescreen movie start
            traveling into the scenes in the smaller-screen movie. Irwin
            mistakes them for poachers -- guys who are only out for &quot;boots,
            bags, and belts&quot; -- but his priority is to get the crocodile in
            his care moved to its new residing place, then &quot;come back and
            give 'em some Steve-o education&quot;. It was probably a good idea
            to let Irwin just play himself if he was going to appear in a motion
            picture. Irwin not only comes off as having a healthy, all-around
            appreciation for wildlife in all its many aspects, but he's
            life-affirming, as well, because he's able to inspire in others the
            same kind of enthusiasm, fascination, and appreciation he feels,
            feelings which Irwin manifests in ways that are honorable and
            admirable. I can't think of any person who could better serve as a
            positive role model, for kids or otherwise.</font></td>
