            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>With its metaphorical title, the
            multiple award-winning <i>Lantana</i> flirts with pretentiousness
            but thankfully falls short of this objective. Despite some sequences
            where writer Andrew Bovell (<i>Strictly Ballroom</i>) and director
            Ray Lawrence (the 1985 adaptation of Peter Carey's <i>Bliss</i>)
            initially appear to be aiming for cheap jolts, the two look at
            marital discord in a fresh and honest light. At first, some of the
            groping sequences seem silly and extraneous, but Bovell and Lawrence
            do have a higher purpose than flashing skin.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The bush that figures in the film's
            moniker dominates its opening shot. The flowers that come from the
            shrub make the screen look like a <i>Better Homes and Gardens</i>
            spread, but the loud, eerie buzz of insects hints that something
            more sinister is occurring. Soon we discover the body of an
            unidentified woman.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Abruptly, the scene shifts to the
            ferocious coupling of Leon (Anthony LaPaglia) and Jane (Rachael
            Blake). Both are married to other people. As far as Leon is
            concerned, the illicit relationship is more an act of desperation
            than passion. &quot;This is not an affair,&quot; he later tells her.
            &quot;It's a one-night stand that happened twice.&quot; While still
            pining for his wife Sonja (Kerry Armstrong), he is uncomfortable
            talking with her. Depressed with the sudden approach of middle age,
            Leon takes up jogging and extramarital dalliances to give himself a
            feeling of vitality he hasn't had in years. Both wind up leading to
            more frustration and chest pains. His ennui has rubbed off on Sonja
            who takes her issues to Valerie (Barbara Hershey), her therapist.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like most shrinks, Valerie has
            issues of her own. The unsolved death of her daughter has inspired
            her to write a best-selling book that has won her acclaim but
            alienated her husband John (Oscar-winner Geoffrey Rush). The two
            exchange perfunctory courtesies but have reached the point where
            they don't take the same vehicles to work even when their schedules
            don't conflict. Aggravating her feelings of abandonment is the fact
            that one of her patients is a gay man who continually boasts of an
            affair he's having with a married fellow who sounds a lot like John.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Throughout <i>Lantana</i> all of
            these folks come into contact with each other in odd, almost
            peripheral ways. Leon is a detective and on his cases, he winds up
            inadvertently crossing paths with Jane's husband (Glenn Robbins) and
            her neighbors Nik (Vince Colosimo) and Paula (Daniela Farinacci).
            The blue-collar couple have unspoken problems of their own because
            Nik is terminally bored staying home with their kids because, unlike
            his wife Paula, he's unable to find work. The connection between
            these folks and the film's opening revelations doesn't play like a
            conventional whodunit. The incident that leads to the pivotal death
            occurs well into the movie, and Bovell, adapting his play <i>Speaking
            in Tongues</i>, is clearly more interested in examining his
            characters' hang-ups than in establishing the identity of a victim
            or killer.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thanks to some fine work from
            LaPaglia, this turns out to be a wise approach. As with his turn in <i>Bulletproof
            Heart</i>, LaPaglia excels at playing men whose cold exteriors hide
            desperate, seemingly futile longings. Because he's played Americans
            so often, it's somewhat jarring to hear him use his native accent,
            but <i>Lantana</i> allows him to demonstrate some chops he hasn't
            had the opportunity to use in ages. Similarly, Armstrong also does a
            fine job of wincing with unspoken torment. While the rest of the
            cast is solid, Rush is disappointing as John. Rush seems more at
            home playing extroverts like the Marquis de Sade (in <i>Quills</i>)
            and the bumbling producer he played( in <i>Shakespeare in Love</i>)
            than he does at playing quiet, tormented unfortunates. In <i>Lantana</i>,
            Rush seems excessively mannered and appears to be itching to step
            into the spotlight.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Even though Bovell and Lawrence are
            working from a play, <i>Lantana</i> reveals more information through
            its visuals than through the dialogue. LaPaglia's face seethes with
            discontent as the camera reveals that Leon has met Jane at a dance
            class he and Sonja are taking, and that Sonja likes the course a lot
            more than he does. At times, the people in <i>Lantana</i> seem a
            little too joyless to be likeable, but because Bovell and Lawrence
            use subtle sequences like the ones in the dance courses, these
            encounters are at least intriguing. It's also refreshing to see a
            theatrical adaptation that doesn't look stiff or sound verbose
            (think of the movie version of David Mamet's <i>American Buffalo</i>).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </span>In many ways the finest moment in <i>Lantana</i> is the
            closing montage. Lawrence flashes to snippets of all the characters'
            fates and settles on a final shot of a couple dancing. The two are
            moving gracefully but can't bring themselves to make eye contact.
            This ending isn't neat or comfortable, but it makes the stories that
            preceded it more compelling and believable.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"></o:p>
