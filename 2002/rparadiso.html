            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Francis Ford Coppola's 
            darker-than-black epic <i>Apocalypse Now Redux</i> debuted last 
            year, adding fifty-three minutes and renewed accolades to what was 
            already a classic war film more than a decade old. Milos Forman's 
            enchanting director's cut of <i>Amadeus</i>, running twenty minutes 
            longer than its 1984 original, was released this spring to more 
            critical acclaim. I consider it one of the most beautifully paced 
            films I have ever seen. Martin Scorsese's ultimate rock concert <i>
            The Last Waltz</i>, louder, better, but, alas, not longer than its 
            original 117 minutes, had a limited run last April in advance of its 
            &quot;special edition&quot; DVD release a month later. Steven Spielberg caught 
            the revisionist bug by rewriting, re-digitizing, and re-filming 
            parts of his twenty-year-old family classic <i>E.T. The 
            Extraterrestrial</i>, released in March. Disney's <i>Beauty and the 
            Beast</i>, celebrated a slightly belated ten-year anniversary as a 
            multi-story IMAX presentation sporting a new six-minute sequence 
            when it opened last New Year's Day. And let's not forget John 
            Sayles' directorial debut <i>Return of the Secaucus 7</i>, opening 
            for limited runs in New York and Los Angeles on April 12th, 
            apparently the only one in the lot left untouched. According to the 
            Motion Picture Association of America there were twenty films 
            reissued in 2001.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Giuseppe Tornatore's 155-minute <i>
            Nuovo Cinema Paradiso</i>, released in Italy on November 17, 1988, 
            was compressed to merely <i>Cinema Paradiso</i> and truncated by 
            more than thirty minutes when American audiences applauded and 
            critics lauded it over a year later. It won an Academy Award, a 
            Golden Globe, several other international prizes, and made tons of 
            Ten Best lists. <i>Cinema Paradiso </i>was the second of four 
            consecutive Best Foreign Film Oscars that would be collected by 
            Miramax between 1988 and 1991 (the others being <i>Pelle the 
            Conqueror</i>, <i>Journey of Hope</i>, and <i>Mediterraneo</i>). It 
            grossed nearly $12 million in this country, making a small but 
            respectable profit for distributor Miramax as the highest-grossing 
            foreign-language film of 1990.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Miramax's press material rightfully 
            calls its current release <i>Cinema Paradiso: The New Version</i>. 
            Not only is it <i>Nuovo Cinema Paradiso</i> (the original edition 
            briefly released in Italy), but <i>molto nuovo</i>, a nearly 
            three-hour extravagance, clocking in some fifty-one minutes longer 
            than what most of the world has seen to date, the 123-minute 
            international condensation. Thoroughly enjoyable in its own right, 
            director-writer Tornatore has expanded his cinematic love letter, 
            basically refashioning his film into a distinctly more mellow piece. 
            What we remember fondly as an affectionate, sweet tale of a boy and 
            his projectionist (Philippe Noiret), then of a teenager and his 
            projectionist, has added back in what is basically the last third of 
            the film, a man and his memories of a projectionist. This portion 
            features the adult Salvatore (Jacques Perrin) in a gloomy role, 
            returning to Giancaldo, his Sicilian home, a prodigal son after 
            thirty years upon learning of his long-time acquaintance's death. 
            While the final ending remains, in which a collated reel of 
            parochially expunged kisses flicker on screen as an affectionate 
            bequest by Alfredo to a white-haired Salvatore, now a renown film 
            director, the hour leading up to this tear-filled finale is (still) 
            best left on the cutting room floor. The innocence is gone.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While the director might consider 
            this a more provocative feature (pushing its PG rating to an R), it 
            also has become much more morose—a huge let down from the formerly 
            tender period piece about friendship and, later, a teenager's timid 
            coming-of-age adventures in love and sex that were the bulk of the 
            film's two-hour version. Tornatore's decision to bring the film full 
            circle finds the fully-grown Salvatore in a position not unlike that 
            of Tom Hanks' Chuck Noland in <i>Cast Away</i>. Pine all you want 
            for &quot;the girl that got away,&quot; but by the time you are reunited, it 
            may be too late. Brigitte Fossey as the matured and married Elena 
            (her younger self played by Agnese Nano, the teenager Salvatore's 
            fancy, who reappears in part three as the daughter of Elena), was 
            totally clipped from the general release version of twelve years 
            ago. She's back in for a quick tryst in a car by the beach, but 
            their love can never be. Yes questions are answered, ones that 
            Tornatore felt needed resolution, but it depreciates what has been a 
            wonderful experience for us.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The opening hour, at least, remains 
            an adorable romp for the ten-year-old Salvatore Cascio as Toto, a 
            precocious lad that stole our hearts and filled us with laughter. 
            His is one of the greatest child performances of all time. To 
            Tornatore's merit, no other film has captured the film-going 
            experience with such affection and warmth, and the director-writer 
            deserved every single kudo. His ode to life in a remote Italian 
            village in the 1940s and 1950s, wherein the movie theater is the 
            town's cultural and social center is priceless entertainment. It is 
            one of cinema's finest hours. But the Paradiso's rusted-out ruin and 
            ultimate collapse during the film's final third, and Perrin's weak 
            performance, emotionally belittle a cinema classic. Sometimes 
            shorter is better.</font></td>
