            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>What's the ripest thing about
            this movie?</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Well, there's the part where James
            Frain, as a magistrate, holds up a sealed letter and asks its
            bearer, &quot;Have you read this?&quot; Edmond Dantes (Jim
            Caviezel), solemnly intoning that his all-consuming desire is
            &quot;revenge,&quot; is told by his hearty Corsican friend (Luis
            Guzman), &quot;Okay. Revenge. Who?&quot; Dagmara Dominczyk, as
            Dantes' girlfriend, says, referring to a Higher Being, &quot;He is
            in everything. Even in a kiss.&quot; Dantes walks up to some guests,
            at a party hosted by someone else, and says, &quot;So glad you could
            come and see me!...&quot; One character surprises another with
            information about a murder which the first character could not
            possibly have been privy to. Some cargo is stolen from a ship, but
            we don't know who it belonged to in the first place (this is an
            essential part to the story). It is then hidden in a secret hiding
            place that everybody seems to know about.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But, no -- The topper has to be the
            part, early in the film, where Dantes and Mercedes (Dominczyk's
            character) are sitting together by a campfire on the beach. After
            some romantic tete-a-tete (&quot;Make love to me.&quot; &quot;Will
            you ever give up?&quot;), she says she has to have a serious
            commitment from him -- men act like little boys, demanding, only to
            discard, playthings like ponies and whistles, and, Mercedes
            declares, &quot;I will not be your whistle!&quot; Alas! Dantes is
            but the meager &quot;son of a clerk,&quot; and can't give her
            something fancy like an engagement ring. So, Mercedes promptly rips
            some thread from the hem of her skirt and, there! The thread becomes
            her ring, and, moreover, she says, it &quot;will never leave my
            finger.&quot;</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now, while it is known that, prior
            to the advent of indoor plumbing and modern hygiene, bathing was not
            a daily occurrence among many people in the early 19th century,
            either Mercedes must not do a whole lot with her hands or that would
            have to be some mighty sturdy thread. Years pass, many of them,
            during which Mercedes obtains, then discards, a husband (no big deal
            -- he never &quot;pleased&quot; her, anyway, she says
            euphemistically), and she and Dantes are reunited, during which she
            holds up her hand to show -- yes! -- that same thread is still
            around the very same finger where she put it. Good to her word, she
            reasserts it &quot;never left my finger.&quot;</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">These lighthearted moments come in
            handy, because otherwise this film -- which seems not so much
            adapted as yanked from the novel by Alexandre Dumas père -- is a
            serious-minded affair, heavy on atmospherics and not all that fun.
            The story -- in which young Dantes is wrongfully accused of a crime,
            imprisoned, escapes, and then sets out to settle some scores with
            the aid of a fabulous treasure at his disposal -- is reduced to a
            welter of confusion, illogical, contradictory, and strewn with
            dangling plotlines, holes, and plausibility gaps (particularly the
            method shown in the film of Dantes' escape, which he would have had
            to have been psychic to engineer). Some films suffer from having not
            enough plot; this one has more than it knows what to do with.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film lays out some huge period
            recreation scenes -- an outdoor party, a landing by hot-air balloon,
            a formal dinner, a festival with masqued revelers, and a decent into
            the Roman catacombs -- only to dump out of them before we've even
            had much of a time to get a good look at them. And there doesn't
            seem to be much of a point in putting on a swashbuckler if the sword
            fights are clumsy. Perhaps aiming for verisimilitude, the filmmakers
            have the combatants lurch and flail about, and at least one fight
            ends up degenerating into a brawl. Maybe they felt that the fights
            Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone took part in during earlier films
            were too graceful, but that was one of the reasons people were drawn
            to them in the first place.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The other reason was that actors
            such as Flynn and Rathbone gave their heroes and villains the proper
            dimension. Jim Caviezel, squinting his eyes like a lizard who's
            about to fall asleep, doesn't give young Dantes the right ingenuous
            quality that would explain why he would feel profoundly betrayed
            after he gets into the fix he's in (Caviezel seems more like a
            nitwit, in fact, than ingenuous). After spending years in jail,
            subsisting on nothing but slops, he grows a fetchingly long beard
            and hair, but mysteriously never seems to lose any weight or body
            tone. And when he emerges, ostensibly a &quot;changed man,&quot;
            Caviezel doesn't really look or sound any different than he did
            before he went in.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">His outrage over the way his
            friend, Fernand, betrays him doesn't hold any weight because the
            film depicts Fernand as being deceitful and untrustworthy right from
            the start. Guy Pearce, who plays Fernand, gives a smirking, lazy,
            astonishingly awful performance -- his upper lip seems to be
            constantly curled -- especially in light of his recent work in
            &quot;Memento.&quot; Here, he doesn't seem to mind or care that he's
            pickling himself in overacting.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Fortunately, Richard Harris turns
            up in the middle of the picture, literally poking his head into
            Dantes' gloomy jail cell. Harris plays the imprisoned Abbé who
            befriends Dantes, teaches him to read and write, among other things
            (&quot;other things&quot; including a basic overview of Issac
            Newton's theories), and, in return, Dantes helps him in his attempt
            to dig a way out of their fortress-like prison and to freedom.
            Exactly how their captors never notice this considerably prodigious
            undertaking, where they get their digging tools from, or how they
            figure in what direction they should dig, is never really explained
            (we do find out what they do with the dirt they excavate), but no
            matter. Harris' dialogue delivery, with its gentle, raspy sound, and
            graceful gestures are recompense enough to one: at least somebody is
            giving a good performance in this picture.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"></o:p>
