            Egoyan's <i>Ararat</i> opens with a close shot on paintbrushes. In
            the background stands an easel and, nearby, the artist, Arshile
            Gorky (Simon Abkarian). It's around 1934, and he's painting a
            portrait, himself and his mother, one of his most famous works. At
            this moment, he's paused, contemplating. Just what he's thinking
            about however, remains unclear. <o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Quietly,
            this first scene sets up everything that follows, including the
            film's increasingly complex evocations of Gorky's own troubled past:
            he survived the Armenian massacre by the Turkish army during World
            War I, losing his mother in the city of Van, near Ararat Mountain.
            Beyond recounting this saga, <i>Ararat</i> investigates the nature
            of storytelling, the ways that particular stories linger or
            evaporate, how stories are told (to what points and to whom), the
            vexed and shifting ways that stories are interpreted. Various modes
            of storytelling come into focus, from history and familial lore, to
            memory and fantasy, all told and retold, repressed and refashioned
            to suit needs -- emotional, political, and economic. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>

            arranges its many stories along a zigzaggy route (a structure that
            is characteristic of Egoyan's work), moving in and out of times and
            settings, breaking down characters' experiences, recollections, and
            self-images. Gorky is the subject of scrutiny throughout the film,
            by multiple writers and readers. Art historian Ani (Arsinée
            Khanjian) has written a provocative new book on Gorky, citing his
            survival of the massacre as a source for his art. In turn, she's
            hired to consult on a film about the massacre by ambitious
            screenwriter Rouben (Eric Bogosian) and aging director Edward
            Saroyan (Charles Aznavour), who are seeking an identifiable figure
            like Gorky to propel their (hopefully) commercial enterprise. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>

            being of Armenian descent, each has personal stakes in recounting
            the killings, an event the Turkish government does not acknowledge
            to this day (this denial underlies the &quot;controversy&quot;
            surrounding the film, much generated before it opened). The story
            also moves the actors in the film within the film, also called <i>Ararat</i>,
            to rethink some of their attitudes and self-images. The accomplished
            Canadian actor Martin (Bruce Greenwood) is playing the selfless
            American missionary, Clarence Ussher, whose 1917 memoir, <i>An
            American Physician in Turkey</i>, grounds Rouben's script, and
            provides grisly imagery), and his first exposure to the brutality
            changes his sense of history, and to whom it's accountable. <o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            actor who is most visibly affected by his participation in the
            project is the half-Turkish Ali (Elias Koteas), who admits, &quot;I
            never heard about any of this stuff when I was growing up.&quot;
            Playing Jevdet Bey, the military officer who orders the slaughter of
            hundreds at Van (and who is written as a stereotypical monster), Ali
            starts to question his own identity, his sense of community. Feeling
            alternately defensive about his &quot;people,&quot; and open to the
            career opportunity presented by the film, he asks Saroyan if he
            hired him (Ali) because he's Turkish. The question cuts all ways --
            Ali is worried that he's hired only because of his ethnic background
            (thus undermining his reputation and skill) and that he's being
            blamed for the horrors depicted by the self-admittedly biased
            Armenian filmmakers. Saroyan avoids answering at first, but when Ali
            pushes him, he pushes back, revealing a deep-seated anger and
            resentment at an entire people in his dismissal of the actor. <o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">This
            film within the film occasions the story of yet another character,
            Ani's eighteen-year-old son Raffi (David Alpay). Hired as a
            production assistant, he's coming back from Turkey with canisters
            that he claims are filled with film he shot as background. Stopped
            by a Toronto customs officer named David (Christopher Plummer),
            Raffi spends the night recounting how he came to be in this place,
            at this time. As he talks, the film cuts back and forth, from this
            present, to Raffi's flashbacks of his familial difficulties and his
            time on the movie set, Gorky's childhood in Van (and the moment when
            the famous photograph of him and his mother is taken), and Ani's
            efforts to reconcile her conflicting aspirations: to be truthful, or
            at least respectful of her subject, and also to get his story told. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Ani
            is dealing with her own trauma and revisionary history. Her first
            husband, Raffi's father, was killed while trying to assassinate a
            Turkish politician; her second, father to Raffi's stepsister Cecilia
            (Marie-Josée Croze), killed himself when he learned she betrayed
            him. Cecilia, now sleeping with Raffi, repeatedly confronts Ani
            during the film, &quot;stalking&quot; her at Ani's readings, because
            her stepmother won't speak to her privately. Cecilia is trying to
            find out what &quot;really happened.&quot; This leaves young Raffi
            with a raggedly divided sense of loyalty, and neither woman is able
            to see the other's needs or his pain. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">As
            usual in Egoyan's films (see also <i>Family Viewing</i>, <i>Speaking
            Parts</i>, <i>Exotica</i>, <i>The Sweet Hereafter</i>, etc.), such
            tangled familial relationships inspire chaos and meanness as much as
            understanding and benevolence. Elegant and deliberate even as it
            depicts horrific events, the film is both intellectual and deeply
            passionate.</span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">&nbsp;<o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Both
            tellers and listeners are responsible for their relationships as
            well as the stories that sustain them (even, or perhaps especially
            when they resist such responsibility). Raffi is invested in what
            happened to Gorky, his mother's dedication to her project(s), his
            lover/stepsister's anger at his mother. And while he tells his
            layered tale, David is clearly fascinated, even sympathetic, but
            also distracted. Flashbacks reveal that he too is undergoing
            domestic strain -- his son (who happens to be sleeping with Ali)
            accuses him of homophobia, and threatens not to let him see his
            grandson. Thus David's reaction to Raffi (much like Raffi's to his
            mother, or Ani's to Cecilia) emerges in part out of his own desires
            -- to have revenge, make things &quot;right,&quot; or make sense of
            all the tumult in his life, maybe even to help Raffi recover his own
            way. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Raffi
            shows David the digital video diary he made during his trip to
            Turkey, during which he visited shrines (and Mount Ararat) he knows
            are important to Ani's research, her personal interests, and
            self-identifications. At this moment, though he's still, Raffi is
            visibly wound up, eager to win her understanding and approval and
            also, to understand her and feel proud of her. As he frames the
            video's story for David, the film frame is segmented, showing the
            video and Raffi's face, as well as David's reactions. This layering
            -- ancient artifacts, contemporary technology, sober human
            reflection -- depicts, in an instant, <i>Ararat</i>'s project, its
            study of the interrelated processes of reception and belief. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">David
            must choose to believe -- what's in the film cans, what Raffi
            intends, what Raffi knows, what's the &quot;best&quot; thing to do.
            His decision will have lasting effects on the boy and himself. But
            it's unknowable how their stories will end. Here again, Gorky's
            story is helpfully emblematic. Near the end of <i>Ararat</i>, the
            scene returns to its opening, the artist paused at his canvas.
            Looking at the portrait of himself and his mother, almost finished,
            he suddenly grabs up a handful of paint solvent and destroys the
            section representing his mother's hands. The portrait will remain
            unfinished. Of all the violences depicted in the film, this is
            perhaps the most visceral, and it makes clear that no single
            history, whether personal or collective, can be<span style="mso-spacerun:
