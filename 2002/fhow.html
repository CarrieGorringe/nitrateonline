            <font face="Verdana" size="5">28th Seattle International Film 
            Festival</font><p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">A well-earned 
retrospective of the work of master cinematographer James Wong Howe (1899-1976) 
was on display at this year's SIFF. Howe, born in China, had a career that 
stretched back to Cecil B. DeMille's early silent films. Progressing from the 
assistant to DeMille's cameraman, to &quot;slate boy&quot; to cinematographer in rapid 
succession, Howe's work was characterized by his use of light, shadow and camera 
movements that were always meticulously planned (nothing in a film lensed by 
Howe ever occurred by accident), and also so subtly executed that the audience 
remained unaware of his meticulous planning . Like a professional athlete, Howe 
worked hard to make it all appear effortless.</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Four of Howe's films -- <i>The Prisoner of 
Zenda</i> (1937), <i>Pursued</i> (1947), <i>Picnic</i> (1956) and <i>Sweet Smell 
of Success</i> (1957) -- were featured in this year's festival. In his 
black-and-white works, Howe achieved the near-impossible feat of presenting the 
entire spectrum of white though grey to deep black, while maintaining a strong 
separation between each on-screen element. The only color film in the lot, <i>
Picnic</i> is completely saturated with a medium-blue hue throughout every 
frame, symbolic of the uncertainty and elusiveness of happiness in this corner 
of small-town America. Howe brought to <i>Sweet Smell of Success</i> the 
diamond-hard and razor-sharp images of <b><i>noir</i></b>. Unequivocal 
black-and-white imagery underscored the open malevolence of and power of gossip 
columnists during the waning years of the studio system -- an era in which 
subtle but well-placed hints about any sort of misdeed could still spell ruin 
for a career. For a master such as Howe, this tribute is just a taste of his 
capabilities (he shot over 125 films during the course of his career, among them 
the chilling <i>Seconds</i> (1966); <i>Hud</i> (1963); <i>Body and Soul</i> 
(1947); <i>The Thin Man</i> (1934); and the Marlene Dietrich/von Sternberg 
vehicle <i>Shanghai Express</i> (1932)). It's a career filled with the vast 
realization of the extent of an individual's considerable talent and range, one 
that few Hollywoodites could match but many would envy.</font></p>
