            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>I would be a fool, or a snob, or
            whatever not to admit that the music in <i>Drumline</i> kept me
            entirely occupied during all of its almost two-hour length, and
            that's a lot more than I can say about a lot of other pictures this
            year. The music in <i>Drumline</i> is good -- quite good, in fact --
            and it would be nice if the story didn't just melt away, but the
            pleasures that it does afford may be enough to keep many moviegoers
            occupied amidst some of the more serious-minded concerns of other
            year-end movies.</b></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Devon (Nick Cannon), a
            newly-graduated N.Y.C. high school student, has been recruited to
            play on the athletic field band for a (fictional) Atlanta
            university. The band students quickly learn that they are going to
            be put through a regiment as vigorous as for any military boot
            camp---rousted out of bed before the crack of dawn, they do
            mandatory push-ups and are hollered at by team leaders who act like
            drill sergeants. Devon, who has an aptitude for the snare drum, also
            has a rebellious streak and what is usually referred to as an
            attitude problem with authority (something that Cannon emphasizes
            with narrow, steely-eyed looks and the way he purses his lips), but
            his potentiality is not lost on the band's conductor, Dr. Lee
            (Orlando Jones, showing heretofore unrevealed acting ability), who
            gets Devon to do what it takes (including bettering Devon's ability
            to read sheet music) so that he may develop from being merely a
            talented musician into a very fine one.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Along the way, Devon picks up a
            girlfriend, Laila (the extremely beautiful Zoe Saldana), who's a
            member of the cheerleading squad (and is it me, or are girls'
            blouses and tops getting tinier and tinier?), and even gets some
            domestic problems with his father worked out. By the end, all boils
            down to a gigantic show-off with an arch-rival band from another
            Atlanta university (one which prefers flash over musicianship), and
            a toe-to-toe contest between the respective bands' drumlines, one
            that makes it look as if you not only have to play well---which is
            work enough---but also be able to do movement and choreography well
            enough to be able to put you in the Joffrey Ballet or Twyla Tharp's
            group. Where do the kids find time to lean this stuff and cram for
            classes?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Which brings us back to where we
            came in. While the movie is diverting enough, by the time it reaches
            its conclusion it has jettisoned whatever story it has set out to
            tell in the first place, settling on being a rousing piece of
            entertainment over a solid one. But that still didn't stop my foot
            from tapping to the music during the movie from beginning to last.</font></p>
