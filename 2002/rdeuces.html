            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700">
            <font size="2">It's da summer of 1958 and Brooklyn's Deuces are at 
            war with a rival gang. Theirs is a long-running conflict, and for 
            the Deuces' charismatic leader, Leon (Stephen Dorff), the stakes are 
            deeply personal. You know this because the film opens with a scene 
            so broadly operatic you might mistake it for parody. As rain pours 
            down and thunder crashes, Leon staggers down the street to his 
            mother's house, carrying his brother's dead body. Arriving on her 
            stoop, he collapses, his face turned up to the torrents of rain, his 
            cries so terribly plaintive: &quot;Maaa! Maaa!&quot; </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">All the while, 
            Leon's younger brother, Bobby (Brad Renfro), looks confused, part 
            anguished, part uncomprehending, part resentful. It's a complex 
            moment (and recalls Renfro's similarly strong performance last year 
            in Larry Clark's <i>Bully</i>), and it almost saves this first scene 
            from looking as utterly ridiculous as it does. Alas, there is no 
            saving it, and the rest of <i>Deuces Wild</i> careens quickly into 
            self-parody without even seeming to be aware it's happening. </font>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Directed by 
            Scott Kalvert, whose previous film was the more earnest, more 
            perversely nimble <i>Basketball Diaries</i> (1995), <i>Deuces Wild</i> 
            is a heavy-handed glob of a movie. Quite unable to get out of its 
            own way, it invests heavily in its characters' posturing and 
            longing. &quot;Every kid wants to be James Dean,&quot; says Renfro of his 
            role, and this is, indeed, what the film appears to be about, that 
            &quot;universal&quot; desire to be a famously moody and self-destructive movie 
            icon. And so, the boys -- the Deuces and their sworn enemies, the 
            Vipers -- all look and act alike. Young toughs, Italian guys with 
            names like Philly Joe and Jimmy Pockets, they wear those 
            straight-bottomed shirts with open collars or tight t-shirts with 
            rolled sleeves, shine their shoes and slick their hair, and hang out 
            with girls in ponytails, pedal-pushers, and red lipstick. They spend 
            their days arguing about the Dodgers' move West, or standing on 
            street corners, usually near pizza joints, and stare each other 
            down. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Because the 
            Deuces and the Vipers argue over turf -- mostly the aforementioned 
            street corners, and sometimes even whole blocks -- you might imagine 
            that they are relevant. Like, maybe they're duck-tailed parallels to 
            today's turf quarrelers. Or perhaps they're model bullies, with some 
            insight to offer about the ways that kids (however old they are) 
            seek their identities in damaging others. But any of that would be a 
            stretch. <i>Deuces Wild</i> is so dated, in concept and execution, 
            that it's hard to take any of the characters or situations as 
            seriously as they take themselves. It even features Matt Dillon as a 
            local kingpin named Fritzy Zennetti, a character seemingly plucked 
            right out of Dillon's own 1980 gang film, <i>My Bodyguard</i>, 
            without taking time even to change his costume or rethink his sneer.
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Fritzy's scheme 
            brings all kinds of pain to Leon, who's been trying to get over Dead 
            Brother, who, by the way, died of a drug overdose, as well as take 
            care of Bobby and their Ma (ragingly alcoholic since Dead Brother's 
            death), as well as be a good helper to the local priest, Father Aldo 
            (<i>The Sopranos</i>' Vincent Pastore, looking predictably 
            uncomfortable in his frock). He's trying to be a good role model for 
            Scooch (Frankie Muniz), whose own dad, a drunk, of course, beats him 
            when he asks for money for a pretzel. And one more thing, Leon's got 
            a vavoomy, high-maintenance blond, Betsy (Drea DeMatteo), whose 
            bullet bra and saddle shoes are only setting her up for a violent 
            abuse scene. Really, the poor fellow has too much pressure on him, 
            even for a James Dean clone. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">As if all this 
            isn't enough, Fritzy just disrespects the heck out of Leon. When the 
            latter asks Fritzy to make his case (Please don't bring drugs into 
            the neighborhood, you know I'm touchy about them because my brother 
            died of an overdose, etc.), Fritzy blows him off royally: &quot;Go wear 
            your shirts, sing your songs, do whatever the f*ck it is that you 
            kids do.&quot; Maybe Fritzy's just mad because Leon's Matt Dillon 
            imitation is so weak. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">In any event, 
            Leon takes all this pretty hard, mainly because he knows that 
            Fritzy's being egged on by Leon's arch-enemy, Marco (Norman Reedus), 
            just out of jail for selling drugs to Dead Brother (who actually 
            does have a name, Al). And oh yes, a few other guys hang around 
            making trouble for Leon and Bobby, namely the snively wannabe Jimmy 
            Pockets (Balthazar Getty), who wants only to beat down the Deuces so 
            he can get in good with Marco. He's mainly in the picture, though, 
            so that his kid sister, Annie (Fairuza Balk), might throw a wrench 
            in Bobby and Leon's lives. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">That is, <i>
            Deuces Wild</i> treads heavily into <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>/<i>West 
            Side Story</i> territory, where it plainly has no business going. 
            While this conflict does help, in one instance, to enrich the 
            Bobby-Leon dynamic (they have a serious talk about the relationship 
            in their little, shared bedroom, and they actually look like 
            brothers rather than sock-hop posers, for a minute), for the most 
            part it's a trumped up plot device, and the brothers spend too much 
            time looking like any other set of brothers in any other movie just 
            like this one. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Annie's 
            contribution to Bobby's dilemma, aside from being the enemy's 
            sister, is that she is desperate to get outta town, to rescue her 
            crazy, Christmas carol-singing mom (Debbie Harry) from the poverty 
            and meanness and frankly, the overweening masculinity of their 
            neighborhood. She convinces Bobby to help them escape, and of 
            course, his not very well-considered scheme leads to tragedy. It's 
            not hard to guess which brother pays the Big Price, and which 
            actually Gets Out. It's more difficult to figure why anyone signed 
            on for this project, which has reportedly on the shelf for a year, 
            but feels more like it's been there for, oh, twenty.</font></span></td>
