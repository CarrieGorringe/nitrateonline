            review by <a href="../kj.html" target="_top">KJ Doughton</a>, 14 June 2002</i></font><p>
            <font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Until it finally hits a stride 
            during a rousing third act, John Woo’s latest balletic bloodbath 
            could be deservedly renamed “Windbreaker,” and not the kind you wear 
            to the beach on a breezy day.&nbsp; His <i>Windtalkers</i> is the latest 
            in Hollywood’s current, never-ending batch of World War II epics, 
            and it gets silver stars for sensational action set-pieces, but a 
            court-martial for its stale dialogue and uncreative, “been there, 
            done that” structure.&nbsp;</b> </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Woo is a natural choice for 
            directing a war film. In fact, one could argue that each elegantly 
            shot movie that the Chinese filmmaker has ever helmed is a war film.
            <i>The Killer</i>’s grand finale was an orgy of Sam Peckinpah-style 
            ballistics that made<i> The Wild Bunch</i> look like <i>Driving Miss 
            Daisy</i> in comparison. The body count of baddies downed <i>Hard 
            Boiled</i>’s trigger-happy hero<i> </i>rivaled that of <i>Platoon</i> 
            and <i>Saving Private Ryan</i> combined.&nbsp; Meanwhile, another superb 
            slug of early Woo magic, <i>Bullet in the Head</i>, boasted a P.O.W. 
            torture sequence that rivaled <i>The Deer Hunter</i>’s harrowing 
            Russian Roulette scene for sheer intensity.&nbsp; Woo can certainly walk 
            the walk. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">However, <i>Windtalkers</i> has 
            only the brilliant battlefield choreography to hold it afloat.&nbsp; The 
            filler passages involve the 1944 clashes between U.S. and Japanese 
            forces on the island of Saipan, and the crucial part that Navajo 
            code-breakers played in such gruesome skirmishes.&nbsp; Nicolas Cage 
            milks his distressed, loose-cannon eccentricity for all that it’s 
            worth, depicting Marine Sgt. Joe Enders as a man tight-roping across 
            frayed ends of sanity and plagued with flashbacks of previously 
            endured war horrors.&nbsp; He’s teamed up with Ben Yahzee (Adam Beach), a 
            New Mexico Navajo trained at California’s Camp Pendleton to transmit 
            radio messages from one U.S. military squadron to another, without 
            the vital information being deciphered by Japanese translators.&nbsp;
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When Enders is ordered by military 
            brass to supervise Yahzee in the field, and guard his partner’s code 
            at all times, the implication is to dust the Navajo counterpart 
            before allowing him to slide into enemy hands.&nbsp; After the uneasy 
            team is called into battle, they’re saddled with the usual cluster 
            of supporting character soldiers, including a hayseed racist who 
            instigates the obligatory Woo fistfight with Yahzee.&nbsp; There are 
            other tired sequences in which the white grunts look onward in 
            curious admiration as the Navajo code breakers perform a “protection 
            ceremony” to ward off evil spirits, slathering ash across their face 
            while Native American reed music sounds off in the background.&nbsp; 
            Ultimately, there’s a betrayal of sorts, and Enders is left to prove 
            his sincerity to Yahzee.&nbsp; This stirs up a bit of drama, but it’s too 
            little too late.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The script is generic Hollywood 
            banter straight from the <i>Pearl Harbor</i> cliché heap. When 
            commander Jason Isaacs (who livened up <i>The Patriot</i> as a 
            ruthless redcoat, and is totally wasted here) informs Enders of his 
            mission to oversee the code talker, Cage’s rebellious G.I. rants, 
            “I’ll best serve the corps killing Japs, not babysitting some 
            Indian.”&nbsp; Later, a tacked on love interest (Frances O’Connor) writes 
            to Enders, announcing, “I took in a stray dog. He reminds me of you. 
            At least he keeps me warm at night.”&nbsp; Suddenly, the sappy love 
            banter in <i>Attack of the Clones</i> starts sounding like David 
            Mamet in comparison.&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ultimately, it’s difficult to 
            dismiss a film staged with such finesse and care, especially one 
            about such an important and overlooked chapter in wartime history 
            (the film is based on actual coding developed by twenty-nine Navajo 
            Marines in 1942, a system which was never cracked by the Japanese).&nbsp; 
            But <i>Windtalkers</i> is awfully familiar. Perhaps if Woo had moved 
            the Navajo component center-stage, and jettisoned Cage’s 
            unnecessarily domineering presence, his film would take on a more 
            crisp, original feel.&nbsp; As it stands, Hollywood’s latest World War II 
            installment has more in common with Michael Bay than with the 
            fever-dream lunacy and go-for-broke kick of <i>Hard Boiled</i>.&nbsp; Too 
            bad.</font></td>
