<p>
            <font face="Verdana" size="5">28th Seattle International Film 
            Festival</font><p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Although Takashi 
Miike doesn’t speak a word of English, he effortlessly commands the focus of a 
conference room in Seattle’s hip &quot;W&quot; Hotel. The Japanese director of <i>Audition</i> 
and <i>Agitator</i> is weathering a series of interviews, with an interpreter 
standing by to decipher questions. Outside, the chameleonic&nbsp; Puget Sound skies 
are morphing from cloudy gray to clear blue, in much the same way that Miike’s 
unpredictable films twist from one extreme to another.</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Take <i>Dead or Alive</i>, where a distraught 
policeman mourns the wrongful deaths of his wife and child late into the still, 
somber night, moments before facing off in a comic bazooka battle that literally 
blows up the world.&nbsp; Even more dramatic is <i>Audition’s</i> cruel, sneaky 
transition from light, domestic romance into the most horrifying onscreen 
torture sequence of all time.&nbsp; By refusing to follow conventional expectations, 
Miike blindsides us with grotesque shocks that come straight out of left field 
and resonate like nightmares.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In person, Miike radiates playful, irreverent 
charisma, his mouth stretching into a mischievous grin from time to time. The 
director’s locks have been cut short and dyed orange.&nbsp; The blue-tinted shades 
that hide his eyes convey a futuristic, <i>Terminator</i>-style sensibility and 
give the filmmaker a menacing, bug-like appearance.&nbsp; Meanwhile, a black leather 
biker’s jacket enshrouds Miike’s compact frame. He looks like a rabble- rousing 
rock star, fresh off some Tokyo stage.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Miike’s appearance on the Starbucks-saturated 
streets of Seattle comes courtesy the 28<sup>th</sup> Annual Seattle 
International Film Festival, where two of his most recent efforts, <i>Happiness 
of the Katakuris</i> and <i>Agitator</i>, are making their U.S. onscreen 
debuts.&nbsp; In addition to providing northwest cinemaniacs with a chance to sample 
the cult favorite’s latest off-kilter projects, the festival has selected Miike 
for Emerging Master status.&nbsp; The honor acknowledges new voices in cinema that 
are poised for mainstream, high-visibility success.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As flattered as the prolific auteur is with 
such recognition, Miike makes it clear that if the mainstream is truly 
interested, it will have to knock on <i>his</i> door.&nbsp; He’d prefer to succeed on 
his own terms. &quot;I’ve got a certain audience that likes to see my movies,&quot; he 
proclaims, &quot;but such films are not for everybody.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The black jacket that gives Miike the 
appearance of a rabid motorcycle enthusiast is a clue to his past.&nbsp; Before eking 
out a reputation in Japanese film with a cluster of T.V. and direct-to-video 
releases that started with 1991’s <i>Lady Hunter</i>, Miike attempted to make 
ends meet as a motorbike racer. &quot;I was in the top three bike racers in my area,&quot; 
he explains, &quot;but then I tried to get a professional license. I found out that 
there was a lot of competition, and lost interest.&quot;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meanwhile, Miike’s stabs at continued education 
were sabotaged by a short attention span. &quot;A lot of times, I didn’t study too 
much,&quot; he confesses of a forgettable school history. &quot;I went to the movies, 
instead. Movies ultimately helped me in two ways. They gave me escapism and 
enjoyment, and later on, they also gave me a livelihood.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In 1995, <i>Shinjuku Triad Society</i> emerged 
as Miike’s first theatrical feature and was the initial installment of a 
gangster trilogy that also includes <i>Rainy Dog</i> (1997) and <i>Ley Lines</i> 
(1999). Miike’s fearless penchant for strong violence and lurid sexuality was 
enforced by the yakuza revenge actioner <i>Fudoh: The New Generations</i> 
(1996). </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">By 1999, Miike’s unusual films had begun making 
waves at festivals across the world. His warped aesthetic was compared to that 
of David Cronenberg or David Lynch, with dreamlike imagery and graphic shocks 
colliding in such twisted masterpieces as 1999’s <i>Audition</i> and <i>Dead or 
Alive</i>. Arguably his piece de resistance, <i>Audition</i> traces the sad 
plight of Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi), a successful businessman and dedicated father 
still smarting from the death of his wife seven years ago.&nbsp; With his adolescent 
boy observing, &quot;Dad, you look old,&quot; and a secretary announcing her engagement, 
Aoyama attempts to diffuse his aching pangs of loneliness by finding a new wife.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At the suggestion of a film industry friend, 
Aoyama stages a phony audition, where aspiring young actresses are summoned to 
apply for the bogus project’s lead role. However, the ulterior motive behind 
this scheme is to allow Aoyama his pick of the bunch, for wining, dining, and 
romance. It’s an underhanded plot, and the shy widower soon pays penance for 
such deception. He falls hard for Asami (Eihi Shiina), an ethereal waif whose 
fragile appearance masks a fierce psychopathology borne of past betrayals.&nbsp;
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><font size="2">Audition</font></i><font size="2"> 
takes its own sweet, leisurely time to lure us towards its camouflaged venus 
flytrap.&nbsp; Initially, we’re lulled into passivity by the film’s breezy blend of 
romantic comedy, like stuffed diners relaxing in the afterglow of fine wine and 
full bellies.&nbsp; Suddenly, Miike reveals the black widow’s web that we’ve been 
trapped in, by unveiling a prolonged, agonizing torture scene involving needles. 
Lots of needles.&nbsp; We’re lurched out of the safe confines of what has come 
before, and the disorientation is only matched by the graphic horror that 
lingers on the screen.&nbsp; <i>Audition</i> emerges as the most harrowing, 
unforgiving jolt of shock cinema since <i>Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer</i>.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After being told that audiences left in droves 
when <i>Audition</i>’s difficult-to-stomach third act premiered at <i>SIFF</i> 
two years ago, Miike isn’t surprised. &quot;That’s a very natural reaction,&quot; he 
confesses. &quot;There are some audiences that don’t want to see that kind of thing. 
However, there are also people who stayed there. They made some connection.&nbsp; 
That’s important to me.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When asked which country hosts his most loyal 
following, Miike states that he doesn’t perceive his audience in terms of 
geography. &quot;For me, it’s not about country, but about people,&quot; he explains. 
&quot;There are special people in every country that identify with my movies.&quot;&nbsp;
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size="2">Other Miike films twist tired formulas 
around in similarly unexpected ways.&nbsp; It’s doubtful that another director has 
ever framed a scene from the bottom of a toilet bowl, as Miike did in 2000’s
</font><i><font size="2">City of Lost Souls</font></i><font size="2">. If 
someone else <i>can</i> lay claim to such an unusual feat, it’s doubly doubtful 
that they’ve done it in a <i>used</i> commode, complete with two chunks of fecal 
matter floating aimlessly in the foreground. </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s also a safe bet that no film lunges out of 
the starting gates with an opening sequence as excessive as that of <i>Dead or 
Alive</i>, which somehow stuffs a gay bathroom murder, gleeful, <i>Scarface</i>-style 
cocaine-snorting, a restaurant shootout, and gyrating go-go dancers within its 
first frenzied ten minutes. &quot;My inspiration for scenes always comes from music,&quot; 
Miike explains of <i>Dead or Alive</i>’s kinetic beginning. &quot;I listened to the 
soundtrack of the film <i>Spawn</i>, which inspired the fast pacing. It gave 
something to me, an aggressive attitude. My musical preferences are very 
different day by day.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Music certainly sets the helter-skelter tone in
<i>Happiness of the Katakuris</i> (2001) another molotov cocktail of a movie 
that combines the upbeat spirit and family values of <i>The Sound of Music</i> 
with the mysteriously growing body count of <i>Motel Hell</i>.&nbsp; At one point, 
the deceased actually spring back to life and plunge into a lively musical 
number.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Another recent Miike movie is <i>Agitator</i> 
(2001), a work that revisits the filmmaker’s early roots with more <i>Godfather</i>-style 
gangster action.&nbsp; This time, Miike appears both behind and in front of the 
camera. Playing a hotheaded yakuza punk whose short-fused temper sets a string 
of messy mob wars into motion, he can be seen instigating a perverted karaoke 
party and devising creative uses for a microphone. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There is much debating over the almost 
unbelievably prolific number of films Miike has churned out in slightly over a 
decade.&nbsp; One Japanese filmography featured on a fan web site credits the 
workaholic with forty-five entries. Another lists forty-eight..&nbsp; However, Miike 
sets the record straight, stating, &quot;A British writer recently told me that I had 
made fifty-two movies.&nbsp; I was surprised. I don’t start out thinking, let’s make 
a lot of movies.&nbsp; The numbers don’t mean much to me.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Currently, the fast-working talent is piecing 
together another guns ‘n gangsters actioner.&nbsp; However, he’s quick to point out a 
fear of repetition.&nbsp; &quot;Some times, I make love and romance,&quot; Miike explains. 
&quot;Other times, I want to do action movies.&nbsp; Then I feel kind of guilty. Too much 
action.&nbsp; Then I think, maybe I should put action and romance together.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Until this next attempt to graft a fresh face 
onto a familiar genre, Miike’s fans can stock up their collections with two 
recently released DVD’s.&nbsp; American Cinematheque’s digital transfer of <i>
Audition </i>features top-notch packaging, an interview with Miike, director’s 
commentary, photo galleries, and detailed liner notes.&nbsp; Nearly as impressive is 
Media Blasters release of <i>Fudoh: The New Generations</i>.&nbsp; Other Miike titles 
are not as readily accessible, found only through persistent haunting of the 
film festival circuit.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When asked which of his early works would be 
recommended for the uninitiated, Miike is characteristically humble.&nbsp; &quot;Previous 
movies are very good for me,&quot; he stresses, &quot;and they give me good memories.&nbsp; But 
what I want American audiences to see are my <i>next</i> movies.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">From a filmmaker who has played maniacal 
matchmaker to a would-be ballerina and a reluctant human pincushion, while 
stockpiling crumbling cinematic corpses into a cozy, countryside lodge, the sky 
is the limit. </font></p>
