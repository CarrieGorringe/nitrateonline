            the start of <i>Monster's Ball</i>, twelve-year-old Tyrell Musgrove
            (Coronji Calhoun) visits his father on death row. Lawrence (Sean
            Combs) is scheduled to die that night. Tyrell asks why.
            &quot;Because I'm a bad man,&quot; his father tells him, gazing
            steadily into his son's devastated face. &quot;I want you to know
            something,&quot; Lawrence says, leaning forward. &quot;You ain't me.
            You're the best of what I am, that's what you are.&quot; Lawrence's
            wife, Leticia (Halle Berry) is not impressed. She moves from the
            barred window where she's been standing, trying not to see this
            poignant father-son scene. As she sits next to Tyrell, her cigarette
            smoke rises slowly. She just can't warm up to Lawrence, even with
            her boy watching and hoping. After eleven years of visiting her man
            in a cell, she's ready for an ending.</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">But
            it won't come easily. Even after Lawrence's execution -- which the
            film displays in aesthetically arranged detail, intercut with
            Leticia brushing her teeth -- she is haunted by the memory of her
            &quot;bad&quot; man. She's unable to move on, not least because she
            sees in Tyrell, specifically, in his obesity, a lack of control that
            reminds her of Lawrence, a weakness that frightens her. Working as a
            waitress in rural Georgia and about to lose her house because she
            can't make the rent, she deals daily with poverty, racism, and
            meanness. When she comes home to find Tyrell's been sneaking
            chocolate bars again, she beats him, mainly out of fear for what's
            in store for him. &quot;I know,&quot; she says later, in a moment of
            regret and confusion, that if you're &quot;a black man in America,
            you can't be like that.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">What
            she knows only makes Leticia's life harder. Looking for her own
            forms of escape, she drinks too much and works too hard, frets about
            her boy, and eventually, falls into an unlikely relationship with
            Hank (Billy Bob Thornton). At first, this plot turn looks crazy,
            except that you've been following the parallel tracks of the
            characters' lives, and so you know (even if they don't) that they
            are meant to find one another. Slowly, though, the film develops a
            strange logic for the pairing, out of mutual need, that at times
            becomes horrific. <i>Monster's Ball</i> leans heavily on Southern
            Gothic torment and metaphor (for instance, birdcage images to
            suggest, you know, feelings of imprisonment), as well as bizarre,
            though historically framed circumstances, reminiscent of those
            conjured by Faulkner or Flannery O'Connor. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">One
            of these circumstances is &quot;coincidental,&quot; in that way that
            instructional fictions tend to be: unknown to Leticia, Hank is one
            of the guards who oversaw Lawrence's execution. He's also a lifelong
            racist, but as the film has it, he's not a bad man, not cruel or
            disagreeable by nature, but a victim of training, by his father,
            Buck (Peter Boyle), a retired death row guard. When Hank and Buck
            exchange the words they do -- in their bleak living room, the close
            space of the bathroom -- the air between them seems to grow thinner
            by the second (this tension is finely exacerbated by Thornton and
            Boyle, who flawlessly underplay their parts).&nbsp;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">As
            if this recipe of dysfunction isn't enough, the film -- directed by
            Swiss-born Marc Forster and written by Milo Addica and Will Rokos --
            folds in yet another layer, in Hank's son, Sonny (Heath Ledger). He
            has also taken up the family business, but hates it like poison,
            can't find in himself the strength (or hatefulness, as is visible in
            Buck) to be hard. Not only does Sonny make mistakes during the trial
            run (which involves the black guard on duty playing the condemned),
            but also collapses on the way to the electric chair with Lawrence.
            Here you glimpse of Hank's potential compassion for Lawrence, whose
            last minutes of life were obviously disturbed, turned into furious
            invective against his child. Throwing Sonny up against the wall,
            Hank is himself out of control: &quot;You're like a goddamn woman!
            You're like your fucking mother!&quot; That this tirade echoes
            Buck's sentiment about Hank's mother (who killed herself years ago)
            is hardly accidental. For Hank, as for Buck -- and Leticia, for that
            matter -- vulnerability is terrifying.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            parallel is obvious, neat and awful: Sonny, like Tyrell, both
            reflects and repulses his parent, as well as burdened with all kinds
            of meaning, from regional and familial legacies to contemporary
            psychological insights. That's not to say that the sons are the
            film's only symbolic devices: while Lawrence is on his way to
            execution, Leticia and Ty watch a television show about skydiving,
            complete with hurtling point-of-view shots; longtime smoker Buck is
            currently tied to an oxygen tank; and Hank and Sonny use the same
            prostitute, whom they take the same way, from behind. When Sonny
            asks her to &quot;get something to eat&quot; with him, she smiles
            ruefully, not even answering the invitation: theirs is not a
            relationship involving face-to-face conversation. You can't miss it:
            everyone is in some form of freefall, running out of breath and
            time, incapable of intimacy or compassion, that is, weakness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Lucky
            for Hank and Leticia, all these other characters are set up to
            service their trajectory toward one another. Sonny, for one, models
            tolerance for Hank, resisting the example of his father and
            grandfather, absorbing their hatred rather than projecting it back
            outward. When he befriends the two sons of a black neighbor, Ryrus
            (played by hiphop artist Mos Def), Hank is appalled, chasing the
            boys off with a shotgun. Predictably, however, Hank will learn a
            hard lesson from Sonny. And if Hank can't articulate this lesson --
            or appreciate its cost -- he does undergo a fairly miraculous change
            of heart that emerges more clearly from movie conventions (the kind
            that allow viewers to feel all right about themselves) than it does
            from his own nasty background.&nbsp;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">That
            Hank's lesson comes to involve Leticia is the film's most elaborate
            contrivance, allowing &quot;catharsis,&quot; i.e., the raw and
            desperate sex scene that everyone's been talking about, shot from
            behind furniture and doorframes, to indicate, again, their mutual
            desire for escape. Premised on tragedy (two, actually), their
            liaison is about shared pain and need, more than desire, but it
            eases into a tender relationship that actually makes sense, if only
            the set-up for it hadn't been so overcooked. It doesn't help that
            their first night together is introduced with clunkily metaphorical
            dialogue: Hank and Leticia sit in his car outside her place. He
            asks, &quot;You know when you feel like you can't breathe? You can't
            get up from inside yourself, really?&quot; She nods, barely.
            &quot;Do you want to come inside?&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">And
            yet... in spite of its symbolic inelegance and familiar plot
            (wherein the not-really-so-bad man is redeemed by his love for the
            girl he hardly &quot;deserves&quot;), <i>Monster's Ball</i> provides
            extraordinary moments for its actors. These do not include that
            much-remarked sex scene, which, for all its manifest
            &quot;daring,&quot; is not nearly so effective as Berry's quieter
            work with ten-year-old Calhoun, or especially, the film's final
            surprising moments, when she essentially acts a scene by herself,
            even though she shares the frame with Thornton. As Leticia makes a
            silent deal with herself in order, at last, to move on, her story
            comes into focus. And in the end, it is more compelling than those
            of the various bad men who have made it so difficult. <o:p>
