            review by <a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>, 12 April 2001</i></font><p>
            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Are we removed far enough from the 
            events and aftermath of 9/11 to have <i>Big Trouble</i> hoisted upon 
            us? Well, our collective comic soul yearns to say yes, as does Buena 
            Vista, the film's distributor. But there's a lot of angst following 
            this film around -- including the title itself -- one of the 
            numerous cinematic casualties sidelined by the terrorist attacks six 
            months ago. We may have lost friends, family, and a smiley-face 
            conception of well being last fall, but our sense of humor wasn't 
            destroyed when the Twin Towers collapsed. Sure our funny bones were 
            broken and that farcical essence that tickles our ribs was numbed 
            from an extended injection of toxic, terrorist novacaine, but the 
            late night talk/comedy shows, the silly sit-coms, and Tinseltown's 
            reel reality all returned to television and the big screen months 
            ago. We are healing, and it's up to broad comedies like <i>Big 
            Trouble</i> to at least attempt to remedy the cosmic depression that 
            has enveloped our civilized planet. Lord knows that was not the 
            film's original intention -- it's makers just want to put the &quot;p&quot; 
            back in parody and a big, fat grin on our faces.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That's still a tall order 
            considering the film's all about a nuclear bomb tossed about Dade 
            County like lost luggage. Listen, if Drew Carey can make us scream 
            with desperate absurdity at airport security just a week or so ago, 
            the multiplex masses should be able to handle an extended version of 
            basically the same joke. Unfortunately for director Barry Sonnenfeld, 
            I suspect <i>Big Trouble</i> will just be an asterix on a generally 
            glowing resume; a coulda, shoulda, woulda hit that didn't because of 
            extenuating circumstances beyond the filmmaker's pre-release 
            horizon. History will write it off as middle tier, below his 
            bonafide hits <i>Men in Black</i>, <i>Get Shorty</i>, and <i>The 
            Addams Family</i>, yet miles above the mechanical tripe of <i>Wild, 
            Wild West</i>. Yeah, it's funny, but…</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As sure as I read syndicated 
            Pulitzer Prize-winner Dave Barry's absurdist humor ever Sunday, I 
            expected most of his wacky literary bite to be up there in Robert 
            Ramsey and Matthew Stone's adaptation of Barry's implausibly 
            entertaining novel, very reminiscent of the classic work of Jean 
            Sheperd. And it is. The screenwriters have proven the third time's 
            nearly the charm, having previously failed with <i>Life</i> (Eddie 
            Murphy and Martin Lawrence) and <i>Destiny Turns on the Radio</i> 
            (Dylan McDermott and Quentin Tarantino). Although the film succeeds 
            more because of Sonnenfeld's quick pacing and his handling a cast 
            that relishes in their off-beat characters. He uses an easygoing 
            flashback technique that fills in the comedic anguish behind each of 
            the many characters. The only down factor in the show is the 
            post-9/11 weirdness of the comic atomic core the bedevils the 
            project in the guise of a mysterious metal suitcase. For those of us 
            old enough to remember, the basso vacuum-sealed escape of air from 
            this particular case sounds very much like it was lifted from Robert 
            Aldrich's <i>Kiss Me Deadly</i>, a marvelously effective film noir 
            piece also dealing with nuclear material encased in a similar 
            container. Sonnenfeld is also inclined to borrow sparingly from 
            Kubrick's <i>Dr. Strangelove</i>. So what, it works.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Tim Allen, fresh of his holiday 
            disappointment <i>Joe Somebody</i>, returns with the same type of 
            character, an amiable, recently divorced parent in search of respect 
            from his child and co-workers. His nemesis last Christmas was 
            Patrick Warburton (who teamed with Sonnenfeld on the short-lived Fox 
            tv series <i>The Tick</i>) returning as a tickish, off-focused 
            police officer out to impress the ladies. A dozen other cast members 
            create a group of whacky pairings whose paths more than 
            coincidentally criss-cross through the streets of Miami and 
            ultimately on the roadways leading to its airport. Rene Russo, 
            married to a womanizing toe-lint-fetishist and crooked business 
            executive (Stanley Tucci) finds comfort in the arms of Allen. Their 
            teenage kids, Ben Foster and Zooey Deschanel, are embroiled in a 
            game of Killer, involving a night time squirt from a water pistol. 
            Two New Jersey hit men (Dennis Farina and Jack Kehler) contracted to 
            take out Tucci, get confused in the kid's gunplay.Tucci is involved 
            with a couple of Russian arms dealers whose lowlife bar is 
            frequented by a pair of dumb and dumber ex-cons (Tom Sizemore and 
            Johnny Knoxville) and Jason Lee, a homeless saviour just in from 
            Boston. He ends up in a tree house with a bleacher seat view of the 
            action. His assigned partner is a sexy housekeeper (Sofia Vergara). 
            Janeane Garfalo is the deeply-tanned, hardnosed cop (she's a real 
            sparkplug) assigned to the aforementioned Warburton. Omar Epps and 
            Dwight &quot;Heavy D&quot; Myers seriously ham it up as overbearing FBI agents 
            pushing special executive order 678-04 as their iron fist in search 
            of the aluminum valise. There's also a dirt-eating, crotch-enamored 
            dog and a stationary toad that emits hallucinogenic secretions.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sure, there's a lot of fun, idiotic 
            stuff, plenty of action, one-liners, and bloated buffoonery. And 
            some great goat stunt work. But a Godzilla-sized change in our 
            sensibilities, in our everyday lives and in the way we travel, will 
            make this film a struggle for audiences to accept as it tries to 
            swim upstream in today cautionary currents. And with today's fickle 
            audiences, that can be turn <i>Big Trouble</i> into big trouble.</font></td>
