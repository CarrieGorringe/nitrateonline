            Grubman (Aaron Stanford) heads home from prep school for
            Thanksgiving full of anticipation. As he rides the train with his
            classmate Charlie (Robert Iler), they lay out typical fifteen-year-old
            plans -- Oscar has a particular girl in mind, someone, he says, he's
            &quot;known for a while.&quot; He won't say her name, but drops that
            she'll be at the Upper East Side party hosted by his father, Stanley
            (John Ritter), a Columbia Asian history professor. As it turns out,
            she has good reason to be there: she's the co-host, dad's wife, Eve
            (Sigourney Weaver). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            crush is wholly understandable. Eve is wonderful in every way, a
            medical researcher who specializes in the workings of the (so
            metaphorical) heart. Witty, warm, and beautiful, she even moves in
            poetic slow motion as Oscar gazes on her from across the room,
            removing her red cashmere scarf as if it's a heavenly vestment. She
            is also, to Oscar's keen eye, slightly melancholy, unfulfilled in
            some vague way. Her best friend Diane (wonderful, sharp Bebe
            Neuwirth) confirms Oscar's feeling when she observes that Eve has a
            &quot;void, something missing.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Determined
            to prove he's the one to fill that void, Oscar is at first
            frustrated by serial distractions (Eve has other people to talk to,
            Stanley sets him up with a colleague's daughter), until, at
            evening's end, he takes himself to a bar to drown his sorrow. The
            bartender serves him and a lovely young woman hits on him. In
            another movie, we'd probably be deep inside Oscar's fantasy-world
            here, but that's not quite the case in <i>Tadpole</i>. As written by
            Heather McGowan and Niels Mueller and directed by Gary Winick (who
            made the under-seen <i>The Tic Code</i>), this look at one teen's
            ostensibly urgent desires takes a mostly blithe approach. The boy's
            perspective shapes his world, and the movie never asks that he -- or
            you -- question that perspective. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">When
            Oscar, precocious and privileged, sees his life collapsing around
            his ears, the film takes his point of view, with appropriate and
            convenient embellishments. When it's convenient to abandon that
            point of view -- to reinforce it -- the movie does that too. And
            when it looks as though Oscar's perspective might possibly need
            adjusting -- like maybe he's not quite the answer to dissatisfied
            forty-ish women's sexual and emotional longings -- well, the movie
            doesn't allow for that possibility at all. Oscar is that answer,
            because the women in the movie only exist to make him seem so. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            begins when, on his self-pitying way home from the bar, he runs into
            Diane, who takes him home to sober up. A chiropractor, she has a
            table in her apartment. She also happens to have borrowed Eve's red
            scarf, the one that so paused Oscar's heart earlier that evening. As
            he rests on the table, his face hanging down through the head-hole,
            he glimpses the scarf; it appears from his point of view, frame,
            deliriously alluring. His back only partly unknotted, Oscar lurches
            to his feet, leans heavily against Diane, and before you know it,
            they're in bed. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Oscar
            is unsurprisingly mortified in the morning: he has one of those
            standard roll-over-in-bed-and-spot-your-lover's-face moments, his
            eyes pop open, and he essays an escape, only to run into &quot;Phil,
            the boyfriend&quot; in her kitchen. Double entendres linking sex to
            chiropractics ensue. Oscar swears Diane to secrecy, believing news
            of the tryst will ruin his chances with Eve. The rest of the film
            follows his efforts to contain Diane's relatively lackadaisical
            attitude and flirt with Eve. Stanley remains mostly on the
            sidelines, until a father-son heart-to-heart reveals to them both
            that perhaps they need to talk more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            assuming Oscar's perspective, the film makes out like everyone is as
            smitten with him as he is, admiring his perfect French (his unseen
            mother is French, living in France, &quot;exotic&quot;), his
            charming gravity, his self-righteousness, and his predilection for
            Voltaire, whom he quotes often and the film quotes even more often,
            in preciously ironic inter-titles, as in, &quot;Every man is guilty
            of all the good he didn't do,&quot; or again, &quot;Reason consists
            of always seeing things as they are.&quot; Diane introduces him
            round to her girlfriends as a delightful confection, unusually
            passionate, suitably deferential, and, apparently, a good lay. Oscar
            sits among them during a brunch, holding forth on some deep
            philosophical point, or at least a point that seems deep to a
            fifteen-year-old. The women cluck and coo; one gives him her number.
            <o:p>

            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Just
            why women who appear to be accomplished and independent might find
            this self-doting child so enchanting is a question the film can't
            ask, because it's a question that does not occur to Oscar. And such
            moments, however self-conscious, only underline its too-cuteness, as
            do various set-pieces (cleverly shot, intimate and also elusive, on
            digital video by Hubert Taczanowski): Oscar and Eve discuss poetry
            and passion in her lab, with repeated references to &quot;the
            heart&quot;; the four principals do an upscale restaurant dinner,
            Diane drinking to excess and Oscar so desperate to impress Eve that
            he's glued on sideburns, having heard that she liked Elvis when she
            was younger -- when she kisses him near the bathroom, she returns to
            the table with a sideburn stuck to her face. Of course, the truth
            comes out, voices are raised, and Oscar, so sincere and so
            persistent, almost convinces Eve that he might fill her
            &quot;void.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">While
            Oscar's point of view can encompass poignant and ridiculous moments,
            the film retreats from the emotional edge set by the film to which
            it has been most often compared, <i>The Graduate</i>. In fact, <i>Tadpole</i>
            doesn't leave the comparison to chance: Eve does learn of the
            scandalous liaison and becomes angry at her friend for sleeping with
            Oscar. Diane tries to mollify her, observing, &quot;It's all very <i>The
            Graduate</i>.&quot; Eve snarks back, &quot;Except Oscar hasn't
            graduated.&quot; Yet, despite her protestations, Eve leaves this
            conversation more confused about her own feelings concerning her
            stepson. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            scene stands out (with a couple of others), with action that Oscar
            can't know or witness, but might well imagine. <i>Tadpole</i>
            initially poses provocative questions about relationships or
            responsibilities: is Oscar &quot;an adult, or close enough,&quot; as
            Diane says? Are middle-aged women so needy that a fifteen-year-old
            looks good? Is Stanley as clueless as he seems? But rather than
            letting them hang, disturbingly, it falls back on an attitude more
            smug than challenging. Worst of all, it closes with Oscar back on
            the train to school, reconciled with a future involving girls
            &quot;his own age.&quot; If this is the primary lesson he's learned,
            it only highlights how shallow he's been all along. And when the
            movie closes on this cozy image, accompanied by Bowie's
            &quot;Changes,&quot; no less, it highlights just how shallow it's
            been, as well. <o:p>
