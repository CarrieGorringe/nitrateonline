            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">After
            <i>Collateral Damage</i>, you might imagine that most every
            aggrieved father cliché has been unturned. But no. Here comes Nick
            Cassavetes' anti-HMO manifesto, <i>John Q</i>, in which a guy who is
            actually named John Q (Archibald -- at least the writers stopped
            short of actually naming him Public) battles the powers that be to
            save his young son's life. &quot;When people are sick,&quot; he
            asserts, his gun aimed at the ER patients, doctors, and Rent-a-Cop
            he's taken hostage, &quot;They deserve a little help!&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Who
            would disagree? Well, okay, the obvious answer is those (few or
            many, depending on how you count) politicians, administrators,
            insurance companies, and doctors whose resistance to any actual
            change in the current U.S. health care system allows the absurdity
            to go on. Unfortunately, <i>John Q</i> doesn't presume that you see
            this obvious answer, and goes on to instruct you as to the evil of
            this system, with several dialogue explications and one-line
            exhortations (&quot;The hospital's under new management now!&quot;)
            sprinkled amidst its reductive ongoing crisis of a plot. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">This
            crisis begins with a disease-of-the-weekish bang: hardworking,
            big-hearted John (Denzel Washington) and his virtuous,
            not-quite-infinitely patient wife Denise (Kimberly Elise) are
            watching their beautiful six-year-old, Mikey (Daniel E. Smith), play
            baseball. Just as the kid is rounding to second, the camera takes a
            slightly low-angle view and fairly screeches into slow-motion: kid
            grabs chest, dust flies, kid's eyes go up in his head, ka-bam, kid
            hits the dirt. Camera cuts to John, hurtling over the bleachers to
            the field. Seconds later, Mikey's at the hospital and doctors are
            shaking their heads, pushing the hysterical parents outside the ER
            window, to watch the doctors attach the usual array of wires and
            needles and tubes to the child. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">In
            your mind, this is a fiercely terrifying event. In <i>John Q</i>,
            it's more pedestrian, despite the fact that Washington's undeniable
            decency invites not only sympathy, but also some desire for a
            specifically raced and classed payback. He's fighting an
            overwhelmingly white-looking system here, and that frames his
            struggle in a particular way. When John aims his gun at the smarmy
            white doctor's expensively outfitted neck, the moment generates some
            audience energy. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">But
            the movie can't follow through on this plot or political point, and
            instead falls back on the &quot;universal&quot; problem represented
            by the Archibalds' case. To this point, you've seen that John and
            Denise are decent and dedicated working class folks, in a ten-minute
            set-up sequence that shows John's car being repossessed, his failed
            effort to get a second job (because he's &quot;overqualified&quot;),
            Denise (in her grocery clerk uniform) worrying about their finances,
            their beat pickup truck, and bodybuilder Flex Wheeler fan Mikey
            offering dad his saved-up allowance. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">After
            Mikey's in the hospital, the movie piles on every anti-corporate
            platitude it can think of, including the one where Denise and John
            are herded into a humungo, icy-bluish conference room with their
            kid's chest x-rays decorating the walls. Across a table that's about
            ten feet wide, they face the prickly, cold-eyed hospital
            administrator, Rebecca Payne (played by the scary Anne Heche), whose
            very name indicates the grief she will be inflicting on the
            Archibalds. And, in case you need more evidence that the hospital is
            a Den of Evil, Payne is accompanied by designer-suited, sycophantic
            heart surgeon Dr. Turner (played by King of Weasels James Woods),
            whose name is similarly weighty, as he will be the first of the
            villains to change his thinking. As John looks on in horror, Payne
            and Turner announce that a heart transplant is Mikey's only chance
            to live, but that he and Denise have no insurance and so, should
            just settle for a few more &quot;quality of life&quot; weeks with
            their boy. Denise collapses. John <i>apologizes</i> to the white
            folks for his display of distress. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">As
            if this is not painful enough, the film lays on more abuse of the
            Archibalds. Next comes the predictable montage of scenes where John
            tries desperately to raise the necessary $250,000, or at least the
            $75,000 down payment that Ice Queen demands for their Cash Account
            (she spits out the words like a viper). He sells the refrigerator,
            pickup truck, TV, etc., he passes the plate at church, he takes help
            from his best friends (David Thornton and Laura Harring, Naomi
            Watts' girlfriend in <i>Mulholland Drive</i>, here with two lines,
            maybe). But the mighty effort fails, as it must for the movie to
            push on to its next step in the persistent crisis plot. A turning
            point occurs when Denise, who has been spending her time at
            increasingly feeble but ever-brave little Mikey's bedside, learns
            that the hospital is releasing him (due to underpayment of bills,
            which can only be a few days late...). She calls John to tell him
            the terrible news, and when he tells her, as he has before, that
            he'll &quot;take care of it,&quot; she gets mad at him, her only
            available target: &quot;Do something!&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Now
            quite up against it, John finds his own target. Lucky for him (and
            very unlucky for you), this Chicago hospital has a wholly
            ineffectual security system, so that he can load up a bunch of
            chains and locks, not to mention a gun and bullets into his
            backpack, enter the hospital, and take Turner hostage, along with
            several other characters who happen to be in the waiting area. This
            group might pass for a short course in Stereotypes 101: Latina with
            Child (Martha Chaves), Barbie-Beater (Shawn Hatosy), Beaten Barbie
            (Heather Wahlquist), Pregnant Couple (female Troy Beyer and male
            Troy Winbush), Inept But Very Nice Security Guard (Ethan Suplee),
            Young and Idealistic ER Doctor (Rick Sood), and oh yes, Funny Black
            Guy (Eddie Griffin). That's just on the inside. Arrayed outside are
            the Plastic-Haired Reporter (Paul Johansson) and The Cops, including
            Aging Negotiator (Robert Duvall), Egotistical Chief (Ray Liotta),
            Gopher Sergeant (Obba Babatunde), and Sniper (Frank &quot;I'm With
            the Director&quot; Cassavetes). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">While
            you might think that this list of caricatures marks the limit of <i>John
            Q</i>'s bad ideas, you would be wrong. The crowd that gathers
            outside becomes the Public whom John represents (mercifully, they
            stop short of yelling, &quot;Attica! Attica!&quot;): their support
            for John, who is, you know, an apparently very upset man with a gun,
            becomes especially touchy when the TV people get involved. When they
            patch into the police video feed and start broadcasting the cops'
            attempt to use a sniper to take John out, the crowd (and presumably
            viewers at home) find one more reason to hate their 5-0. (That the
            cops apparently have no concept that this image appears on live
            television is only one among many plot holes.) Trying to control the
            situation, Negotiator calls Rebecca Payne to come down to the site
            -- on her Day Off! -- and has her try to calm Denise (how anyone
            would think that Payne is the person to do this remains a mystery). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Inside
            the hospital, the Young and Idealistic ER Doctor gets into a debate
            with Turner about medical industry-insurance company collusions
            (&quot;The HMOs pay the doctors not to test... to save
            money!&quot;). Turner has a little moment of rage (&quot;I've heard
            all the bitching and moaning I can stand for one day!&quot;), just
            before he's called on to save a gunshot victim, rolled into the ER
            all bloody and you know, dying. Though Turner says he can't do it
            (he's a heart surgeon, Jim, not a doctor!), he performs brilliantly
            -- or at least that's what Young and Idealistic ER Doctor exclaims.
            When mutual respect is restored, apparently, everyone starts to
            think John has the right idea here. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Really,
            this back-and-forth just makes you want to shoot all of them. Where <i>is</i>
            Arnold when you need him? <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Eventually,
            of course, the heart transplant must actually be performed. You
            can't go through such agony and education and kill off the kid. Some
            question arises as to just how this will occur. John offers to
            donate his own heart for Mikey (shades of Denzel's very own,
            best-forgotten, peculiar romantic comedy, <i>Heart Condition</i>),
            but all the while, the film has been setting up for the miracle he's
            praying for. Swinging into high bizarro gear, <i>John Q</i> takes
            you back and back again to the very first scene. This scene features
            a lovely young woman cruising along in her white Beemer on a
            mountain road. You see close-ups of her mouth, the rosary and
            crucifix on her rearview mirror, her hand, and of course, her donor
            bracelet, but you never see her face (so you don't feel too, too
            badly when she bites it). With &quot;Ave Maria&quot; on the
            soundtrack, Anonymous Bad Driver heads into the slo-mo that
            characterizes movie miracles, slamming her car into a truck: voila!
            she's a donor. And so, you see, rich folks do give back to the
            community after all. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Though
            you see Anonymous Bad Driver smashed up at the start of the film,
            there remains a glimmer of doubt. Her blood type and all other
            specifics will no doubt match Mikey's, but you are left to wonder
            whether her organs will harvested and shipped out fast enough to
            preclude John's suicide. The film proceeds to lay on the
            crosscutting tension as thickly as it can. So... maybe you'll be
            surprised.<o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">And
            still, after all this contrivance and weirdness, <i>John Q</i>
            absolutely outdoes itself in the closing moments, when, under the
            guise of promoting its populist hero, it comes up with what has to
            be the creepiest movie moment in recent memory. In a closing
            round-up of anti-HMO in-the-news rhetoric, including Hillary
            Clinton, Gloria Allred, and Bill Maher, Ted Demme appears, not even
            talking, but listening to Arianna Huffington sound off on <i>Politically
            Incorrect</i>. What is wrong with this picture? <o:p>
