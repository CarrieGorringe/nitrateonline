            beauty of Mark Romanek's second film, <i>One Hour Photo</i>, rests
            not in its subtle excoriation of the cluelessness of the privileged
            &quot;I want&quot; upper middle class, but in its right-on view of
            the forgotten, taken-for-granted faces who comprise everyday service
            life. Has our inability to &quot;see&quot; those who wait upon us
            daily, helping satiate our consumer lust and ensuring we have all we
            believe we need in our lives, spawned the sociopathy and envy that
            sates the media with news fodder on a day-to-day basis by
            culminating, usually, in a tragic encounter?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>And so what if, as in the case of <i>One Hour Photo</i>, we
            blindly entrust these invisible souls with our private selves -
            whether contained in a roll of film, access to a bank account or the
            purchase of lingerie and sex toys?<o:p>

            Parrish (Robin Williams) knows. He's a perfectionist at what he
            does. For eleven years he's been developing the film for the
            families of customers of the SavMart store. They manage slight
            greetings and forced smiles to this familar staple in their busy
            existences and yet they barely make eye contact while issuing
            demands upon his already pressed schedule.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            Sy has a secret - for nine years he's been fixated on the impossibly
            perfect Yorkins - beautiful mom Nina (Connie Nielsen), handsome dad
            Will (Michael Vartan) and precociously cute son Jakob (Dylan Smith).
            They've been bringing their film to Sy all that time, and he's seen
            this ideal family through the birth of their son, exotic vacations,
            birthday parties, Christmas dinner. And he has quietly made a copy
            of each of their photographs for his own family album - that which
            adorns the wall of the dismal, austere apartment in which he resides
            - alone and lonely.<o:p>

            Yorkins never think of Sy as a threat. He's always impeccably polite
            and willing to bend to their demands. But lately Sy's fantasies have
            been getting the best of him. And when a frissoned crack appears in
            the Yorkin's marriage, and Sy is suddenly dealt his own blow,
            fantasy escalates and Sy feels compelled to correct the
            imperfections in the frames of this family's life that he has had
            such a part in preserving.<o:p>

            is a taut, unnervingly quiet thriller. Romanek uses music sparingly
            and he's shot his film almost as if glimpsing it through a negative.
            There are stark whites, the touches of cyan and blue and red-yellow
            that compose a photograph, and in certain moments of stillness he
            cranks the volume on a phone ringing, to jarring, creepily effective
            ends.<o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            dread builds and builds<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>and
            the film works well as more than a thriller, too. It really peers at
            Sy's pathology - The Yorkins as well - and behind Nielsen's daunting
            allure and Vartan's boyish remoteness roosts a listless unhappiness.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>But the film belongs to Robin Williams and, for one of the
            few times in his career, it allows the comic to transcend his
            formidable persona. Romanek collapses Williams' frenzied,
            over-inflated facade and creates a scarily sympathetic, prissy,
            pissed off and pathetic non-entity who blends into the woodwork<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>and yet cannot really be a part of it. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">He's
            given Williams only a couple of eerily prescient comic seconds, and
            they are so weighted that they're perfectly relevant and meaningful
            within the context of what is happening around the character and
            within his own mind. Sy Parrish finds his place in the world only
            through The Yorkins' seemingly perfect one. But Sy's presence
            exposes more than their film and their marriage; he exposes the
            cracks in social bias and class, to a heightened, open ending in
            which time and perception cannot reverse itself.</font></span><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"></o:p>
