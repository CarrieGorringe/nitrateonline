            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>As Ivan Beckman, an agent in a
            high-powered Los Angeles talent agency, Danny Huston, at one point
            in <i>ivans xtc.</i>, does this wonderful, hop-skip dance through
            the offices where he works, after having gotten an important
            Hollywood star to sign with his agency in order to make a movie of a
            screenplay that everyone -- everyone who has read it -- says is
            awful, or worse. Ivan has been telling everyone the exact opposite
            -- it's possible he hasn't even read the thing at all, and it's
            probably a good thing that he hasn't or else he'd never be able to
            sell the thing. Rather, it's all about getting the star to sign to
            make the movie -- what isn't on the page, Ivan tells his girlfriend
            (who's read the screenplay, and says it's awful, too) will end up on
            the screen. Or so he's led himself to believe. No wonder some people
            in Hollywood are said to have become peeved towards <i>ivans xtc.</i>
            It shows how the agents have taken over the asylum and sucked all
            the quality and integrity right out of commercial cinema, so that it
            is all about power and the making and execution of deals rather than
            about storytelling or making something that has enough legitimacy
            for people to expend the effort to watch it.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The star, Don West, is played by
            Peter Weller as someone who has totally succumbed to this delusional
            and superficial way of living, and he helps to bring a darkly
            comedic quality to the first half of the picture. Don proudly tells
            people that his wife, Yolanda, and kids are completely out and away
            from the industry life; the next, he's snorting cocaine off the
            extended, bare leg of the girl whom he's going to a movie premiere
            with. Don's world has been reduced to movies, drugs, sex, fame, and
            firearms -- he impresses people with what his bodyguard is packing
            -- and Weller plays him as a jolly jester who doesn't even know that
            he's way gone 'round the bend. He doesn't seem to know what's real
            from one moment to the next, but that doesn't make him any less
            powerful or a &quot;star&quot;.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ivan's been living unrealistically,
            too -- he's ignored all the warning signs until, one day, he gets a
            call from his doctor asking him to come in for a consultation, and
            to &quot;bring a friend&quot;. The intimation is immediately
            sobering for Ivan, even more so because he can't find someone to go
            with him (even flirting with the possibility of asking his secretary
            to go). <i>ivans xtc.</i> is based on a Leo Tolstoy novella, <i>The
            Death of Ivan Illyich</i>, written by Tolstoy after he had gone
            through a conversion late in his life and fully embraced a pure,
            aesthetic form of spiritual faith, and the film has evoked the
            present-day Hollywood milieu not so that it can go trawling for the
            purposes of rubbernecking over drug-fueled parties stocked with
            tanned, pneumatically beautiful girls who will do
            &quot;anything&quot;. It's as aggrandizing and self-contained a
            world as the aristocracy must have been at the time Tolstoy wrote
            his story. The movie tips us off at the start that Ivan's death
            amounts to precious little among his colleagues and alleged friends
            when it occurs -- at his agency, there's a moment of silence, then
            &quot;damage control&quot;, and his associates quickly turn to
            bickering over deals that are unraveling.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Danny Huston (son of the director
            John Huston, and a filmmaker in his own right), who gives a
            brilliant, cut-to-the-quick performance, plays Ivan with rounded,
            oracular tones, and puts forward how Ivan has not lost the ability
            to have, to want, true experience, whether it's how the wind passes
            over his hand while he's driving, the moment before he savors the
            first, crisp taste of a freshly-made martini, or the beautiful halo
            that has formed around a full moon in a nigh sky. The film itself
            was made using High Definition Digital video equipment, which
            allowed the filmmakers to work very fast (and to maintain a high
            amount of control over their project), and the results have a &quot;floatey&quot;
            quality which at times looks as if the people and events were moving
            through an aquarium. This actually works in favor of the film
            overall, since the opening images (and I wonder if some of these
            images, with their particular quality, could have been caught on
            conventional celluloid) set the stage for a story that appears to be
            taking place in a luxuriant purgatory (one of the reasons I have not
            settled permanently in the Los Angeles area).</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film closes on a profoundly
            moving note which stresses the need, the importance, for having true
            human contact -- after much suffering, Ivan receives the one genuine
            thing that he needs to put everything into perspective and to also
            become free. Bernard Rose, the UK director who made <i>ivans xtc.</i>,
            and Lisa Enos, who produced the film and co-wrote the screenplay,
            have not forgotten to leave out the human element. It makes this
            feel like the type of movie that the people in the movie would be
            incapable of making, but which is exactly the type of movie which
            needs to exist.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"></o:p>
