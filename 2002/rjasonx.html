            <font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In May, 1980, I walked into an 
            auditorium of the Carillon Square cinemas, in Orem, Utah, and sat 
            down to watch a movie called Friday the 13th. I didn't know much 
            about the movie going in, and I didn't think much about it on the 
            way out. Little did I know that, twenty-two years later, I would be 
            watching Jason X.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jason is, of course, Jason 
            Voorhees, the hulking, unstoppable killing machine with a 
            perpetually bad day, who has gone on to appear in nine, count 'em, 
            nine more pictures. Paramount and, later, New Line kept recycling 
            the same formula, which was stripped of all frills and was 
            relatively inexpensive to make but which kept spelling boffo box 
            office and, in Hollywood, money talks. There was even talk of doing 
            &quot;Jason vs. Freddy&quot;, with that jolly jester Freddy Krugger, who 
            sprung from Jason the same way Jason sprung from Michael Myers in <i>
            Halloween</i>. But, as financially successful as the pictures were, 
            they never gave you anyone to identify with: the pictures demanded 
            that you dissociate yourself from what was occurring to the people 
            on the screen, which is dehumanizing to the moviegoer.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What's amazing about the new 
            picture is not that they've found another way to keep churning out 
            movies with Jason Voorhees in them, but that the filmmakers think 
            the audience will, again, sit still for the same thing, over and 
            over again. People skulk around in the dark; Jason nabs them; others 
            stand around looking stupidly uncomprehending. And just when you 
            think Jason's had it, he's right back up, again. It's repeated 
            ad-infinitum, and it becomes boring beyond belief. The action in the 
            new film is set in the year 2455, and Jason is a cryogenic ice cube 
            about to be thawed out onboard a spaceship, but the plot is 
            virtually the same as it was in the 1980 movie. Rather than take 
            advantage of the futuristic situation---in which, for instance, the 
            customs and habits of people from the twentieth/twenty-first century 
            would seem as quaint as those of twelfth-century Flemish peasants 
            would to us---the filmmakers have actually reduced everything so 
            that they can doggedly adhere to the formula. The cast of characters 
            is mostly made up of teenagers, and they act, talk, and sound just 
            like modern-day teenagers so they won't do anything that could throw 
            the audience off. One character (played by Lexa Doig) from 
            present-day times who was frozen along with Jason is revived, and 
            she's shown taking the news that she's suddenly in the twenty-fifth 
            century as if she's just been informed that her dry cleaning has 
            been delayed. (The one clever note in these early sections: a 
            surprise cameo from David Cronenberg, as the head of the &quot;Crystal 
            Lake Research Facility&quot;.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Further underscoring the overall 
            feeling of recycling&nbsp; are lifts from the first two <i>Alien</i> 
            movies, such as a humanoid android, and a sneaky so-and-so who wants 
            to use Jason for financial gain. (The android, though, is female, 
            and, as played by Lisa Ryder, briefly kicks the movie out of its 
            doldrums when she gleefully takes to the role of warrior woman and, 
            literally, reduces Jason to rubble.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It would make a difference if Jason 
            stood for something more than a block of cement with a knife, but he 
            doesn't: when he's shown falling into another Earth-like 
            environment, like an apple falling in the Garden of Eden, all we can 
            think is, uh, oh, they've just left it open for another sequel. 
            Calling this movie brainless would be paying it a compliment: it's 
            more like entertainment for trolls.</font></td>
