            begins with the ominous declaration that it is &quot;inspired by
            true events.&quot; Uh-oh. Here comes the earnestness.</font></span></b></p>
            <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><font size="2">Tracking the
            rise and fall of Philadelphia street hustler Beans (Roc-A-Fella
            artist Beanie Sigel), <i>State Property</i> has a familiar
            structure, as well as standard bling-bling hiphop dialogue
            (according to the <i>New York Times</i>, it's rated R for
            &quot;nonstop language&quot;), violence, and misogyny (the first
            scene takes place in a strip club, in order to allow slow-motion
            views of women in g-strings dancing with poles). It also raises the
            occasional moral dilemma, but really only in passing, on the way to
            Beans' next abuse of some underling, or said underling's efforts to
            curry favor with the boss by shooting down some enemy on the street
            or in a club.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><font size="2">In his hubris
            and short-sightedness, Beans recalls the <i>original</i> original
            gangsters, like Paul Muni's Tony Camonte in <i>Scarface</i> (Howard
            Hawks 1932) or Jimmy Cagney's Eddie Bartlett in <i>The Roaring
            Twenties</i> (Raoul Walsh 1939). Mean, arrogant, and
            self-righteously ambitious, Beans is less a role model than an
            object lesson, charismatic and compelling to watch almost in spite
            of himself (that said, Sigel has a way to go before he commands the
            screen like a Cagney or Edward G. Robinson). Also like the '30s
            gangster pictures, <i>State Property</i> indicts the environment
            that creates such a monster, including corrupt government agents,
            the local five-o as well as the DEA and FBI. Beans and his ilk can't
            exist (and thrive) without serious assistance from the powers that
            be, and the film makes sure to point out pay-offs and instances of
            official ineptitude.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><font size="2">But for all its
            social and political potential, <i>State Property</i> doesn't end up
            being very inspiring or insightful. Partly, this is a function of
            genre. It's the first feature directed and co-written (with Ernest
            &quot;Tron&quot; Anderson) by Abdul Malik Abbott, who has previously
            directed music videos for Roc-A-Fella artists, as well as the
            straight-to-video <i>Streets Is Watching</i> (which is more an
            &quot;illustration&quot; of Jay-Z's album of the same name than a
            film proper). As you expect, Beans begins the film as a lowly street
            hustler, then makes his way up the neighborhood ladder by having his
            opponents killed off, believing all the time that he's making real
            progress because of all the ice he's rocking.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><font size="2">Beans is
            motivated to make his first move (literally, he wants to move out of
            his mom's house, so he needs &quot;real paper, man&quot;) when he
            and his boy, Baby Boy (Omillio Sparks), witness a brutal and
            outrageously in-the-open shooting by the remarkably poised Blizz
            (Memphis Bleek). Impressed, they chase him down in their SUV, and,
            after he almost shoots their heads off, they recruit him as a
            soldier. &quot;Several weeks later,&quot; the film informs you, the
            trio is off and running.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><font size="2">Their main game
            is drugs, cocaine specifically. Whatever cautionary tale Mario Van
            Peebles and Wesley Snipes thought they were weaving in <i>New Jack
            City</i> way back in 1992, well, maybe these cats just don't watch
            movies much. Or more likely, their sense of Nino Brown and his CMB
            (Cash Money Brothers) is that he's a grand and mesmerizing visionary
            who makes a couple of unfortunate -- and fatal -- mistakes.
            (Besides, Abbott's film certainly doesn't make the cops seem either
            heroic or emotionally complicated, as did Van Peebles'; here the
            detectives are unimaginative bullies, straight-up.) However they
            come up with the idea, Beans, Blizz, and Baby Boy make pact with an
            initialed moniker and everything. (Theirs is ABM, not so cleverly
            short for All About the Money). Beans' signature line -- because
            he's got to have one -- is &quot;You either get down or you lay
            down.&quot; When someone refuses to &quot;get down&quot; (accept
            Beans' terms, pay up, or do what he's told), well then, that someone
            is made to lay down, um, forever.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><font size="2">At first,
            things go easily: Beans' own first hands-on effort involves
            literally beating down one particularly revered street elder who
            refuses to &quot;get down.&quot; Beans' bat goes <i>whomp</i>, the
            guy's blood and brains go splat, and Beans and his cohorts heft the
            body into a nearby dumpster. With that, the camera pulls out to show
            the grimy, back-alley everydayness of the scene, as Beans
            re-composes himself, blood fresh on his white wife-beater. Cut to a
            scene to display his regular &quot;guyness&quot;, in the form of his
            girl, Aisha (Sundy Carter). She likes to shop, and she loves her
            man. Even though she knows his business is brutal, worries that she
            might lose him, and that he spends too much time with his boys,
            smoking dope and drinking Cristal, the fact of the violence doesn't
            bother her per se -- it's what men do, as far as she can tell. At
            least Beans provides a hefty credit card allowance.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><font size="2">Before you know
            it, Aisha bears Beans' daughter, and by the time the daughter is
            having her fifth birthday, Beans is ignoring his woman in favor of
            his business, at the same time that his voice-over is telling you
            that all he cares about his family; more precisely, all he cares
            about is making sure that family has all kinds of loot. This
            situation isn't immediately threatened, but he imagines it is, in
            the form of a rival gangsta, Boss Dame (Damon Dash, the famously
            ruthless Roc-A-Fella exec and Jay-Z running partner, recently best
            known as Aaliyah's grieving boyfriend). The part is basically a
            chance for Dash to show off his comedy skills, in particular when he
            discusses business with <b><i>his</i></b> boss, the laconic
            Untouchable J (Jay-Z Himself, who mostly appears in his nice ride
            and on his cell, his face close up to the camera, knowing he's a
            star and not working it too hard). Where Untouchable J is
            preternaturally relaxed, Dame is a nervous wreck, motor-mouthing his
            way through all possible solutions to the problem posed by Beans,
            until J finally stops him: &quot;Handle it.&quot;&nbsp;</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><font size="2">This handling
            involves the kidnapping and abuse of his boo Aisha, and that's a
            nasty bit of business, revealing that Dame has a really f*cked-up,
            cruel streak, as well as that goofy one. Again, this is not
            precisely news, and neither is Beans' rage in return. What is
            unusual is the film's brief but notable attention to Aisha's
            perspective: when Beans is cold in the face of her traumatic
            experience, and insists that he has to &quot;take care of
            business,&quot; no matter what she wants, the camera positions her
            in the bedroom doorway, small and alone (save for her baby daughter)
            -- she needn't say a word, but it's clear what's important here.
            That is, until the cut to Beans in full-on
            gotta-prove-my-masculinity mode.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><font size="2">Though <i>State
            Property</i> borrows openly from great films that have come before
            -- in addition to the '30s gangster movies and <i>New Jack City</i>,
            it owes something to the Hughes brothers' seminal <i>Menace II
            Society</i> (1993), in particular in Beans' world-weary,
            intermittently painfully self-conscious voice-over, which recalls
            that of Caine (Tyrin Turner). Beans begins by clarifying what's at
            issue here: &quot;Forget about my real name. Everyone calls me
            Beans.&quot; Though he lives in the city &quot; they call Brotherly
            Love,&quot; he sighs, &quot;Ain't no love here. But I'm gonna take
            mine.&quot; With that, you see a snapshot of Beans and his crew,
            most every one of them doomed.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><font size="2">That the '90s
            gangsta genre has long since played itself out is of little concern
            to the up-and-comers, like Abbott, Master P, or the Cash Money
            outfit. (Master P's <i>MP: DA Last Don</i> [1998] and Cash Money's <i>Baller
            Blockin'</i> [2000]&nbsp; are two more straight-to-video
            semi-movies, telling pretty much the same story as Abbot's movies,
            that is, gangster rises, falls, and learns that maybe gold isn't so
            glittery, or something like that). As a point of entry into
            filmmaking (as opposed to video-making?), the hood movie is looking
            a lot like the slasher flick of old. The scripts are formulaic, the
            filmmaking merely adequate, and the acting generally atrocious. A
            key difference between then and now, of course, is that the hood
            moviemakers aren't angry, arty white kids, but angry, arty kids of
            color. That, and the hood movies have access to machinery already in
            place, decent soundtrack material to be sure, but also money. Master
            P, Cash Money (at least before Juvenile left the Williams brothers'
            outfit late last year), and Roc-A-Fella all have in-house production
            companies.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><font size="2">This is a
            somewhat different tack from the one being used by other hiphoppers
            who break into film acting (and producing, writing, and directing,
            in the case of Ices T and Cube). Snoop, Ice Cube, Ice T, Will Smith,
            and P. Diddy Combs have made their moves variously, through
            mainstream studio releases, television series and appearances,
            independent films, and even straight-to-video companies. Between the
            two of them, Snoop and Ice T, along with Kurupt, Fat Joe, Big Pun,
            and others, have a veritable video store shelf full of titles to
            their credit over the past six or seven years -- in genres ranging
            from horror (Ice T's <i>Leprechaun in the Hood</i> [2000] is one of
            my favorites) to war to cops and robbers to hood movies (romantic
            comedies don't seem to appeal to this crew as yet, which may be just
            as well, if you think back on 'NSync-er Lance Bass's 2001 vanity
            project, <i>On the Line</i>).</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="FONT-FAMILY: Verdana"><font size="2">But if the
            strategy is unlike that of other hiphop stars, and if the film has
            not gotten the wide release that Sigel and Roc-A-Fella might have
            once imagined for it, the movie does represent yet another effort to
            crack the established system. And the move to a theatrical release
            (rather than straight to video) is not unprecedented either, as
            Master P's No Limit got there a few years back with <i>I Got the
            Hook-Up</i>, a hood comedy of sorts, which still made sure to
            include the strip-club hoochies, guns, and crew loyalty issues that
            make up the standard dramatic hood movie. Still, the lack of oomph
            in the film doesn't bode well. Though Hype Williams and co-writer
            Nas took the gangsta movie to all kinds of strange (and not entirely
            profitable, by studio and distributor standards) places in <i>Belly</i>,
            the film deconstructed the genre in ways that repay repeat viewings.
            Abbott and his crew seem content to rehearse what's come before
            pretty much intact. As the slasher phenomenon showed (and continues
            to show), it does help to exhibit some ingenuity, to extend yourself
            beyond what you think you know.</font></span><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"> <o:p>
