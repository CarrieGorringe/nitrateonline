            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Somewhere between the glorious 
            1990s that was <i>Seinfeld</i> and the presumed 
            somewhere-way-down-the-road sequel <i>I'm Telling You for the Last 
            Time, Again</i> (HBO, April 29, 2029, coincidentally Jerry's 
            seventy-fifth birthday -- set your VCR now) lies the quaint 
            amusement <i>Comedian</i>. Sure, there are a fair sampling of laughs 
            over the course of this eighty-one-minute survey of the stand-up 
            comedic landscape that was once, and will be again, conquered by the 
            Man Who Would Be Funny. It won't bust your gut -- and it's not 
            intended to -- it's merely a blandly cinematic surgical examination 
            (if this documentary was really bad I would have used the word 
            autopsy) of what makes a joke a joke. Inspiration begets concept 
            leads to delivery with aim of laughter, yet even the best laid comic 
            equation can fall prey to an ambivalent audience.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Director Christian Charles, who 
            co-developed the successful American Express campaign with you know 
            who, makes his feature film debut with <i>Comedian</i>, a digital 
            video excursion in which he and producer Gary Streiner follow 
            Seinfeld's year-plus rebirth as a stand-up comic. We observe him 
            experiment with new material, flub his delivery, and still catch 
            himself with the professional aplomb we have grown to admire in him. 
            We catch glimpses of his act at various venues around New York City, 
            including The Comic Strip, where he was the master of ceremonies 
            back in the late 1970s, the Gotham Comedy Club, the Comedy Cellar, 
            Carolines, and plenty of others. He's on stage and off, dealing with 
            hecklers (&quot;Is this your first gig?&quot;) and schmoozing and boozing with 
            friends Colin Quinn (ex of <i>Saturday Night Live</i>) and Chris 
            Rock. Quinn's got some great material about germ-infested 
            refreshments at the movie theater and the staff that puts them there 
            (&quot;They piss in the ginger ale.&quot;). [Reminder: Ask my son, who works 
            at the AMC Fenway Park, about this.]</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And we suffer through the brash, 
            arrogant, self-absorbed, and extremely insecure manic-depressive 
            Orny Adams, a thirty-something, up-and-coming comedian who falls 
            under the wing of George Shapiro, Seinfeld's manager, who's 
            obviously intent on getting his client exposure here at any cost. 
            For Orny (who calls their kid Orny?) it's been nearly a decade 
            trying (heck, it took Seinfeld nearly as long before he got his big 
            break on television), but his anger at the lack of celebrity the 
            world owes him is a real let down. As for his comedy, he hits, he 
            misses, but look, Ma, he's in a movie! Sure he's brutally honest on 
            himself (&quot;It's painful watching yourself on tape.&quot;), but just as 
            jealous of the next humorist who may have had a better night. The 
            audience responded with a cumulative &quot;get a life,&quot; accepting his 
            participation in the film as overly generous. He should have been in 
            less of the movie, frankly. The filmmakers should have used the 
            Google-gauge: Orny gets 168 hits in that well-known Internet search 
            engine, Jerry gets about 80,500.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thankfully, when Jerry's doing his 
            unassuming shtick as he approaches the half-century mark (been 
            there, done that, it's not funny, or is it?), and when it's going 
            well, the punchlines hit like waterbombs exploding on a hot city 
            sidewalk. There are flitting glimpses of other comic greats that 
            Seinfeld has admired: thinking man's comedian Robert Klein, NBC 
            staple Jay Leno, the intelligently witty Gary Shandling a.k.a. <i>
            Larry Sanders</i>, and the comedian's comedian Bill Cosby, revered 
            by Seinfeld when he visits him in Newark in between two 
            two-and-one-half-hour shows. Klein's stint is brief but divine, 
            relating his displeasure with the state of Florida. Having sent two 
            good sixty-five-year-old parents there, then, boom, thirty years 
            later, they're dead!</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Director Charles doesn't let the 
            film slide, adequately gluing together action from on stage to back 
            stage to off stage, showing us the evolution of a comedy as stand 
            up. It's quite amusing to hear Jerry talk &quot;shop&quot; with his fellow 
            entertainers, griping about pacing, the curse of a poor memory, the 
            trepidation of using rookie material before it ripens, and zinging a 
            successful opening bit.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A classic soundtrack including John 
            Mayall (<i>Room to Move</i>), The Band (<i>When I Paint My 
            Masterpiece</i>), Steely Dan (<i>Deacon Blues</i>), Allman Brothers, 
            Traffic, and other great bands rocks constantly in the background, 
            without overwhelming the film. Nice touch.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Comedian</i> is ultimately a 
            home movie about a family of comics (Jerry's wife and infant make 
            cameo appearances) and the trials and tribulations they (well mostly 
            Jerry) experience &quot;growing up&quot; and hitting the road, be it the 
            streets of the Big Apple, Washington, DC's Improv Comedy Theater, 
            Cleveland, Tempe, L.A., Hermosa Beach, and West Orange, New Jersey. 
            What do we learn in the end? That Jerry Seinfeld is a man humble in 
            his celebrity, yet a consummate professional who takes his job very 
            seriously. Preparing for months before nailing a &quot;comeback&quot; spot on 
            the Letterman Show, he makes us laugh at nothing. That's quite a 
            talent.</font></td>
