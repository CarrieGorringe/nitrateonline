            review by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 4 October 2002</i></font><p class="MsoNormal">
            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Despite all of the time and energy 
            he places into his animated movies, Japanese writer-director Hayao 
            Miyazaki half-jokingly advises his fans to watch his movies only 
            once so they won’t miss out on the other things that life has to 
            offer. His request is somewhat ironic because his movies, especially 
            his last two: <i>Princess Mononoke</i> and <i>Spirited Away</i>, 
            often take a few viewings to really appreciate. </font></b></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">A lot of <b><i>
            anime</i></b> is made rather quickly and cheaply, whereas Miyazaki 
            and his legion of animators and computer artists can take years and 
            considerable sums of money. The effort is reflected in just about 
            every frame in <i>Spirited Away</i>. Although some of the characters 
            in the latest film have the “Manga eyes” or the exaggerated peepers 
            associated with Japanese cartoons, there’s an expressiveness and 
            attention to detail that’s missing from most animated films from any 
            country. Even the clouds in some of background paintings are 
            breathtaking to behold. Because of his long history as an animator 
            (he toiled in that profession since 1963 before helming his own 
            films starting in 1979’s <i>The Castle of Cagliostro</i>), it’s a 
            given that <i>Spirited Away</i> is going to look great. Still, much 
            of the reason that <i>Spirited Away</i> is Japan’s current all-time 
            box office champ and tied with <i>Bloody Sunday </i>for top prizes 
            at this year’s Berlinale is because Miyazaki is also an engaging and 
            subtle storyteller. <i>Spirited Away</i> is a wonderous tale for 
            grade schoolers that never condescends or spoon feeds its themes. 
            Miyazaki’s characters and situations are so engaging that he can 
            condemn greed and environmental negligence without ever sermonizing.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Considering how 
            surreal the film gets as it progresses, it’s odd that the 
            protagonist in his latest adventure is bored ten-year-old named 
            Chihiro (voiced in the American release by Daveigh Chase, who was 
            the human half of <i>Lilo and Stitch</i>). The girl is reluctantly 
            joining her parents as they move to a new town. Dad and Mom (Michael 
            Chiklis and Loren Holly) try to make the long, dull journey seem 
            more like an adventure, but Chihiro doesn’t buy it.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If Chihiro seems 
            apathetic, it may be because her folks are a bit foolish. Her 
            father’s undue fondness for shortcuts lands then in front of bizarre 
            abandoned buildings that look like an abandoned amusement park, 
            symptomatic of the Japanese “Bubble Economy,” which burst in the 
            early 1990s. Chihiro senses they should leave, but her parents 
            wander around and start gorging on some fresh, tasty morsels that 
            just seem to be lying around. Dad figures that his cash and credit 
            cards can easily cover the expense.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As darkness 
            falls, Chihiro abruptly learns that the resort is actually open for 
            business but for a clientele of strange spirits. She tries to warn 
            her parents but finds that their appetites for the divinely intended 
            morsels have literally turned them into pigs.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Merely keeping 
            herself alive, much less rescuing her parents from the spell, proves 
            to be an enormous challenge. Chihiro’s struggle also allows 
            Miyazaki’s delightfully warped imagination to go into overdrive. 
            From this point on, the screen is filled with fascinatingly odd 
            spirits, magicians and other creatures, and unpredictability is the 
            norm. Chihiro’s closest ally is a fellow named Haku (Jason Marsden), 
            who looks like a human one minute and a dragon the next. She gets 
            more help from an initially dismissive furnace operator named Kamaji 
            (Disney veteran David Ogden Stiers). With eight rubbery limbs, the 
            fussy creature gives new meaning to word “multi-tasking.” All of 
            them must answer to a demanding, unsympathetic witch named Yubaba 
            (Suzanne Pleshette). Yubaba has a unique way of making sure that 
            workers follow their contracts. To bind employees to their word, she 
            steals their names and even magically lifts the name from both the 
            page and the worker’s memory.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">While all of 
            these characters except for Chihiro are exotic, Miyazaki’s real gift 
            is the way in which he can give them dynamic, three-dimensional 
            personalities. It’s a pleasure to watch Chihiro grow from a spoiled 
            sulker into a courageous and thoughtful girl. Similarly, a masked 
            creature named No Face wavers between helpfulness and extreme 
            gluttony (he eats attendants with the food), then reveals himself to 
            be something entirely different. Commonly, animated movies and even 
            most live action films have characters who are simply good or evil, 
            and resolutions are reached only when one or the other triumphs 
            (say, the Coyote falling off a cliff in pursuit of the Road Runner). 
            Miyazaki’s approach, especially in his later movies, is refreshing 
            because he presents characters who are not inherently good or evil 
            but are driven by and occasionally learn from their choices.&nbsp; </font>
            </p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">That’s not to say 
            the exoticism in <i>Spirited Away</i> isn’t welcome. Jaw-dropping 
            images come by the score. Keep an eye out for a lamp that literally 
            leads people to their destinations (it’s an inside joke, a nod to 
            Pixar veteran John Lasseter who was Executive Producer on the 
            English dub). There’s even a spirit who is so dirty that the grunge 
            on his skin includes a washing machine and an entire bicycle. Fans 
            of Miyazaki’s <i>My Neighbor Totoro</i> might even notice that the 
            magical soot balls who load the bathhouse furnace in <i>Spirited 
            Away</i> look a bit like the dust bunnies in the earlier film.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The thought, 
            imagination and sense of wonder that dominate Miyazaki’s movies are 
            sorely needed in any country’s films. Because of his talent and 
            appeal, Miyazaki has often been called “Japan’s Walt Disney.”&nbsp; The 
            term is an insult to both men. Disney was an outsider whose 
            innovations gradually led him to dominate animation. Miyazaki 
            learned his craft through the studio system. Uncle Walt could draw 
            but gradually delegated the animation and the nuts-and-bolts 
            filmmaking to people like Ub Iwerks. Miyazaki, on the other hand, 
            pens his own stories, designs the characters, directs and even 
            personally proofs and corrects much of the animation. 
            Philosophically, Miyazaki has also questioned the attitudes in 
            Disney’s movies. On <i>Cinderella</i>, he has mused, “I felt bad for 
            the evil stepsisters. Couldn’t they be a little prettier? It would 
            have appeared much more tragic if her sisters had been more charming 
            and the prince had to choose among them.”</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thankfully both 
            animation gurus share a refusal to treat animation as a simple 
            novelty and eagerly push the limits of the technology and the 
            content of the stories. The company that bears Walt’s name would do 
            the legacy of both men a favor if they would release more of 
            Miyazaki’s films here in the States. Disney has the American rights 
            for Miyazaki’s Studio Ghibli films but has chosen to delay releasing 
            them. This is a shame because <i>Castle in the Sky</i> and other 
            wonderful titles are currently only available through imports and 
            bootlegs. As any <b><i>anime</i></b> buff will tell you, Disney is 
            not only disappointing fans but denying themselves and Studio Ghibli 
            money because fan substitutes will proliferate as long as legitimate 
            copies are unavailable.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The new American 
            release of <i>Spirited Away</i> is a firm step in the right 
            direction. Director Kirk Wise (<i>Beauty and the Beast</i>) and 
            writers Cindy David Hewitt and Donald H. Hewitt have made a solid 
            English dub that helps explain some of the Japanese cultural 
            idiosyncrasies and sounds like believable conversational English (Chihiro’s 
            last line is a riot). Unlike <i>Princess Mononoke</i>, where the 
            celebrity voices wound up distracting from the characters (hey, 
            isn’t that Billy Bob Thornton?), the voice talents here are familiar 
            but lesser known and more appropriately fit the characters. If 
            Disney applies this care to the rest of the Ghibli canon, animation 
            lovers in States will finally be able to understand why the rest of 
            the world has been raving about Miyazaki’s films.</font>
