            review by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 18 October 2002</i></font><p>
            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">In his best movies, the late Polish 
            director Krzysztof Kieslowski would sometimes reach gloomy 
            conclusions and yet leave a viewer feeling pleased and even a bit 
            awed. There was something weirdly touching about watching an 
            incarcerated Julie Delpy waving to the husband who put her there as 
            an act of revenge in <i>Three Colors: White</i>.&nbsp; Kieslowski had 
            announced his retirement after he had completed <i>Three Colors: Red</i>, 
            but he his co-writer Krzysztof Piesiewicz stared developing scripts 
            for another trilogy based around the themes of Heaven, Hell, and 
            Purgatory. Kieslowski didn’t live to make any of these films.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like a lot of Kieslowski admirers, 
            I was excited when I heard that <i>Heaven</i> was actually going 
            into production. While the resulting film is a sincere and committed 
            effort, it doesn’t have the cohesion or the subtlety that came with 
            the movies Kieslowski directed himself. &nbsp;It’s a movie that I wish I 
            could have liked more. <i>Heaven</i> looks great (a given 
            considering Tom Tykwer of <i>Run Lola Run</i> and <i>The Princess 
            and the Warrior</i> has directed it), and features some riveting 
            performances. It also tackles some weighty and urgent subject 
            matters that most filmmakers would be afraid to touch. Considering 
            the fact that one of the screenwriters is long dead, it’s a little 
            disheartening that it’s one of the few recent films that tries to 
            addresses why some people trust bombs instead of the law to bring 
            about justice.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Cate Blanchett (<i>Bandits</i>) 
            stars as Philippa, a British teacher living in Milan, who takes 
            drastic measures when her students get involved in drugs and her 
            husband overdoses on illicit chemicals from the same supplier. When 
            none of her inquiries about the pusher get any response from law 
            enforcement (he has connections on the inside), she plants a bomb in 
            his trashcan. Instead of stopping the crimes, the bomb winds up 
            killing four innocent people. The cops quickly apprehend her and 
            start grilling her as if she were a hardened terrorist. Filippo 
            (Giovanni Ribisi, <i>The Boiler Room</i>), the police stenographer, 
            who conveniently also speaks English, quickly senses she’s not and 
            starts taking steps to help her escape. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Having similar names, it’s not 
            surprising they share a birthday. One of Kieslowski’s favorite 
            themes was parallel lives. This was especially evident in <i>The 
            Double Life of Veronique</i> and <i>Three Colors: Red</i>. </font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When Kieslowski was directing, 
            though, the movies’ ideas didn’t seem quite so bombastic. Kieslowski 
            kept some of his character interactions in the background as if he 
            were waiting for the viewer to figure out what he was doing. You had 
            to watch his movies a couple of times because the characters would 
            rarely directly address what was happening on the screen. &nbsp;In <i>
            Heaven</i>, Tykwer practically advertises the motifs. As the movie 
            progresses, Blanchett and Ribisi even start to physically resemble 
            each other (the two have to alter their appearances when they run 
            from the authorities). The movie ultimately feels unsatisfying 
            because viewers are given little chance to reach their own 
            conclusions until the almost dreamlike image that closes <i>Heaven</i>. 
            It’s almost as if <i>Heaven</i> were a rough draft of a Kieslowski 
            film. The spare music resembles Zbigniew Preisner’s scores for <i>
            Three Colors</i> and <i>The Decalogue</i>, and Ribisi bears a 
            strange resemblance to Zbigniew Zamachowski, a leading actor in 
            both. It’s hard to tell where and if Tykwer takes over because his
            <i>The Princess and the Warrior</i> has a similar pace. Still, if <i>
            Heaven</i> didn’t have those weird reminders, it wouldn’t feel like 
            an anemic substitute.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While these factors seem to prevent
            <i>Heaven</i> from transcending its roots, Tykwer really hasn’t done 
            anything to be ashamed of here. He coaxes some first-rate work from 
            the leads. Whereas his previous flicks like <i>Run Lola Run</i> 
            bordered on fantasy, <i>Heaven</i> features realistic interrogation 
            sequences. This may be due to the fact that screenwriter Krzysztof 
            Piesiewicz was an attorney for the Solidarity union in Poland, and 
            legal motifs run through much of Kieslowski’s films, particularly in
            <i>Three Colors: Red</i> and <i>A Short Film about Killing</i>. All 
            of these films present a complex picture of the legal system that is 
            both corrupt and yet preferable to vigilantism.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Tykwer is an intriguing filmmaker 
            in his own right, and his creative approach to storytelling seems a 
            bit stifled here. He sometimes reveals the same tale three different 
            ways. While it’s easy to see why he’d be eager to bring a coda to 
            Kieslowski’s legacy, it’s more satisfying when he’s just being 
            himself.</font></td>
