            review by <a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 6 September 2002</i></font><p>
            <font face="Verdana" size="5">Can't stop</font></p>
            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Amy Miller (Shiri Appleby) is a 
            nice girl. Pretty, friendly, and trusting, she's the kind of girl 
            bound to be beleaguered in a psycho-stalker movie, in this case, <i>
            Swimfan</i>. And of course, she has so much to lose: an industrious 
            high school senior, she's got college options (a vaguely noted 
            &quot;Rhode Island&quot; or Berkeley), loyal friends who hang with her by the 
            lockers, an after-school waitressing job to show how she is both 
            hardworking and admirably working-classish. Plus, Amy's got a 
            boyfriend, one she loves and supports completely, because she's just 
            that nice. </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At first this boyfriend, Ben Cronin 
            (Jesse Bradford, of the adorable <i>Clockstoppers</i>), also looks 
            nice: cute and good to Amy, he's a swim team star being scouted for 
            a Stanford scholarship and, after school, dispenses medications at 
            the hospital where his mom works. According to Ben, he owes his 
            current solid standing to Amy, since she helped him through his less 
            nice period, when &quot;a situation with drugs turned into a situation 
            with stealing,&quot; landing him in juvie for 6 months. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Having endured that difficulty, now 
            Amy and Ben plan for their future together, repeating much they love 
            one another. Meanwhile, Giles (<i>The Deep End</i>) Nuttgens' shifty 
            and shadowy camerawork suggests that all this namby-pamby sweetness 
            is about to end. And so: New Girl comes to school, her halo of blond 
            hair, pouty painted lips, and increasingly kohled eyes indicating 
            that she is, indeed, trouble. Madison (Erika Christensen) arrives on 
            the scene just in time to be late for English class and in need of 
            help breaking into her conveniently persnickety locker. Ben obliges, 
            Madison smiles, the filtered light through the hallway windows 
            telegraphs danger! danger! </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A few minutes later, after 
            snuggling guiltily with Amy and swimming some laps, he's headed home 
            in his Jeep. Boom, he nearly hits Madison, who crosses the street in 
            front of him as if out of nowhere. &quot;So sorry!,&quot; he whimpers. One 
            thing leads to another (though it's very hard to tell how, except 
            that Ben must be the most dim-witted nice boy on earth), and soon 
            he's showing her how he swims in the pool at night, she's stripping 
            to her fine underwear, wanting to learn how to swim (pay attention: 
            it will be important later that she doesn't know how). &quot;I have a 
            girlfriend,&quot; he breathes. She presses up against him, and as they 
            have sex up against the pool wall, she makes him say, &quot;I love you,&quot; 
            even if he doesn't &quot;mean it.&quot; Idiot boy does as he's told. </font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While you know his goose is cooked 
            (as he has no bunny), Ben believes that he will be able to forget 
            his one night of pool sex and return to his nice life as if nothing 
            has changed. But Ben will pay dearly for his few minutes of pool 
            sex, as Madison refuses to &quot;be ignored.&quot; And wouldn't you know, his 
            feeble efforts to put off Madison -- &quot;I think that you're 
            misunderstanding our relationship in a very fundamental way&quot; -- only 
            make her more insistent. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">She starts leaving flowers at Ben's 
            locker, calling him at home, paging him when he's in serious 
            discussion with his coach (Dan Hedaya, who mostly looks like he 
            walked into the wrong movie), chatting up Amy at mixers, appearing 
            in the boys' locker room (which is always strangely deserted -- 
            where are all the other jocks at this high school?), and sending 
            lots of emails -- at least one including a naked photo, which Ben 
            barely hides from lovely, clueless Amy. As the film is named for 
            Madison's cunning username, you might imagine that this particular 
            mode of stalking gets special treatment: Ben checks his mailbox, the 
            camera zooms in to a computer screen filled with little 
            email-message-envelope emblems, all from &quot;swimfan85.&quot; Cue ooky 
            music. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As if this spamming is not bad 
            enough, Madison stages a sort of home invasion, coming to visit 
            Ben's mom on her (mom's) birthday, complete with a bouquet of 
            flowers that outclasses and outsizes his own measly bunch. As it 
            happens, Madison is as wealthy as she is psychotic, though 
            apparently three's not an adult in sight at the mansion where she 
            lives with her cousin Dante (James Debello), who also happens to be 
            the class outcast (like the other kids, she's routinely mean to 
            Dante, but she alone deserves to be punished because she's really 
            mean). Madison's wealth is mostly a device to mark her difference 
            from Ben and Amy: she can afford designer outfits and an SUV, as 
            well as cello lessons, and most importantly, doesn't have to work. 
            Taken as a cautionary tale, <i>Swimfan</i> suggests that after 
            school jobs might ward off monstrous obsessions. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It happens that Madison's obsession 
            with Ben has some vague motivation in her past, though such 
            explanation hardly seems necessary (she's crazy: check). She tells 
            him that she has a boyfriend waiting for her in New York City, but 
            he's a vegetable, breathing on a respirator following a car 
            accident; as the nurse ominously tells Ben, Madison was wearing a 
            seatbelt, and gee, the Veggie Beau was not. Just what this is 
            supposed to tell us about her is not clear: She engineered the 
            accident because she was mad at Veggie Beau? She's now mentally 
            unstable because of it? </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Whatever the case -- and it hardly 
            matters -- Ben is only finding out about this dark past when it's 
            way too late. He's been tossed off the swim team for steroid use 
            (due to Madison's finagling of urine samples), a teammate (Clayne 
            Crawford) is dead, and Amy won't speak to him. And still, the film 
            can't stop. Borrowing from <i>Fatal Attraction</i> again, Charles 
            Bohl and Phillip Schneider's overheated script crosscuts between two 
            scenes, as Ben noses around in Madison's background, and she steals 
            his car, wearing a baseball cap so she apparently looks like him, 
            and goes gunning for Amy, riding to work on her bicycle. The tension 
            mounts. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Which is not to say that there's a 
            single plot point in <i>Swimfan</i> that you can't see coming a mile 
            away, except, maybe, the one where Madison, arrested, handcuffed, 
            and hauled off in a cruiser, manages to grab a gun off one of her 
            two handler-cops while they're stopped at a railroad crossing 
            and...&nbsp; well, just know that she performs a feat of Terminatoresque 
            dimensions and poor Amy is not yet out of the woods. Then again, at 
            this point you might be inclined to wish her ill too, even if she is 
            nice. Forgiving Ben for his stupidity is one thing; lolling 
            half-conscious in her corny head bandage, in Ben's bedroom no less, 
            is something else. Appleby's best-known role, as the nice girl on 
            the tv series <i>Roswell</i>, certainly laid the groundwork for this 
            dullest of girlfriend parts, but at least there, she was hanging 
            with seductive, perpetually angsty teen aliens. In <i>Swimfan</i>, 
            it's hard to see the percentage for her. At least Christensen gets 
            to look evil and wily. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">No doubt, distributors calculated
            <i>Swimfan</i>'s arrival in theaters at the nadir of the film year, 
            when competition is slim to none and most potential viewers are 
            otherwise distracted. This way, its not so fabulous first weekend 
            gross, some $12,430,000, still makes it look like it &quot;won&quot; 
            something, no matter how inconsequential. Careless and exploitative 
            as it is, <i>Swimfan</i>'s greatest offense may be that it offers so 
            little to its target adolescent audience, retreading a trashy 1987 
            movie about stupid, selfish adults, battering its viewers with a 
            ridiculous morality coda. Even if adults haven't learned anything 
            since then, most kids have. </font></td>
