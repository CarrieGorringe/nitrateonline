            couple of weeks ago, before Christmas, I caught Gary Sinise hawking <i>Impostor</i>
            on <i>The Daily Show</i> and then, Leno. Both were uncomfortable
            appearances, and not just because Sinise is a seriously serious guy
            who never looks happy in such situations. These were particularly
            odd because of the timing. The film's release during Xmas week was
            moved back (and it had actually been shelved for over a year, before
            then), so the immediacy of Sinise's good-sport pitch was somewhat
            thwarted. And so, Jon Stewart and Jay had him showing clips and
            answering questions about his mostly distinguished career, and then
            they vaguely noted that the new film was... &quot;opening soon,
            right?&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            moment was notably awkward, and only made more so by Sinise's
            perpetually snarly face. No matter his circumstances, you believe
            this guy is in pain. More often than not, he's turned this into an
            asset. He's best known as a stage actor and cofounder of Chicago's
            justly-renowned Steppenwolf Theatre Company, as well as the star of
            respected cable biopics about Harry Truman and George Wallace, and a
            movie version of <i>Of Mice and Men</i>, which he also directed.
            Still, Sinise has also contributed to his share of movie schlock,
            say, <i>Mission to Mars</i> and <i>Reindeer Games</i>. And when he
            is involved in such projects, you tend to sympathize with him,
            whether he's headed to Mars with Jerry O'Connell or throwing darts
            at Ben Affleck's chest. Like I said, a serious guy. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">So
            here he comes again -- looking very intense, sincere, and
            appropriately pained in the drecky <i>Impostor</i>. Based on a 1953
            Philip K. Dick story, the film rehearses the usual Dickish concerns,
            namely, a male protagonist's loss of identity, confidence, and
            context in a dystopic SF future. Much like other Dick-flicks
            (Verhoeven's <i>Total Recall</i>, Spielberg's upcoming <i>Minority
            Report</i>), <i>Impostor</i> immerses you in the experience of its
            abruptly disoriented hero, Sinise's Spencer Olham. Indeed, Spencer
            sort of picks up where Deckard leaves off in Ridley Scott's <i>Blade
            Runner</i>, wondering whether or not he's a replicant. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">In
            order to set up this monumental identity crisis, <i>Impostor</i>
            barely sketches Spencer's sense of himself. A revered
            &quot;brilliant scientist&quot; living in some urban center, circa
            2079, he's working for the insidious Government on a weapon to
            annihilate aliens, with whom humans have apparently been at war for
            years. A few brief images show Spencer's unhappy childhood (his
            father was killed by those same aliens) and his currently happy
            marriage to a doctor, Maya (Madeleine Stowe). Meanwhile, in a
            voice-over, he mourns the planet earth's many devastations, for
            instance, the loss of the atmosphere to ozone holes, peace to
            perpetual war, democracy to global leadership. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Even
            in this few minutes worth of intro, it's clear that Spencer himself
            is rather damaged (owing to that childhood trauma): as he walks
            through the military-science center where he works, Sinise's face
            couldn't look more anguished. Within moments of his return to work
            after a getaway weekend in the woods with Maya, Spencer is named an
            &quot;impostor,&quot; a genetically engineered cyborg with a
            &quot;bomb in his ribcage&quot; (at least he doesn't have a hugely
            symbolic uterus, like the bomb-carrying girl robot in <i>Eve of
            Destruction</i>). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            plot gauntlet is thus thrown down. According to Agent Hathaway
            (Vincent D'Onofrio), an imperious government flunky, Spencer is not
            who he thinks he is, but the Spencer-bot, sent by the aliens to
            assassinate a vital ambassador (Lindsay Crouse, on screen for about
            a minute). In an instant, Hathaway captures Spencer and has him
            strapped into a chair to be executed. There's no trial, as this is
            the future, when a military tribunal will look like so much liberal
            hand-wringing. Though he's been integral to this military-government
            fiat previously, now Spencer is understandably upset at this turn of
            events, and, now lacking a voice-over, scans the assembled audience
            for a friendly face. And there he is: best friend Nelson (Tony
            Shaloub, on screen for about four minutes) sadly looks down on
            Spencer from the observation deck, shaking his head. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">It's
            hard to believe, but things get worse. Despite the ad campaign's
            assertion that <i>Imposter</i> will &quot;keep you guessing,&quot;
            the truth is, you can figure out where it's headed pretty easily,
            especially the character dynamics. Partly this is because Hathaway
            is a chatty sort who helpfully explains most everything that's going
            on, even when you see it on screen. His version of events at this
            point is that, like most of Dick's bots, the one who has replaced
            Spencer has human memories, and so it believes it is Spencer. From
            Spencer's (or is it the bot's?) point of view, which the film more
            or less takes, Hathaway is an abusive thug, certainly less human
            (and sympathetic) than the object of his abuse. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">This
            state of affairs creates a potential dilemma for viewers, inclined
            by habit to identify with the designated star/hero, especially one
            who is strapped down in a chair and about to be cut open by large
            men in suits. This moment is one of those that feels perpetually
            topical: no one likes to think the government can just decide who
            you are and treat you accordingly. Perhaps if Gary Sinise looked
            &quot;Middle Eastern,&quot; the film's topicality would be complete.
            But then again, a film might be considered &quot;unpatriotic&quot;
            (by AG John Ashcroft anyway) if it underlined the racial realities
            of such government detainment and interrogation &quot;methods.&quot;
            So, best to let the scenario reside in some far-off future, where
            bomb-carrying cyborgs will look like sincere white guys. You know,
            &quot;universal.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">At
            first, it looks as though <i>Impostor</i> has other questions to
            ask, namely, Dick's usual questions: How is identity constructed?
            How do memories determine behavior and belief? Is there a difference
            between artificial and real identity? Almost as soon as it raises
            them, however, the film drops these philosophical niceties in favor
            of SF action and artfully dreary sets. Once he escapes from the
            government meanies --which he must, because the movie has some
            eighty minutes more to run -- Spencer runs off to that dystopic SF
            staple, the rebel-populated underground. Here he meets an earnest
            doctor (Elizabeth Pena, yet <i>another</i> wasted performer, on
            screen for about two minutes) who obligingly removes his
            government-identity device (in this particular future's slang, his
            simcode), and Cale (Mekhi Phifer), a rebel who instantly takes him
            at his word. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Cale
            has reasons for believing this, and his own background in this
            nasty-ass future, but the film only suggests what that might be
            (while Spencer has his simcode removed, Cale tends to an anonymous
            girl who's obviously sick in bed). In lieu of development, Cale has
            buddy-duties to perform. He agrees to lead Spencer back into the
            city (a task that Spencer apparently cannot manage himself, even
            though he got himself out of the city), so that he can run a DNA
            test to prove he is who he thinks he is. Here again, a potentially
            intriguing relationship goes nowhere. Spencer mistakes Cale for a
            drug addict (perhaps &quot;they all look alike,&quot; even in the
            future) and Cale, once he sees the pervasive Wanted posters
            generated electronically all over the city, has to make some choices
            regarding his allegiance to Spencer. But <i>Impostor</i> can't think
            of a thing to do with these characters except have them run through
            dark tunnels, fight off various anonymous attackers, and evade
            elaborate surveillance technologies. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Spencer's
            situation might have challenged social and political presumptions --
            that personality is consistent, memory coherent, or community
            rational. Will Spencer complete that crucial DNA test? Will Maya
            believe his story? Will Hathaway track him down? Will Cale make the
            right decision? Eventually, this suspense-less film sucks the life
            out of all these concerns. And by the time the bomb is discovered,
            you're way past worrying about it. <o:p>
