            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">One sits back and silently makes up 
            the tally: A pre-credits sequence which actually introduces, rather 
            than postpones, the story. A stunning opening titles sequence (by 
            Danny Kleinman) accompanying the theme song by Madonna (and I still 
            don't know WHAT to make of that thing). Definitely darker, meaner, 
            edgier in tone (no surprise considering that the director is Lee 
            Tamahori, who did the superb, but brutal, <i>Once Were Warriors</i>). 
            Some genuine tours-de-force, including a sword fight and a sequence 
            set in a palace made out of ice (right down to the furnishings and a 
            swan-shaped bed). And Halle Berry, showing poise and presence, 
            instantly winning us over as she wags her eyebrows at Pierce 
            Brosnan's James Bond before leaping, backwards, over a cliff into 
            the sea (and, yes, she wears a belted bikini). So why do I not feel 
            more excitement about <i>Die Another Day</i>?</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Maybe it's because, at twenty films 
            and running, the Bond franchise has done just about everything it's 
            going to do. As the mid-Seventies films showed, toy with the formula 
            too much and you end up with some monstrosities, like the mutant 
            offspring in Larry Cohen's <i>It's Alive</i> films. But, as Anthony 
            Lane pointed out in his recent <i>New Yorker </i>essay, the formula 
            itself is curiously unsatisfying to begin with, moving from initial 
            kiss-kiss bang-bang to, as Sean Connery put it in <i>Dr. No</i>, 
            &quot;World domination. Same old story.&quot; Here, Bond starts out being 
            tortured and imprisoned in North Korea, then finds out that he's in 
            disgrace with MI6 because they think he talked under pressure. 
            Knowing that he didn't (although it would have been more interesting 
            if he wondered if he did, as is readily apparent in the film), Bond 
            must turn rogue agent in order to clear his name and find out who 
            betrayed him. This leads him through Cuba, where he charges through 
            a private clinic specializing in &quot;D.N.A. replacement&quot; and bumps into 
            a North Korean officer (Rick Yune) scarred by &quot;diamond shrapnel&quot;, to 
            a British entrepreneur (Toby Stephens) who never sleeps and mines 
            diamonds out of Iceland. (There's a lot of ice in this movie, along 
            with a witty use of the Clash's &quot;London Calling&quot;.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While Vin Diesel may have struck 
            accord with some in <i>XXX</i> because of his insouciant, 
            cut-the-crap manner, Bond has been and remains appealing (even if it 
            has some inherent snob appeal) because he wears Brioni, knows that 
            you need a sturdy timepiece like Omega in case you're going to have 
            to swim through deep water at a moment's notice, and can order the 
            right vintage champagne to go with lobster. But the Bond films have 
            always been one action hero affairs -- his teaming up with Halle 
            Berry's American agent Jinx works only so far as it does until they 
            get the job done (and because Pierce Brosnan knows how to play 
            opposite Halle Berry), but, in the end, she becomes but one more 
            conquest of his (although you sense it's a conquest on her own 
            terms). And the one-liners and rejoinders (&quot;I'm Mr. Kill.&quot; &quot;A name 
            to die for.&quot;) seem to be here only because they've always been here. 
            Each new Bond film has to come up with one showstopper that somehow 
            tops anything that has come before -- along with the sword fight, 
            there's a good sequence involving a helicopter that has to be 
            started in mid-air before it dashes the occupants to bits, but some 
            of the others (including a much-publicized car chase across an ice 
            lake) seem tricked or unbelievable.&nbsp; The stand-out action sequences 
            in previous Bond films stood out because they involved actual people 
            in actual locations.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Pierce Brosnan continues to bring a 
            steely reserve to Bond that makes the character convincing 
            (something I don't think any of the other performers I've heard 
            bandied about for the role could ever do), and, do what they want, 
            but please leave Judi Dench in the role of M. Rosamund Pike does 
            what she can in the <b><i>de facto</i></b> role of designated Bond 
            Girl Miranda Frost -- her change of character seems lost in the 
            shuffle that occurs when the movie shifts from a vendetta/revenge 
            story to one where large devices in outer space start blowing up the 
            world. (There's also an invisible car -- an Aston-Martin -- and an 
            electric hand used by the villain.) And there are the in-jokes: 
            Moneypenny finally gets to kiss James (a first); Bond poses as an 
            ornithologist by carrying a copy of &quot;Field Guide to Birds&quot; (Ian 
            Fleming took the name &quot;James Bond&quot; from the author of just such a 
            book); one character's name, Colonel Moon, brings directly to mind 
            the title of Kingsley Amis' Bond pastiche &quot;Colonel Sun&quot;; and, while 
            walking through the workplace of the new Q (John Cleese, extremely 
            well-cast), Brosnan's Bond shakes the ridiculous jet pack used in <i>
            Thunderball</i> and asks, &quot;Does this old thing work?&quot; (Yes, and it 
            still looks ridiculous, but people really thought they'd be getting 
            around in those things in 1965!) Alas, Shirley Eaton, the gilded 
            Jill Masterson in <i>Goldfinger</i>, does not make her much-rumored 
            cameo appearance, although Madonna does an unbilled (and perfectly 
            fine) one as a fencing instructor named Verity.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Is there any hope? (John Gardner's 
            Bond novels, fourteen of them starting with <i>License Renewed</i> 
            in 1981, seem to have been placed off-limits to Eon Productions.) 
            Anthony Lane suggested the most mind-blowing solution of all -- 
            mind-blowing because it just might work -- doing Fleming's 1953 
            novel, <i>Casino Royale</i>, as a period piece, directed by Ang Lee. 
            I think I'll have that martini, now, dry, shaken until ice-cold, and 
            served in a deep champagne goblet.</font></td>
