            <font face="Verdana" size="5">28th Seattle International Film 
            Festival</font><p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Rapper Tupac 
            Shakur was gunned down on September 7, 1996 in Las Vegas. Rapper 
            Biggie (The Notorious B.I.G.) Smalls suffered the same fate on March 
            9, 1997 in Los Angeles. Once the closest of friends, Biggie and 
            Tupac died as bitter enemies. In his latest film, <i>Biggie and 
            Tupac</i>, documentary filmmaker Nick Broomfield (<i>Kurt and 
            Courtney</i>, <i>Heidi Fleiss: Hollywood Madam</i>) suggests that 
            these murders are, despite all appearances, related incidents. He, 
            along with many of his interviewees, barely stop short at 
            proclaiming Marion (Suge) Knight to be the chief mastermind behind 
            both the murders and the feud between Biggie and Tupac. It seems 
            that Knight, the former head of the rap label Death Row records, had 
            the typical characteristics for committing the murders: motive and 
            opportunity. The movie lines up a laundry list of potential motives, 
            chief among them the large sum of money ($10 million) he owed Tupac 
            at the time when Tupac was planning -- some might have said 
            threatening -- to leave Death Row because of the violence 
            surrounding the label and his minimal financial compensation for a 
            punishing workload (During one eleven-month period, Tupac recorded 
            sixty-seven songs). Knight had also operated under a 
            divide-and-conquer strategy, attempting to create an &quot;East Coast 
            versus West Coast&quot; rivalry, dismissing East Coast rap labels as 
            inauthentic. Tupac's impending departure for an East Coast label 
            would have threatened that, along with Tupac's intention of taking 
            his entire back catalog with him. Fortunately, as the film suggests, 
            Knight had one last trump card to play: some of L.A.'s finest also 
            worked part-time as part of Death Row's security detail, providing 
            protection for its artists. Was it coincidence, the film asks, that 
            an investigation into both killings went nowhere under this 
            insidious set of circumstances?</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This being a Nick Broomfield film, 
            it's not surprising that the film veers into the realm of 
            tantalizing implications. Operating as a cross between Albert Sayles 
            and Oliver Stone (much like Michael Moore), Bloomfield and his films 
            play at the fringes of treating its participants with neutrality, 
            but the outcome -- especially in this case -- tends to rest on an 
            uneasy line between libel and interpretation (and perhaps very 
            uneasily at that, since Courtney Love sought an injunction against 
            the release of <i>Kurt and Courtney</i>). The film's structure 
            relies very heavily upon Biggie Small's friends and family, since 
            Tupac's mother -- the executor of his estate and the rights holder 
            to all of her son's music -- refused to cooperate with Broomfield. 
            The interpretation of the events behind this case may be tempting to 
            those with a love for the paranoiac -- although Broomfield, to his 
            credit, doesn't shy away from presenting Knight's commanding, almost 
            sinister, presence -- but the speculations aren't sufficient to 
            present a truly persuasive viewpoint. </font>&nbsp;</p>
