            Nelson's <i>The Grey Zone</i> depicts the lot of the <i>
            sonderkommandos</i>. They were the prisoners who, in exchange for a 
            few extra months of life and semi-generous rations, agreed to assist 
            the Nazis in their genocidal aims, &quot;processing&quot; those destined for 
            the gas chamber, from leading them into the chambers to shoveling 
            their dead bodies into the ovens (imagine, if you can, the prospect 
            of separating dead babies from their mothers and throwing them into 
            the ovens, or even of coming across the bodies of your own 
            relatives, all for the price of some sausage and generous amount of 
            liquor in order to dull the pain). The <i>sonderkommandos</i> most 
            aptly bridged the realm between absolute evil and good evil; hence 
            the title of the film. Of course, there were countless other 
            instances of prisoners betraying others in order to save themselves 
            -- other manifestations of living in a &quot;grey zone&quot; in a world where 
            the concepts of morality had been rendered utterly relative to the 
            extreme -- but the situation in which the <i>sonderkommandos</i> 
            placed themselves could be interpreted as the <i>ne plus ultra</i> 
            of collaboration with the Nazis. </b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Working from his own play (based on 
            a true story), Nelson (who also appears in another SIFF film, <i>
            Cherish</i>) crafts a world of moral madness and overwhelming 
            horror. It is 1944 -- approximately four to six months before the 
            camp would be liberated by the Russian Army -- and a group of 
            inmates are conspiring to break out of Auschwitz. Meanwhile, a group 
            of <b><i>sonderkommandos</i></b>, while cleaning up after one of 
            their routine &quot;details&quot;, discovers, much to their amazement, that a 
            twelve-year-old girl has managed to survive the gassing. The <b><i>
            sonderkommandos</i></b>, who are in league with the would-be 
            escapees, find themselves in a moral dilemma: do they attempt the 
            impossible and try to save her, or do they turn her directly over to 
            the Nazis? If they don't turn her over, they risk undermining an 
            escape attempt that had been months in planning, as well as their 
            own lives and those of others. If they do, they risk the loss of 
            perhaps their most valuable asset: the psychological block that 
            keeps from feeling the ramifications of their participation in the 
            killing machinery.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The overall impression of the film 
            is one of hit-and-miss achievements. To his credit, Nelson's 
            depiction of events in the camp and in the gas chambers themselves 
            is accurate without being graphic; he allows quick editing and 
            glimpses of the ghastly situation to allow the audience's 
            imagination to fill in the nightmarish gaps in a way that direct 
            imagery could not, thus making the impact all the more frightening. 
            And yet, there's a vague but still certain sense that Nelson doesn't 
            trust the material enough to convey the omnipresent evil. He allows 
            the actors to descend into the melodramatic in an attempt to pump up 
            the sense of terror (with the surprising exception of David Arquette, 
            whose performance here proves that his range extends far beyond the 
            realm of horror-film satires). <i>The Grey Zone</i> does leave its 
            audience numb with shock, but also uneasy about some of the film's 
            deeper defects. Nevertheless, it is a film that effectively 
            underscores what should be a rather obvious point: good and evil 
            don't always possess clear boundaries. </font></p>
