            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>On a first viewing, I found
            Bruce Beresford's new movie <i>Evelyn</i> to be too cloying and
            syrupy for its own good. But for some strange reason, the next day I
            wanted to show it to friends and relatives and get their reaction.
            Now that I've caught it again, the film's virtues outweigh its
            missteps. The humor seems less forced, and the beauty of the core
            story tramples the moments where the Irish-set drama sinks into
            blarney.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Working from a
            fascinating and historically important 1953 Irish legal case,
            Scottish screenwriter and producer Paul Pender deserves credit for
            simply introducing the story to the rest of the world.</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">During that event, an unemployed
            housepainter and part-time singer named Desmond Doyle (Pierce
            Brosnan) suffered a double calamity. His wife, weary of their
            crumbling marriage, abandons him for an Englishman and heads to
            Australia without leaving anyone a forwarding address. Because of
            her abrupt departure and his financial woes (&quot;Santa was
            strapped for cash this year,&quot; he tells his offspring), Desmond
            has little choice but to give his children over to Catholic
            Church-sponsored orphanages. As far as the Irish government is
            concerned, Desmond's luck and his habits -- like cursing and
            consuming Guinness -- make him an unfit parent.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Gradually, Desmond gets a job
            restoring a grand old home and wants to bring his daughter Evelyn
            (Sophie Vavasseur) and sons Dermot (Niall Began) and Maurice (Hugh
            McDonagh) home. The government and the Church remain unmoved, and
            there's an obscure 1941 law that requires him to obtain the consent
            of the mother to take custody. With his spouse living incommunicado
            in Sydney, that's not going to happen. As far as the law is
            concerned, it would have been so much easier if she had died.
            Desmond even tries rescuing his tots from the orphanages, but it's
            all for naught. Even if one of the sisters feels to the need to beat
            God's love into the Evelyn, Desmond's love is little match for the
            local child welfare system. Thanks to an intelligent barmaid named
            Bernadette Beattie (Julianna Margulies), Desmond gradually quits the
            chemical recreation and recruits her brother Michael (Stephen Rea)
            to act as his solicitor. He and Desmond's unceasing determination
            eventually gain support from a hotshot Irish-American barrister
            (Aidan Quinn) and a retired lawyer-soccer player (Alan Bates from <i>Gosford
            Park</i>), who uses his celebrity status to help argue Desmond's
            case on a new medium called television.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Because of the omnipresence of
            television these days, it's actually fascinating to watch Desmond
            and others trying to comprehend this new contraption. It might have
            been even more effective if screenwriter Pender had cut the stale
            wisecrack about TV never lasting.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Eventually, the Irish Supreme Court
            has little choice but to review the case and possibly declare the
            law unconstitutional. There's something inherently moving about a
            responsible caring father fighting to regain custody of his
            children. In some ways, Brosnan's previous turns as James Bond
            offhandedly work in his favor. Whereas 007 would do anything in his
            power to deny paternity, Desmond longs for it, so it's almost like
            Bond has shaped up. It's a rare treat to hear Brosnan speak with his
            native accent (he was born in County Meath), and apparently he's a
            ringer for the real Desmond Doyle.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The rest of the film could have
            used that sort of authenticity. Every now and then artificial
            &quot;sunlight&quot; will glow, and one of the characters grins
            because the &quot;angel rays&quot; are shining. With treacly bits
            like this, the film's charm begins to erode. Had Beresford and
            Pender chosen to tell the story in a more detached manner, it might
            have been more involving because the two gradually bludgeon the
            audience with sentimentality. Thankfully, the supporting cast is
            more than solid, and, like a lot of other Irish movies, <i>Evelyn</i>
            is visually gorgeous.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Having been raised a
            German-American Protestant, I'm also curious about the way <i>Evelyn</i>
            treats the Catholic Church. The film features an almost cartoonish
            nun (Andrea Irvine) who abuses the children in the name of the Lord.
            I wondered how realistic this depiction of Irish Catholicism was.
            There may have been nuns that fanatical running the orphanages, but
            with all the scorn the Church has faced lately, the last thing they
            need is unfair stereotypes. Fortunately, many of the clergy depicted
            in the film eagerly help out Desmond Doyle and his children. Still,
            as I watched the movie, I couldn't help but think about how
            politicians and religious leaders are spouting all sorts of
            platitudes about family. It's sadly ironic that these same two
            groups can be unwittingly harmful to the institution they praise.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"></o:p>
