            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Believe it or not, this little 
            exchange from the movie embodies much of what I love about <i>E.T. 
            The Extra-Terrestrial</i>. Twenty years after his initial landing, 
            the exploits of this elaborate puppet are still captivating because 
            director Steven Spielberg wisely treats this fantasy with a 
            surprisingly naturalistic approach.</b> </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After being separated from his 
            fellow space aliens, little <i>E.T.</i> finds himself stranded in an 
            environment that's fairly close to the one outside of the theater. 
            The human family that &quot;adopts&quot; him is teeming with sibling rivalry. 
            Eleven-year-old Elliot (Henry Thomas) has trouble attracting the 
            attention his younger sister Gertie (Drew Barrymore) elicits with 
            ease, and his older brother Michael (Robert MacNaughton) treats the 
            younger siblings as nuisances. Their mother (Dee Wallace Stone) has 
            several concerns vying for her attention. In addition to trying to 
            juggle the children, the housework and her job, she and the rest of 
            the family are still smarting from a bitter divorce. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Elliot and his significant others 
            might be a little more affluent and certainly better looking than 
            the folks who might be viewing the film, but their conversations 
            sound authentic, and their frustrations are familiar and convincing. 
            When <i>E.T.</i> does wander into their home (lured by an early 
            product placement for Reese's Pieces), it seems all the more 
            remarkable because the family's situation is rather mundane.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Before <i>Schindler's List</i> and
            <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>, Spielberg gained a reputation as 
            special-effects junkie, but <i>E.T.</i> proves to be surprisingly 
            low tech compared to other sci-fi fare. One of the film's most 
            striking visual touches requires no computerized enhancements at 
            all. A good deal of the <i>E.T.</i>'s footage was shot from a 
            child's-eye level, allowing the viewer to experience the story with 
            an intimacy that this movie's imitators never achieved. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This closeness to the characters 
            could have been potentially disastrous if Thomas hadn't proved to be 
            such an adept leading man. Despite his youth, his work is so 
            unaffected that believing that he has psychically bonded with the 
            alien is an easy and even pleasant task. Similarly, Melissa 
            Mathison's (<i>The Black Stallion</i>, <i>Kundun</i>) script has a 
            radar for children's movie clichés and often deftly skewers or 
            avoids them. When Elliot tells Gertie that only kids can see E.T., 
            she rolls her eyes and scoffs. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's factors like these that made 
            me fall for this movie when I was fifteen, even though I initially 
            considered myself too old to fall for a kiddie flick. Twenty years 
            later, <i>E.T.</i> still grabs me more than it should. When I had 
            heard about the &quot;enhancements&quot; Spielberg and his cohorts were 
            offering in this new edition of the film, I cringed. The revised, or 
            should I say desecrated, versions of the <i>Star Wars</i> trilogy 
            and the <i>Exorcist</i> are proof that artists are sometimes wise 
            not to second-guess themselves.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For the most part, the new version 
            of <i>E.T.</i> avoids some of these pitfalls. While it might have 
            been fun to get a glimpse of the now-legendary deleted sequence 
            where Harrison Ford plays the principal at Elliot's school (at the 
            time, Ford was married to Mathison), the two sequences that have 
            been restored actually enhance the rest of the movie. The extended 
            Halloween portion of the movie makes the mother appear far more 
            caring and sympathetic. The bathroom sequence, where E.T. discovers 
            bizarre uses ordinary objects, is amusing and helps explain how he 
            and Elliot become one as the movie progresses, culminating in the 
            scene where a drunken E.T. manipulates Elliot's behavior in school.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The special effects tweaking is 
            fairly subtle and doesn't detract the rest of the movie. There are a 
            couple of questionable modifications, though. In the previous 
            version, Elliot's mother warns him that his Halloween costume makes 
            him look a terrorist and won't let him leave. She now calls him a 
            &quot;hippie,&quot; which makes little since because of all the 
            camouflage-like paint on his face. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The second change seems even more 
            bizarre. In the initial cut of the film, before E.T. makes all of 
            the bicycles Elliot and his peers are riding fly, there is a 
            roadblock manned by two cops with pistols. For years, Spielberg has 
            reportedly been bothered by the idea of armed me facing down 
            children. The officers are now holding digitally-drawn walkie 
            talkies. This portion of the film is remarkably brief, so the 
            ramifications having policemen pointing guns at kids doesn't sink in 
            unless you've seen this portion dozens of times, as Spielberg 
            obviously has. The walkie-talkies are held at strange angles, which 
            makes the new version seem awkward.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While Spielberg was revising the 
            film, he might have changed a few things that still mar the film. 
            The government agents led by Keys (Peter Coyote) invade Elliot's 
            home wearing space suits. The sequences where they abruptly take 
            over the neighborhood have an over-the-top quality that almost sinks 
            the movie. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As with the endings of <i>Saving 
            Private Ryan</i> and <i>A.I.</i>, Spielberg sometimes bludgeons his 
            ideas on his audience where they are already obvious. E.T.'s 
            spaceship leaves an exhaust trail that looks a rainbow. What has 
            transpired just a few seconds before is one of the most moving 
            sequences in cinema. This little multicolored flourish takes an 
            honest moment and cheapens it. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For the most part, however, 
            Spielberg and Mathison have their priorities straight. Emblematic of 
            the rest of the film, the film's final shot is of Elliot silently 
            ruminating about what has just happened to him. If special effects 
            or magical worlds were all that viewers needed to enjoy a movie, why 
            hasn't every movie directed by Roland Emmerich (<i>Independence Day</i>) 
            become a box-office bonanza?</font></td>
