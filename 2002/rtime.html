            <span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="5">What's this &quot;we&quot; 
            stuff?&nbsp; </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><b>The new film 
            version of <i>The Time Machine</i> is misconceived from jump. A 
            philosophical dilemma dressed up like an action picture or maybe a 
            romance, it's part <i>Planet of the Apes</i>, part <i>Star Trek</i>, 
            and part One More Inexplicable Choice by Jeremy Irons (whose 
            appearance as the hoary <i>Über</i>-Morlock -- horrifically white, 
            bony, and mean -- reeks of his role in <i>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</i>). 
            Based on H. G. Wells' prescient science fiction tale (written way 
            back in 1894), the movie raises all kinds of great questions 
            concerning the dangers and thrills of time travel (Can one 
            individual's misstep alter the planet's future? Is fate fixed? What 
            happens when you go back, knowing the future? Will Orlando Jones 
            still be hawking stuff in 2030?), but backs off from every one. </b>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Just as the 
            philosophical dilemma angle gets short shrift, so the action angle 
            is also in trouble. One problem is that the time machine doesn't 
            actually move: built by Victorian scientist Alexander (Guy Pearce), 
            it is an elaborate chair (that looks a little too dentist-like for 
            comfort) adorned with levers, wheels, and glass pipes. The concept 
            -- not a bad one -- is that time travel is not spatial but, well, 
            temporal, which means that once the machine starts whirring and 
            whooshing, it remains stationary inside a strange little bubble, 
            while the world bucks and changes around it. This means, of course, 
            there's lots of blue screen work and digital effects, all darn dull 
            to watch. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Once Alexander 
            gets out of the contraption, there would seem to be room for 
            movement, exploration, and adventure. Or even, you know, science 
            fiction as deliberate social or political allegory. But where the 
            novel concerned itself with urgent class questions as these 
            persisted into a post-apocalyptic (and of course, metaphorical) 
            future world, the 2002 film is kind of la-de-dah about the whole 
            science-fiction-allegory thing. This <i>Time Machine</i> is written 
            by Josh (<i>Gladiator</i>) Logan, and partly directed by Wells' 
            great-grandson Simon Wells: his previous credit is co-directing 
            DreamWorks' animated film <i>Prince of Egypt</i>, and, following 
            troubles on the set of <i>Time Machine</i> (last minute rewrites, a 
            large cast of extras and oversight by the producers), he reportedly 
            succumbed to &quot;exhaustion,&quot; replaced in the final months of shooting 
            by Gore Verbinski. The result is a disjointed, abbreviated film that 
            guts the novel's urgent class analysis, in favor of an &quot;emotional&quot; 
            trajectory, combining a little sensitive guy romance thing, a 
            cautionary tale thing, and finally, an action-hero-saving-the-day 
            thing. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Alexander 
            begins the film as a socially awkward scientist, bumbling and sweet, 
            with a penchant for pocket watches and professorial vested suits. 
            Pearce brings a beguiling mix of intelligence and angst to the role 
            (he's not so stiff as Rod Taylor was in George Pal's 1960 film), as 
            well as an emotional curiosity. His girlfriend Emma (Sienna 
            Guillory) inspires him to be passionate, and if he's a little green, 
            he's also mostly endearing. When his marriage proposal ends in 
            disaster (that is, her murder by a mugger who is also very 
            unprepared and awkward), he dedicates himself to building a time 
            machine so that he can go <i>back</i> in time to put that situation 
            right, or better, avoid it altogether.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">When this 
            proves impossible (for reasons that aren't well explained, 
            especially as they are supposed to convince this &quot;scientist&quot;)), 
            Alexander starts whining to his best friend, the suitably worried 
            Dr. Philby (Mark Addy, who must surely be tired of playing sidekicks 
            to waffling heroes by now): &quot;Why can't one change the past!?&quot; Philby 
            looks about as flummoxed as you might, probably considering all the 
            reasons why &quot;one can't&quot; do such a thing (like, maybe, economies of 
            matter, energy, and Joan Collins, as in: &quot;He knows, doctor, he <i>
            knows</i>&quot;). But Alexander decides to go look for an answer, but 
            going into the future (why, we'll never know). He sends his machine 
            forward to 2030, where he meets a holographic New York Public 
            Librarian named Vox (Orlando Jones), who stores all of human 
            knowledge for all time and is willing to regurgitate at any moment. 
            Though Alexander learns that he has made a little historical 
            footnote of a name for himself in the future, he also doesn't have 
            an answer to his question. And so he pushes on. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">At this point, 
            the film just lets go of all sense of direction or focus. Alexander 
            whooshes forward to a Blade Runner-ish, about-to-destroy-itself NYC 
            (2037) and then, when the explosions all around him rock his machine 
            and knock him out so he hits a lever with his head, he hurtles 
            forward 800,000 years. Unconscious when he lands, Alexander is 
            fortunately rescued by Mara (Samantha Mumba), a conveniently 
            English-speaking member of a really friendly community. 
            Post-apocalyptic but also prelapserian, these folks are called the 
            Elois. They live in translucent pods on the sides of cliffs (looking 
            &quot;toward the light&quot;) and dress in soft, earth-toned outfits. They're 
            gentle, spiritual (though they have what appear to be collective 
            nightmares), and naïve-seeming tribal types, played by actors cast, 
            as the press notes have it, &quot;to reflect the evolutionary path on 
            which it appears humanity is heading.&quot; Put bluntly, the Elois are 
            beige-brown-black. In addition to Mara, the only other Eloi with 
            more than two lines of dialogue is her brother Kalen (Omero Mumba, 
            who is, as it happens, Samantha's very own little brother, and an 
            aspiring hiphop artist currently working on his first CD).</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">As the 
            nightmares forewarn, however, the Elois' edenic existence is plagued 
            by monsters called the Morlocks. Where in the novel, the oppressed 
            Morlocks were fighting back against the elite Elois, here the 
            Morlocks are languageless and apparently quite dumb and crude, not 
            to mention sincerely ugly: skull-eyed and smashed-nosed. Though they 
            live underground, they pop up occasionally (literally, as the sand 
            swirls and sucks around whatever temporary holes they make) to steal 
            Elois for slave labor and food. But when the Elois mournfully bow 
            down and accept this as the way of the world, Alexander fumes and 
            yells. &quot;Sometimes,&quot; he exhorts, &quot;We need to fight!&quot; </font></span>
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Um, what's this 
            &quot;we&quot; stuff, white man? </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Apparently, 
            this is where the film's time-traveling class analysis has landed, 
            in the brutal conflict between the pasty-white slavers and their 
            exploited and abused &quot;resources,&quot; the &quot;exotic&quot; (so-called by 
            producer David Valdes) Elois. When Alexander heads down the hole to 
            rescue a &quot;stolen&quot; Mara, he encounters the Uber-Morlock (the only one 
            with speech, again conveniently, English), who offers some 
            pseudo-rational drivel concerning slavery and cannibalism, but 
            nothing that helps to pull any of the film's ongoing illogic 
            together, as narrative or ideology. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">During their 
            discussion of time travel, dreams, and morality, the Uber-Morlock 
            shows Alexander his ugly back (nasty-looking spine exposed), as if 
            this explains his imperialist-capitalist egomania, but really, he 
            has nothing new to say, even though he's supposedly living some 800 
            centuries from now. While the Uber-Morlock goes on about his sorry 
            state and Alexander contemplates the depressing end of his own 
            ingenuity, Mara's locked in a cage, waiting to be saved. You would 
            think that maybe, just maybe, the future would bring a new story.</font></span></p>
