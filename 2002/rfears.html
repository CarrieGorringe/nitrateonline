            in explosions and plotted out the wazoo, full of sinister villains,
            exotic locations, and itself, the fourth Jack Ryan movie is also
            distressingly out of date. This despite the current campaign to make
            it loom as a dramatically relevant enterprise: between CNN's recent
            discussions of the film's application to the War Against Terrorism
            and <i>ET</i>'s &quot;Special&quot; on the franchise history
            (including interviews with previous Jack Ryans, Alec Baldwin and
            Harrison Ford), you'd think Phil Alden Robinson's movie is some kind
            of Momentous Event, rather than what it is -- a well-appointed
            action pic. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            film's gargantuan set-piece, as everyone knows because of the
            trailer that's been circulating for months, is a nuclear explosion,
            specifically, a nuclear explosion in Baltimore, at the Superbowl, no
            less, where the President is attending in a display of public
            confidence and national unity. You know how important those displays
            are. Oddly, this particular version of a Worst Case Scenario is
            equally mundane and horrific. How awful to imagine such a thing, no
            matter how many mushroom clouds Arnold and his ilk have survived.
            And how outrageous to imagine that, as long as CIA Super Analyst
            Jack Ryan (here played by Ben Affleck, working really hard to
            grimace like he means it) is on the case, everything'll be okay. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">What
            with the action-heroics and all (including mighty leaping and
            driving through nuclear dust, arctic hinterlands, flaming streets,
            and demolished buildings, which moves Jack learns from his buddy,
            Field Agent/Recon Guy [appropriately taciturn Liev Schreiber]), the
            film's vision of survival is pretty unreal, as is its
            political-moral-military naiveté -- all very duck-and-cover. The
            villains are easy to keep track of here, which is, I suppose, the
            greatest mythology of all, and the film's primary device to get you
            hooked up with Jack. He knows, you know. He always knows. You might
            say that knowing is his métier.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At
            the same time, Ryan's expertise and incessant insight, even as a
            youngster (for this film takes place before the others, strangely,
            and more on that below), make <i>The Sum of All Fears</i> feel
            dated. As a representative of his Agency, Consider that it posits
            the CIA doing a bang-up job of monitoring terrorists, Nazi plots,
            and wayward nuclear devices, not to mention the untrustworthy
            Russians. Even if the Administration's most recent anti-terrorist
            action-decision is to send CIA analysts round to FBI offices to
            interpret the Feds' data (as clearly, they're having trouble doing
            it themselves), the truth is that public faith in the Agency has
            waned, seriously. And it was waning long before 9-11. Since that
            day, of course, Jack Ryan's fictional world (as concocted by
            techno-thriller novelist and former insurance broker Tom Clancy) is
            looking older and older, in particular his tendency to make personal
            action heroics into solutions to international crises. Very, very
            pretty to think so. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            no matter. Logic, narrative or temporal, is largely irrelevant for
            Ryan's world. Directed by Phil Alden (<i>Sneakers</i>, <i>Field of
            Dreams</i>) Robinson, <i>The Sum of All Fears</i> (based on Clancy's
            1991 novel of the same name) provides backstory for Ryan. It's
            delivered in neat little bits, such that the characters are more
            types than, well, characters. So, you learn how Ryan came by his
            reputation as the CIA's Smart Guy, mainly, it appears, by
            interpreting events in ways that none of his superiors can even
            imagine, much less believe, then going round them to make nice with
            the wily new Russian Guy, also known as President Nemerov (Ciarán
            Hinds). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            White House Boss Guys (including James Cromwell as President Fowler,
            Philip Baker Hall as Secretary of Defense, Ron Rifkin as Secretary
            of State, Bruce McGill as National Security Advisor) all assume
            Nemerov is a shifty bastard, because they're living a couple of
            decades back, when Bad Guys were defined, in the U.S. at least, by
            their nationalities. Ryan knows better, because he's written A Paper
            on Russian Guy, and knows he is ambitious and cagey, as opposed to
            bitter and aggressive. Ryan's mentor, sagacious CIA chief Bill Cabot
            (Morgan Freeman), knows better because, well, he has faith in his
            mentee.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Pre-Ford-Baldwin
            Ryan is brash, smart, and thrillingly workaholic, which means that
            he's just started dating the pretty and infinitely patient doctor,
            Cathy Muller (perky Bridget Moynahan), who will eventually become
            his pretty and infinitely patient wife (Anne Archer in the Harrison
            Ford movies). Since you know Jack's life is going to take a certain
            course (he'll become a respected senior analyst, marry Cathy, have
            kids and live in a big house), it's hard to be too worried by the
            many clear and present dangers that pop up -- say, a nuclear warhead
            that's been missing since the Israelis lost it in the desert in
            1973. He can't die. Shoot, he can't even be seriously maimed. And
            so, Jack Ryan persists. Even, quite preposterously, in the face of
            that nuclear blast. He's in a chopper, rushing to the scene, trying
            desperately to get the message out -- &quot;The bomb is in
            play!!&quot; -- and whooomp! he's hit by the rolling edge of the
            smoky, fiery, hot-air explosion. Chopper goes down. Ryan gets up. <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Let's
            just say upfront: Clancy's novels and the movies they spawn have
            never had much truck with credibility. The bomb gets to the U.S. via
            the machinations of Dressler (Alan Bates), an intensely nasty
            Austrian Neo-Nazi Guy with a ferocious grudge against the axis that
            beat down Hitler and apparently limitless cash-flow. He pays various
            minions to hunt down the missing nuke and steals three Russian
            scientists to put the pieces together (so you see: the junior NATO-ites
            <i>do</i> have a part in this catastrophe, after all). His goal is
            to set in motion WWIII, by making the utterly clueless and
            enthusiastically hawkish U.S. leaders believe the deed is done by
            Russian terrorists. That the U.S. Cabinet initially falls whole hog
            for the ploy is necessary to make Ryan look brilliant, but it's a
            tedious device. And it may give pause, since most folks making the
            Sunday news shows these days don't look any more energetic or astute
            than the cardboard types here. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            bomb's detonation is spectacular, all billowing flames and smoke and
            debris, and not much in the way of bodies or limbs or bloody flecks,
            the kind of stuff that does tend to fly around under such
            circumstances. You might be tempted to gawk and say to yourself,
            &quot;It's like a movie.&quot; And then, of course, you'd realize,
            it is a movie. Hence, you know, the likeness. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">That
            such a device might be smuggled in through what passes as U.S.
            security now doesn't look as farfetched as it might have when the
            film was conceived. But the explosion per se stretches the film's
            believability factor considerably, in that nearby key characters
            survive the bomb. I probably don't need to tell you who doesn't
            survive, because you've seen enough of these sorts of movies to know
            that which characters are not only expendable, but also ennobled by
            dying for the Greater Good. Of course, Ryan lives, as does the
            increasingly grumpy Fowler, pushed quite over the edge by his
            assailants' sheer nerve, not to mention their devious excess.
            &quot;They fucking tired to kill me!&quot; he points out, as if to
            explain his decision to seek major vengeance. Those Evil Ones: no
            telling what kind of rage they're going to bring on themselves. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Predictably,
            Jack's day-saving ends up looking anti-climactic after this
            special-effects jamboree. Who knew how simple international
            politicking and war-making could be? Jack only has to bust into high
            security government offices, get past Gruff Uniformed Guys, convince
            Guard Guy to let him use the top secret communications equipment,
            then get Superpower Head-Guys to back off, to recognize the
            malevolence that lurks among them in the form of Rich Racist Guy.
            Thank goodness for Young Cocky Guy. <o:p>
