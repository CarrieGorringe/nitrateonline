            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Paul Schrader's
            <i>Auto Focus</i> is, as its title suggests, about self-interest and 
            -obsession. Its means to these themes is the sad, absurd, short life 
            of Bob Crane (Greg Kinnear), the guy who played Colonel Hogan in the 
            World War II POW sitcom, <i>Hogan's Heroes</i> (on CBS from 
            1965-'71). Odd and regrettable as it was, the series had noting on 
            its star's life story. Crane's off-TV career ran something of a 
            gamut, from pornographic to preposterous. Making his way from a 
            working class background to minor celebrity and seeming suburban 
            bliss, he was eventually, irrevocably entangled in his own desire, 
            his self-absorption and self-delusion. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Bob Crane met a 
            brutal end: he was bludgeoned to death in his Phoenix, Arizona condo 
            in 1978. This instrument is at once telling, ludicrous, and 
            pathetic: he was murdered with one of the tripods he used to make 
            sex tapes. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Indeed, 
            following the killing, a blood-lusting press dug all the dirt it 
            might have desired: Crane was a sex addict, amassing thousands of 
            photographs and tapes, many created in league with his buddy John 
            Carpenter (played here by Schrader regular Willem Dafoe), a 
            conniving hanger-on once employed by Sony (which gave him access to 
            emerging recording technologies) who was, some years later, tried 
            and acquitted of Crane's brutal murder. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Recently, and 
            no doubt egged on by the film's promoters, diverse media have taken 
            up Crane's story. The ex-wives, Anne and Patti, have appeared on TV, 
            extolling their beloved Bob's big heart (each remembering him as 
            hers). <i>E! True Hollywood Story</i> aired an episode this past 
            weekend, with emphasis on the John Carpenter trial and the lingering 
            pathos and mystery. And in late September, the <i>New York Times 
            Magazine</i> ran an article by Lynn Hirschberg (perhaps most famous 
            for writing the Courtney-Love-did-heroin-while-pregnant story that 
            so enraged the ailing Kurt Cobain), which details some of the 
            fallout from Crane's excesses: the unhappy marriages, that Bobby, 
            fifty-one, his son from his first marriage to high school sweetheart 
            Anne, served as consultant for the movie; another son, Scotty, 
            thirty-one, is publicly disparaging Schrader's version of his dad; 
            he also maintains a website featuring his father's sex tapes. 
            Kooky.&nbsp;</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Schrader's 
            version of Bob Crane, based on Michael Gerbosi's script, adapted 
            from Robert Graysmith's book <i>The Murder of Bob Crane</i>, is less 
            particular, less passionate, and probably less moralistic than these 
            others. Schrader's Crane is a victim of his own weaknesses, 
            succumbing to the Hollywood-induced fiction that you can be who you 
            want to be. Hardly transgressive, Crane's sordid silliness provides 
            another occasion for the filmmaker to detail the duplicities and 
            repressions of U.S. consumer culture. Believing that his celebrity, 
            however paltry or fleeting, allows him access to fulfillment of all 
            desire, Crane avidly pursues his whimsy, with no apparent 
            understanding of its shallowness. (Or, alternatively, he's so 
            painfully self-aware of his absurdity that he bends to it, seeking 
            self-destruction.)&nbsp;</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">For all its 
            dedication to showing Bob's excesses and misapprehensions, the film 
            opens with credits, under Angelo Badalamenti's slick-jazzy score, 
            that posit a peculiar distance from its subject. Martini glasses, 
            bikinis and cigarette holders, Hugh Hefner and Polaroid cameras: the 
            images designate an era, a place, a sense of insularity, ease, and 
            privilege. And so: L.A, mythic land of pretty surfaces and preening 
            affects. At the beginning of <i>Auto Focus</i>, In 1964, Bob is 
            working as a radio DJ and amateur drummer. He's in a booth, hamming 
            it up like he's a star already, cajoling his guest, the Lone Ranger 
            Clayton Moore, slapping his cymbal to transition to commercial. Bob 
            has an affable charm, but he's lightweight in every way, including 
            his already visible lack of self-knowledge. &quot;I'm a likeable guy,&quot; he 
            tells his agent Lenny (Ron Leibman), &quot;I need something big. I can be 
            Jack Lemmon.&quot; You get the feeling that he knows his type, but has no 
            notion of his limits.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Lenny comes up 
            with a gig, and no one can anticipate just how big it will be. <i>
            Hogan's Heroes</i>, a Holocaust comedy, looks like a terrible idea, 
            and the network works overtime to preclude offense, inviting press 
            to visit with the players, emphasizing their good intentions, their 
            sweetness and &quot;likeability.&quot; Bob is the ostensibly perfect 
            interview, prepared, pleasant, and ostensibly impermeable. </font>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The front 
            becomes obsessive and thematic: Bob's performance continues on and 
            offscreen. When his wife Anne (Rita Wilson) finds a stack of what 
            she calls &quot;shady magazines&quot; hidden in a drawer (<i>Nature Girls 1965</i>), 
            she's furious: &quot;No wonder you never look at me anymore!&quot; Bob hangs 
            his head and acts like he's sheepish and sorry, but he's entered 
            into a world, within himself, from which he will not emerge. </font>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">He's encouraged 
            on this journey by Carp, cunning and conniving and terminally 
            obtuse. Coming on like he's a fan of the TV show, Carp offers Bob a 
            way to make his own &quot;shady&quot; images, via video tape. &quot;I'm sort of 
            freelance,&quot; says Carp, selling himself as much as he's selling any 
            products for Sony. He takes Bob on a date, to a strip club, and here 
            Bob finds his apparent calling: he sits in on drums during the 
            girls' dances. John arranges for double dates at his home, premised 
            on girls wanting to party with Celebrity Bob, and before long, Bob 
            is sliding down his own very slippery slope. He leaves Anne for his
            <i>Hogan's</i> costar Patti (Maria Bello), who agrees, initially, to 
            go along with his &quot;open marriage&quot; policy. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">All this 
            activity is too much for any one man to manage. Increasingly, Bob 
            can't keep track of differences between his fantasy life and his 
            real life, and his multiple roles begin to collapse. His loss of 
            self (and self-control) is particularly evident in the film's set 
            piece, Bob's hallucinatory near-breakdown on the <i>Hogan's</i> set: 
            the lights turn salacious red, Bob and Helga (Patti's character) get 
            busy on Colonel Klink's desk, and soon enough, Klink (Werner 
            Klemperer, played by Kurt Fuller) joins in. Horrified that he's so 
            out of control, Bob thinks -- for a minute -- that he might need to 
            cut back. But his addiction is his life; he has no choice, and finds 
            ways to justify and make sense of his excesses. Sex is &quot;natural,&quot; he 
            tells Lenny. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">At the same 
            time, Bob has some dim sense that his behavior is not quite 
            &quot;normal.&quot; But he can, conveniently, project any &quot;depravity&quot; onto 
            Carp. As <i>Auto Focus</i> has it, Bob's pathology is of a piece 
            with Carp's vulgar encouragement, desperate solicitousness, and most 
            especially, the technology they use to document their exploits. As 
            Carp keeps coming with new and improved equipment, cameras, 
            monitors, and tripods, the pornography becomes a kind of end in 
            itself: they watch it together, jerking off in tandem. When, at one 
            point, Bob sees John's hand on him in one sex tape, he has a brief 
            moment of anxiety: &quot;What the hell is that on my ass!?&quot; John 
            apologizes, promises never to do it again: they're no perverts, 
            after all. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">It's this 
            absolute inability to see themselves that most clearly indicts Bob 
            and John. Not as perverts per se, but as products of a culture 
            premised on consumption and illusion, endless need and promise. They 
            can't ever get enough, they can't ever see an end. They feed one 
            another's desire, but can't admit to their intimacy. They're 
            miserably, incessantly horny, never satisfied, partners in longing 
            and fear: what if they are so small, so unsatisfied, so pathetic as 
            they feel? </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">At the same 
            time, of course, Bob and John see themselves relentlessly and 
            explicitly, engaged in all manners of sexual behavior on camera. The 
            camera -- the focus -- defines Bob, as Hogan, as interview subject, 
            as sexual entity. At one point, when he's now the ex-star of a 
            cancelled sitcom, Bob is desperate to pick up some girls in a bar, 
            and so asks the bartender to change the channel to a station showing
            <i>Hogan's</i> reruns, so he can pose nearby and then act as though 
            he's so surprised that anyone would recognize him. Bob may have lost 
            himself, but he preserves himself as well, in that TV image. </font>
