<font face="Verdana" size="6">Citizen Kaufman<br>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="5">Prepare to be Tromatized by<br>
the Father of the Toxic Avenger<br>
</font><i><font size="1" face="Verdana">interview by <a href="../kj.html" target="_top">KJ 
Doughton</a>, 22 March 2002</font></i></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like the <i>Toxic Avenger</i> gutting a 
corrupt, hippo-sized mayor by jamming a noxious hand into the villain’s flabby 
belly, Troma Films CEO Lloyd Kaufman is throwing verbal jabs as he speaks his 
mind at a quaint coffee shop on the north end of Tacoma’s Proctor District.&nbsp; 
&quot;The Sundance Film Festival is bogus,&quot; the outspoken renegade claims. &quot;They hate 
filmmakers, and they’re not really independent.&quot; </font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the take-no-prisoners manner of <i>Terror 
Firmer</i>’s sexually conflicted killer treating a college numbskull to a beer 
enema and bong bludgeoning, the Yale graduate and father of three calls 
Hollywood a maker of &quot;baby-food movies, run by a Satanic conspiracy of elites.&quot;&nbsp;
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like an aggressive Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD zapping 
a crime lord with his heat-seeking chopsticks, Kaufman scoffs at the Independent 
Film Channel. &quot;IFC are [sic] owned by a giant media conglomerate. They should be 
called FIF, for ‘F*ck Independent Film.’&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Spouting off louder than the Draino-chugging, 
hillbilly son from <i>Mother’s Day</i>, Kaufman continues his heartfelt, 
impassioned rant.&nbsp; &quot;I’m not against the mainstream in general. I’m just against 
mainstream people who want to erase images of the World Trade Center from <i>
Friends</i>.&nbsp; They should erase <i>Friends</i> from the World Trade Center -- 
erase those mealy-mouthed little sh*theads from that crappy show.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">By this time, however, the coordinator of 
America’s longest-running independent studio is mellowing out. He edits the 
previous comment by adding, &quot;<i>Friends</i> is funny. I’ll have to admit that.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kaufman goes on to simultaneously praise 
Jennifer Aniston and flex his movie trivia muscles by stating, &quot;She was great in 
the film <i>Office Space</i>, by Mike Judge. She was cute, and funny, and 
subversive. Now, I have a soft spot for her.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Moments later, after the dapper, tie and sport 
jacket-wearing director finishes a tin dish of rainbow sherbet, he smiles at a 
waitress who arrives to clear the table. &quot;Thanks, ma’am,&quot; he acknowledges as she 
carts off his eating utensils and re-fills a coffee cup.&nbsp; Revealing both an 
edgy, maverick spirit and a refined, polite demeanor, this Lloyd Kaufman is a 
complex character, indeed. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Troma Films was born kicking and screaming in 
1974, when Kaufman and Yale college-buddy-turned-business-partner Michael Herz 
cut their teeth with a cluster of sex comedies oriented towards the drive-in 
theater crowds, that preceded such blockbuster, mainstream counterparts as <i>
Porky’s</i> and <i>Animal House. </i>Meanwhile, Kaufman dabbled in larger 
profile Hollywood features as a production assistant, working with director John 
G. Avildsen on a string of early seventies hits including <i>Joe</i>, <i>Cry 
Uncle</i>, and <i>Rocky</i>.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Darting back and forth between the worlds of 
corporate, big studio movies and low budget, exploitation fodder, Kaufman viewed 
filmmaking like a mountain climber might scan Wyoming vistas from various Grand 
Teton peaks.&nbsp; He hunted down places to shoot as a location manager for John 
Badham’s disco classic, <i>Saturday Night Fever</i>. He took on the role of 
production manager for the intimate, highly regarded Louis Malle feature <i>My 
Dinner with Andre. </i>All the while, he’d sneak off from these more respectable 
stints to produce such lowbrow fare as <i>Mother’s Day</i>, about a couple of 
depraved, <i>Deliverance</i>-style crackers who terrorize young girls to please 
their equally sadistic matron.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">However, Troma’s definitive mascot, and 
low-budget cinema’s equivalent to the omnipresent fast-food image of Ronald 
McDonald, was spawned in 1984.&nbsp; <i>The Toxic Avenger</i> followed the grisly 
metamorphosis of wimpy, absent-minded supergeek Melvin Junko, an ill-fated mop 
boy slaving away at Troma Health Club.&nbsp; After being humiliated at the callous 
hands of some murderous, fitness-obsessed jocks, Melvin hurls himself out a 
window and into a barrel of oozing, hazardous slime. Emerging as a muscular 
mound of orange tumors and crime-fighting savvy, Melvin becomes The Toxic 
Avenger and dispatches several depraved crooks in creatively gruesome ways.&nbsp;
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;The action is set in the town of Tromaville,&quot; 
Kaufman explains of the fictional, New Jersey-based locale where<i> The Toxic 
Avenger</i>, and most of Troma’s other features, are based. &quot;The good people 
there are perfectly capable of running their own lives, but there is a 
conspiracy of elites that get in their way.&nbsp; There’s the labor elite, the 
bureaucratic elite, and the corporate elite.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;The three elites conspire to suck dry the 
little people of Tromaville and their economic and spiritual capital,&quot; continues 
Kaufman, revealing a political undertone that weaves through all the severed 
heads and gloppy intestines that more commonly define his work. &quot;Sometimes the 
people need Toxie to save them, or Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD. In <i>Troma’s War</i>, 
they did it themselves. That’s the theme of all of our movies -- that there is a 
conspiracy of elites that must be stopped.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kaufman, who was recently honored alongside 
fellow indie legend John Sayles at the high-profile SXSW Film Festival in 
Austin, Texas, states that this much-hated stew of conglomerates is at the heart 
of what’s wrong with Hollywood today.&nbsp; The fact that studio-owning corporations 
often possess the very theatre chains, video stores, and television networks 
which feed their product to the public ensures that certain movies are 
guaranteed public exposure.&nbsp; Meanwhile, those films not directly thrust into 
such mainstream pipelines are often neglected. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kaufman can definitely talk the talk, but can 
he walk the walk when it comes to support of indie films?&nbsp; His latest endeavor, 
The TromaDance Film Festival, celebrated its third year in January, in the 
rugged, snow-covered confines of Park City. As a deliberate nose thumb at its 
more well-known Utah neighbor, the glitzy, star-studded Sundance Film Festival, 
TromaDance does not charge filmmakers to submit their work.&nbsp; Void of special 
reservations for the rich and famous, TromaDance rolls out the red carpet for 
the average film-loving guy on the street, with free, public screenings of all 
entries.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Some poor sucker trying to get his movie 
exposed to the media can’t hand out leaflets there in Park City,&quot; growls 
Kaufman, denouncing what he perceives as Sundance’s pretentious, spoiled-kid 
vibe. &quot;In fact, two volunteers from TromaDance were put in jail for handing out 
leaflets!&nbsp; The guys from Enron won’t be put in jail, but these people had to 
spend a few nights there.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I’m pissed off that in what is supposed to be 
the freest society on earth, the American Public is denied art. Art is stolen 
from the people. We have to see the same piece of crap on 8,000 screens, like <i>
A Beautiful Mind</i>.&quot; Once again, the low-budget icon edits his statement.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I don’t know that it’s crap,&quot; he reconsiders, 
&quot;but lets face it. Open <i>A Beautiful Mind</i> at a thousand theatres, then let 
five other movies play. Because right now, there are masterpieces from Spain, 
Japan, and Korea, by filmmakers like Takashi Miike, that don’t play here.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Meanwhile, the American public is denied them, 
because we have to see the same movies, wherever we go, and whatever we do. 
Whether you’re in a hotel, or an airplane, or a movie theatre, it’s the same six 
movies. It’s a disgrace. These are baby-food movies, attempting to be all things 
to all people.&nbsp; You can live off baby food, but it’s very boring.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Boring isn’t a term commonly associated with 
Troma’s formula, a liberal stew of breasts, brain-splatter, and irreverent humor 
that makes <i>There’s Something About Mary</i> look like a Merchant-Ivory 
Production in comparison.&nbsp; Meanwhile, its utterly crude and distasteful 
aesthetic is neutralized by the most obviously gut-bucket special effects this 
side of Ed Wood. While the typical Hollywood film runs anywhere from thirty to 
eighty million dollars, Troma’s movies average less than half a million to 
produce.&nbsp; Without state of the art gimmicks, Kaufmann heaps on slapstick action, 
cranberry sauce, and stage blood.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After some particularly villainous robbers hold 
up a Taco joint in the original <i>Toxic Avenger</i> film, its pop-eyed hero 
comes to the rescue with some fast-food combat strategies that must have 
McDonald’s founder Ray Kroc rolling in his grave.&nbsp; One hyperactive goon is 
rendered senseless by some martial arts mayhem before having his lungs ripped 
out by a milkshake mixer.&nbsp; Another offender becomes a human pizza, shoved into 
an oven to bake long into the evening. The <b><i>pièce de résistance</i></b> 
involves a third thug’s hands being thrust into hot oil, his fingers immersed in 
the boiling goo like ten overcooked french fries.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;We filmed that scene all night,&quot; he reveals. 
&quot;The guy who owned the restaurant was a big Troma fan, and he let us shoot there 
for nothing.&nbsp; Because the Taco scene was set during the daytime, a lot of the 
shots are filmed facing away from the windows, so that people wouldn’t see that 
it was dark outside.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kaufman, whose Troma acquisitions catalog 
boasts over 1,000 titles, recently completed a second book on such low budget 
filmmaking secrets, <i>Make Your Own Damn Movie</i>. Slated for a Christmas 
season release, the book will be available through St. Martin’s Press.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Occasionally, an effect that deviates from the 
director’s specific vision can turn into a major coup. Case in point: Toxie’s 
hideous yet adorable mug, which brings to mind the hairless, radiated bean of <i>
The Road Warrior</i>’s main scourge, Humongus, cloned with comic book sensation 
Swamp Thing. &quot;I wanted Toxie to be much more disgusting looking,&quot; he confesses. 
&quot;Jenny Aspinall, the gal whom we hired to create his look, kept coming back with 
this kind of lovable, lump-headed guy. I kept telling her to make the skin more 
oozing. Then I ran out of time and money, and had to shoot. She deserves the 
credit, because everybody loves Toxie. Whatever she did, it’s magic.&quot; </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Magic, indeed. Since <i>The Toxic Avenger</i>’s 
mid-eighties debut, its title character has become a major franchise. His name 
and slime-slathered likeness can be found on comic book covers, lunch boxes, 
board and video games, model kits, and Halloween masks.&nbsp; He frequently haunts 
the Cannes Film Festival, and has marched in the Macy’s Thanksgiving Day 
Parade.&nbsp; </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Tacoma’s Proctor District is an upper-class 
nook in North Tacoma, a few blocks south of Commencement Bay and a western 
border to the expensive, private campus of University of Puget Sound.&nbsp; It’s a 
haunt known more for its coffee shops, antique stores, and quaint, restored 
nineteenth-century homes than for norm-challenging eccentricity. In fact, it 
could almost be the West Coast version of Tromaville.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yet, the town sheds its polite, disciplined 
demeanor each Saturday night, as the Blue Mouse Theater hosts everybody’s 
favorite interactive midnight movie, <i>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</i>. The 
weekend ritual attracts a colorful freak show of neighborhood nonconformists who 
eschew Proctor’s refined vibe. Even though it’s Troma Thursday, and Tim Curry’s 
spandex ‘n mascara clad form is nowhere to be seen, the same motley crew from <i>
Rocky Horror</i> have taken over the cinema, anxious to be the first in 
Washington to view <i>Citizen Toxie: The Toxic Avenger Part IV</i>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There’s Sparky, a lumbering man-mountain with 
the blonde, untamed mane of Metallica frontman James Hetfield. Sparky spouts 
Troma trivia from the Blue Mouse’s front row, and grips a video copy of Troma’s
<i>Class of Nuke ‘em High</i> for Kaufman to sign.&nbsp; With his Harry Knowles-sized 
profile, Sparky claims to be the movie house’s unofficial bouncer, and proudly 
states that Troma movies and Iron Maiden music are his two greatest passions in 
life. His friend, a dark-haired geek sporting an oriental, silk shirt and 
carting around a special edition of <i>Terror Firmer</i>, hopes to get the tape 
autographed by Kaufman. It seems that most of the Rocky Horror regulars are on 
hand to be Tromatized.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Others, like the middle-aged couples and 
college students taking advantage of the free March screening after seeing it 
advertised as part of a University of Washington Arts &amp; Lecture Series, might 
have been expecting an ecology documentary.&nbsp; Instead, they watch as Kaufman, the 
event’s guest of honor, saunters up the left aisle alongside a mop-wielding 
likeness of Toxie himself. Trailing behind them is Sgt. Kabukiman NYPD, another 
Troma celebrity, who shares the spotlight as the trio is mobbed by about a dozen 
hardcore fans.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Troma President is greeted by another wave 
of rabid applause as he introduces the fourth <i>Toxic Avenger</i> installment. 
&quot;I think that <i>The Toxic Avenger</i> series is the only set of movies to 
feature someone’s head getting crushed by an automobile, before getting turned 
into a children’s cartoon.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The middle-aged couple suddenly grows wary, 
sensing that perhaps they aren’t ready to enter Troma’s grisly universe just 
yet.&nbsp; However, Sparky and his cronies are poised for maximum splatter, howling 
up front as the lights grow dim.&nbsp; Hail, Toxie.</font></p>
