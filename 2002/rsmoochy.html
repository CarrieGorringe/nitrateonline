            <b><font size="2" face="Verdana">As Sheldon Mopes, the eponymous 
            hero of the black comedy <i>Death to Smoochy</i>,&nbsp; Edward Norton 
            strums the guitar while wearing a funny, helmet-like headdress that 
            is supposed to transform him into Smoochy the Rhino, an ambassador 
            of gladness who extols the virtues of good living, eating right, and 
            always finding the positive side to everything. (One of Sheldon's 
            vast repetoire of songs is about how children should respond to 
            grumpy stepfathers, &quot;He's Not Mean, He's Adjusting.”) The children's 
            cable channel executives who latch onto him and plan to vault him to 
            celebrity status think that he's too good to be true, but, the fact 
            is, he is...absolutely true.</font></b></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Edward Norton locates exactly the 
            spark that would make Sheldon sweet, genuine, and unimpeachable in 
            the strength of his convictions in such a way that would win over 
            even the toughest cookies, including one TV executive played by 
            Catherine Keener (basically playing the same character she played in
            <i>Being John Malkovich</i>, only, if you can imagine it, much 
            tougher). The story becomes a journey whereby we watch and see 
            whether Sheldon will prove to be indomitable over even the cruelest 
            of circumstances that come his way.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The picture, which Danny De Vito 
            directed from an original screenplay by Adam Resnick, captures the 
            fast-track quality of the commercial television industry, where 
            everyone's a commodity and popularity can hurtle up and down on a 
            day-to-day basis. (Resnick previously worked as a writer on HBO's 
            astonishingly acerbic TV satire <i>The Larry Sanders Show</i>.) But 
            its depiction of television as a fish tank where the piranhas are 
            feeding on each other feels awfully familiar, especially after you 
            realize that you're supposed to judge the characters' worth in the 
            picture based on how many cuss words they use. (<i>Network</i>, 
            anyone?) The irony of the world of children's television being as 
            cutthroat as any other branch of television comes as no surprise to 
            anyone who's followed the real-life travails of John Kricfalusi and
            <i>The Ren and Stimpy Show</i> during the last ten years.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Sheldon's playful character Smoochy 
            is replacing the disgraced Rainbow Randolph, who was -- gasp! -- 
            caught taking bribes. We don't see very much of Randolph's show -- 
            which may be the point, it's a totally disposable product, albeit 
            with a creepy Dayglo-and-Formica look that brings to mind the Sid 
            and Marty Kroff nightmare programs of the Seventies, and with a 
            theme song whose lyrics sound like they're supposed to be sneaky 
            double-entendres -- so we don't know what we're missing. Instead, 
            the film plunges immediately into Randolph's vilest depths of 
            misery, and Robin Williams' portrayal of Randolph is a weirdly 
            disagreeable, one-note turn. He seems to emphasize the most 
            vitriolic, spiteful, squalid, and encrusted qualities -- Randolph 
            isn't just a phony, he's a veritable black hole of negative energy, 
            but Williams nonetheless seems to be playing him within a very 
            narrow emotional range, even after Randolph has a putative 
            change-of-heart near the end. Until then, he attempts to disgrace 
            Smoochy by associating him with Nazis; later, he tries to immolate 
            himself in Times Square, and even that doesn't work right. 
            Randolph's efforts should take cosmic proportions of some sort, but 
            they don't.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The picture itself jacks up its 
            increasing sense of craziness as it reaches its climax, a huge ice 
            show during which Sheldon/Smoochy seems to be finally succumbing to 
            the swan song of celebrity self-aggrandizement. The scene itself 
            manages to also reference half a dozen other movies, including <i>
            The Parallax View</i> and <i>The Manchurian Candidate</i>.&nbsp; By this 
            time, a whole score of people are after Smoochy, either out of 
            jealousy, resentfulness, or just plain craziness. Edward Norton's 
            performance, consistent to the end, turns out to be the best (make 
            that very best) thing about <i>Death to Smoochy</i>; the film 
            itself, though, takes a nasty spill at about the one-hour mark, and 
            never fully recovers. It tries to get high on its own sense of 
            dizziness and whacked-out plot occurrences, but, like one of its 
            very own characters, it just ends up being buggy.</font></td>
