            at the Retail Rodeo isn't so much fun as it might sound. Sure,
            Justine (Jennifer Aniston) has experience on the cash register and
            it's not like anyone puts much energy into shopping there, so that
            part is easy enough. And working at the makeup counter, which she
            does occasionally, might break up the routine. A little. But the
            routine always returns with a vengeance. And Justine is weary. You
            can see it in her slight slump, her shambling feet and slow-motion
            hands.<o:p>

            a girl,&quot; Justine says as <i>The Good Girl</i> begins, &quot;you
            see the world as a giant candy store filled with sweet candy and
            such.&quot; Now thirty, she gazes from her register, and the view is
            definitely not sweet; the camera looks out a window-wall to the
            mostly empty parking lot. When you're older, Justine sighs, you
            realize that you're locked up in a prison. No way out. She doesn't
            even imagine escape. Instead, she's &quot;good&quot; -- responsible,
            quiet, resigned until she aches. <o:p>

            folks in Justine's small East Texas nowhere find vague, generally
            ineffective ways &quot;out.&quot; Her housepainter husband Phil
            (John C. Reilly) escapes by smoking pot with his partner and best
            friend since high school, Bubba (Tim Blake Nelson). Coworker Cheryl
            (Zooey Deschanel) dresses &quot;punk&quot; and rolls her eyes at the
            middle-aged ladies who shuffle through her checkout line, Corny
            (Mike White, who wrote the script), the security guard down at the
            Retail Rodeo, finds solace in Bible study. Her coworker, Gwen
            (Deborah Rush), makes sense of her life by &quot;saving&quot; women
            at the makeup counter. And their boss (John Carroll Lynch) feels
            best when he's announcing something -- pretty much anything -- over
            the store's PA system, accompanied by an &quot;appropriate&quot;
            song of his own choosing (following one employee's unexpected death,
            Kate Smith's &quot;I'll Be Seeing You&quot;). <o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Into
            Justine's black hole of a routine walks Holden (Jake Gyllenhaal),
            glowering, self-consciously poetic, urgent. Born Tom (&quot;my slave
            name&quot;), he has taken his current name in honor of his favorite
            book, <i>Catcher in the Rye</i> (when he tells Justine this, she
            asks if his name is &quot;Catcher&quot;). At first, the two share
            lunchtime conversations, sitting at a picnic bench -- he regales her
            with the plots of stories he's writing, all involving doomed teen
            romance, suicidal inclinations, and desperate emotions.
            Anxious-making, perhaps, or maybe just trite: what little you do
            hear of his prose, mostly via Justine's reading aloud, is florid and
            clunky. But it's also full of passion. Justine can relate. &quot;I
            was looking at you in the store and I liked how you kept to
            yourself,&quot; she tells him. &quot;I saw in your eyes that you
            hate the world. I hate it too.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Their
            evolution from friendship to sexual trysting down at the local motel
            occurs awkwardly and earnestly. Each is surprised and grateful to
            be, as they put it, &quot;gotten&quot; (as in, &quot;You get
            me&quot;). But somewhere between walking past Holden's parents in
            the TV room and hiding out at the motel, Justine starts thinking
            that the affair isn't quite what she anticipated; like a lot of
            teenaged boys who feel their futures are crap, he's morose and
            possessive. She feels guilty about Phil. And there is that great gap
            in their ages: she tells Holden, &quot;You're a writer, so you have
            a goal, I guess.&quot; As for herself, recalling that once she
            looked forward to running through that candy store, Justine says,
            &quot;Now I don't even know what to imagine anymore.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            situation turns even gloomier when Bubba spots the lovers leaving
            the motel one afternoon, and proceeds to blackmail Justine, for whom
            he has always carried something of a torch. Actually, this
            description doesn't quite cover it: Bubba wants to be Phil,
            believing, because his own life is so miserable, that their married
            life is perfect, or more to the point, that sex with Justine is a
            defining experience. Such a convolution of logic -- and the way
            Bubba uses it like a blunt instrument against the woman he purports
            to &quot;love&quot; -- is awful but not surprising in a film written
            by Mike White and directed by Miguel Arteta, whose <i>Chuck &amp;
            Buck</i> plumbed similar depths of human longing and manipulation,
            with similar legerdemain. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>

            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Unlike
            <i>Chuck &amp; Buck</i>, however, <i>The Good Girl</i> gives viewers
            a break, particularly in making Justine more conventionally
            sympathetic than the difficult Buck. Some viewers will miss the
            first film's relentlessness, but rather than contrast the two films,
            it seems more useful to see them as part of an ongoing process, a
            darkly comic exploration of relationships among characters who don't
            know how to maintain them. Where <i>Chuck &amp; Buck</i> considers
            childlike &quot;innocence&quot; (even in manipulation), <i>The Good
            Girl</i> looks at goodness as another form of innocence, equally
            imposed and equally costly, a means of wreaking havoc, of shaping
            fragile and necessary bonds. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            movie delves into Justine's frustrations, her non-options (at one
            point, she's literally at a crossroads, a traffic light, where she
            must choose between Holden and Phil, an unknown future and an
            all-too-known present). And it does so without condescending to her
            or treating her limited understanding as a lack of intelligence (and
            the heaps of praise for Aniston's performance are well-deserved). At
            first, Justine believes that being &quot;good&quot; is a matter of
            following rules, of not rocking boats. But when a friend dies
            suddenly, and freakishly, she is not so much moved or even
            frightened by the loss as she is galvanized to rethink her
            relationships, less in terms of herself than others.</span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">&nbsp;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Still,
            that's not to say that <i>The Good Girl</i> goes all soft, locates a
            moral ground for being &quot;good,&quot; or even asserts a model of
            decent behavior in a cold, cruel, hateful world. Smartly and
            disturbingly, it resists any such resolution. Superficially, the
            finale looks like one you'd see in another movie, involving a
            familial unit and smiles all around -- a finale where the limited
            choices are somehow justified, celebrated, or just made bearable.
            Not in this movie. Here, the unit is uncertain and the smiles aren't
            so comforting as you might wish they were. Justine has been gotten,
            and she's still trying to be good. <o:p>
