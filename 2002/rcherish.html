            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s a peculiar condition of modern 
            life that the more pressed among us will fantasize about being 
            incarcerated. Think of all the reading prison would give you time 
            for, or the novel you could write if you were locked up for several 
            months. None of these intellectual pastimes, however, seem to occur 
            to Zoe, the needy motor mouth under house arrest in Finn Taylor’s 
            new film. For Zoe, being alone with herself is her worst source of 
            anxiety. </font></b></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Zoe 
            (Robin Tunney) is pretty enough to date frequently, even 
            compulsively, unable to sit still in her hard-earned San Francisco 
            condo. To her therapist’s (a grossly underutilized Lindsay Crouse) 
            chastisement for such profligate dating habits, Zoe speculates, &quot;I 
            don’t think I’d go out with so many if any one of them would call me 
            back.&quot;</font></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><font face="Verdana" size="2">How a 
            woman so accessible acquires a secret stalker is one of the larger 
            mysteries in this film that oscillates between a suspense thriller 
            and romantic comedy. One would think the mysterious stranger spends 
            enough time observing her to learn the word that will snag Zoe’s 
            frenetic interest – it’s “Hello.” Nevertheless, in a bungled 
            carjacking meant to abduct her, he runs over a policeman and flees 
            the scene, leaving her to take the blame. </font></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Fearful 
            of prison, Zoe agrees to participate in the electronic bracelet 
            program, which allows her to serve her pre-trial incarceration in a 
            low-rent loft (having to sell her condo to pay for her unsympathetic 
            attorney).&nbsp; This requires regular visits from Bill (Tim Blake 
            Nelson), the technician who installs and monitors the technology 
            that assures Zoe remains within the apartment. Bill, of course, 
            begins to fall in love with the defiant young woman who insists on 
            her unprovable innocence.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The story 
            proceeds as Zoe tries to find ways to cope with her boredom, and to 
            find ways of stretching the limits of her bonds. She makes friends 
            with a wheelchair-bound, pugnacious (and gay, and Jewish) dwarf in 
            the same building – albeit a limited one since she can’t go 
            downstairs and he can’t ascend them. Ultimately, she needs to 
            determine who her stalker his and get the police to catch him – for 
            which, in her circumscribed state, she needs allies.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Finn 
            Taylor’s second directorial effort is as amusing and light as the 
            70s and 80s pop music it uses as its soundtrack, yet it pulses with 
            lurking ambition to be a bigger, studio film. Watching Tunney’s 
            neurotic Zoe flail, one senses the role beckoning for Sandra 
            Bullock. Instead of Nelson as the nerdy technician, John Cusack 
            might have taken it on. It’s no slight to these actors, who give the 
            roles flesh with due diligence. It’s just that trifles like this 
            usually rely on the charisma of stars to smooth over such a 
            formulaic and frequently implausible story.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For 
            example, placing the attractive Tunney in a Rosanna Rosanadana 
            hairstyle is reminiscent of the adage that Hollywood’s idea of an 
            ugly woman is a beautiful one in glasses. Of course, she loses that 
            feature quickly once she is confined, ironing her hair to produce 
            her “real” look and clumsily signaling that Zoe will undergo inner 
            change.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As the 
            film proceeds, one can feel the plot points clicking into place, 
            like tumblers in a combination lock. First we get the character and 
            her need established, then the dramatic event, followed by conflicts 
            A, B and C. There’s little surprise or commentary here, just a sound 
            delivery of entertainment.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><font face="Verdana" size="2">What’s 
            wrong with that? Well, nothing much. It’s what we get on television 
            all the time – for free. It’s also what we’re accustomed to having 
            in the summer, a jolly piece of unchallenging distraction. Still, 
            it’s not what one would likely expect from a small, moderate-budget 
            film. <i>Cherish</i> is bright and fun, but disappointingly average. 
            One might have hoped that an independent film might have made better 
            use of its liberty.</font><!--webbot bot="Include" U-Include="fsiff02-indx.htm" TAG="BODY" startspan --><strong>[Shared Documents/General/Website/2002/fsiff02-indx.htm]</strong><!--webbot bot="Include" i-checksum="16614" endspan --></td>
