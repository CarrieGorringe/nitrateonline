Vary, Czech Republic, 05 July) Sean Connery, Michael York, Stellan Skarsgard, 
critic Roger Ebert and <i>Deliverance</i> director John Boorman are just a few 
of the international stars either already in attendance or expected shortly for 
the thirty-seventh edition of thi</font></b><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">s 
sprawling but somehow intimate festival in the spa city of Karlovy Vary, about 
an hour west of Prague by speeding festival limousine.</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Close to three hundred films will unspool in 
some thirteen programmatic sections throughout the festival, which opened 04 
July with a gala screening of the Czech rock’n’roll mockumentary <i>Year of the 
Devil</i> and runs until 13 July, when brothers and <i>American Pie</i> 
directors Paul and Chris Weitz will present the Czech premiere of the Hugh Grant 
comedy <i>About a Boy</i>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There’s a competition section for fiction 
features and another for documentaries, which is where most of the festival 
surprises (good and bad) will be revealed. The handful of special event 
screenings include York presenting the 1972 Bob Fosse musical <i>Cabaret</i>, 
Boorman presiding over his own private print of <i>Deliverance</i>. The section 
dubbed &quot;Horizons&quot; gathers films with hot word-of-mouth from other festivals, 
while the &quot;Forum of Independents&quot; spotlights more adventurous international 
production. &quot;East of the West&quot; offers rare glimpses of films from the other half 
of Europe, while Czech films themselves are displayed in their very own sidebar.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The competition jury is headed by French 
actor-director Jean-Marc Barr, and members include Spanish actress Assumpta 
Serna, <i>Legend of Rita</i> star Bibiana Beglau and Ebert (who received a wild 
round of applause when he was introduced to the throng on opening night).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">One of the more distinctive elements of Karlovy 
Vary is the local audiences: each year throngs of students descend on the town 
and wait hours in line for screening tickets. They also juice up the nightlife 
nicely, as hot regional bands and DJs can be found performing in clubs, bars and 
even outdoors virtually every night of the festival.</font></p>
