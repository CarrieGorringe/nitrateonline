            <font face="Verdana" size="5">28th Seattle International Film 
            Festival</font><p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">With the Catholic 
            Church currently facing landmark sexual-abuse lawsuits, it might 
            have seemed somewhat inappropriate to release a film with the 
            provocative title, <i>The Dangerous Lives of Altar Boys</i>, but 
            this story, adapted from Chris Fuhrman's first and only novel, 
            explores different issues. Set in the early 70's, <i>Dangerous</i> 
            revolves around a group of boys led by Tim Sullivan (Kieran Culkin) 
            and his ever-loyal friend Francis Doyle (Emile Hirsch). The boys, 
            possessing considerable talent, illustrate their own comic books, 
            under the title of &quot;Atomic Trilogy,&quot; with three superheroes who 
            fight off the vicious villain &quot;Nun-Zilla&quot;. The source of their 
            creativity is clear-cut: both Tim and Francis are caught within 
            Catholic families that are both emotionally repressed and perilously 
            close to collapse. Moreover, they must deal with their own &quot;nun-zilla&quot;, 
            Sister Assumpta: (Jodie Foster, in a performance so excessively 
            mannered that it borders upon inadvertent parody), who seems to take 
            an absolute (if perhaps unrealized) delight in denying her charges 
            any sort of pleasure under the guise that it will corrupt their 
            souls. Caught between both impenetrable worlds, in an era in which 
            moral guidance was a difficult, if not impossible, concept to 
            define, the boys retreat into their own private existence, and plot 
            to pull off a daring raid that will raise their status with their 
            fellow students. Tim and Francis soon discover, however, that the 
            line between derring-do and risk may be as ambiguously defined as 
            everything else in their lives. </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As the center of the piece Culkin 
            and especially Hirsch give evocative performances that honestly 
            capture the fact that, underneath all their bravado, lies two 
            children crying out for acceptance and guidance. The animated 
            sequences (brilliantly crafted by Todd McFarlane, he of the 
            comic-book series, <i>Spawn</i>) that punctuate the main action are 
            powerful, and accurately breathe life into the boys' comic-book 
            images, acting as the boys' alter egos -- a counterpart to their 
            impotence within their own lives. Director Peter Case sensitively 
            encapsulates the contradictory elements within Tim and Francis' 
            lives -- their first loves, their triumphs and miseries -- and 
            displays them in a form that doesn't dismiss their struggles as 
            simply the insubstantial whining of &quot;typical&quot; teenagers. Case evokes 
            a version of the past that has the feel of authenticity about it. 
            Although the film treats the tragi-comic elements of the boys' 
            relationship with tenderness, the film is not an exercise in 
            nostalgia; the harsh effects of reality that can limit Tim and 
            Francis' dreams are never far away. The film also works because it 
            doesn't treat the other elements of the boys' world as mere ciphers: 
            it's clear that everyone and everything else, from parents to the 
            Catholic church itself, is struggling to do the right thing even if, 
            like the boys themselves, the solutions aren't always clear or the 
            outcomes inappropriate and/or inadequate. This two-pronged approach 
            places Dangerous far above other films in the &quot;coming of age&quot; film 
            genre.</font></p>
