            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>High Crimes</i> is the sort of 
            woman-in-peril schlock that you usually see, being played out by 
            B-level actors, on Lifetime Television any Saturday or Sunday 
            afternoon -- which makes the involvement, here, of Morgan Freeman 
            and director Carl Franklin even more bewildering.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;The military have set-up your 
            husband,&quot; says one character early on, and that pretty much sums up 
            the entire picture. A successful, high-powered attorney (Ashley 
            Judd) -- who looks great in a dress suit, and can talk about sports 
            with the boys -- sees her husband (Jim Caviezel) arrested, rather 
            forcefully, and carted off to a U.S. Marine Corps base to face 
            charges before a court-martial. The attorney takes on her husband's 
            defense to find out just what they are: instigating a massacre in an 
            El Salvador village while operating as part of an elite paramilitary 
            unit in the country during the 1980s. She then seeks help from 
            another attorney (played by Freeman), who comes highly recommended 
            but also has a reputation for being a drunkard. The attorney's 
            husband looks soulfully into her eyes, tears falling, and tells her 
            he didn't do it; we wait to see whether or not he really, truly did, 
            after all. We also wait to see how long it's going to be before 
            Freeman's character falls off the wagon. Various other things ensue, 
            such as attempts on the main characters' lives.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Carl Franklin tries to stage this 
            with an emphasis on character action that would bring some further 
            dimension and life to the material, and, as in his previous films -- 
            from <i>One False Move</i> (1992) to <i>Devil in a Blue Dress</i> 
            (1995) and <i>One True Thing</i> (1998) -- he gets very good work 
            from the actors. Judd and Freeman work very comfortably together 
            (they had previously appeared in <i>Kiss the Girls</i>, back in 
            1997), and Caviezel even looks less sleepy than usual, while Amanda 
            Peet does about as good a job as anyone could with an almost 
            hopeless part (the younger sister of Judd's character, who's as much 
            of a wreck as she's composed and immaculately groomed), and Adam 
            Scott does a more than perfectly fine job playing the somewhat-green 
            Marine attorney who's appointed to the husband's defense. The 
            excellent Bruce Davison also achieves, in only a few scenes, a 
            masterfully creepy turn as a distrustful Brigadier General.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Franklin almost, but can't quite, 
            make the dumbbell ending work, though. and the film's coda 
            inadvertently turns the picture into a TV pilot -- <i>The Further 
            Adventures of Ashley and Morgan</i>, so to speak.<i>&nbsp; </i>I suspect 
            that Morgan Freeman is taking roles in movies like this and <i>Along 
            Came a Spider</i> because they're allow him to maintain his dignity 
            and stature as an actor while doing a perfectly respectable job of 
            acting in the films themselves. There are moments, though, in <i>
            High Crimes</i> where he exercises his craft in such a way as to 
            make you realize, with a jolt, just how very, very good an actor 
            this guy can be. He needs material that is of the same caliber as 
            his acting abilities, rather than beneath them.</font></td>
