            part-time film critics don't have the opportunity, or the luxury
            (you try watching 300 movies a year AND earning a living), to watch
            a film twice before writing a review. Granted when I spout out 800
            words per film I tend to spend more time writing about a film that I
            spent enraptured, bored, or otherwise entertained by it. Among
            critics, I'm in the minority, as I like to take notes during
            screenings. My writing process generally works better when I
            scramble through my scrawl and find an important phrase, nuance,
            etc. worth mentioned.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p style="tab-stops:225.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So much
            for this meandering introduction. Why, you're now wondering, did I
            even extrapolate? Well, the first time I caught <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Solaris</i>,
            Steven Soderbergh's solemn update to the thirty-year-old Russian
            epic by celebrated Soviet director Andrei Tarkovsky, based on Polish
            sci-fi author Stanislaw Lem's 1961 philosophical novel, I forgot it
            was on my review schedule. I thought it plodding, boring, and dull.
            George Clooney moons at the sterile camera and barely emotes. If
            this film were a mood ring, it would register as black leader.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p style="tab-stops:225.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">A second
            viewing, armed with my trusty light-pen and a wife who hadn't seen
            it yet, brought her the same feeling I had the first go-round. As
            for me, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Solaris</i> was still a deliberately, glacially paced extra-terrestrial
            journey, but my admiration for this high-gloss art-house project,
            produced by Mr. Titanic, James Cameron, was elevated by some
            audacious determination by the filmmakers to tackle such a difficult
            remake and attempting to deliver to the masses a psychological
            exploration of mankind's inner depths in outer space.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p style="tab-stops:225.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Soderbergh's
            version is a compressed vision, by half, of the nearly three-hour
            Tarkovsky edition (recently released on DVD), but often feels twice
            at long. It runs just ninety-five minutes. Yet everything is
            designed to draw this time-defying illusion. A bleak, intimate
            landscape; lingering views of a fractally luminescent planet;
            claustrophobic camera shots; truth-seeking dialogue that races along
            at the speed of a turtle. Add in an existential,
            time/thought-jumping plot, which apparently sticks fairly close to
            Lem's themes, a too barren touch of mystery, and it's no wonder this
            film, despite such popular box office names attached to it, will
            challenge any normal audience.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p style="tab-stops:225.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">That's
            the problem. Soderbergh's made his thirteenth feature (I hope he's
            not superstitious) as another experimental, pet project. That's two
            in a row. You've already forgotten (I have) his digitally shot <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Full
            Frontal</i>, an experience that caused a far worse stampede for the
            handful of exasperated souls who attended a nearby multiplex
            second-week screening.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p style="tab-stops:225.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Fans of
            Lem's most popular book, especially those who read the original
            language version, will undoubtedly wax fantastic on the film. My
            sci-fi leanings have been toward Robert Heinlein, and I suspect most
            audiences going to a George Clooney and/or Steven Soderbergh and/or
            James Cameron film will not savor the somewhat obscure literary
            background that so enamored these three individuals to make this
            adaptation.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p style="tab-stops:225.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Let's
            talk plotline. Chris Kelvin (Clooney) is a dreary, workaholic
            psychologist hiding well his daily dysfunction, caused by what we
            eventually determine to be the death of his doting, doe-eyed wife
            Rheya (Natascha McElhone). His association with the
            NASA-turned-commercial space program examining the strange, swirling
            world of Solaris makes him the primary choice to single-handedly
            rendezvous with an exploratory mission that has gone inexplicably
            awry. Upon arrival he is warned by the cryptic Snow (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Saving
            Private Ryan</i>'s Jeremy Davis) and a determined-to-overcome
            science officer Gordon (Viola Davis) of strange, unearthly
            happenings. Kelvin's friend, Commander Gibarian (Ulrich Tukur), took
            his own life sometime after sending out the original distress call.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p style="tab-stops:225.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As Kelvin
            tries to unravel the Solarian shenanigans on a purely psychological
            level, he, like the rest of the real or not-so-real members of the
            crew, the ghost of Gibarian, and a wife apparently back from the
            dead, all get confused about life's ultimate meaning.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p style="tab-stops:225.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you
            can get past all the esoteric baggage littering the runway, there's
            a visually stunning film created by Soderbergh, who photographed it
            under the pseudonym Peter Andrews. With the help of production
            designer Philip Messina, there are obvious <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">2001</i>
            markings. Even the monolith makes a brief appearance in the guise of
            the seemingly indestructible manifestation of Rheya. Soderbergh also
            borrows some technical tools from <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Traffic</i>, its multiple stories delimited by color-filtered
            cinematography. In <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Solaris</i>
            he opts to differentiate the haunting dream-thought recollections of
            Kelvin (and Rheya) using a slight desaturation and a hand-held
            camera. Think of it as the equivalent of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">italicized</i>
            subtitles on a foreign film that often indicate inner-mind
            voiceovers.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            fades to a less than satisfying conclusion, where its blending of
