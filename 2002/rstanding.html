The concept of&nbsp; &quot;American innocence&quot; has always been a fabrication, designed to let dominant cultural denizens off various political and material hooks.&nbsp; That said, the film still acts as a valuable and compelling record of the contributions that deserving (and otherwise anonymous) individuals made to an important part of American musical history.">

&nbsp; -- Uriel Jones, <i>Standing in the Shadows of Motown</i> </font></span>
              </p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Most everyone 
            agrees, now: the Motown sound is brilliant and beloved. It's also 
            well recognized that the music -- sung by such miracle-workers as 
            Stevie Wonder, the Supremes, Marvin Gaye, the Four Tops, Smokey 
            Robinson, Martha Reeves and the Vandellas -- emerged against a 
            particular background: industrial Detroit during the U.S. Civil 
            Rights Movement. At the center of this remarkable moment -- which 
            lasted some fourteen years -- was Berry Gordy's Hitsville, U.S.A. 
            From 1959 until 1972 (when the company moved to L.A., with &quot;no 
            warning and no acknowledgement&quot;), an astounding collection of 
            musicians hunkered down in Studio A, better known as &quot;the snake 
            pit,&quot; less well known as Gordy's garage. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">These 
            relentlessly inventive artists called themselves the Funk Brothers, 
            in recognition of the rich, undulating rhythms they brought to what 
            was otherwise basic pop-R&amp;B. They came to think of themselves as a 
            family, working long hours for $10 a song, playing at local clubs to 
            make ends meet and to be able just to hang out, apart from the 
            day-in-day out production push at Hitsville. They played for the 
            love of it, and for each other. The usual Motown myths, as 
            incomplete as any in self-loving American nostalgia, forget to 
            mention the Funk Brothers, much as Gordy tended to do at the time. 
            The songs rose on the charts; Gordy was deemed a genius; Stevie 
            Wonder and Diana Ross became superstars. &quot;When the dust cleared,&quot; 
            observes keyboard player Joe Hunter, &quot;we realized it was all over 
            and we were being left out of the dream.&quot; </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Paul Justman's
            <i>Standing in the Shadows of Motown</i>, based on Allan Slutsky's 
            1989 book about gifted bass player James Jamerson, aims to recover 
            the Funk Brothers' legacy, or rather, to get it documented while 
            some of them are still alive (indeed, the urgency of the project has 
            been underlined by the post-filming deaths of drummer Pistol Allen 
            and keyboardist Johnny Griffith). Surely, their invisibility is a 
            terrible oversight, but it's hardly unusual in the music business 
            (who can name the sensational artists behind big-ticket acts like 
            Mary J. Blige or Madonna, Usher or David Bowie? Many are session 
            players tapped to tour or record, sometimes repeatedly, and most 
            remain unknown, except to fellow musicians). </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">As several of 
            the Brothers joke about other producers' efforts to replicate the 
            winning &quot;formula,&quot; then and now, drummer Steve Jordan observes, &quot;You 
            could have had Deputy Dawg singing on [any of these tracks] and it 
            would have been a hit.&quot; While it's hard to imagine tunes by Marvin 
            Gaye or Smokey Robinson sounding quite as good by someone else, it's 
            easy to understand the idea here -- the Funk Brothers' sound was 
            solid, consistent, <i>and</i> indefatigably original. They brought 
            with them a range of experiences: classical music, underground jazz 
            clubs, and strip joints; many had moved North from Tennessee and the 
            Carolinas to work in auto plants; and they all found their way to 
            Hitsville. There, as a group, Don Was observes, &quot;They could swing 
            like crazy.&quot; </font></span></p>
            <p><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Standing in 
            the Shadows of Motown</font></span></i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
            takes up its good cause in mostly effective ways: archival photos 
            and interviews with now deceased members (keyboardist Earl Van Dyke, 
            whose playing was so aggressive they called it &quot;guerilla piano&quot;), 
            interviews with surviving members (percussionist and &quot;tambourine 
            man&quot; Jack Ashford, keyboardist Joe Hunter, drummers Richard &quot;Pistol&quot; 
            Allen and Uriel Jones, guitarists Eddie Willis and Joe Messina, 
            bassist Bob Babbitt), and performances with contemporary artists: 
            Gerald Levert on &quot;Reach Out I'll Be There,&quot; Me'shell Ndegéocello 
            leaving all kinds of effective space in &quot;Cloud Nine,&quot; Bootsy Collins 
            wearing a pink feather boa for &quot;Cool Jerk,&quot; Ben Harper on &quot;Ain't Too 
            Proud To Beg,&quot; Joan Osborne bearing down on &quot;What Becomes Of The 
            Brokenhearted,&quot; and Chaka Kahn and Montell Jordan all over &quot;Ain't No 
            Mountain High Enough.&quot;</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Easily, the 
            least effective scenes involve reenactments of stories, for 
            instance, about Jamerson -- actors feign sleep in a car on a snowy 
            night, windows closed, as the one playing Jamerson pulls out a jar 
            of stinky pigs' feet -- the narrator, drummer Uriel Jones, recalls 
            events with enough verve that the image just seems extraneous, even 
            if it is cleverly accompanied by the Temptations' &quot;The Way You Do 
            the Things You Do&quot;: &quot;The way you smell so sweet / You know, you 
            could've been some perfume.&quot;&nbsp; </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Jamerson floats 
            over much the film, as inspiration, as emblem of loss, as hope for 
            the future. The opening credits sequence features a reenactment of 
            Jamerson as a boy, running along a riverside, fashioning a 
            rudimentary bass with string and a stick, as Walter Dallas and 
            Ntozake Shange's narration, read by Andre Braugher, refers to &quot;the 
            days of American innocence,&quot; days about to be seriously shaken by 
            the &quot;cultural tidal wave in [Elvis Presley's] hips and music.&quot; Such 
            language speaks to an understandable nostalgia and generalization, 
            appealing to <i>Standing in the Shadows</i>' presumed &quot;crossover&quot; 
            audience, but it's also rehearsing the same mythologies that it 
            would do well to debunk. This &quot;American innocence&quot; has always been a 
            fabrication, designed to let dominant cultural denizens off various 
            political and material hooks. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">That said, the 
            film appears less interested in this proverbial &quot;innocence,&quot; than in 
            the setting it created for Jamerson: he had to overcome myths before 
            he could create them. Passionate and seemingly endlessly creative, 
            he changed the face of popular music forever, with bass lines moving 
            and unforgettable. One particularly entertaining and frankly 
            incredible story has him unable to sit on a stool down at the snake 
            pit, and so, he played &quot;What's Going On&quot; while lying on his back on 
            the studio floor. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The film's 
            celebratory focus on such wild talents and behaviors means that it 
            can only allude to historical details, as background rendered in 
            archival footage: police hosings, Martin Luther King Jr.'s 
            assassination, the 1967 Detroit rebellions, and the ideological as 
            well as sales competitions with Stax/Volt. Many of these details are 
            available in Suzanne E. Smith's insightful reconsideration of the 
            period, <i>Dancing in the Street: Motown and the Cultural Politics 
            of Detroit</i> (for instance, Gordy hired mostly white men to manage 
            Motown, in the legal and accounting departments, and efforts by 
            Gaye, Wonder, and the Temps to address their struggles with racism 
            were resisted by the company, who preferred lucrative love songs 
            with easy, &quot;white&quot; beats). </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The film also 
            offers glimpses of the unpredictable, occasionally dangerous world 
            the Funk Brothers inhabited, mainly through their stories: Uriel 
            Jones tells about conceiving Afro Cuban beats while playing after 
            hours with exotic dancer Lottie the Body, then bringing them to the 
            studio the next day; Joe Hunter recalls a group of them laying their 
            guns on a table to settle an argument over getting paid; and Johnny 
            Griffith remembers his mentor Hunter telling him not to worry too 
            much about pleasing producers: &quot;Just play,&quot; he said, &quot;They don't 
            know what they listening to anyway.&quot; </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Whether or not 
            you know what you're listening to, <i>Standing in the Shadows of 
            Motown</i> invites pleasure and discernment in listening. This holds 
            even if you're listening to nothing: when Me'Shell asks Bob Babbitt 
            how he felt about being white, when King was killed and race 
            tensions ran especially high, he lapses into silence and she pats 
            him, reassuring, understanding. The moment is left unresolved, and 
            the film retains its focus -- on the magic wrought in the snake pit, 
            in the Funk Brothers' ideal space. </font></span>
