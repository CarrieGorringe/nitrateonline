            Avery</a>, 20 December 2002</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In <i>Two Weeks Notice</i>,
            Sandra Bullock and Hugh Grant are in what's supposed to be a
            modern-day Tracy-and-Hepburn comedy -- not only are those two great
            names invoked specifically in one scene, but also that of another
            great Hepburn, Audrey, who is then personified when Bullock turns up
            in a following scene wearing an evening gown that could be one of
            Givenchy's more dreamier creations.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Until then, Bullock wears cotton
            peasant blouses and skirts to play an activist lawyer who lays down
            in front of landmark buildings in order to prevent wreaking crews
            from demolishing them. Grant plays a multi-trillionaire who wants to
            demolish one of those buildings so he can put up another edifice of
            greed and status. When he needs an assistant who can also function
            as legal consul, Bullock takes the job -- she's going to change the
            system from within! -- but he becomes so dependent on her that she
            ends up quitting. Only when she sees him hire another cute young
            thing in a skirt (Alicia Witt, in a truly thankless role) to fill
            her vacancy does she realize that she's in love with him, and he
            with her. And the world yawns.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The plot's so hackneyed that,
            half-an-hour in, you can already figure out what's going to happen
            during the rest of the movie, it's just going to take an awful long
            while to get there. Trying to show that his character is shallow,
            Grant speaks with the crisp, clipped diction of the young Laurence
            Olivier, and he pronounces &quot;answer&quot; as &quot;ahn-swer&quot;,
            but he's also supposed to be a rapacious womanizer, and Grant has
            too cultivated a persona to ever be convincing in that capacity.
            Bullock, on the other hand, is supposed to come off as a little
            goofy -- in every third or fourth scene, she has to contend with
            having coffee flung down the front of her clothing, tripping over
            potted plants, being hit between the eyes by a tennis ball, or, in
            one scene, being rushed to facilities so she can alleviate herself
            of gastrointestinal distress (and she's wearing white, in the scene,
            as well). I remember women who said they got tired of watching
            Rosanna Arquette having to trip all over herself in movies like <i>The
            Big Blue</i>, and I doubt that people's feelings have changed much
            since then. What interested us most about Sandra Bullock to begin
            with was her combination of warmth and personableness, not her
            ability to slip on a banana peel to get a quick laugh.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At one point, Bullock's character
            sits down at a kitchen table to ask her father (played by the
            estimable Robert Klein) --who, with her mother, form two of
            &quot;the best legal minds in the country&quot; -- what she should
            do. Klein's character replies that, as they speak, he's eating a
            cheesecake that's made from tofu, which he hates. &quot;But I'm
            eating it,&quot; he adds. Meaning sometimes you have to eat things
            you don't want to? It's supposed to tell us why Bullock and Grant's
            characters should be together, but it doesn't, and by the time this
            slack film inches its way towards its inevitable conclusion, it
            still hasn't come up with a reason why these two should be together:
            they could end up with each other, or the potted plant, and the
            ending would still feel the same.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"></o:p>
