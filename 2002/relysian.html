            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Director George Hickenlooper still 
            hasn't made a film as good as his best documentary, 1991's <i>Hearts 
            of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse</i>, the brilliant piece 
            demystifying Francis Ford Coppola's <i>Apocalypse Now</i> that he 
            co-wrote and co-directed by Fax Bahr. Or as fine as his best 
            fictional piece <i>Some Folks Call It a Sling Blade</i>, the short 
            that inspired Billy Bob Thornton's Oscar-winning feature. His 
            current effort may be as sleek as his sold-to-cable indie feature <i>
            The Big Brass Ring</i>, based on an unfilmed screenplay by Orson 
            Welles, but <i>The Man From Elysian Fields</i> is a cold, bliss-less 
            work that groans along thinking itself some important comment on how 
            life throws us some beguiling curves. It's actually nothing more 
            than a mildly amusing business proposition surrounded by creaky 
            melodramatic drivel.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Andy Garcia is the topliner, 
            portraying Byron Tiller, a Pasadena dad, husband, and 
            never-really-successful novelist who can't even sell a 
            remainder-priced, soon-to-be-autographed edition of his book <i>
            Hitler's Child</i> to an seemingly interested bystander at the local 
            Rizzoli's. (Perhaps humorist Dave Barry -- if he dared spend time 
            watching this film -- is wondering, as he often does, whether <i>
            Hitler's Child</i> would be a great name for a rock group.) However, 
            it's aging rocker Mick Jagger who struts out on stage and absolutely 
            steals the spotlight, what little there is that shines here. As 
            debonair businessman Luther Fox (and the film's slight narrator), 
            he's the story's immoral center, a reptilian creature of habit 
            camouflaged in fancy designer threads and caressed by cigarette 
            smoke. No, he's not the CEO of Enron, but the world weary owner of a 
            male escort business, Elysian Fields, Inc. He's a snake and a 
            charmer, and he's got an eye on the good-looking Byron, who's seedy 
            Hollywood office is right down the hall from Elysian's Room 507 and 
            just around the corner from a sea of trouble.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The harried Byron, still convinced 
            that he's got the great American novel locked up inside him, is 
            adored by his supportive, beautiful wife Dena (<i>ER</i>'s Julianna 
            Margulies), who admires his brain possibly as much as his expertise 
            under the bed sheets. She has so much faith in her spouse that I 
            half expected her to set up a tent outside their apartment and start 
            a revival meeting.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hallelujah, BYRON, Hallelujah!</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sorry for the digression, but the 
            morning coffee just kicked in.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With a baby son going through more 
            disposal diapers than can be stocked at the local Costco, those 
            pesky rent and car payments being missed, and Dena's rich, obnoxious 
            construction-magnate father unwilling to loan his son-in-law a 
            thousand bucks or an ounce of respect, these are trying times for 
            the struggling author. And doesn't he look it! He drives a wreck of 
            a VW bug, his hair is greasy and flops, uncombed, down over his 
            forehead. He's got stubble on his face, and that sad puppy look 
            drives the point home.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">So when his snobby Little, Brown 
            editor flat-out rejects his latest book for being overtly symbolic, 
            instead of telling wifey the truth, he starts spinning the Big Lie. 
            That his book has been optioned, that the Book-of-the-Month people 
            are interested, and that all will be well in the world. As luck, and 
            screenwriter Philip Jayson Lasker tells us, opportunity arrives in 
            the impeccably dressed Luther, who fawns on Byron that he is also a 
            fan of his work (A side note/question mark on the screenwriter. The 
            publicity material indicates Lasker has written at least five other 
            scripts, none yet produced, including one for Tom Cruise based on 
            the screenwriter's novel <i>Identity Crisis</i>, identified as 
            having been published by Putnam. A visit to the Library of Congress, 
            Amazon, ebay, Penguin Putnam, and Copyright Office websites divulge 
            no such book. Maybe I should have looked under <i>Hitler's Child</i>?).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Armed with Luther's business card 
            (with an <i>actual</i> phone number-323-460-6409; don't bother, it's 
            disconnected), the kind you know someone's wife is bound to discover 
            in a jacket pocket, Byron joins the escort corps of &quot;cocker spaniels 
            with hard-ons&quot; and is soon servicing thirty-four-year-old Andrea 
            Alcott (<i>Rushmore</i>'s Olivia Williams), the decades-younger wife 
            of dying triple-Pulitzer Prize winning author Tobias (James Coburn). 
            This IS California, after all, and this couple has one of those 
            cordial &quot;open&quot; relationships. The dour Byron finds &quot;tending to the 
            wounds of lonely women&quot; hard to write up on his resume, so he 
            instead offers his help rewriting Tobias' last great novel, a 
            rambling 800-page manuscript on the Roman Empire several steps down 
            from his earlier efforts (apparently not even close to his <i>Whores 
            of Babylon -- </i>or is that the name of a rock band?).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Where does this all lead? Well 
            Luther wants to get out of the biz and settle down with Jennifer 
            Adler (Anjelica Huston), his only &quot;personal&quot; client who married for 
            money and plans to stay that way. Byron gets shafted from both ends, 
            digs down deep within his soul and…. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Oh God, yes, it's one of those 
            clean-shaven, smartly dressed, hair-in-place endings.</font></td>
