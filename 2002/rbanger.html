            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Jamie
            Lee Curtis's recent decision to pose for photos
            &quot;un-retouched&quot; for the September issue of <i>More</i>
            magazine has garnered a flurry of media attention, including an
            interview with <i>Dateline</i>'s Maria Shriver. (It's no small irony
            that Curtis starred with Shriver's famously hard-bodied husband in
            1994's <i>True Lies</i>, winning all kinds of &quot;praise&quot; for
            her stunningly worked-out figure.) Reportedly, Curtis's &quot;tell
            all story&quot; has pushed the magazine's sales toward
            &quot;breaking the single issue sales record.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Whatever
            this record-breaking might say -- about admiration or prurience --
            Curtis has a clear idea of what <i>she</i>'s saying. At forty-three,
            she's tired of &quot;playing&quot; the packaging game, and, with no
            film roles &quot;on the horizon,&quot; is taking her stand against
            it, encouraging consumers, especially the kids for whom she's now
            written five books, to accept themselves and others for who they
            are, however &quot;imperfect.&quot; Shriver extols Curtis's courage,
            adding, &quot;But the question is whether in the process, she may be
            blowing the lid off her career in film.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">This
            is the question that keeps the machine running, mainly because so
            few people want to ask it, much less answer it. And it's precisely
            the sort of question that drives <i>The Banger Sisters</i>, which
            purports to be a celebration of women over fifty, casting Susan
            Sarandon and Goldie Hawn as former groupies. Rather too cutely,
            Hawn's Suzette seems a survivor-version of Penny Lane, the character
            her real-life daughter Kate Hudson played to great acclaim in <i>Almost
            Famous</i>. Suzette has hung onto her idealism and wardrobe twenty
            years, and remembers the '70s fondly, all anti-war politics and
            free-love practices, and now tends bar at L.A.'s Whiskey a Go Go. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">As
            <i>The Banger Sisters</i> begins, the just-fired,
            feeling-desperate-but-still-game Suzette finds herself unable to
            trick (it's a younger girls' game), she decides that she'll ask her
            old friend and former co-banger Lavinia (Sarandon) for a little
            stopgap cash. When her car breaks down, Suzette hitches a ride with
            twitchy, neurotic writer Harry (Geoffrey Rush), whom she promptly
            beds (her seduction begins like this: &quot;I am such a good
            blowjob-giver&quot;), whereupon he turns into a happy, generous
            soul. While he remains consistently unbearable in both his
            incarnations -- depressive grump or gushing boyfriend -- the
            conversion is contrived and abrupt. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Suzette's
            magic takes slightly longer to work on Lavinia, now married to
            dullsville Phoenix lawyer (Robin Thomas) with two spunky daughters,
            Hannah (Erika Christenson) and Ginger (Sarandon's real-life
            daughter, Eva Amurri). Worst of all, she's come to favor pert
            hairdos and beige suits. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Poor
            Lavinia is, of course, in dire need of rescue. Suzette's well-timed
            grand entrance is initiated by a super-convenient coincidence: she
            stumbles on Hannah, bad-acid-tripping on prom night, in the very
            hotel where she's staying with Harry. They survive the night, with
            Harry looking on with admiring, moist eyes, as Suzette holds
            Hannah's pukey face to her bosom and rocks her to sleep. Next AM,
            Suzette delivers the errant child to her homestead, startling
            Lavinia, who has so deeply repressed her past that she doesn't
            recognize her old chum (who looks almost exactly as she did back in
            the day), and comes at her with a garden tool. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">They
            argue some, then Suzette wangles a dinner invitation. Much to
            Lavinia's initial embarrassment and Husband's increasing disdain,
            she regales the daughters with tales of mom's rock-concert antics.
            Hannah and Ginger can't believe it, giggling over the image of mom
            in a mosh pit. They don't trust adults, righteously: the film's most
            convincing scene, which, granted, is not saying much, takes place in
            Hannah's bedroom, between the girls -- no sputtering or acting out,
            just a sensible conversation between two sisters who see their
            parents as alien creatures. They're flabbergasted when Suzette
            asserts that their prim garden-party-organizing mother &quot;was a
            blast. She was a kick-ass girlfriend!&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">There's
            something charming about Lavinia's resistance, and for a minute,
            you're grateful, thinking that the film, at last, is getting over
            the stereotypes and move on to something that resembles women's
            experiences. For all her efforts to maintain her decorum -- and they
            are vigorous -- her family's disbelief that she was ever capable of
            such expansive desire, let alone behavior, is too much. She decides
            to &quot;go out&quot;: she cuts her hair, borrows some un-beige
            clothes from Suzette, and goes dancing and drinking, shaking her
            booty with the rest of the kids at some Phoenix hot spot. This
            reverence for sexual experiences recalled with relish, as well as
            not-so-youthful bodies has led some viewers to fret. Middle-aged
            women shouldn't be showing cleavage and cameras shouldn't focus on
            their backsides. Parents shouldn't be admitting they had sex or
            did/do drugs, and they certainly shouldn't be wearing halter tops,
            visible bra straps, and faux-lizard pants. For these few minutes, <i>The
            Banger Sisters</i> venerates imperfection and adventure. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Thrilled
            and rejuvenated, the girls head back home to peruse Lavinia's photo
            collection: a series of rock-stars' cocks. They giggle and smoke
            some ancient dope, and feel warm and generous -- until the plot
            intrudes. Husband discovers them, she talks back, and at last, a
            daughter-related crisis brings everyone back together, better people
            for having known Suzette. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">This
            very clunkiness, so familiar and so reductive, is, here, even worse
            than it sounds. First time director Bob Dolman, who wrote <i>Willow</i>
            and <i>Far and Away</i> before he wrote this script, connects scenes
            in a cursory way, and the trajectory is glaringly obvious, an After
            School Special For Adults. Precisely because <i>The Banger Sisters</i>
            poses questions about aging -- how women do it, how they resist and
            embrace it, how difficult it is to do in front of others -- its
            falling short in providing answers to these questions is all the
            more disappointing. Lavinia and Suzette probably deserve better.
            Sarandon and Hawn definitely do.</span></font></td>
