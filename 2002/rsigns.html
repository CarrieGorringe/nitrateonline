            review by <a href="../kj.html" target="_top">KJ Doughton</a>, 2 August 2002</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Like a one-hit wonder
            desperately clinging to the pop charts as its lone hit fades into
            history, M. Night Shyamalan appears to be grasping at straws with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Signs</i>.
            Impassioned, bold straws, but straws all the same. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Sixth Sense</i> was a nearly perfect movie, tightening its bolts for
            a tense slow burn, only to launch itself onto another plain
            altogether with a brilliant finale.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Without its last-minute denouement, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Sixth Sense</i> would still be a good film.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Adding that mind-bending wrap-up, it became a classic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With his follow-up, the grim
            superhero thriller <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Unbreakable</i>,
            Shyamalan appeared to be chasing his own tail, struggling to heap up
            another transcendent ending that only partially succeeded.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Like David Lynch, who made psycho space cadets his stock in
            trade after the success of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Blue
            Velvet</i>, it appeared that Shyamalan was agonizingly straining to
            top himself with slow-building revelations and kick-butt cappers to
            seal the deals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Signs</i>,
            the incredibly ambitious talent again tries to create an experience
            where the whole becomes much more than merely the sum of its parts.
            Does he deliver? Well, sort of.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Signs</i>
            follows a rural Pennsylvania family dutifully harvesting its
            jungle-dense fields of corn crop.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Right from the get-go, Shyamalan cunningly navigates viewers
            into his narrative with a lean, economic sparseness. His camera
            snakes through the airy farmhouse occupied by a twitchy widower, his
            unemployed brother (Joaquin Phoenix), and two adorable, dedicated
            children (Rory Culkin, Abigail Breslin).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Passing by a family photo, we are
            informed that the farmer is (or was) both a husband and a minister.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Shyamalan is one of those storytellers gifted enough to
            convey information without dialogue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>With Mel Gibson’s expressive blue eyes at his disposal, the
            director opts for personal, soul-searching close-ups of faces and
            common domestic images, such as the door of a pantry room, or a
            piercing flashlight beam. His quiet, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">mise
            en scene</i> approach is a refreshing contrast to the cluttered,
            caffeinated assault on the senses most often favored for sci-fi
            features.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>If most
            movies are the onscreen equivalent to a line of nerve-jolting
            methamphetamine (think <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Independence
            Day</i>), <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Signs</i> is the clear-eyed calm following a healthy runner’s high.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That’s not to say that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Signs</i>
            isn’t scary.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
            we’ve lived in the skin of Gibson’s close-knit clan, we share
            their bewilderment and horror as crop circles haunt their
            cornfields, and media communications are jammed with eerie reports
            of UFO sightings. All signs point to an impending alien invasion.
            The subtle way in which such a takeover is hinted at - with
            distraught radio announcers describing unsettling close encounters
            while television stations air Sasquatch-style home video footage of
            what may or may not be an alien terrorizing a child’s birthday
            party - brings to mind<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Night of the Living
            Dead</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As with that
            George Romero masterpiece, arguably the most frightening film ever
            made, the dread feels real.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As Gibson’s patriarch braces he
            and his loved ones for a hostile invasion, we learn things about the
            family that ultimately play into the story’s attempt at a Big
            Finish. His brother was once a baseball player. His wife was
            recently killed during a devastating auto accident.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>This last incident introduces a parallel concept that wraps
            itself around the sexier, more commercial "aliens are coming" vibe
            cast out by <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Signs</i>: that
            every person is given the choice to embrace faith, or lose it. In an
            unlikely, family values contrast, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Signs</i>
            studies the same underlying theme as Quentin Tarantino’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Pulp Fiction</i>, where two hit men pondered whether their surviving a
            bloody shootout was merely random chance, or some type of grand
            miracle - a "divine intervention," if you will.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Gibson is angry with God for
            allowing the death of his wife, and has all but lost his faith.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The seemingly supernatural events that plague him in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Signs</i> are like one final test of the farmer’s true loyalties. Will
            he give in to despair as threatening hints of Armageddon appear
            right around the corner, or cloak himself in the reassurance that
            everything has a spiritual meaning while re-applying his cleric’s
            collar?<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I’m not sure where I stand on <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Signs</i>. Shyamalan’s claustrophobic, "micro" angle to a &quot;macro&quot;
            theme like extraterrestrial war, in which he examines a decent
            Eastern-American family huddling behind the corn husks instead of
            jerking about between a school of noisy starfighters, is commendable
            and unique.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>But the film’s climax doesn’t quite justify all the
            buildup, even a buildup as refreshingly understated as that which
            Shyamalan employs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Like
            the recent <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">K-Pax</i> before it, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Signs</i> is
            a sci-fi movie with grand, out-of-this-world ambitions that
            ultimately doesn’t quite live up to them.</font></td>
