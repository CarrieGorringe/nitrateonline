            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 28 June 2002</i></font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;</font><p>
            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">I almost walked out of the new Adam 
            Sandler comedy, <i>Mr. Deeds</i>, during the scene where Sandler 
            started throwing cats, seven of them, out of the window of a burning 
            building -- there are some things you just don't sit still for. But, 
            hey, he was trying to &quot;save&quot; them, and they all bounced and landed 
            in funny places, and they turned out to be all right, even the last 
            one, which was actually on-fire and burning when Sandler flung it 
            into the void.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The comedian plays Longfellow 
            Deeds, the character-in-name (though not manner) originally played 
            by Gary Cooper back, in times gone past, in the 1936 Frank Capra 
            movie. He runs a pizza parlor in a small, dainty New Hampshire town, 
            helps old people cross the street, corrects bad language, is 
            considerate towards ladies, and stops muggers by smashing them to 
            the ground with a garbage can, then sitting on top of them and 
            punching them in the face ten times.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">He inherits a multi-billion dollar 
            empire and goes to New York City for the first time, where he 
            insists on everybody calling him by his last name (it's more 
            informal), and hugs people a lot. The venal, snobbish, and greedy 
            New Yorkers for the most part laugh and jeer at him, and he has to 
            punch some of them out, too, especially when they chortle over his 
            greeting-card poetry -- it may be classic, but, as Deeds himself sez, 
            er, says, it's &quot;the best that he can do.”</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The movie wants us to believe that 
            he's more genuine, sincere, and feeling as a person than the big 
            city types. But the small town folks, who are also supposed to be 
            more genuine, sincere, and feeling, are drawn as a gallery of 
            grotesques, with fat guts, sloppy clothing, and missing teeth. 
            (Steve Buscemi appears, hideously made-up, as a character named 
            &quot;Crazy Eyes,” who orders pizza with pineapple and gumball topping, 
            or something like that.) We're supposed to laugh at them, we're 
            supposed to laugh at the venal New Yorkers -- and we're supposed to 
            laugh at Deeds, too, when he does stuff like a doofus rendition of 
            the song &quot;Space Oddity&quot; sung into a banana, or when he slides down a 
            banister and crashes atop a table.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The filmmakers also believe that 
            money is bad, but they put John McEnroe into the picture for a 
            cameo, and in his first shot he holds a Heineken with the label 
            pointing directly at the camera. (He and Deeds go out and egg 
            passing cars!) Al Sharpton shows up to deliver a eulogy, in rhyme, 
            after which Sandler's character does the same (to Sharpton's 
            approval). And there's the aforementioned scene where Deeds rescues 
            the purdy pusses, during which he throws off a compliment to N.Y.C. 
            firefighters.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sympathy is what you feel for 
            Winona Ryder, who increasingly assumes the panicky look of someone 
            who's trapped in an elevator for an indefinite period of time; she's 
            hideously photographed throughout the picture, and her hair changes 
            color at several points in the story, like a mood ring. She gets 
            into a brawl with Conchata Ferrell, during which they slam kick each 
            other and break furniture; then, she falls through the ice over a 
            frozen pond -- and Sandler lets her drown. When this happened to Lew 
            Ayres in <i>Damien: Omen II</i>, is was supposed to be scary. On top 
            of that, Ryder plays a character who's compulsively dishonest, and 
            the actress struggles to do scenes such as one where she makes up a 
            recollection of falling out of a tree when she was a little girl and 
            being rushed by her father to be treated by Dr. Pepper -- Deeds 
            thinks Dr. Pepper is a physician, and she does nothing to dissuade 
            him. Over dinner, Sandler leans towards her and says, &quot;You're hair 
            is very nice and blond.&quot; &quot;My grandfather was in ABBA,&quot; Ryder 
            stammers in reply.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sandler's slow, halting, witless 
            dialogue deliveries are supposed to make him appealing and 
            good-hearted, but he looks more like a dolt than ever, and why 
            should we be asked to identify with him? In addition, the movie 
            wants us to alternately root for him and laugh <i>at</i> him, not <i>
            with</i> him. The movie doesn't think much of its characters, its 
            protagonist, or of us. &quot;Oh, please, please jump on my foot,&quot; he asks 
            his Spanish butler (John Turturro, who gives the only thing 
            approximating a respectable performance in this), peeling a sock off 
            of an appendage blackened by frostbite. Oh, please.</font></td>
