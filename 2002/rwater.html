            review by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 28 June 2002</i></font><p>
            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Japanese director Shohei Imamura’s 
            latest film is an odd but ultimately satisfying blend of the 
            sophomoric and the sublime. The seventy-five-year-old Imamura 
            juggles social commentary, magical realism and gold old-fashioned 
            dirty jokes into a tale that both baffles and intrigues.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Koji Yakusho, the star of Imamura’s
            <i>The Eel</i>, portrays yet another white-collar sad sack. The 
            catch is&nbsp; that this time his character, Yosuke Sasano, has all the 
            aggravations of the employed even though he’s lost his job. He’s 
            also got a nagging wife (Toshie Negishi) who doesn’t live with him. 
            All he gets from his job interviews are tactful rejections. Like a 
            lot of his countrymen, Yosuke has devoted most of his adult life to 
            a company that has folded and can’t seem to get his bearings back.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yosuke’s very real and common 
            (especially in present day Japan) malaise provides an appropriate 
            counterpoint for the strangeness that ensues. An old man (Kazuo 
            Kitamura) who told Yosuke a series of outlandish stories has 
            recently died. Before he passed on, he told Yosuke how he has hidden 
            a golden Buddhist statue in a house near a red bridge in a small 
            village. Yosuke’s skepticism about the story vanishes when he 
            discovers during a commute that both the bridge and the house still 
            exist.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Inside the house lives Saeko (Misa 
            Shimizu), a gorgeous young woman who immediately infatuates Yosuke, 
            and ends up enlisting him to help her with her bizarre affliction. 
            Saeko’s body gradually fills with gallons of water, and the only way 
            she can properly shed is by committing a sin like shoplifting. The 
            most effective treatment, however, turns out to be an orgasm. </font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yosuke soon discovers that he is 
            especially good at administering this cure, causing Saeko to gush 
            with a massive flood of water. During these moments of ecstasy, the 
            town’s river benefits enormously from Saeko’s contribution, becoming 
            a major fishery. Needless to say, Yosuke joins the crew of a fishing 
            boat and makes no plans to return to the city.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">All of this weirdness might have 
            been a racy bore, if Imamura and his co-writers Daisuke Tengan and 
            Motofumi Tomikawa (working from the book by Yo Henmi) hadn’t create 
            likable characters. If Yosuke and Saeko weren’t a relatively decent 
            people trapped in an entertainingly absurd situation, a viewer might 
            want him to get back home to his responsibilities instead fooling 
            around in the village. Fortunately, both his Yosuke and the locals 
            are interesting enough to make his stay worthwhile. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Even some of the antagonists in 
            story are painted affectionately. A mean biker ends up becoming 
            Yosuke’s friend and even helps him get a job on a fishing boat. When 
            one of Yosuke’s old friends appears later and competes with him in 
            the quest for the gold statue, he also demonstrates a good side that 
            wasn’t immediately apparent.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The exotic ingredients that make up
            <i>Warm Water Under a Red Bridge</i> don’t always jell. With three 
            credited writers, the film sometimes feels a bit disjointed, and the 
            last quarter of the movie, involving a dark secret from Saeko’s 
            past, feels slow and off-putting, lacking the giddy wonder that 
            preceded it.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Some additional exposure to 
            Japanese culture or to Imamura’s previous movies like <i>The Eel</i> 
            and <i>Black Rain </i>might make <i>Warm Water under a Red Bridge</i> 
            seem a little less quirky and confounding. Still, Imamura’s 
            affection for his characters prevents the movie from becoming a 
            bawdy in-joke.</font></td>
