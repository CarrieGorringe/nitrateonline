            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>&quot;This is Pinochet's
            government,&quot; says one man, at the beginning of Patricio Guzmán's
            documentary, <i>The Pinochet Case</i>, pointing to a bare field in
            northern Chile where some of the victims who were murdered under the
            dictator's fifteen-year rule were dumped anonymously. The army
            general Auguste Pinochet headed the military junta that overthrew
            the country's democratically-elected president, Salvador Allende, on
            September 11, 1973: Allende dismissed his staff while he himself
            remained inside the presidential palace, La Moneta, in the capital
            of Santiago, while he remained inside as tanks and planes shelled
            and bombed the building. Allende was trying to institute social
            reforms in Chile while working within the country's constitution.
            The reason for his overthrow? He had been elected as a member of the
            U.P. (Popular Unity) party, made up of Chile's Communist, Radical,
            and Social-Democratic parties.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After Pinochet assumed power in
            1975, he ruled the country under a system of total terror, wherein
            the secret police, the DINA, arrested, detained, tortured, and
            murdered thousands of people: a light perusal of the records show
            that the DINA apparently arrested any and everyone they wanted. Many
            of their victims became part of a vast body of the
            &quot;disappeared,&quot; people who were arrested and, when their
            whereabouts were later inquired after, turned out to have no record
            with the authorities of their arrest or even of their existence.
            Proof that they had, indeed, been under the custody of the DINA was
            often only confirmed by other prisoners who had been held in the
            same facility at the same time. Even before Pinochet left power,
            under a plebiscite that restored democratic government to Chile in
            1990, meticulous dossiers were being assembled and collected on the
            identities of everyone who became part of the
            &quot;disappeared,&quot; along with other victims of crimes
            committed under Pinochet's rule.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Pinochet was visiting London -- on
            what was an annual shopping visit, where he visited the city's best
            stores -- when Spain moved to have him extradited on charges of
            genocide and murder: by this time, a 1992 report estimated that over
            2,000 people had been killed in Chile between September, 1973 and
            March, 1990, over a thousand of which had become
            &quot;disappeared.&quot; One of the reasons, an attorney
            representing the victims tells Guzmán, is simple
            &quot;solidarity&quot;: after the end of the Spanish civil war,
            arrangements were made for over 2,000 refugees to enter Chile -- the
            Spanish consulate who made the arrangements was Pablo Neruda, and
            the government official who received them at the other end, in
            Valparaiso, was Salvador Allende.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Guzmán has previously made a
            monumental three-part documentary on the events that occurred in
            Chile during and after the Allende overthrow, <i>The Battle of Chile</i>,
            which was released between 1975 and 79: one of the cameramen on his
            crew was shot and killed while operating a film camera, and Guzmán
            had to complete post-production on his film abroad, smuggling the
            footage out under dangerous circumstances. When he returned to Chile
            in the late 'nineties to make a follow-up documentary, he found many
            instances where Chileans, young and old, were beginning to forget
            what had happened under Pinochet's rule. <i>The Pinochet Case</i>
            emerges, in part, as a film about memory. Guzmán films many of the
            people who suffered under the dictatorship as they arrived in Spain
            to give testimony during the legal proceedings, and he records their
            stories, without sensationalism or reducing them to something flat
            and dry. We hear how people were taken to the infamous Villa
            Grimaldi, or to &quot;special detention centers,&quot; essentially
            torture houses set up by the DINA, where detainees were subjected to
            electrical shock, suffocation, or systematic beatings or sexual
            assault. Many of the victims were not told why they were arrested,
            or how long they would be imprisoned. Those who died were disposed
            of, individually or in mass graves, in the countryside. One of the
            most moving testimonies comes from a woman who keeps a photo of her
            son (many of the &quot;disappeared&quot; turn out to have been
            alarmingly young when they were taken away), in a clear plastic
            sleeve, in her pocketbook, the religious icon to which she prays
            every day.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Pinochet was made &quot;senator for
            life&quot; when he left office, a status that made him immune to
            legal prosecution, but he was in what amounted to protective custody
            in a house in London while the British authorities debated over
            whether to accede to Spain's extradition request. Persons both for
            and against Pinochet kept up a noisy daily vigil outside the gates
            of his residence,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>with
            each side, as shown in the film, trying to make as much racket as
            possible to drown the other side out, as if, by doing so, they could
            declare themselves the winner. Guzmán shows supporters of Pinochet
            who say (or reiterate what Pinochet himself said) that it was his
            subordinates, not he, who were responsible for all those crimes,
            even that Pinochet helped route the possibility of godless Communism
            in Chile with a &quot;minimal loss of life.&quot; Pinochet even
            receives a visit from Margaret Thatcher -- no longer a Prime
            Minister, but now a Baroness -- who tells him, to his face and while
            news cameras clack away in the background, how much he did for
            &quot;democracy&quot; in Chile. (The 1973 coup was backed by the
            C.I.A.; in the 'nineties, the then-present U.S. government forwarded
            secret documents showing the general's involvement in the
            suppression of political opposition to Pinochet's prosecutors in
            Spain.) Meanwhile, floorboards are being yanked up in former
            &quot;detention center&quot; houses, corpses are found still clad in
            the clothes they died in, and forensic experts, including a
            &quot;forensic archaeologist,&quot; are piecing together skeletal
            remains and examining bone fragments that show traces of point-blank
            gunshots.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the end, Pinochet would end up
            leaving Britain -- for Chile, where he was met with a formal
            reception. On the other hand, the ranks of those calling for
            Pinochet's accountability for his crimes were being swelled by
            Chileans who weren't even born, yet, when he first took power. And
            while showing the survivors of Pinochet's terrible rule, Guzmán
            ends up revealing something quite unexpected: while what was done to
            those who tell their stories for his camera was inhuman,
            inexcusable, and left them with scars they shouldn't have to have,
            they also seem to have been granted a strength that enables them,
            now, to fight to make the old monster accountable for the misdeeds
            that were perpetrated under his regime. The film becomes a document
            of human resiliency, tried but unthwarted, even after being
            subjected to the most terrible of ordeals -- of human spirit that
            people simply refused to have taken away from them.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As of July, 2002, Auguste Pinochet,
            living under house arrest in Chile, was judged mentally unfit to
            stand trial by Chile's Supreme Court. Prior to that decision, a
            statue of Salvador Allende was erected in Santiago, standing between
            the Judicial Ministry and Government House.</font></p>
