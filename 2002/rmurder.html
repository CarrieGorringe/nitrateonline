            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700">
            <font size="2">Partway through <i>Murder by Numbers</i>, Seattle 
            homicide detective Cassie Mayweather (Sandra Bullock) tries to make 
            up with her newbie partner and (already) one-night stand, Sam 
            Kennedy (Ben Chaplin). Ironically, he's come by her houseboat after 
            work, where he finds her wrapped in an afghan throw, eating 
            Pepperidge Farm Chocolate Chunk cookies out the bag, and watching <i>
            Matlock</i> on TV. At first, she won't speak to him, mad that he 
            dissed her in front of their captain. But soon she's trying to 
            rekindle a little of that one-nightness. As he sits upright and 
            anxious in an armchair, she slips her bare foot up under his leg. He 
            looks alarmed. She smiles, sweetly, then wiggles her toes you know 
            where. As Keanu might say, Whoa. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">By turns sly, 
            needy, tough, vulnerable, and not a little twisted, Cassie isn't 
            exactly the Sandy Bullock role you might be expecting. Nor is <i>
            Murder by Numbers</i> the usual Sandy Bullock vehicle. Indeed, and 
            to her credit, it appears that Bullock has been rethinking that 
            whole America's Sweetheart thing. No doubt, she's been grateful for 
            the leg up it gave her early on, because you know she's just that 
            way, humble and appreciative, not to mention talented and brainy. 
            Plus, she sang the Oscar Mayer Weiner song <i>and</i> kissed 
            Sylvester Stallone in <i>Demolition Man</i>, a one-two punch that 
            precious few might have managed. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">But still, 
            after stealing the show in <i>Speed</i>, being lumped in with Meg 
            Ryan and Julia Roberts, well, it must get frustrating if you feel 
            like you have something else going on (and you know she does). And 
            so, like Meg and Julia, Sandy's taken to pushing the edges of what 
            people expect from her, doing the wholesome thing when she must, but 
            looking for alternatives when she can. (That said, no one can say 
            what dementia possessed everyone involved with <i>Speed 2</i>.)
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">More often than 
            not, of course, the hardworking Bullock is compelled to do 
            combinations, of the Sweetheart and Something Else: an adorable 
            computer nerd in <i>The Net</i> (1995), adorable witch in <i>
            Practical Magic</i> (1998), adorable wild child who does <i>not</i>, 
            thank god, get Ben Affleck in <i>Forces of Nature</i> (1999), 
            adorable alcoholic in <i>28 Days</i> (2000). And even if you 
            overlook the awful <i>Gun Shy</i> (2000), it's worth mentioning that 
            she executive produced it and the decently melodramatic <i>Hope 
            Floats</i> (1998) and produced <i>Miss Congeniality</i> (2000), one 
            of her biggest successes. (Bullock is also currently executive 
            producing TV's <i>George Lopez Show</i>, which only underlines that 
            she has more on her mind than lifelong Sweetheart Stardom.) </font>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i>Murder by 
            Numbers</i> (which again, and no coincidence, Bullock also executive 
            produced) revisits and refits the combinatory strategy, but times 
            two. For one thing, Cassie is working both a familiar, emotionally 
            harrowing melodrama and a standard male movie-cop's trajectory, as 
            in: the angry/damaged/ruined hero triumphs over his terrible past. 
            Moreover, the murder she must solve is multilayered and messy. (In 
            fact, the solution unravels pretty seriously by film's end, what 
            with a few easy-to-spot twists, some shooting in a creepy house, and 
            a breakaway balcony from which Cassie must dangle perilously.)
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">This murder 
            involves the dead young woman, with whom Cassie doesn't exactly 
            identify (but with whom she feels mighty empathy), and her arrogant, 
            foolish psycho-killers. These would be two homoerotically charged-up 
            high schoolers, Richard (Ryan Gosling, stunning in <i>The Believer</i>) 
            and Justin (Michael Pitt, <i>Hedwig and the Angry Inch</i> and <i>
            Bully</i>), looking to commit the flawless crime. And they're 
            perfectly &quot;straight,&quot; of course, even fighting over the same 
            not-so-bright golden girl Lisa (Agnes Bruckner). Still, the movie 
            goes predictably overboard to underline their pathology. And so, the 
            urge to homicide is piled up with an urge to love each other (as 
            they love themselves) a little too much: they share teary embraces, 
            ritual chants, a sense of being abandoned by distracted/absent 
            parents, and most importantly, a belief that they are superior, and 
            only they can meet one another's needs. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Their 
            similarities, no surprise, are matched by their differences, and so, 
            tensions arise. Justin is the behind the scenes brain, always 
            researching (and even reads books, which he burns, sensationally, to 
            destroy &quot;evidence&quot;). Richard is the out-front &quot;star,&quot; seducing, 
            cajoling, performing because he loves to do it and always wins. In 
            their lair, a house up on &quot;the bluff,&quot; miles from nowhere, they 
            frame and revere a digital composite portrait of themselves as one 
            person. Or, they do until they fall out, whereupon Justin breaks up 
            the image with a grand flourish on his fancy machine. It's the 
            chanting and the embracing though, that secure their place as 
            Leopold and Loeb Lite, with a few additional edges to make them look 
            &quot;contemporary,&quot; more Columbine-ish than Bates Motel-ish. </font>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">For one thing, 
            they know they can be profiled and tracked by forensic evidence, and 
            would never do something so sloppy as leave a pair of glasses at the 
            body-dump site. They go one more step, beyond leaving no evidence: 
            they leave &quot;counter-evidence&quot; -- a carpet fiber, a baboon hair -- in 
            order to thwart the lab team. Hence Cassie's exclamation, so 
            prominent in the trailer, &quot;The profile doesn't fit the profile!&quot; 
            Just so: Justin and Richard's &quot;contemporary&quot; lies primarily with 
            their understanding of technology and process, more or less common 
            knowledge for anyone who watches TV or surfs the web. They're like 
            the rest of us, unprofiled. Clearly, Justin knew to do his research 
            because he'd seen a few episodes of <i>C.S.I.</i> or something like 
            it. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">And their 
            primary gimmick would be great TV: when committing the murder, they 
            wrap themselves up in plastic, like Ethan Hawke in <i>Gattaca</i>, 
            to keep from dropping incriminating skin cells and hairs. But while 
            these suits and goggles are crafty, they're also comical, as the 
            boys lumber like a couple of Diver Dans through several crime scenes 
            in flashbacks (as they move the victim from one place to another), 
            and then through multiple versions of those flashbacks. Real, not 
            real, remembered, not remembered -- the effect is part spooky, part 
            wacky. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">In the peculiar 
            universe laid out in <i>Murder By Numbers</i>, such refraction -- of 
            time and motive, fear and desire -- makes a certain sense. The kids 
            have no parents to speak of (Justin's mom appears to be propped up 
            in the living room at one point), Cassie orders up lab tests on 
            ill-gotten garbage without even a nod to, say, protocol or legality. 
            Basically, the cops do whatever they want when they want, like skulk 
            around at the high school to make the suspects &quot;nervous,&quot; or bust 
            into the home of Richard's randy pot dealer (Chris Penn, sort of 
            playing Dennis Hopper in <i>River's Edge</i>, only not as well).
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">It's probably 
            best not to look too closely at just how all this works. Justin and 
            Richard are bad because they can be; Cassie's good because she wills 
            herself to be, and Sam, well, poor Sam has a bit of a ride to 
            endure, and not much else to do but observe and harrumph a little 
            about everyone's bad behavior. Cassie keeps calling him &quot;Vice,&quot; 
            because that's the department from which he's just transferred, and 
            after a while, the name just seems to fit. That is, Vice is less of 
            a character than a plot point, and like Keanu Reeves, Jason Patrick, 
            Harry Connick Jr., even Viggo Mortenson before him, Chaplin sort of 
            falls off the screen when in range of the Sandy B death-ray. It's 
            not that she's mean or selfish, no way. She's not even a 
            knock-your-socks-off performer. It's that she's more compelling to 
            watch than most all her costars. I mean, she even gave Benjamin 
            Bratt a run for his money. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Cassie's more 
            vibrant relationships by far involve Justin and Richard, which 
            naturally makes her a megathreat the boys must destroy at all costs. 
            Equally pretty but supposedly differently socially abled (Richard is 
            rich and &quot;popular,&quot; though you never see him with any friends, and 
            Justin is brilliant and geeky, though he seems perfectly adept when 
            he gets his chance with Lisa) the boys are immediate suspects in the 
            crime. But the film isn't about solving the case; it's about solving 
            Cassie. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">So, while 
            snarky Richard pushes her personal buttons (she's got a dark secret 
            that starts getting telegraphed early, in echoey sound flashbacks 
            and deeply shadowed visual ones), Justin beguiles her with his 
            vulnerability. She sees Richard as she sees others (the rich pricks 
            of her own youth) and broody Justin as she sees herself (his 
            philosophy class paper on &quot;crime&quot; as a means to freedom intrigues 
            her, even though she and he both know the premise is morally 
            unsound). </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">This three-way, 
            so damaged and difficult (and so neatly imaged through cop 
            interrogation room mirrors) is easily the film's most potent and 
            potentially disquieting idea, even if it stops short of actually 
            investigating what the deal might be between an adult woman cop and 
            her teen boy suspects. All three actors bring something serious to 
            this table, and their interactions are unnerving in any number of 
            ways, until, of course, the movie's speedy descent into big-finale 
            nonsense. Before then, the three-way is a great, disturbing idea, 
            recalling Barbet Schroeder's the best of great, disturbing work (<i>Reversal 
            of Fortune</i>, <i>Our Lady of the Assassins</i>). And it's a 
            complex mishmash of longing and dread that this movie -- aiming for 
            mainstream box-office -- just isn't going to consider deeply.</font></span></td>
