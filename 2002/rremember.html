            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b>Amid
            the crowd of blonde girl pop stars who rolled out at more or less
            the same moment (Britney, Christina, Jessica), Mandy Moore stands
            out. Just count the ways: she's the first to dye her hair brown; the
            first to pitch Neutrogena; the first to host her own MTV talk show
            last summer (<i>Mandy</i>), plus numerous gabby specials; and the
            youngest (she was fourteen when her single, &quot;Candy,&quot; made
            everyone want her and when her first album, <i>So Real</i>, was
            released in 1999, and only a year older when this album was
            repackaged as <i>I Wanna Be With You</i>). She's also the first to
            make it to the movies -- as a high school diva in last year's <i>The
            Princess Diaries</i> and now, as the polite, religious,
            excruciatingly virtuous protagonist in <i>A Walk to Remember</i>. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">But,
            really, all of these firsts are less important in defining Moore's
            difference than the fact that, out of this impressively talented,
            perfectly made-up, and terrifically bankrolled group, she is the
            only one who looks honestly tranquil in front of a camera. For all
            the practice Britney got as a Musketeer, and for all of Jessica's
            polished piousness and Christina's manifest confidence, they all
            maintain a kind of well-trained pre-packaged affect, so utterly
            aware of how they're being looked at and how they mean for people to
            interpret their actions and appearance, that they tend to look,
            well, stressed -- smiles a little too taut, outfits a little too
            sewed on, makeup a little too air-brushed. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Mandy
            Moore, on the other hand, looks almost preternaturally comfortable
            in her skin. The girl has poise for days. Okay, so her recent music
            video, &quot;In My Pocket,&quot; followed the usual suit for pop
            stars of her moment, presenting her as something akin to sultry, and
            actually didn't come off as &quot;so real.&quot; But I can't think
            of another pop star who handles herself so well with both mob scenes
            and individual fans and interviewees: she has done little skits and
            counseling sessions on <i>Mandy</i>, and teen-celeb interviews for
            MTV teen-celeb specials. And she quickly became MTV's go-to pop girl
            for hosting duties, as at last year's summer events and the 2001 New
            Year's bash. Through it all, even when she's flustered or on the
            verge of fluster, she looks fine with the whole silly business, at
            ease with herself, her family, and her extraordinary situation,
            mature enough to handle the many demands made of her. Even when
            critics pan her albums -- calling them, say,
            &quot;overproduced,&quot; &quot;bland&quot; -- Moore looks fine.
            Selling more records than everyone else, making more money than god
            -- who cares? The girl is hard not to like. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">This
            charismatic self-security is both a help and a hindrance in <i>A
            Walk to Remember</i>, in which she plays Jaime Sullivan, a
            &quot;mousy&quot; high school student living in small-town North
            Carolina. Though critics have made the easy claim that the film
            &quot;forgettable&quot;, though she wears the same baggy dresses and
            (literally) the same green cotton sweater to school everyday, though
            the cool kids taunt her mercilessly, and though her father (Peter
            Coyote) is the local uptight reverend, Jaime is extraordinarily
            serene, almost beatific. Moore carries this off only partly -- she's
            clearly not a mousy girl, but she does appear confident enough to
            hold up under the abuse. When the coolest of the cool kids, Landon
            Carter (Shane West, of TV's <i>Once &amp; Again</i>), gets in some
            serious trouble, he's sent not to juvie hall but to the high school
            drama club, where he's miraculously assigned the lead, opposite
            superstar singer Mandy Moore... uh, I mean, superstar singer Jaime.
            For green sweater girl is transformed when she sings on stage -- in
            a word, she's dazzling. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">So
            dazzling that Landon, who has already stated secretly to
            &quot;like&quot; her during their weeks of rehearsing together, is
            just stricken when he sees her play a nightclub siren, in a slinky
            but chaste powder blue gown. At the same time, the camera
            indiscreetly cuts from one audience member to another -- the drama
            teacher and Jaime's dad, as well as the Landon contingent -- his mom
            (Daryl Hannah), black friend Eric (Al Thompson), and
            former-but-still-pining girlfriend Belinda (Lauren German) -- all
            looking increasingly thrilled but also horrified by what's happening
            in front of them, namely, Landon falls desperately in love with
            Jaime, on stage. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Directed
            by Adam (<i>The Wedding Planner</i>) Shankman, and based on Nicholas
            Sparks' &quot;best-selling novel&quot; (he also wrote the novel on
            which Costner's horrific <i>Message in a Bottle</i> is based), <i>A
            Walk to Remember</i> is audaciously, self-contentedly corny. Indeed,
            it revels in its corn. Though screenwriter Karen Janszen has
            displaced the story from the '50s to now, the film insists that the
            same values apply, across these fifty years. Jaime's charm and her
            awkwardness are both based in the spectacle of her decency, so
            profoundly eccentric nowadays that her peers can't help themselves
            but to be mean. From all outward appearances, Jaime is happy to cook
            meals for her dad, volunteer at the hospital, tutor younger kids
            after school, and save herself for marriage (you know, like Britney
            Spears). Until, of course, Landon pledges his troth. At this moment,
            everything changes. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">And,
            at this moment, come the plot spoilers. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">First,
            Jaime and Landon endure a series of several falling-in-love scenes:
            they look at the stars with her homemade telescope, slow dance, dine
            at a fine restaurant, kiss and cuddle, and bear up together under
            still more cool clique meanness at school. She defies her father,
            sneaking out one night to see her suddenly lovely boy. He gives up
            his old (apparently hiphop) habits: when Eric comes by for a visit,
            Landon rejects his choice of &quot;Get Ur Freak On,&quot; in favor
            of a Jars of Clay tune. She asks, &quot;Are you trying to seduce
            me?&quot; He asks back, &quot;Are you seducible?&quot; The answer to
            both is, yes and no. He's so completely changed by his interactions
            with Jaime that he's fine with appreciating her beauty sincerely and
            asexually (aside from petting and puppyish gazing). And she's so
            moved by his &quot;miraculous&quot; make over that she's willing to
            go pet and gaze (going farther than she's ever even considered going
            with anyone else). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">And
            then, Jaime drops the other shoe: she's terminally ill, in fact,
            she's dying in a few weeks. The movie has nowhere to go from here,
            and so slides off into a weepy, banal sunset. Jaime has a faint one
            day, and from then on, looks increasingly wan (at least she doesn't
            have to exchange her makeup-look for a no-makeup-look, since she's
            been made up throughout the film to look like she's not wearing
            makeup) and also steadfast, helping Landon and her dad to cope with <i>their</i>
            loss. Shades of Winona-Leelee-Ali McGraw-and-Bette Davis. (Come to
            think of it: when was the last time you saw a movie where the boy
            dies of a withering-but-strangely-glow-inducing illness to teach the
            girl an important life lesson?) <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">It's
            sad. Not that Jaime dies or that Landon cries, or even that the
            moral trappings of the film are so single-mindedly, so reductively,
            &quot;conservative&quot; (in the various meanings of the word). The
            tragedy is that <i>A Walk to Remember</i> is so unimaginative and
            dull. Though adults may see Mandy Moore as just one more girl
            singer, younger folks, who may be more attentive to the details of
            the pop biz see that she is special, and that she deserves better.
            And so, you might hold out hope. Though the industry tends to work
            against talent and self-respect rather than with them, she may still
            find it. <o:p>
