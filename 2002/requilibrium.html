            future looks grim and preposterous in Kurt Wimmer's <i>Equilibrium</i>.
            The U.S. went to war with Iraq and started WWIII, which led to all
            commerce and government going to hell (who knew?). In order to
            combat ongoing chaos, a new regime -- orchestrated via TV
            appearances by a gray-haired fellow named &quot;Father&quot; -- has
            outlawed all displays of feelings. Thank goodness that the totally
            cut Christian Bale gets in touch with his Inner Keanu and saves the
            world for all who want to express themselves freely. Hooray for
            kicking opponents' heads in, fancy wirework, and twirling black
            topcoats -- emoting at its best.</b></span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">&nbsp;<o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Predictably,
            there's a bit of movie tedium to endure before this gonzo payoff.
            That is, before Bale's character, the dismally named Clerick John
            Preston, comes to his senses, he's a dedicated member of Team
            Oppressive. Here that's a generically fascistic government ruling
            Libria, a city full of massive Mussolini-style architecture. So
            here's the basic illogic of this system: Father's spokesperson,
            Master Clerick (Angus MacFadyen), rallies his agents to kill
            &quot;sense offenders&quot; by damning the &quot;disease&quot; of
            human emotion with a thunderously emotional display. Apparently
            Father &amp; Co. have forgotten the Nazis were damn passionate about
            their mission. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>

            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            Clericks spend their time rounding up and killing hundreds of
            &quot;resistance&quot; fighters during night sweeps of the dark and
            poverty-stricken sections of the city. (Killing to stop the killing
            -- the illogic would be laughable if it weren't so like the logic
            behind the pitches for &quot;Iraq Attack.&quot;) The primary means
            of maintaining emotional &quot;equilibrium&quot; is to medicate the
            entire population; every morning John and his two young children pop
            Prozium II pills, and every morning John's Children-of-the-Cornish
            son quizzes his father, as if to catch him out in some show of
            emotion.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">John's
            efforts to stay cool stem from personal experience -- his own wife
            was found out as one of those offenders some time ago, and was
            hauled out of the house, in front of their young children and John.
            As they huddle in the hallway and wifey begs him to remember her, he
            stands by in the (routine) flashback scene, &quot;emotionless,&quot;
            devoted to his duty and the rightness of the cause. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">So
            ardent is John that he thinks nothing of torching the Mona Lisa
            (apparently the most recognizable bit of &quot;art&quot; the
            filmmakers could concoct to make the point) when he finds it hidden
            beneath some floorboards. He takes a certain pride -- not emotional,
            but professional -- in his physical perfection, capacity for cruel
            and efficient violence, and ability to ferret out emotional
            &quot;whiffs&quot; from anyone. Predictably, he comes to a series of
            crossroads (the earlier execution of the Mrs. was apparently not
            one), the first involving his partner, the pensive Partridge (Sean
            Bean). John discovers Partridge illegally reading Yeats (confiscated
            &quot;evidence&quot; that he kept for himself), late at night in the
            destitute part of town. Poetically, he shoots Partridge through the
            book he's holding up to his face. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Such
            frenzied metaphors almost save <i>Equilibrium</i> from being this
            season's <i>Impostor</i>, that is, the latest undercooked Phillip K.
            Dick-based flick. Since <i>Blade Runner</i>, the once prescient Dick
            has been a source of timely material for filmmakers looking to
            underline -- from a science-fictionish distance -- the danger of
            police states, wartime hysterias, and ultra-conformity. <i>Equilibrium</i>
            recalls <i>Blade Runner</i> and <i>Minority Report</i>, of course,
            as well as <i>Gattaca</i>, <i>THX-1138</i>, <i>The Matrix</i>, and
            George Orwell. Though <i>Equilibrium</i> achieves some admirably
            campy excess in the fight scenes (the hyperkinetic image of Patrick
            Bateman channeling Neo is oddly irresistible), most of its deriving
            and homaging never extends beyond the obvious. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>

            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Still,
            there's some plot to be handled at this surface level: John is
            assigned a new partner, the viciously -- er, dispassionately --
            striving Clerick Brandt (Taye Diggs). As he begins to ponder
            Partridge's interest in the book (and even recall his own wife's
            demise), John is apparently distracted enough that he doesn't notice
            that Brandt is another version of his previous self. This despite
            the fact that Brandt mentions their resemblance and his desire to be
            just like John more than once. Easily their most entertaining
            encounter occurs in the gym, where they're working out
            neo-macho-man-style. At this point, you can imagine why either of
            them signed on for this project -- such intensity, such jaw-jutting
            and teeth-gritting, must be rare in scripts these days. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Much
            as John and Brandt plainly have a need for one another, John further
            jeopardizes their partnership, his career, and his life when he
            stops taking his pills (hiding them in the wall behind his bathroom
            cabinet -- could this superstar stealth agent have picked a less
            clever hiding place?). Without his meds, jeez, suddenly everything
            looks different. John has an increasingly hard time slaughtering
            resistance fighters, he's nice to a puppy, and he falls for a sense
            offender taken prisoner, Mary O'Brien (Emily Watson), whose perfume
            bottle intoxicates him. When he visits her in prison, under the
            pretense of interrogating her, their mutual attraction evolves
            soap-operatically, though what she sees in this jackbooted bully is
            less fathomable than his fetishizing of her red hair ribbon. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Here,
            emotion -- the abstract enemy -- becomes concrete. John starts
            feeling everything -- fingering Mary's gewgaws while supposedly
            searching her apartment for contraband. He gets woozy. The very
            objectness of the objects overwhelms him. He might as well be
            slapping his forehead with astonishment: so <i>this</i> is what all
            the hubbub is about! He turns this discovery back around into a
            rationale for exactly what he was trained to do -- kill squadrons of
            assailants with moves faster than the eye can see, accompanied by an
            exhilarating dance track. Emotion or not-emotion: it all looks the
            same.</span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"></o:p>
