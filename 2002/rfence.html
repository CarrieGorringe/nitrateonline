            <font face="Verdana" size="5">27th Toronto International Film 
            Festival</font><p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">After a decade of 
            working in Hollywood, most notably as Harrison Ford's favorite 
            action-film director (<i>Clear and Present Danger</i>, <i>Patriot 
            Games</i>), Phillip Noyce has returned to his Australian roots in <i>
            Rabbit-Proof Fence</i>.&nbsp; Working from Doris Pilkington's 
            autobiography, Noyce and screenwriter Christine Olsen crafts a 
            bittersweet tale of miraculous resilience in the face of 
            state-sanctioned racism.&nbsp; </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In 1931, the Australian government 
            passed the Aboriginal Act, a law which allowed for the removal of 
            so-called &quot;half-caste&quot; children from their aboriginal families in 
            the hope that their &quot;inferior&quot; (read:&nbsp; black) bloodlines could be, 
            in the words of a fanatical official named Neville (Kenneth Branagh), 
            &quot;bred out&quot; of them.&nbsp; Placed in grim orphanages in the outback, the 
            children were subjected to periodic &quot;inspections&quot; to determine which 
            of any of the occupants had skin deemed &quot;white enough&quot; to allow them 
            to be taken and trained for more than menial labor (the law was not 
            repealed until 1970, long after eugenics had been scientifically 
            discredited) Those foolish enough to try escaping are subjected to 
            horrible punishment.&nbsp; However, fourteen-year-old Molly Craig (Everlyn 
            Sampi) is resolute in her desire to return home.&nbsp; Gathering up her 
            sister Daisy (Tianna Sansbury) and their cousin, Gracie Fields 
            (Laura Monaghan), Molly tries to make her way home despite 
            incredible odds.&nbsp; Not only must they travel over 1500 miles- on foot 
            - but they will also be pursued by Moodoo (David Gulpilil), an 
            Aboriginal who is forced to use his innate gift for tracking by a 
            government that holds his own child hostage.&nbsp; Their only guidepost 
            in the desolate outback is the rabbit-proof fence erected by the 
            government to separate the farms from the rabbits (and the 
            &quot;irremediable&quot; Aboriginals from those who can be &quot;saved&quot;).&nbsp; 
            Unfortunately, and not surprisingly, Neville knows exactly where 
            they need to go to reach their home.&nbsp; The result is an elaborate 
            game of cat-and-mouse as the girls, attempting to stay several steps 
            ahead of Neville's men, seek help along the way, not knowing whom 
            they can trust.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Noyce and his team have created a 
            quiet masterpiece that moves along as quietly and as resolutely as 
            the girls themselves.&nbsp; Cinematographer Christopher Doyle bathes the 
            screen in pastels, their wanness conveying the deceptive beauty of 
            the outback, one that can be abruptly broken in an instant by the 
            intrusion of the dark cars and uniforms of officialdom.&nbsp; Peter 
            Gabriel's score unobtrusively confers an appropriately eerie and 
            ominous, yet faintly hopeful, edge upon the proceedings. The 
            powerful performances by Sampi, Sansbury and Monaghan aren't laden 
            with mock-heroics, and necessarily so (the film's coda makes it 
            clear that there is no clean conclusion to the girls' story.&nbsp; Fence 
            is the necessary examination of one of Australia's darker legal 
            policies.</font><!--webbot bot="Include"
