            review by <a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>, 3 May 2002</i></font><p>
            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Forty years ago, a masked superhero 
            was born at the hands of Mr. Marvel, a.k.a. Stan Lee, and Steve 
            Ditko on the pages of <i>Amazing Fantasy</i>. As brilliantly evident 
            in this bigger-than-life makeover of a now legendary webbed 
            crusader's saga, it's obvious that there are other creatures than 
            cats which have more than nine lives. Through more than a few 
            television series (mostly animated), four video games, a couple of 
            direct-to-video spin-offs, and a theatrical-development hell that 
            could fill a supplemental DVD when this blockbuster hits Blockbuster 
            later this year, now arises <i>Spider-Man</i>, THE movie, a 
            wondrously Charles Atlas-esque story destined for overflowing 
            popcorn sales and enthusiastic audience and critical response. That 
            &quot;97-lb. Weakling&quot; turned world's most perfectly-developed man (with 
            advertisements featuring in most of those decades-old comic books) 
            is the type of spirited creation captured in the film, further 
            embellished with a witty, gee-whiz smartness.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sam Raimi, just a toddler when 
            Spidey was born, returns part way to his darker directorial roots of 
            the <i>Evil Dead</i>/<i>Army of Darkness</i> trilogy (with its star 
            Bruce Campbell making an amusing appearance in the current film as a 
            wrestling match ring announcer and giving the masked vigilante-to-be 
            his moniker), while also imbuing his movie with those smaller human 
            sensibilities found in <i>A Simple Plan</i> (1998) and <i>The Gift</i> 
            (2000). Yes <i>Spider-Man</i> will be a super hit because of its 
            tremendous mass appeal for people, like myself, who grew up on a 
            steady diet of Marvel and DC Comics superheroes. Yet the film also 
            succeeds because of Raimi's determined, deft touch in keeping his 
            titular character relatively personal, tender-hearted, and 
            narcissistically humorous within the confines of his supernatural, 
            i.e. $120 million budget, abilities. He plays with CGI masterfully, 
            on the rooftops, in the streets, and all those places spidermen tend 
            to spin with webs, although some of the upper-story soaring isn't as 
            believably smooth in transposing live action with computer 
            animation.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When Tobey Maguire was announced as 
            the film's lead, legions of fans let out an exasperated groan, 
            fearing the project would deconstruct under the performer's 
            minimalist acting style. But that now twenty-six-year-old boy we 
            applauded in <i>Wonder Boys</i>, <i>Pleasantville</i>, and <i>The 
            Ice Storm</i>, packed on a few pounds for his new vehicle while 
            retaining a boyish veneer that ultimately made him the perfect 
            choice. As Peter Parker, a meek, introverted high school science 
            geek, Maguire impeccably embodies the orphaned good-body residing in 
            Queens, New York, with his caring Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) and 
            Uncle Ben (Cliff Robertson). He's living right next door to a 
            red-haired angel, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst), for whom he has 
            been carrying a very big, and private, flame since she moved in at 
            age six. Dunst adds her own dynamic chemistry as romantic love 
            interest and vulnerable downtrodden daughter of a white-trash 
            father. You notice that, as well as her low-cut tops and one 
            jaw-dropping, rain-drenched moment that will send most of America's 
            male teenagers surfing the internet for a few of the frames with 
            this particular pose as their new screen saver. (Good news kids, I 
            think it's in the trailer.) Their moms may not appreciate such 
            virtual images flitting about the computer monitor, but their 
            red-blooded dads will ogle along with junior. Yowsah.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Maguire's blue-eyed innocence as he 
            transforms from school joke to action figure fills up the movie's 
            first hour with a charming journey of self-discovery, set against 
            the backdrop of the world's greatest city. The film also features 
            more than a few tributes to New York City's huddled masses yearning 
            to celebrate superheroes and brow-beat evildoers. Whether he's 
            prepared for stardom, this role will change Maguire's life forever, 
            especially financially, as he'll earn $26 million if he makes two 
            sequels.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As a rite of passage, Parker, 
            Watson, and classmate Harry Osborn (James Franco) graduate from high 
            school at about the same time (mid-point in the film) that 
            Spider-Man moves up from his amateur rankings (with a costume 
            featuring a red ski mask and gloves, and what I believe are flannel 
            pajamas) to full-fledged professional crime-fighter (with an 
            appropriate, true-to-the-original upgrade courtesy of costume 
            designer James Acheson). Veteran David Koepp's screenplay is 
            serviceable, although I had some problems with his development of 
            arch-nemesis Green Goblin (Willem Dafoe), the alter-ego of military 
            arms industrialist Norman Osborn (Harry's father), who doses himself 
            with an experimental drug and gains super-strength and a split 
            personality that too neatly separates its characters at the writer's 
            whim. Put him in his green armor and plant him atop his 
            armament-enhanced jet glider—he's one mean superdude. Plop him back 
            in his business suits (how does he manage to gleefully wreak havoc, 
            death, and destruction, yet still remember to be on time for 
            Thanksgiving dinner?)—he's a semi-indulgent father and 
            megalomaniacal executive. Dafoe plays it decidedly over-the-top, but 
            it's a distraction that his Gobby wasn't better defined, as 
            Superman's adversary Lux Luthor (Gene Hackman) was. There is also a 
            conflict in the narrative about how long Peter has mooned over Mary 
            Jane.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Danny Elfman's score is stupendous 
            in its staccato urgency, complementing the breathtaking production 
            design of Neil Spisak and the photography of Don Burgess (<i>Forrest 
            Gump</i>, <i>Cast Away</i>). The supplemental cast is all very good, 
            particularly J. K. Simmons (Psychiatrist Emil Skoda in all the <i>
            Law &amp; Order</i> TV series) as the close-cropped, cigar-stomping, 
            conservative newspaper editor J. Jonah Jameson.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Raimi, taking a cue from a line in 
            the film, realizes that with great power comes great responsibility. 
            He's taken a childhood treasure and spun it into a delightful, 
            respectable classic, something of which he, and Sony Pictures, 
            should be very proud. Do I smell franchise? Who doesn't?</font></td>
