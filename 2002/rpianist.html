            the bombs were dropped on Warsaw in September 1939 (as depicted in
            Roman Polanski's Holocaust survival story <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Pianist</i>), they were falling all around New York City's Minskoff
            Theatre. In early December (2002), critics were pummeling David
            Ives, Jim Steinman, and Michel Kunze's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Dance
            of the Vampires</i>, a musical adaptation of Polanski's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Fearless Vampire Killers</i> (an adorable 1967 horror comedy
            released in England under the play's title). While <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">DOTV</i>
            will be kept temporarily afloat by having <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Phantom
            of the Opera</i>'s Michael Crawford comfortable ensconced in the
            belfry as the head bloodsucker, Polanski will have a longer stay and
            be much better represented on either end of Broadway with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Pianist</i>, his well overdue cinematic silver lining. Winner of the
            Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival last May, honored by the
            Boston and San Francisco film critics as the best film of the year, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Pianist</i> marks Polanski's painful, poignant, and triumphant
            return to the Directors' Circle, a lofty tier he visited with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

            <p style="tab-stops:225.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Having
            escaped the Nazis himself … the bombing of Warsaw and imprisonment
            in the Cracow Ghetto … Polanski uses his haunting childhood
            memories to bring the horrifying, hopeful story of renown
            composer-pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman to life. He actually begins <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Pianist</i> with a tickle of false hope, but doesn't let his
            audience retract for more than two hours from his retelling by
            screenwriter Ronald Harwood (based on the 1946 autobiography) of the
            ensuing horrors that befell the Szpilman family during World War II.
            The announcement that England and France have declared war on Nazi
            Germany only briefly forestalls the family's expected departure from
            the city. Believing &quot;Poland is no longer alone,&quot; all
            thought of packing a lifetime's belongings into a handful of
            suitcases is put aside. The family embraces, serves itself a
            celebratory dinner, and Papa (Frank Finlay) toasts to the Allied
            powers, &quot;All will be well.&quot;</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p style="tab-stops:225.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But the
            clinking of the crystal is quickly overwhelmed by the thunderously
            bootfalls of the German soldiers goose-stepping through the ruins of
            the city. Wlady attempts to carry on his life. The radio station
            where he played Chopin having been destroyed, he finds the mounting
            restrictions against the Jews a minor inconvenience in finding work
            and freedom. The initial, non-violent restraints forbid entry to
            restaurants, parks, and—half-jokingly in a conversation between
            Wlady and his bright-eyed, blond-haired, non-Jewish friend Dorota (Emilia
            Fox) -- the public benches. Quickly the harassment escalates; the
            must-be-worn Jewish Star of David emblems, the face slappings, and
            the eventual redistricting of the city. On October 31, 1940, the
            procession into the Warsaw Ghetto begins a deadly chapter for the
            Szpilman family and those herded in the muddy streets around them.
            Vast starvation, abject fear, horrible acts of desperation,
            gratuitous arrests, massive humiliation, gallows humor. Death
            becomes an indiscriminate and arbitrary decision at the hand of the
            tormentors.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p style="tab-stops:225.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">By
            mid-August 1942, the Szpilmans are briefly separated. Wlady, his
            father, mother (Maureen Lipman), and sister Regina (Julia Rayner)
            pray that siblings Henryk (Ed Stoppard) and Halina (Jessica Kate
            Meyer) are better off. Reunited to share a small speck of caramel
            (their last supper), the family is crammed forward into the freight
            train that will ferry them to the death camp at Treblinka. While the
            German soldiers amuse themselves with anecdotes about their quarry's
            trip to the &quot;melting pot,&quot; Wlady is reluctantly rescued by
            a collaborator and forced to return to the ghetto, its streets
            littered with the belongings of the dead and soon-to-be.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p style="tab-stops:225.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Wlady
            begins the film's second hour alone, tearfully wandering the streets
            filled only with empty souls and lost luggage. He eventually flees
            the ghetto, and with the help of Dorota, is shuttled from one hiding
            place to another, only to become a front row spectator of the April
            1943 ghetto uprising. On the brink of discovery, he escapes to a
            secure, safe apartment, but is soon forgotten by the underground
            until near death. With the outbreak of fiery resistance in August
            1944, he breaks out once again, spending the last hour of the film
            playing an escalating game of fat German cat and emaciated Polish
            Jew mouse, once playing dead in full sight of a passing squad of
            Nazi soldiers.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p style="tab-stops:225.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Adrian
            Brody IS <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Pianist</i>. Yes,
            there is a director, a writer, a great cinematographer (Pawel
            Edelman), some incredibly realistic production design by Allan
            Starski (who won an Academy Award for his work on <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Schindler's
            List</i>), and painful to view makeup (Didier Lavergne and Waldermar
            Pokromski), but without Brody <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Pianst</i> does not breathe. This performance is one of the best of
            the year, particularly absorbing is the subtlety he lends to the
            role of an innocence observer, never once raising a gun against the
            enemy. His weapons are the music in his mind and ability to transfix
            an audience with it, no matter what their political association.
            Brody's Wlady is a wounded bird wanting to flee his cage and play.
            Just play. Much like Tom Hanks' character in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Cast
            Away</i>, Brody is often left alone on the screen for extended
            periods of time, put through the paces by a director who squeezes
            every ounce of emotion from his subject. The relentless journey to
            death, and the luck that keeps him from it, is only broken when his
            long fingers mimic playing the piano. Given an unusual opportunity
            to play when discovered by a compassionate German captain (Thomas
            Kretschmann) during the last moments of the film, that is
            bittersweet food to feed his hungry soul, despite the freezing cold
            and an empty stomach.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p style="tab-stops:225.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Around
            him, thousands of souls were lost by despicable atrocities hoisted
            by the Nazis on the Jews, but Wladislaw Szpilman as embodied by
            Adrien Brody and steered by the vision of Roman Polanski makes <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Pianist</i> a supremely hopeful cautionary tale of war's madness
            remembered that we, today, can prevent its tragic waste of life.
            Here is a divine monument to a single man's struggle to regain his
            life, his dignity, and his music.</font></p>
