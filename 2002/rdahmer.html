            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">When Jeffrey Dahmer was on trial 
            for murdering seventeen men in the early '90s, my roommate and I 
            tuned into Court TV hoping to get a look at the world's most famous 
            cannibal. Both of us were college students and, while we wouldn't 
            admit it, wanted to know every detail about his heartless acts of 
            violence. After a few minutes we quickly stopped reveling in other 
            people's tragedies and decided to do something more exciting, like 
            studying.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The defense and the prosecution had 
            the rare gift of making Dahmer's cruelty as galvanizing as an 8:00 
            a.m. macroeconomics lecture. Worse, the man sitting at the defense 
            table was not the defiant, brazenly demonic fellow we had imagined 
            or even hoped to see. Instead he was sort of a geeky guy who simply 
            blended with his surroundings.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This blandness enabled him to 
            escape detection and capture for an inordinately long period of 
            time. And it's what writer-director David Jacobson chooses to 
            emphasize his is new biopic on the serial killer. Jacobson rightly 
            concludes that his viewers probably know the extent of Dahmer's 
            crimes and don't need any reminders or embellishments. Those who are 
            longing to see Dahmer (Jeremy Renner) chow down on a seven-course 
            meal of gore will be deeply disappointed. In fact, Jacobson avoids 
            depicting the cannibalism directly. He even avoids courtroom scenes 
            or Dahmer's arrest.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Before the title character appears 
            on the screen, there's already a creepy sense that something is a 
            bit off. As the voice of Patsy Cline longingly wails in the 
            background, a series of machines stamp out little chocolate men. 
            Thanks to the context, the candy looks strangely unappetizing. When 
            Dahmer finally enters, he's wearing the same uniform that everyone 
            at the plant is, making him a cog in a greater mechanism.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">From this point on, Jacobson 
            refuses to follow most of the serial killer movie rules. We do see 
            Dahmer attack, but the victim's wounds are out of the frame. Only 
            toward the end do we get to see any of the gore or dismemberment. 
            Jacobson instead focuses on how everyone around Dahmer continually 
            missed out on what now seem to be obvious signs of how dangerous he 
            really was. Without the audience's hindsight, the supporting 
            characters think that he's either just a sad drunk or a fellow who 
            needs to learn how to pick up other guys at gay bars without first 
            drugging them. When Dahmer tells a cop that he's had a bad night, 
            can't sleep and just wants to take his lawn clippings (actually the 
            hacked-up body of his first victim) to the dump at 3:00 a.m., foul 
            play seems obvious to us. To the policeman pulling him over, 
            however, it seems only a little strange.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jacobson gives Dahmer a 
            consideration that the murderer never game his victims. In a long 
            encounter Dahmer has with a potential meal named Rodney (Artel 
            Kayaru), Renner gets to show how loneliness and other frustrations 
            led Dahmer to kill. The dialogue's a bit stiff and obvious, but the 
            sequence gives a strong hint to the torments that made him a menace 
            to others and himself without remotely excusing his actions. This is 
            not small feat. In some ways, making Dahmer more human enables us to 
            imagine how he was able to lure people to their doom.&nbsp; At times the 
            modest budget is a liability. <i>Dahmer</i> has few locations and 
            gets talky. On the plus side, the cast is solid, and the lack of 
            familiar stars makes the situations seem more believable and 
            surprising. The only &quot;name&quot; actor in the cast is Bruce Davison (<i>X-Men</i>), 
            who's wonderful as Dahmer's concerned but clueless father.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jacobson and editor Bipasha Shom 
            don't present Dahmer's story in chronological order and go for an 
            almost stream-of-consciousness approach. Toward the end they even 
            split the narrative between one of Dahmer's later attacks and his 
            first murder. Most &quot;based-on-a-true&quot; story films aren't this 
            creative. It may be a little off-putting and disorienting at first. 
            The momentum of the narrative is slowed at times, but, in the end,
            <i>Dahmer</i> forces viewers to reach their own conclusions, which 
            is oddly refreshing. Despite the meager resources available, Renner 
            convincingly ages from Dahmer's teens to his late twenties. </font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jacobson and his collaborators 
            deserve a lot of credit for treating both Dahmer and his victims 
            with respect. The film has been screening theatrically, but there is 
            a forthcoming DVD with a fitfully insightful commentary track and a 
            featurette. They seem quickly put together and don't add much to the 
            package. The stylized cover showing a leering Renner is 
            inappropriate because it doesn’t cue potential viewers on what often 
            makes the movie work. <i>Dahmer </i>directed me to something I 
            missed when I glimpsed the real killer:&nbsp; sometimes the people who 
            should fill us fill us with fear don't because they look just like 
            everybody else.</font></td>
