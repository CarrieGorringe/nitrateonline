            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Jerking off and smoking dope: 
            with their pretty girlfriends on their way to Italy on vacation, 
            high schoolers Julio (Gael García Bernal) and Tenoch (Diego Luna) 
            are looking forward to what appears an uneventful summer. And yet, 
            they're bound to be surprised, as the opening scene of Alfonso 
            Cuarón's <i>Y Tu Mamá Tambièn</i> suggests: as Tenchon and his girl 
            Ana have awkward sex under a <i>Harold and Maude</i> poster, he 
            makes her promise not to have sex with anyone else, listing all 
            manner of nationalities for her to avoid. Yes, yes, she promises, he 
            is the only one for her. He pledges the same in return. They are, 
            after all, teenagers in lust.</b> </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Shortly after the obligatory 
            goodbye scene at the airport (Julio: &quot;I'll miss her, but this is too 
            much!&quot;), the boys find themselves at a fancy society wedding hosted 
            by Techon's wealthy dad. Bored with drinking as much as they can, 
            they meet the beautiful, Spanish-born Luisa (Maribel Verdú), married 
            to Tenoch's pretentious novelist cousin, Jano (Juan Carlos Remolina). 
            The boys are young enough to imagine she finds their drunken antics 
            charming, and they invite her to drive with them a made-up beach 
            they call &quot;Heaven's Mouth.&quot; &quot;We can drink coconuts and bring plenty 
            of 40s,&quot; offers Julio. Luisa smiles politely. And it looks like 
            that's that. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But, as <i>Y Tu Mamá Tambièn</i> 
            demonstrates again and again, life is full of surprises. Soon after 
            their initial encounter, Luisa agrees to go. Thrilled by their 
            unbelievable good fortune, Tenoch and Julio rush to the supermarket, 
            where they scamper and stumble through the surreally fluorescent-lit 
            aisles in search of chips, beer, and condoms. They have no idea why 
            she's leaving Jano, nor do they much care. But the film ensures that 
            you know some (though not all), of her motivation: distressed by 
            Jano's cheating on her, she abandons her affluent life, in search of 
            something else. As she leaves her apartment, the camera tracks from 
            the comfortable living room to the empty kitchen, walls covered with 
            photos and details of her marriage, to look out the window, onto the 
            sidewalk where children kick a soccer ball and she loads her single 
            bag into Julio's beat-up station wagon. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This isn't to say that Luisa's 
            looking for love or salvation on a road trip with a couple of 
            affable but ignorant kids. She's plainly aware of the limits of her 
            adventure, but there's more at stake for Luisa than immediate 
            gratification. The film too, is full of narrative layers and visual 
            nuances that challenge assumptions you may have about the 
            characters' desires and backgrounds. For one thing, the journey is 
            punctuated by images of what goes on in Mexico: police checks along 
            their route to the sea, poverty-stricken neighborhoods, and 
            community activities -- local religious rituals, roadside shrines 
            and vendors. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And for another thing, a voice-over 
            cuts in frequently, narrating not so much what's happening on 
            screen, but what you don't see and can't know, for example, that a 
            spot of road they drive past is the site of a fatal accident ten 
            years before, involving a chicken truck; or that a joyful fisherman 
            whom they meet during their travels will be reduced to working as a 
            janitor in two years, due to Mexico's increasing class 
            divide/dependence on tourism/collapsing economy. Or even that Luisa 
            has recently taken a women's magazine quiz in her doctor's office, 
            which judged her &quot;afraid to accept her freedom&quot;; Luisa, the 
            voice-over says, &quot;did not agree.&quot; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">On their surface, these audio 
            flashes forward and back have very little to do with Julio and 
            Tenoch's present &quot;action,&quot; that is, their evolving friendship 
            (complicated by their classed differences, Tenoch being rich and 
            Julio coming from a single-parent family), their sexual liaisons 
            with Luisa, their expected &quot;coming of age&quot; stories. But, taken as 
            interventions into the usual linearity of a road-trip movie, these 
            stories become profoundly relevant, some glimpses of truth 
            unavailable to the characters as yet, as well as access to the ways 
            the characters invent and perform themselves; as the narrator 
            observes, &quot;Their stories, though adorned by personal mythologies, 
            were true.&quot; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Its interest in the vagaries and 
            shifting colors of truth make <i>Y Tu Mamá Tambièn</i> an unusual 
            film. Rather than take its characters from point A to point B, as do 
            most road movies, it carefully and respectfully observes their 
            present moments, then looks back a little, and even projects 
            forward, to futures they cannot yet imagine. To achieve such 
            narrative fluidity, the film expands and explores the possibilities 
            of the medium per se. Not only does Emmanuel Lubezki's camera create 
            a sense of handheld intimacy and abundant vistas (occasionally at 
            the same time), but as well, Alfonso and Carlos Cuarón's script 
            develops multiple story levels, of memory, yearning, and 
            anticipation, so that your experience remains consciously different 
            from that of the characters. You don't lose yourself in 
            identification, but share experience, inflected by your own story.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At the beginning of their trip to a 
            make-believe beach (that turns out, brilliantly, to exist after 
            all), Julio and Tenoch gleefully instruct Luisa in their club's 
            &quot;Manifesto.&quot; Naming themselves the &quot;Charolastras,&quot; after romantic 
            Mexican cowboys, they run down a list of rules, like &quot;Get high at 
            least once a day,&quot; &quot;Whacking off rules,&quot; and &quot;Truth is cool but 
            unattainable.&quot; Luisa listens to these rules, but rather than 
            dismissing them outright as adolescent boys' self-inflations, she 
            takes them seriously, eventually asking them, by example as much as 
            anything else, to consider their adherence to a code -- even this 
            code -- as a means to self-definition and analysis, even 
            development.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Though the boys inevitably learn 
            that pursuing immediate desires can lead to unexpected consequences 
            (as well as completely predictable ones), they also come to 
            appreciate this coolness of truth, and especially, they learn to 
            value its elusiveness. At first, they can't comprehend what Luisa 
            means when she advises them, &quot;Life is like the surf, so give 
            yourself away like the sea.&quot; But by the end of <i>Y Tu Mamá Tambièn</i>, 
            they -- and you -- come to respect what remains unknown.&nbsp; </font></td>
