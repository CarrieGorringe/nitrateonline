            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The more Kevin Costner rests on
            his pretty-boy laurels, the public is, regrettably, going to have
            tepid films like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Dragonfly</i> tossed at them. His fans might consider taking a bug
            swatter to his latest effort, a pale <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Sixth
            Sense</i> imitation. Non-Sense, actually. You see dead people. I see
            dead writing. Brandon Camp, Mike Thompson, and David Seltzer mash
            out a comatose script that lets the sap flow down a river of cameo
            stereotypes and mindless dialogue. Your chances of really enjoying
            this semi-spooky journey into the Madame Cleo's psychic zone is
            about the same as finding honest judges in the ice-skating
            competition at the Olympics. Sure, it's more entertaining than <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">3,000
            Miles to Graceland</i>, Costner's uniquely miscalculated last
            effort, but on the critical Savadameter scale, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Dragonfly</i>
            flutters below the horizon to a mere one wing out of four. I guess
            the producers are hoping for a wing <i>and </i>a prayer. They'll
            need more than that to get this flattened bug off the ground.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">No, it doesn't bring to mind the
            metaphysical <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">What Dreams May
            Come</i>, a truly unbearable visit to that other world between life
            and death, but the effect is nearly as fatal. Costner drifts through
            the film with barely any emotional direction from Tom Shadyac (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Ace
            Ventura: Pet Detective</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Nutty Professor</i>, and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Liar
            Liar</i>), whose first excursion out of comedy and into something
            &quot;truly serious&quot; flounders about with insipid conversation
            and wiggly symbolism that only a mapmaker might find amusing. The
            film closely aligns itself with Shadyac's foolish but more watchable
            <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Patch Adams</i> in twisting
            the heart strings until they snap; however Costner's dreary funereal
            gaze sharply contrasts with the manic energy of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Patch</i>'s
            Robin Williams.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Dragonfly</i>'s trailers have been pushing the eerie <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Mothman
            Prophecy</i> buttons for expectant audiences, yet after viewing the
            entire film, the prescription is a meager dose of angelic white
            lights, telekinetic anomalies, and a few tablets of cheap, abrupt
            fright gimmicks. The real scare come when such a decent support cast
            fails to register in such a heavy-handed effort. Joe Morton and Ron
            Rifkin have bare walk-ons as a strong-armed hospital administrator
            and a concerned, organ-hungry surgeon. Joe Darrow (Costner) works
            with them as head of emergency services at Chicago Memorial Hospital
            (isn't that where Dr. Kimball started out before turning fugitive?).
            Before the opening credits are over, Dr. Kimball's, er, sorry, Dr.
            Darrow's wife Emily (Susanna Thompson) perishes in a muddy rockslide
            when on a Red Cross mercy mission in South America, having put her
            career as a pediatric oncologist on hold to wrestle with
            middle-class social angst. What's a pregnant girl to do but absurdly
            drag herself off to the edge of civilization, deep in the jungles of
            Venezuela?</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The rest of the film follows Joe
            through a series of is-she-or-isn't-she experiences wherein the
            grieving widower waits for several very sick children to drift off
            into near-death and channel a message from his late-or-not-late
            missus. Welcome to the dead letter zone. One of the kid's Jeffrey
            Reardan (Robert Bailey, Jr.) delivers more than a few notes about
            rainbows and waterfalls (too much Discovery Channel, perhaps?),
            making him eligible for a frequent delivery program, although a
            handful of other postmen convey the phrase &quot;Emily's Joe!&quot;
            that should banish the authors to screenwriter's Hell.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Joe also manages more than a few
            insipid autumnal memories of his blissful life with Emily, one which
            shows the couple in bed, playing lovey-dovey and showcasing the
            reason for the film's title -- a faint birthmark of the bug near
            Emily's right shoulder blade.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The writers mistakenly fill the
            film with dialogue that time and again precludes the action, thereby
            weakening <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Dragonfly</i>'s limited shock value. Joe's moth-eaten mynah, obviously
            caught in the dryer a few spins over the limit, resides in the
            Darrow suburban Victorian homestead, despondently silent in Emily's
            absence. She had taught the bird to say &quot;Honey, I'm home,&quot;
            in a toss-away line offered by Joe to his neighbor Miriam Belmont
            (Kathy Bates), a butchy lawyer who has grieved and gotten over the
            loss of her own lover and now is trying to get mopey Joe to move on
            with his life. Of course the bird's gonna talk, and you know exactly
            what it's going to squawk.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There are a few continuity
            problems, too. When someone fully clothed falls in the water and
            pops out, there's no reason that person's clothes should be drip dry
            an hour later. Honestly, I felt like I was caught in a bug zapper by
            the time the filmmaker dragged us to rainbow's end. If you build a
            film like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Dragonfly</i>, no
            one should come.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"></o:p>
