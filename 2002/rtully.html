            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by
            <a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>, 27 December 2002</i></font><p>
            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">This sun-drenched tale of the 
            American Heartland mixes together a &quot;yeah, I know I'm gorgeous&quot; 
            heartthrob, one freckled-face redhead, more than a handful of 
            wonderful performances, and a big wallop of Hallmark. After baking 
            for 102 minutes in a warm, golden Nebraska field of dreams, you find 
            the meal, er film, well-prepared, enjoyable, almost-filling, and 
            with a sweet, hopeful dessert. Like some honky-tonk, Nashville 
            ditty, <i>Tully</i> is a small, amiable walk down the fragile, 
            country road of life. When you're thrown a bad pitch such as the 
            loss of a loved one or a pending foreclosure (I'll leave the rhyming 
            to you), you either duck or get winged. And all the men in the 
            Coates family have a handful of secret curve balls tossed their way. 
            Director and co-writer Hilary Birmingham's maiden feature, based on 
            a 1992 O. Henry Prize-winning short story by Tom McNeal, is a 
            strong, polished, professional indie effort that bodes well for 
            bigger success. Her subtle direction, unhurried pacing, a fine 
            ability to elicit believable performances from her actors, and an 
            honest script with homegrown dialogue (co-written with Matt Drake) 
            make <i>Tully</i> a keeper.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Twenty-somethings Tully Jr. (<i>City 
            by the Sea</i>'s Anson Mount) and his shy, younger brother Earl 
            (Glenn Fitzgerald) live with their purse-lipped stone-face of a 
            father (Bob Burrus). Tully Sr. has kept a tight clamp on the 
            business of running the family farm since the undocumented loss of 
            his wife a decade and a half earlier, and an unexpected $300,000 
            lien quickly dampens his already stoic demeanor. Even though photos 
            of mom peer out from behind a mirror's edge here and there around 
            the house, she's rarely the topic of discussion among those who were 
            closest to her. Some ghosts are indeed pushing the generations 
            apart.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The lads generally attend to their 
            daily chores. They have their easy-going friends in Great Falls and 
            straightforwardly manufacture their own good, clean fun drinking 
            Budweisers, munching on French Fries, or catching <i>The Trouble 
            with Harry</i> at a Hitchcock retrospective at the town's sole 
            bijou. The semi-introverted yet emotionally secure Earl puts up with 
            his still-maturing brother's casual dalliances with the young 
            fillies he deflowers on the hood of his car. Yet, as each layer of 
            the family's secret past is painfully revealed, the men drift closer 
            together, their protectiveness of each other strengthening. And 
            that's the key to enjoying <i>Tully</i>. It's a painfully simple 
            story that builds strongly on family, friendship, changing 
            relationships, and inner growth.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Keeping company with the family is 
            Ella Smalley (Julianne Nicholson), a no-nonsense, even-keeled 
            neighbor. She's best friends with Earl and calmly capable of 
            playfully analyzing Tully's womanizing efforts, even joking with him 
            when one such conquest, April Reece (Catherine Kellner), a jealous 
            stripper—or &quot;burlesque&quot; entertainer as she likes to call 
            herself—takes some artistic license with Tully's Cadillac as 
            punishment for dipping his wick in one too many wells. IMHO, 
            Nicholson, best known for her television roles in <i>The Others</i>,
            <i>Ally McBeal</i>, and <i>Presidio Med</i>, is poised for stardom. 
            Her acting ability notwithstanding, if I had a nickel for every one 
            of her lovable freckles that run her skinny 5'9&quot; frame, I'd be a 
            millionaire. Of course, we're all richer for her fine, sensitive 
            performance as the girl next door, the young earth-mom, and the 
            tender core that makes the emotional journey of <i>Tully </i>such a 
            joyful ride.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Natalie Canerday also gets high 
            marks in her role as the comically coy Claire, a kind-hearted 
            grocery clerk enamored of the much older Tully, Sr. She could have 
            easily been plucked from a Mike Leigh film, with her brief 
            appearances quietly lifting the sullen widower out of a years-long 
            depression.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Technically, this low-budget entry 
            has more going for it than the fine cast and direction. John 
            Foster's cinematography captures the warmth of the landscape (with 
            filming spanning Nebraska, Iowa, and the director's home state of 
            Massachusetts), while Marcelo Zavos adds a splendid, understated 
            score.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film, originally shown at 
            several film festivals more than two years ago under the title <i>
            The Truth About Tully</i> has since been nominated for four 
            Independent Spirit awards (Best Feature, Screenplay, Supporting 
            Female [Nicholson] and Debut Performance [Burrus]), rechristened (to 
            avoid confusion with that dreadful <i>The Truth About Charlie</i>) 
            and released through&nbsp; Small Planet Pictures. It opens in Washington 
            at the Visions Cinema/Bistro/Lounge on January 10. Local readers are 
            advised to mark their calendars now. It'll be a pleasant start to 
            their new year.</font></td>
