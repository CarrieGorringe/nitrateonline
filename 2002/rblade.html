            <font face="Verdana" size="5">28th Seattle International Film 
            Festival</font><p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Once upon a time, 
            there was a group of noble guards called the Takemikasuchi, who 
            after they were sent into exile by a political coup, became 
            assassins. Shinsute Sako's film, <i>Princess Blade</i> (<i>Shura 
            Yukihime</i>) takes this premise and runs it through a different 
            variation of the chop-socky genre. Yuki, the film's heroine, is, one 
            might say, lethally loyal to the clan, (this is a good thing, 
            because, like the Mafia, the Takemikasuchi don't believe in 
            voluntary retirement), which is currently headed by a sinister 
            figure named Byakurai. One day, while hunting down a &quot;traitor,&quot; Yuki 
            comes across yet another one, a man who was a servant to her mother. 
            From him, she learns that, not only is she a princess and the only 
            one with legitimate rights to lead the Takemikasuchi, but that 
            Byakuri tortured her mother to death. On the verge of turning twenty 
            years old (the age at which all clan Princesses are crowned), Yuki 
            must make a decision: should she fight for the leadership of the 
            clan, or go into hiding in an attempt to avoid Byakuri's wrath? 
            While on the run from one of Byakurai's assassination attempts, Yuki 
            encounters, and takes refuge with, a young man and his traumatized 
            sister. </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Unbeknownst to Yuki, his home is no 
            real sanctuary; the young man, in turn, is in thrall to his own need 
            to find peace and happiness at any cost, to the extent of placing 
            his own faith in yet another sinister member of authority. Of 
            course, since she's a royal assassin (not just some mere peasant), 
            it's obvious that she will be able to kick at least five times more 
            ass than anyone else in the story, so that gives her, well, a 
            fighting chance. Whether or not she can save her newfound friends is 
            another matter.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sako's film is chock-full of 
            visually masterful set pieces, thanks to legendary fight 
            choreographer Donnie Yen (<i>Iron Monkey</i>), but, as might be 
            expected, rather light on plot and expository information. The 
            audience never learns much about the young man or the connection to 
            the political machinations in which he has become involved; we're to 
            assume that his idealism, coupled with weary cowardice, has rendered 
            him useless in the fight against potential dictatorships. After a 
            while, the extreme contrast between skilful fighting and moral 
            weakness stretches the film's credibility thin. It's best to 
            concentrate upon the action and less upon the plot.</font></p>
