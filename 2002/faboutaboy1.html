</font><font face="Verdana" size="4">Interview with Chris and Paul Weitz</font><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="4"><br>
</font></span><i><font size="1" face="Verdana">interview by
<a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 17 May 2002</font></i></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Different as they may be, and they are, 
Chris and Paul Weitz appreciate the specific weirdness that each brings to their 
relationship, as brothers and filmmakers. Raised &quot;in&quot; the profession -- their 
dad is fashion designer/writer John Weitz and their mother is Susan Kohner, who 
played Sarah Jane in Douglas Sirk's <i>Imitation of Life</i> (1959) -- Chris and 
Paul share a healthy perspective on the business and the art of movies. Far less 
mainstream high-jinksy than their most famous film, <i>American Pie</i>, might 
suggest, they do cultivate a certain sense of the absurd and &quot;perversity,&quot; as 
Chris calls it. While you would hardly call the Weitzes &quot;sober,&quot; they are 
plainly serious about what they do, and understand their chosen profession in 
all its layers. </b>&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Partly, this understanding is revealed in their 
varied career choices. After making dissimilar early career choices -- Chris has 
a degree in English lit from Cambridge University, worked as a journalist, and 
passed his foreign service exams with the idea of going to work for the State 
Department, while Paul got a film degree from Wesleyan University and produced 
off-Broadway plays -- they broke into the mainstream as screenwriters. Their 
first script was for <i>Antz</i>, then they wrote <i>Madeline</i> (based on the 
popular children's book). At last, they somehow convinced Universal Studios to 
let them -- first-timers -- direct <i>American Pie</i>. The rest, you might say, 
is history: they then grappled with the Chris Rock Team while directing the 
less-than-successful <i>Down To Earth</i>. In between directing jobs, the 
Weitzes acted in Miguel Arteta and Mike White's indie DV project, <i>Chuck &amp; 
Buck</i>. &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Today we're talking about their new film, <i>
About A Boy</i>, based on the Nick Hornby novel and starring Hugh Grant as Will, 
Nicholas Hoult as Marcus, Toni Collette as Marcus' mother, and Rachel Weisz as 
Will's eventual love interest, Rachel. &nbsp;</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>Cynthia Fuchs: </i></b>How have your 
different educational backgrounds helped you to collaborate on films? &nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>Paul Weitz: </i></b>I think that one 
thing that film students should immediately do is to take a literature class. 
The idea that film exists in this technical vacuum outside of the history of 
storytelling misleads people. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>Chris Weitz: </i></b>When I went to 
Cambridge, there was no film department; it's a very canonical, rigid literature 
curriculum, and films just didn't exist, basically. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>PW: </i></b>I did go to film school, but 
it was really with this film [<i>About A Boy</i>] that I started to understand 
what people meant when they talked about the &quot;language of film.&quot; It was through 
watching certain films over and over, and trying to deconstruct that experience, 
trusting that that wouldn't ruin the experience of film. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CF: </i></b>I've read repeatedly that you 
got this gig, because you demonstrated a &quot;passion&quot; for the book and a &quot;passion&quot; 
for the film, a passion for <i>Antz</i>... &nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CW: </i></b>It seems like we're kind of 
sweating with lust for our projects. That's a word overused by studio 
executives, especially about very cold, unpassionate people. But you know, 
strangely, making a film can wreck your enjoyment of films, because you can 
start to think, &quot;Oh whoops, I just saw the zoom,&quot; which is supposed to be 
hidden. And that can be a bit of a shame. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>PW: </i></b>But at its best, the essence 
of art is getting an audience to suspend their disbelief. Actually, to some 
extent, the more knowledge you have about the technical processes of film, the 
more fulfilling it can be when you forget about those things while watching a 
film, <i>or</i> when you perceive this other language going on beneath the 
surface. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CW: </i></b>The question of disbelief is 
more complicated when you have a movie star in your picture. That's where the 
willing suspension of disbelief comes in. But I wonder at what degree that 
really operates. With <i>American Pie</i> we had the advantage that nobody had 
seen these actors before. And so they only identified them as these characters, 
which may be a problem for some of them now. But when you see Hugh Grant, you 
see Hugh Grant play Hugh Grant play someone like Hugh Grant. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>PW: </i></b>There's almost something 
ancient and mythological about it. Like there are all these legends about the 
same character...&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CW: </i></b>Yeah, like the trickster. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>PW: </i></b>Exactly!&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CW: </i></b>Especially with Hugh, because 
he has such a particular persona that follows him and occasionally hounds him. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>PW: </i></b>But I think he's being 
incredibly smart right now. The film, when we made it, was coming up against the 
writers and actors' strike, which eventually didn't happen, but everybody 
thought there was going to be a cut-off point. And Hugh was turning down all 
sorts of roles in hopes that we would get this film, together. I think that it's 
something that he can do incredibly well, that is sort of &quot;natural&quot; to him, but 
it is sort of a step away from the bumbling, foppish guy so many people 
associate him with. &nbsp;</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CF: </i></b>The Will and Marcus story is 
such a strong center for the film, I was almost disappointed when the more usual 
romance between Will and Rachel popped up. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>PW: </i></b>Well, the most conventional 
way would have been to have him end up with Marcus's mother, whom he meets 
first. But in terms of Rachel, we were trying to posit that it's only because 
he's met Marcus and has sort of inadvertently been opened up that he's able to 
have this relationship with her, that he could have met the same person a year 
before and only been able to have a one-night stand with her, rather than 
something more substantial. And in fact, we cut some stuff that was hedging our 
bets and was more of a romantic comedy. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CW: </i></b>We actually always saw it 
that the subtext of the movie was a romantic comedy between him and the boy, not 
in any sort of perverted way, but in the sense that, in a romantic comedy, you 
have the audience rooting for these two ill-matched characters to get together. 
The film follows that kind of rhythm, in that boy meets boy, boy loses boy, boy 
gets boy [laughs].&nbsp;</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CF: </i></b>How was it to make a high 
profile, sort of prestigey movie like this one? &nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>PW: </i></b>It's funny, we actually took 
a step down in budget from the last film [<i>Down to Earth</i>]. It's high 
profile in the sense that there's a movie star and it's based on a somewhat 
beloved book. But I think we were just so desperate to do a comedy of this type, 
in that it's sort of hearkening back to Billy Wilder's <i>The Apartment</i> 
[1960], which is a comedy, but Shirley MacLaine's character tries to commit 
suicide partway through the movie, and there are a lot of dark aspects to it. I 
think also when you make a film you're hoping that it is inadvertently, A) of 
the time, and B) telling some story that will have all sorts of meanings 
attached to it. And I do think that Nick Hornby's novels, and in particular, 
this novel, do manage to achieve that. I'm possibly about to get extremely 
obtuse...&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CW: </i></b>[laugh] About the means of 
production? The service industry? Paul has developed an interesting economic 
theory...&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>PW: </i></b>It's about a guy who does 
nothing and in modern economics, the Western world has moved away from being 
manufacturing into being a service economy, where we basically do nothing. And 
lots of people I know, not just those who literally don't have jobs, but even 
those who do, for example in the financial industry, appear to me to do 
absolutely nothing. And so, in some ways, I think that Hugh's character is of 
the time. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CW: </i></b>Ironically, in film, we're 
manufacturing this image on celluloid, in an actually archaic mode. Pretty soon 
you'll just be making digital information, which gets beamed around. With film, 
you're working in this practically medieval art form. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>PW: </i></b>Yeah, it goes along with 
dentistry, in that you can't believe they're still doing it in the same way they 
did at the beginning of the science. There must be some easier way to do it. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CW: </i></b>If not easier, there is a 
more efficient and more economical way, which is a bit of a shame, because 
you're going to put a lot of great tradesmen out of work. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>PW: </i></b>The wonderful thing about 
film is that you're trying to capture something very ephemeral and make it 
permanent. We get to see Cary Grant living, instead of some digital analysis of 
Cary Grant. &nbsp;</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Or, you get to see 
Fred Astaire dancing with a vacuum cleaner. </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">I think that's one of 
the most mortifying moments in recent culture. It's literally defiling the dead, 
exhuming his corpse and attaching strings to it, as far as I'm concerned. Leave 
him alone! </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">On some level, <i>
About A Boy</i> is, as you suggest, about class anxiety and lack of activity, 
doing nothing: Will has no aspirations and no reason to have them that he can 
imagine. </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">I think he's got this 
particular English thing, that if you can't do something well, don't do anything 
at all. He's a kind of desperate, hopeless character who's decided to abandon 
all pretense of trying to do anything. In that way, he's more of a literary type 
than a movie type. There's a book called <i>Against Nature</i>, by Joris-Karl 
Huysmans, it's about this wealthy guy who essentially spends his time 
calculating how to do nothing. Although most people aren't in that position, in 
that they don't have an independent income, people nowadays are often in the 
position of finding ways to waste their time, kind of on the way to oblivion 
[laughs]. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">But isn't that a goal, 
in capitalism, anyway, to have time to waste? </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Yes. I also think that 
we're in danger of being entertained from the cradle to the grave, with 
entertainment being this abstract concept... Not to say that this isn't an 
entertaining movie! [laughs]</font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">PW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">[laughs] Having said 
that, you <i>will</i> be entertained! </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Well, that's 
interesting too, as a lot of your work has been mainstream-industry 
entertaining, with <i>American Pie</i> or the Chris Rock movie. But you also did 
the strange and cool <i>Chuck &amp; Buck</i>. What possessed you to take that kind 
of risk? </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">PW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Well, he asked us, was 
the first thing. </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">And it was a chance to 
act, which I don't think is going to recur. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Are you kidding? You 
didn't get good notices? </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">I was mostly ignored.
</font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">PW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">You're being Hugh 
Grantish. <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> said... </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Owen Gleiberman, yeah, 
he must have been on crack! He actually said I deserved an Academy Award 
nomination, which I think is the exception that proved the rule. Actually, after 
we'd finished doing <i>American Pie</i> but before it came out, we knew we'd 
done something which had a chance of striking a chord in a kind of a mainstream 
way, and <i>Chuck &amp; Buck</i> was a chance to maintain some street cred. </font>
</span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">PW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">I think that the 
hidden thing about <i>Chuck &amp; Buck</i> is that it's an entertaining film. </font>
</span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">It has a happy ending, 
too. </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">PW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">But I do think that 
there are some films that are treated better in a low-budget, digital video 
format, like <i>Chuck &amp; Buck</i>, but there are others that can stand a bigger 
budget. </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">We also thought it was 
going to be a bit of a laugh and was never going to get picked up. It was a 
bunch of friends making this twisted little movie. And when it got picked up, it 
was like a weird dream. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">There's a weirdness to 
your other choices as well. </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Perversity. </font>
</span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">PW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">I really hope so. 
Certainly to the path that our career is talking, there's a strangeness. But I 
think what we try to do is forget about the genre of the piece that we're 
making. So for instance, with <i>American Pie</i>, we were not aficionados of 
the teen sex genre. And we greatly disliked the aspect of, say, <i>Porky's</i> 
that tends toward misogyny. Or, with <i>Antz</i>, we sort of forgot that we were 
writing a children's film; there's so much stuff in there that's obscure, even 
too obscure for adults, much less children! I remember the horror with which I 
came up to a theater on the first day when I saw a little 4-year-old boy jumping 
up and down in front of the poster going, &quot;<i>Antz</i>! <i>Antz</i>!&quot; I thought, 
&quot;Oh man, we have <i>not</i> provided this kid with what he wants!&quot; And in this 
case too, although it's a romantic comedy, it's not really in the vein of <i>
Notting Hill</i>. It's much less sort of picturesque and filled with lovable, 
quirky characters. It's trying to be more edgy than that. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Although they are 
promoting it by comparing it to <i>Bridget Jones</i>. </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">It's understandable 
from the box office point of view, because it's hard to high-concept-ize the 
story; it's hard to market it as precisely what it is within the allotted time. 
The film is the best advertisement for itself. So, they wanna get butts in seats 
so you can actually get word of mouth going. I think we're perverse before all 
things. And it was odd for us to do a film abroad, to do an adaptation of a 
novel. It seemed like a good change. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">At the same time, 
those people who do greenlighting, whoever they are, seem willing to give you 
chances. </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">We've gotten people to 
take some interesting gambles. I think that for this film it was the looming 
actors' strike and writers' strike, and the studios were desperate to get films 
into production. I think this one could have bounced around in development hell 
for quite a while, and it just fell into place. </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">PW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Actually, we had to 
convince the same woman to let us do this film as we had convinced to let us do
<i>American Pie</i>, and in this case, we said we wanted to make a movie like <i>
The Apartment</i>, and luckily she knew what <i>The Apartment</i> was [laughs], 
as opposed to a lot of people in Hollywood. </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">There's absolutely no 
institutional memory in Hollywood. And the last thing you ever want to do in a 
meeting is cite a movie that didn't make money at the box office, no matter how 
good it was. They'll nod their heads and say, &quot;Yeah, that was a fantastic film,&quot; 
and call somebody else. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Speaking of that, I 
was surprised to read in your bios that the only people who knew your mom's 
work, in particularly in [Douglas Sirk's] <i>Imitation of Life</i>, are gay men.
</font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">It <i>is</i> the gay 
litmus test. </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">PW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">I would say, gay men 
and cinephiles. I thin what Chris is referring to is that there's a female 
impersonator named Lipsynka who does an imitation of certain lines from <i>
Imitation of Life</i>. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">It's an amazing movie, 
and that beat-down scene with your mom [Susan Kohner] is just incredible, the 
music and the window, and oh...</font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">PW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">With Troy Donahue, 
yeah! </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Wasn't it Tab Hunter? 
Isn't there a guy named Troy Donahue playing for the Magic? A shooting guard? 
[laughs]</font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">There should be if 
there's not. </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Well, Douglas Sirk was 
clearly mad, or at least that's what it sounds like, talking to our mother. 
Fantastic names for movies: <i>Written on the Wind</i>, <i>All that Heaven 
Allows</i>. They're like Bond titles, all that meaningless grandiosity. </font>
</span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">It seems like you have 
a very easy and productive rhythm between you: how are you liking being the 
brothers-team? </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">PW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">We try not to have 
yawning conversations in our conversations, and when one of has a chasm, the 
other one leaps in, when you're talking to cinematographers or actors. I get a 
particular vacant look where Chris knows is the key for him to say something 
that makes sense. </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">When you're on the 
set, from the moment the day starts, money is burning, so you have to develop 
some kind of fluency to the way we work together, or we'd be in big trouble.&nbsp;
</font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">So you practice this 
in front of the mirror. </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">[laughs] Yeah, 
sentence finishing. No, it just seems to have worked out, because we grew up 
together and have always gotten along. People are disappointed because it's more 
interesting to see people fight than to see them agree. </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">PW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The only people we let 
see us fight are our editors. When we're editing, we beat the hell out of each 
other. </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">It is productive, but 
it can be ugly for a while. We had a big fight over the opening of this movie. I 
was for a slower opening. I was afraid to lose track of the kid in the 
beginning. </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">PW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">It was originally a 
lengthier introduction to Will, and another to Marcus. But I felt like it was 
important to get the audience to very quickly get used to the idea that this was 
about two characters, and that they were somehow bonded together. I wanted them 
to be visible faster, so it was a definite choice to have them both have a 
voice-over. </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">We used several 
devices; one was to change the opening song from a very poppy tune to something 
more lyrical [Badly Drawn Boy's &quot;Something to Talk About&quot;]. And we used a couple 
of cheap wipes to link them. [laughs] We wanted the dual voice-over, and the 
precedent for that was the Scorsese movie where &quot;Bob&quot; DeNiro and Joe Pesci both 
have voice-overs. There's a kind of paranoia about voice-over being &quot;telling 
instead of showing,&quot; but I think that's nonsense, if it's done well. </font>
</span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">It helps to have 
strong actors doing the reading. </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Yes, Hugh is 
brilliantly inflected. I think he was hung over [laughs], so he had that air of 
pain. And Nicholas was wonderful, without being hung over. He has a natural 
quality to him, unlike, a lot of the kids we saw for the part who were 
theater-trained actors and very good at <i>that</i>. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">And how was it working 
with someone so young? </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">PW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The first thing is 
that, when you're working with an adult actor, they've already made the decision 
in their life, and you're not going to ruin the rest of their lives by bringing 
them into the public eye. So one does hope that the kid you're working with will 
keep things in perspective and will not judge himself according to the success 
of his movies or his career. It's nerve-wracking. He still calls us up out of 
the blue and acts like we're just picking up a conversation we were having five 
minutes ago. </font></span></p>
<p><b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CW: </font></span></b>
<span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">He wasn't the kind of Haley 
Joel Osment type where you could go into these deep conversations about the 
motivation of the character. It started with us having him write words like 
&quot;sad&quot; in the margin of his script and underlining them. But he's got a lot more 
going on than that would seem to indicate. He is really a kid, and intuitive in 
that way. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">How do you deal with 
rough emotional scenes for a child to act? </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">PW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">There was a scene 
where the kids had stolen Marcus' shoes and he's out in the rain and he's 
supposed to cry. We did the scene and we thought Nicholas did it quite well...
</font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">... but first, we're 
trying to give him advice, telling him [in lilting, faux-hypnotist's voice], 
&quot;Think about moments that really upset you.&quot; And of course, there weren't any. 
[laughs]</font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">But you didn't have to 
tell him his dog had died. </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Well, we asked him if 
his hamster had died, and he was like, &quot;Yeh. Got a new one.&quot; [laughs]</font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">PW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">[laughs] So, we did 
this scene, and before he left, he came to us and said, &quot;Do you know what I was 
thinking about when I did that scene?&quot; And we said, &quot;What?&quot; And he said, 
&quot;Nothing.&quot; And he laughed in our faces and left. [laughs] There's something very 
pure about him as a person and an actor, though. He really gets that film acting 
is about letting the audience come to you. </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">It's rare in adults, 
and especially rare when you find someone who's a kid and understands what the 
camera does. </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">PW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Toni Collette's like 
that, actually. I never really see her acting. We've worked with actors who, 
when they have an emotional scene, you can't talk to them and they need to spend 
all day working themselves up into a frenzy. But with her, you'll be talking 
with her about which band she saw last night, and two minutes later, she's doing 
the scene and sobbing. </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">With Toni, she just 
sort of turns it on, and it's quite fresh when you get it. It's so hard to talk 
about acting and actors, to talk about something so intuitive. </font></span>
</p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">PW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">And there are so many 
different styles. Hugh would come to the set with his script all marked up with 
tons of notes. And you're trying to bring everyone into the same movie even 
though they're coming to it so differently. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">How has your acting 
changed the way you work with actors? </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">PW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">I worried less about 
rehearsal. It's only important what happens when the film rolls. </font></span>
</p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">I gained a respect for 
just how difficult it is to imitate another human being in front of a camera. 
And I think we learned to let our actors know what's going on even when they're 
sitting around waiting to do what they're going to do. Because to keep yourself 
in that high pitch of emotionality for hours and then learn that you're going to 
break for lunch is hard to do. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Do you shoot a lot of 
footage? </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">I don't think we ever 
do more than 10 or 11 takes, and that would be the outer limit, usually. So I 
suppose we do shoot quite a bit, though not aimlessly. I heard that William 
Wyler would shoot 40 takes and just say, &quot;Again,&quot; without giving any indication 
of what he wanted or when it would be over. I think the actors get kind of 
spooked after a while when you do that.</font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Are you ever surprised 
when you go into the editing room, by what you have? </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">I think more and more, 
we plan it ahead, and shot-list very carefully. In this one, we had some match 
cuts we had to plan out beforehand. We took a lot of inspiration for this film 
from <i>The Graduate</i> and the match cuts and other editing in that are 
extraordinary.</font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">How important is it 
for you to write what you're shooting? </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">PW: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">I don't think we'd 
ever shoot something that we didn't at least tinker with the script, so that we 
could understand it. Being a pure screenwriter is very difficult, because you're 
almost willfully trying to forget about the rest of the process, including 
actors improvising. And that's probably the most fun part, to get into an 
environment where there's some spontaneity. We're much bigger fans of directing 
than of writing.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
