            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the documentary <i>War 
            Photographer</i>, the American photo-journalist James Nachtwey, a 
            tall, serious-looking man, simply dressed and with short, greying 
            hair, is shown calmly and methodically assembling his still camera 
            equipment, and then going off to photograph people and events and in 
            places like Kosovo, during the discovery of a mass grave; a 
            confrontation between Israelis and Palestinians in Ramalla, during 
            which tear gas is thrown and bullets are exchanged inbetween 
            rock-throwing; African survivors of machete attacks, or people 
            starving during a man-made famine in Rwanda, the latter which 
            Nachtwey describes as something like &quot;taking the express elevator to 
            hell.&quot;</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In Jakarta, he meets and 
            photographs working-class people who are living next to railway 
            tracks -- right next to them, in the open and with trains zooming 
            by, because, with the amount of money they're making, it's less 
            expensive for them to live on this ground because they don't have to 
            pay rent. Wherever he goes, Nachtwey exchanges a gesture or a few 
            words of greeting with people before taking pictures. Ingeniously, 
            the documentary filmmakers have set up a &quot;microcam&quot; atop Nachtwey's 
            still camera, so that we can see the scene that he is photographing; 
            later, we see the images that he has recorded on film, unstinting 
            yet very expressive.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Nachtwey himself lives in an 
            apartment in New York City with a very good view, but it is sparsely 
            furnished and utilitarian. He seems to have very little life outside 
            of his work -- photography, and specifically war photography, 
            something which he says he consciously chose to pursue beginning in 
            the 1980s, takes up all of his time, as if it were a vocation, and 
            the more we watch him and listen to him, the more we come to believe 
            how entirely in earnest he is about what he does. And, gradually, 
            the documentary reveals the subject underneath the taciturn surface. 
            To do what he does means having to confront grief, horror, 
            bloodshed, but, as Nachtwey himself puts it, &quot;For me to go to these 
            places and cave-in would be useless.&quot; If he did, of course, he 
            wouldn't be able to function in this capacity, but neither is he 
            cynical, callous, or glib about what he does, nor is he some cocky 
            sort who sticks a gun in his belt, heads into a war zone, and hopes 
            to find fame and glory in the attention. The film opens with a quote 
            from Robert Capa, who took a famous photograph of a young man at the 
            moment when he is shot to death during the Spanish Civil War; later, 
            Capa himself would, fatally, step on a landmine during the early 
            years of what would become the Vietnam War. An editor for the German 
            news magazine &quot;Stern&quot; ventures to the filmmakers that Nachtwey may 
            have come to believe that he is immune to the stray bullet, and 
            there are certainly easier ways to make a living, especially when 
            Nachtwey mentions the difficulty in placing photographs such as his 
            opposite upscale advertising in magazines or in a media culture 
            attuned more than ever towards escapism and entertainment. But 
            there's no denying that he's performing an important service in 
            documenting events and occurrences that otherwise wouldn't be seen 
            or known about yet deserve to be recorded no matter how unpleasant 
            they may be.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Is he making a living out of other 
            people's suffering? A good question, and one that the documentary 
            does not try to dodge. Not until the end do we learn that Nachtwey 
            diligently keeps himself in check on this -- that if he ever felt 
            that his work was beginning to keel in that direction, than he would 
            have &quot;sold his soul,&quot; and in this way does his low-key manner, way 
            of living, and way of working all begin to make sense in your head. 
            Far from being unfeeling, Nachtwey maintains his compassion for the 
            people on the other side of his camera as a sort of covenant, so 
            that he can show us: This is what's happening. What can we do about 
            it? And it is only by way of other people whom the filmmakers talk 
            to that we learn of the injuries Nachtwey has sustained, the 
            instances of &quot;physical trauma,&quot; or (as told by a seasoned cameraman 
            who works for Reuters) of the time when he got down on his knees 
            before an angry crowd to beg that they spare the life of a man whom 
            they were going to beat to death in the streets. Inspite of himself, 
            Nachtwey emerges in this film as a truly heroic figure.</font></td>
