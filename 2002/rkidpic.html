            first moments of <i>The Kid Stays in the Picture</i> offer a grand
            tour of Robert Evans' beloved mansion, Woodlands, erstwhile home of
            Hollywood royals Norma Shearer and Irving Thalberg. As the camera
            trails through the oversized rooms, past splendid artwork and
            furniture, you might get the feeling that you've happened on a
            spooky, slow motion version of <i>Cribs</i>. And you'd be partly,
            oddly right. Much like the MTV series, <i>The Kid Stays in the
            Picture</i> is fascinated with the rich and famous, allowing you to
            feel intimate -- in the house! -- with celebrity, while also
            maintaining a suitably awed distance. <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still,
            Evans is hardly MTV's usual draw, that is, an up-and-coming or
            wholly legendary rock or sports star. Evans is certainly legendary
            in his own mind, and he's all too happy to tell you about it. Though
            he doesn't appear in the film as he is now -- it's comprised of
            stills and footage from back in the day -- Evans' monumental
            presence is everywhere. For one thing, he narrates the film, which
            is based on his 1994 autobiography (or more precisely, the
            audio-book he taped from this book), which closes with the words,
            &quot;Resolve: F*ck 'em, f*ck 'em all.&quot; The film is a little
            less pissed off, perhaps because the book helped to bring him back
            into Tinseltown's good graces. The film -- the pre-credits part of
            it, anyway -- ends with his answering a gushy interview question,
            &quot;Was it truly worth it?&quot; &quot;Yeah,&quot; he smiles,
            rakishly because he can't do it any other way. &quot;Because I love
            what I do.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">What
            Evans does, mostly, is him. It's hard to think of a more cheerfully
            and unapologetically self-involved character. His story, of course,
            includes mention of all sorts of other people, and his recollections
            are entertaining, if not quite as appalling as he might think they
            are. Then again, whatever he's thinking is clearly beside the point.
            Documentary makers Brett Morgen and Nanette Burstein (who made the
            solid 1999 boxing doc <i>On the Ropes</i>) have ingeniously
            assembled a collection of images (still, morphing, floating, and
            archival footage) to accompany The Man's narration, such that
            &quot;truth&quot; remains elusive. For viewers looking for
            &quot;history,&quot; this elusiveness will be annoying. For the rest
            of us, it's refreshing. The film doesn't lie, exactly. It's honest
            about its inability to get at something like truth. As the epigraph
            reads, &quot;There are three sides to every story: your side, my
            side, and the truth. And no one is lying. Memories shared serve each
            one differently.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like
            most everything else in <i>Kid</i>, these words sound nice but, when
            you think about it, don't mean much. You come away from the film
            without any sense that there is a &quot;truth&quot; out there that
            has somehow been missed, forgotten, or conveniently omitted. You
            feel more like you've been schooled on the limits of documentary as
            a concept. Where other documentaries line up facts, dates, and
            events, usually interspersed with witness testimonies, this one
            doesn't even pretend that it's getting at any kind of
            &quot;objective&quot; presentation or finding. Evans rolls on. And
            truth, as theorist Trinh T. Minh-Ha puts it, &quot;runs away.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            its own way, <i>Kid</i> does recount events, but they play here like
            movie scenes, which makes sense, since that's what they are now.
            Perhaps that's what they always were for Evans. He began his career
            as the fortunate brother-partner in the women's fashion concern,
            Evan-Picone. While in L.A. to oversee the start of a new West Coast
            E-P boutique, he is spotted by Norma Shearer, who picks him to play
            her late producer-mogul husband in 1957's <i>Man of 1000 Faces</i>,
            opposite James Cagney as Lon Chaney. This auspicious beginning
            quickly turns strange. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">That
            same year, he goes on to play the matador Pedro Romero in <i>The Sun
            Also Rises</i>, despite vigorous protests from key players Ava
            Gardner, Ernest Hemingway, and Errol Flynn. Here, he recalls
            proudly, producer Daryl Zanuck believes in him, telling everyone,
            apparently with gusto, &quot;The kids stays in the picture!&quot;
            With this experience, an autobiography's title is born -- especially
            as it dawns on the cocky Evans that he wants to be that guy, the one
            who can make that kind of decision, right or wrong. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And
            shortly thereafter, with <i>The Fiend Who Walked the Earth</i> and <i>The
            Best of Everything</i>, an acting career is mercifully ended. Even
            the egomaniac Evans realizes that he is a talentless performer in
            front of a camera, and besides, playing Thalberg gives him the idea
            that he wants to <i>be</i> Thalberg. With his business background
            and this goal in mind, he sets about looking for production
            properties. As Evans recalls it in <i>Kid</i>, his phenomenal
            success was a function of his own nerve, vision, and determination.
            It also appears here that he was the beneficiary of several men's
            trust, primarily the head of Gulf + Western, Charlie Bludhorn, who
            was, mid-'60s, casting about for someone to head the newly acquired
            Paramount Studios. Evans, recently the subject of a favorable <i>New
            York Times</i> feature, looked &quot;hot.&quot; He got the job. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At
            the time, Paramount was ranked ninth, after the top eight L.A.
            studios, so it may be that Evans' off route to power was less of a
            gamble for Bludhorn than it sounds (actually, the sound here is
            particular: Evans does a raucous imitation of Bludhorn, as still
            shots of both men drift and rotate over the screen). He went on to
            work a few miracles, and he's only too happy to list them: <i>The
            Odd Couple</i> and <i>Rosemary's Baby</i> in 1968 (Evans recalls
            triumphantly that he hired the &quot;little Polack&quot; even when
            he was warned against it), <i>Goodbye, Columbus</i> in 1969, and
            then a string of stunning critical and/or popular successes: <i>Love
            Story</i> (1970), <i>The Godfather</i> (1972), and <i>Serpico</i>
            (1973). Almost instinctively, Evans knew how to swing his weight; he
            started his own company, Robert Evans Productions, housed within
            Paramount. and the first film he made was the extraordinary <i>Chinatown</i>
            (1972). These were the days when the kid could do no wrong. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">During
            the late '60s, in addition to changing the fortunes of Paramount and
            all the suits at G+W, Evans also romances the luscious Ali McGraw,
            whom he affectionately calls &quot;Ms. Snotnose.&quot; He recollects
            his seduction of her by way of the looniest of movie-hero language:
            he gives her his number and says, &quot;I'm only seven digits
            away!&quot; Or, &quot;Never plan, kid. Planning is for the
            poor!&quot; At this point, he regales you with a couple of scenes
            from <i>Love Story</i>, the film/property that she brings to Evans
            and that apparently makes him adore her. But, ouch: that &quot;never
            having to say you're sorry&quot; bit on the snowy steps is almost
            painful to watch. Still, the film makes the cover of <i>Time</i>,
            among other commercial triumphs, and folks line up to see it, again
            and again. Evans and McGraw marry, he's a star, she's a star, and,
            as he remembers, &quot;Camelot was ours, or at least I thought it
            was.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">How
            ominous. And how 20-20 hindsight. Some time after they have a child,
            Joshua, she leaves him for Steve McQueen, her costar in <i>The
            Getaway</i>. According to Evans, he's been more invested in his
            crazy work schedule and professional reputation than in his
            marvelous wife (this would be Evans being contrite). The collapse of
            his marriage (the only one he mentions in the film, out of five
            divorces) leads him to rededicate himself to his work, though that
            also isn't going so well. After a debacle working with his
            tempestuous buddy Coppola on 1984's <i>The Cotton Club</i>, Evans
            takes up cocaine, ferociously. By the early 1980s, he's busted. His
            lawyer (OJ's Robert Shapiro) gets him off with a sentence of
            &quot;community service.&quot; Thinking he'll do even that up with
            &quot;grand style,&quot; Evans produces a public service
            announcement called &quot;Get High on Yourself,&quot; an
            embarrassing &quot;We Are the World&quot; gimmick-piece that he
            apparently still thinks is terrific.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Depressed
            and not working much, Evans then finds himself vaguely connected
            with a bizarre Hollywood <i>scandale</i>, the drug-related (and
            somehow, <i>Cotton Club</i>-related) murder of Roy Radin. Though
            Evans is never even a suspect, the fact that police question him
            ensured his name is removed from every guest list in town. Woe is
            him. Forced to sell Woodlands, he believes that his life is over.
            Eventually, as the film skips lightly through the later years, he
            believes he's suicidal and commits himself to an asylum, then comes
            up with a daring &quot;escape,&quot; calling his loyal limo driver
            to come pick him up outside the gates. As drastic and sad as this
            all must have been, in the telling, and in particular, in the
            outrageous spinning and hovering images concocted by the filmmakers,
            the whole story turns ridiculous -- outsized, pathetic, and comical.
            The film closes with a few notes, citing his return to work by
            producing <i>Sliver</i> (1993) and <i>The Saint</i> (1997). Oi. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">When
            Evans recently made the late night talk show rounds to pitch the
            film, he surely looked like he's been through all the hell he has
            been through, his movements and speech slowed (the effects of
            strokes), his skin tanned to crusty brown, his singular glasses and
            speed-mumbling all dialed up to the level of caricature (the film's
            closing credits roll over a smarmy-funny Dustin Hoffman imitation of
            &quot;Bob&quot;). Yet, there's no doubt that that Evans is enjoying
            his resurgence as a public figure, someone people crane their necks
            to watch. It's no matter whether or not you believe him, or whether
            he believes himself. The film is about the slippery slopes of truth,
            and the ways they serve all of us.</font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
