mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><b>&quot;To
            say I'm disappointed in you, young lady, is an understatement.&quot;
            So begins the stern dressing down delivered by Kate (Andie
            MacDowell), to a child caught smoking at a British private school.
            The camera pulls out slowly from Kate's face, to allow you time to
            absorb her every lovely detail. After ensuring that student knows
            full well the extent of her displeasure, Kate confiscates the
            cigarettes, dismisses the girl, and then, alone in her office, sucks
            down one of those cancer sticks with elaborate pleasure.</b>

mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">This
            first scene in John McKay's <i>Crush</i> lays out the film's
            remarkably banal premise: while Kate appears perfect on the outside,
            she's actually unhappy. She manages her disappointment (with her
            charges, yes, but more with her life), as well as boredom with her
            very proper headmistressing job, her small-town horizons (she's an
            American living in the &quot;quaint English Cotswolds,&quot; so
            described in the press kit), and most especially, her lack of a man,
            by spending one evening a week in a grousing session. She and her
            best friends -- single mom-policewoman Janine (Imelda Staunton) and
            three-times-divorced, cruelly witty doctor Molly (Anna Chancellor)
            -- drink gin, eat chocolates, and swap pitiful stories (pathetic
            sex, bad sex, no sex), angling to win the prize for &quot;Saddest
            F*cker of the Week.&quot;

            <font size="2">Crush</font></span></i><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"> offers itself (according to its
            website) as &quot;the female perspective.&quot; Even aside from the
            problem of assuming a single such perspective, the film's version of
            it is decidedly unoriginal. This isn't to say that girlfriends can't
            support one another when they're feeling alienated from the
            surrounding, narrow-minded culture that expects every woman to nab a
            man and settle down: but how come, in the movies, the women who
            comfort one another in the midst of their uncoupledness can't quite
            see their way out of the cultural expectations that are so
            alienating them? 'Tis a puzzlement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>
            </span></font><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
            <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">At
            any rate, the movie needs a plot, and so, into the women's
            melancholy world steps Jed (Kenny Doughty). Kate's former student,
            he's now a lovely-looking twenty-five and playing organ for funerals
            at the local church. (<i>Crush</i> has already been compared to <i>Four
            Weddings and a Funeral</i>, in part because it involves British
            weddings and funerals: how novel.) When Kate learns that Jed had a
            crush on her back in the day, she leads him outside to the cemetery,
            where they enjoy a quick shag on someone's gravestone, while the
            rest of the funeral party converses politely on the church steps.
            It's the same deal as when she smokes that first secret cigarette in
            her office: Kate is a good girl who wants to be &quot;bad,&quot;
            sort of.
            </span></font> <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
            <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Though
            she's somewhat embarrassed by her folly, Kate relates this first
            encounter at that week's &quot;Saddest F*cker&quot; session. Molly
            and Janine agree that it's a sad story, then move on. But trouble
            comes when Kate finds herself unable to move on. She's drawn to Jed,
            again and again. He's so earnest, so fun, so full of energy, and
            besides, he's devoted to her. When she eventually confesses to her
            friends that she has seen him again, they're very concerned,
            imagining that he's far too immature to be considered an ideal mate.
            They agree to a dinner to meet Jed, bringing along their own, more
            properly aged dates. At this point the film goes where you know it
            will -- the older folks are dismayed by Jed's affection for loud
            music and soup-slurping. He gets drunk, declares his undying love
            for his lady, and falls down.
            </span></font> <o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
            <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Such
            antics lead to disapproval from the older, more sophisticated folks,
            of course. And the film's &quot;female perspective&quot; here
            divides, somewhat, as Kate is forced to choose between her friends
            and Jed. But really, the film never gets over its own investment in
            conventional arrangements, in terms of love, age, gender, race, and
            class; even when one character decides she's open to a lesbian
            relationship, it's an afterthought, undeveloped and a means to
            &quot;wrap up&quot; with a clever twist.
            </span></font> <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">
            <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Molly
            and Janine apparently believe that Kate is much better suited to the
            dullest man on the planet, the vicar Gerald Farquhar Marsden (Bill
            Paterson). And indeed, when he pledges his troth to her (end extols
            her virtues, as in, &quot;You're better than sausages!&quot;), she's
            tempted -- he's so solidly bourgeois, and isn't security and comfort
            precisely what those who have the &quot;female perspective&quot;
            seek? Alas, Gerald can't compete with the excitement of secret sex
            among the footballs and gym jerseys in her school's locker room, or
            playing doctor against her couch, or any number of other
            &quot;illicit&quot; situations his youthful imagination concocts.
            Kate just can't resist, but then she can, and then she can't, and
            then... well, the film does go on.

mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Molly
            is most outspoken about her misgivings, deeming the relationship
            &quot;hideously perverted.&quot; Janine, ever the mediator, appears
            to go along, for fear that Kate will end up in a relationship where
            her younger man will cheat on her. The women take Kate for a weekend
            to Paris, hoping that the fine hotel room and a few suave Frenchmen
            will enable her to &quot;get over&quot; her crush. But the plan
            backfires, and soon Kate is planning a wedding with her young
            sweetie. This is too much for Molly and the narrative, which rapidly
            descends into a series of nonsensical and nasty turns. And Jed, as
            sympathetic, charming, and sincere as he has seemed throughout, is
            suddenly turned into Plot Device.

            <span style="mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It
            would appear that the women's friendship is the film's primary
            concern, and that the crushes they suffer are just that, as well as
            means to illustrate and somehow cement their increasingly disturbing
            power dynamics. <i>Crush</i> is surely &quot;quaint,&quot; but as it
            purports to demonstrate the binds and frustrations confronting
            middle-ageish &quot;women,&quot; it's also sad in ways it probably
            doesn't mean to be.
