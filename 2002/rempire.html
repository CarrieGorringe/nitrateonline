            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Of
            the many crazy clichés in <i>Empire</i>, Isabella Rossellini's big
            fat hair has to be the loony-tunesiest. For most of Franc. Reyes'
            neo-gangster movie, she remains out of sight, a mysterious
            millionaire drug queen-pin known as &quot;La Colombiana.&quot; Her
            eventual appearance, more than an hour into the film, is <i>completely</i>
            worth the wait. Seated at her patio table, her jewelry clinking and
            her gloriously crooked teeth glinting in the sunlight, La Colombiana
            holds forth, her hair teased high atop her head and falling into
            perfect flips -- a veritable hair riot. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Alas,
            aside from this brief, special moment, <i>Empire</i>, the first film
            produced by the Hispanic-focused Arenas Entertainment, is hardly
            surprising. This despite the fact that the central gangster-boy, the
            jangly, ambitious Vic, is played by John Leguizamo. Though he brings
            his usual charismatic energy, he's up against it: a predictable plot
            (essentially ripped off from <i>Carlito's Way</i>, on which Reyes
            worked as choreographer -- check Penelope Ann Miller's pole dancing)
            and weed-whacker editing (in a couple of instances, it's juts a
            mystery how he gets from one scene to another). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">While
            Vic will learn that crime does not pay (and without the benefit of
            Sean Penn's oh-so-memorable <i>Carlito's</i> hair), for a little
            while, he has that cocky, got-it-all attitude. He sees himself
            following in the footsteps of Rockefeller, Carnegie, and that
            &quot;geek motherf*cker&quot; Bill Gates, and it's hard to disagree:
            ruthlessness is an asset in corporate politics. Vic's got his loyal
            crew -- Jimmy (Vincent Laresca), Chedda (Treach), and Jay (Rafael Báez)
            -- and swears by a familiar credo: &quot;Keep your brothers close
            and your beef even closer&quot; (which he credits to his dead and
            much adored brother, but Jimmy knows it's from <i>The Godfather</i>).

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">According
            to Vic, the heroin dealer's existence is all about maintaining
            respect and turf divisions: he has one section, the biggest section,
            and others belong to Tito Severe (Fat Joe) or Hector (Carlos Leon,
            better known as father to Lourdes Maria Ciccone Leon). Though these
            lugs end up with bullets in their heads, Vic thinks he's different,
            mostly because he's more of the same. He's got the first-rate ride,
            the designer jeans, the assorted slick leather jackets. True, he
            still lives in the projects and has to hide his cash in nine
            separate locations, but he's the big fish in his little pond. As he
            puts it in his mostly redundant voiceover, he can park his $40,000
            vehicle anywhere in the hood. No one messes with his property. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Here
            Vic counts his lovely chica, Carmen (Delilah Cotto), whom he notes
            is smart enough to go to college but somehow not smart enough to see
            that his dealing gig is a dead end; her mother (Sonia Braga)
            suggests as much, but she's only on screen twice, so no one pays
            much attention to her. Then again, Carmen's judgment hardly matters.
            She's a plot device of the most tedious sort: her pregnancy prompts
            Vic to rethink his &quot;lifestyle,&quot; and her friendship with a
            white girl opens the door to his next option. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">When
            Vic gives Carmen a $17,000 diamond necklace, she wears it to school,
            where her &quot;friend&quot; Trish (Denise Richards working her own
            big wigs) spots it and immediately decides they need to be better
            friends. She invites Carmen and her ostentatious man to a party,
            where they're marked by what they wear, how they walk, and how they
            speak. Some skinny girls in cocktail dresses lust after Vic's
            jittery tough guy affect (Leguizamo swaggers more convincingly than
            Paul Muni, and more subtly than Al Pacino), but it's Trish's
            boyfriend, Jack (Peter Sarsgaard), who really takes a shine to him. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Smirking
            and shuffling, Jack calls himself an &quot;investment banker,&quot;
            and speaks that opaque Wall Street insiders' lingo well enough to
            impress perpetual outsider Vic. The two of them agree that street
            business is no &quot;different&quot; in effects and ethics than
            boardroom business, Jack gives him free use of a Soho loft, offers
            him stupid girlfriend advice, and buys him Armani suits on the
            &quot;corporate card.&quot; Vic is smitten. When Jack baits him,
            suggesting that maybe he's not ready to come along for the big deal,
            Vic insists, &quot;I was born ready, baby!&quot; Unable to contain
            himself, it's not long before Vic's investing $4 million of his and
            (bad idea) La Colombiana's money in a sweet &quot;legit&quot; deal
            with the obviously odious Jack. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Regardless
            of Vic's keen understanding of the workings of capitalism, he's
            doomed by his desire to be like Jack and be liked by Jack, or so the
            film contends. Street vengeance, cruel and extravagant as it is,
            comes off as less degenerate than good old white-collar brutality.
            Though Vic falls for the most ridiculous ploys (Trish on his lap)
            and responds in the most predictable ways (violent retribution),
            Jack's presumption of privilege and overt racism (&quot;Go back to
            your ghetto!&quot;) remain <i>Empire</i>'s primary targets. Surely,
            they're worthy targets, but just as surely, there's a less hackneyed
            means to take aim. <o:p>
