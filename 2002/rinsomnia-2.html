            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>At the beginning of Christopher
            Nolan's new film <i>Insomnia</i>, Al Pacino's character, an L.A.
            police detective named Will Dormer, is seen furiously trying to
            scrub something out of the cuff of his sleeve. Flying over broken,
            ice-covered landscape, he is going to the town of Nightmute, Alaska
            to look into the beating death of a seventeen-year-old girl, and,
            after his arrival, he peers into people's faces and circles around
            them, trying to determine who's hiding something or what they may be
            up to, with all the confidence of a great matador sizing up a bull
            in a corrida. When he announces that he's ready to pay a first visit
            to the school the deceased girl attended, he's told, incredulously,
            &quot;It's ten o-clock ... At night.&quot; Oh, right. This is
            Alaska, where it may be overcast and wet but it stays light a whole
            lot of the time, and the story proceeds to show how Dormer then goes
            on to get everything all wrong.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Dormer's inability to function
            without sleep is but one thing that causes him to slip up. He may be
            interested in getting at the truth (and he's not above scaring
            people to death in order to do so), and registers righteous
            indignation over the way the dead girl was treated, but he's also
            trying to selectively contain other things. Dormer's police partner,
            Hap Eckhart (played by the superb Martin Donovan), is being
            pressured to participate in an internal affairs investigation back
            in Los Angeles, something that may put Dormer himself directly into
            the line of questioning, and when he announces his decision, you can
            see something mean and hard deep down, like a metal line, surface
            within Dormer as he looks at Eckhart. Shortly thereafter, he makes a
            horrible mistake during the pursuit of a possible suspect, and
            proceeds to rearrange the evidence to deflect attention from
            himself. That's when he starts receiving tell-tale calls over the
            telephone from someone who seems to know his every move, where he
            is, even what he had been doing back down in California. The caller
            is one Walter Finch (Robin Williams), a smiling, soft-spoken writer
            who knew the murdered girl and proceeds to share with Dormer
            information about he made a mistake, in the past, that he could
            never take back and didn't make amends for. Now, they both share a
            secret and they both have the goods on each other, and they can't
            tell without getting themselves into trouble.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Williams, who plays his character
            with just the right touch of an outwardly convivial, soft-spoken,
            but earnest quality, is working without the hard-edged, and
            sometimes splenetic, quality that he brought to his earlier
            &quot;serious&quot; performance, which makes it more convincing when
            doubt is raised as to whether his character may really be guilty of
            anything at all: the story is being told from Dormer's
            point-of-view, and Finch may merely be a projection of his own
            increasing sense of desperation and anguish. Nolan, working from a
            screenplay adapted by Hillary Seitz from a 1997 Norwegian-made
            thriller, creates sequences which offer some of the most unnervingly
            accurate depictions of sensory dislocation I've ever seen in a
            motion picture (credit is due to cinematographer Wally Pfeister and
            film editor Dody Dorn, who also did brilliant work in Nolan's
            previous film <i>Memento</i>), but the picture also works best when
            it has an untethered, slightly unresolved quality to it -- just what
            are two Los Angeles police detectives doing in Alaska, anyway? One
            of the police officers in Nightmute, Ellie (Hilary Swank), turns out
            to be an acolyte of Dormer -- his previous investigations have
            turned into classic case studies for up-and-coming law enforcers --
            and she registers most acutely when Dormer seems to be acting in
            ways that just don't seem to be quite right.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film turns a bit too literal in
            the end, with some flailing about that seems to be in the picture
            because somebody, somewhere, said it just had to be there. It also
            looks as if Hilary Swank's character is going to be reduced to being
            as about relevant to the action as a bedknob, but she pulls things
            together in the end -- she shows whether anyone is going to get away
            clean or not out of the increasingly murky situation. Shortly before
            that happens, Dormer reveals why he is just one step ahead of being
            investigated by his own department: he rigged a case so that a
            person that he thought was guilty ended up behind bars. &quot;I
            assign guilt,&quot; is how Dormer sums up his job. It's a
            distortion, like the physical and sensory ones that he experiences
            in Alaska after going for too many nights without sleep, of what law
            enforcers are supposed to do, which is to determine who the
            wrongdoers are, but under the prevailing circumstances that everyone
            is innocent until proven guilty. Al Pacino's character is the one
            about whom we seem to know the least -- very little about his family
            background or personal predilections is given away -- but the way in
            which he portrays the gradations of Dormer's decline makes this one
            of his most fascinating and involving characterizations in years.
            Dormer is revealed as inhabiting that small, grey corridor inbetween
            which he travels from being a good cop to a bad one -- he's hedged
            and stepped over the line of boundary into the &quot;other&quot;
            territory, then stepped back, so many times, but once that first
            step is made, it's irrevocable and nothing can ever be the same way
            again. Dormer's moral compass, though, turns out to be his sole
            reason for existence, and once he loses that, he's lost in the void.
            Pacino's character in <i>Insomnia</i> can't afford to go to sleep,
            because, once he does, he's gone.</font></p>
