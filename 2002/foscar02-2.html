<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700">Four 
hours and twenty-three minutes; four points higher in the primetime overnight 
Nielsen ratings than last year’s telecast; back in Hollywood proper after 42 
years. Of all the numbers thrown about before, during and after the 74<sup>th</sup> 
annual Academy Awards ceremony, these seem to have the most resonance. For in a 
year when the Oscar nominees themselves and the expensive, acrimonious financial 
race to secure the winners by public opinion were as deeply schizophrenic as the 
subject of the eventual Best Picture winner, the true surprise of the evening 
was the dignity with which everyone involved in the ceremony seemed to comport 
themselves—and, in turn, the way this new gravity was received by the viewing 
public.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">For the record, the 
Universal/DreamWorks production <i>A Beautiful Mind </i>won four Oscars, 
including Best Picture, Best Director (Ron Howard), Best Supporting Actress 
(Jennifer Connelly) and Best Adapted Screenplay (Akiva Goldsman). It was the 
second Oscar in a row for the studio alliance, after last year’s <i>Gladiator</i>. 
And DreamWorks extended their winning streak to three, having copped Best 
Picture the year before that for <i>American Beauty</i>. And DreamWorks can 
boast three consecutive script wins, as <i>A Beautiful Mind </i>follows <i>
Almost Famous </i>and <i>American Beauty</i>.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">New Line Cinema’s <i>
The Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring </i>also won four awards, less 
than a third of its 13 nominations. As expected, they were for technical 
achievement: Andrew Lesnie’s cinematography, Howard Shore’s original score, the 
makeup of Peter Owen and Richard Taylor, and the visual effects of Randall 
William Cook, Jim Rygiel, Mark Stetson and Taylor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">In a neat bit of 
historical synergy, the Twentieth Century Fox production <i>Moulin Rouge’s </i>
two Oscars, for costume design (Catherine Martin, Angus Strathie) and art 
direction/set decoration (Martin/Brigitte Broch), matched exactly the two awards 
won by John Huston’s 1952 production of -- Moulin Rouge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">And the USA Films 
production <i>Gosford Park </i>picked up the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay 
(Julian Fellowes -- his first produced script). That’s the second win in a row 
for USA Films, following <i>Traffic</i>; the studio is only three years old.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Though not nominated 
for Best Picture, the Sony/Revolution Studios co-production <i>Black Hawk Down
</i>won technical awards for editing and sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">While it was arch-rival 
DreamWorks that took the inaugural Best Animated Film Oscar for <i>Shrek</i>, 
Disney won the Best Original Song prize (Randy Newman’s “If I Didn’t Have You” 
from <i>Monsters, Inc.</i> -- his first win after 16 nominations).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">In all, it was a 
refreshingly diverse roster of winners, as of all five of the Best Picture 
nominees, only Miramax’s <i>In the Bedroom </i>went home empty-handed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">But the real story was 
that wholly unexpected gravity and dignity of an event usually marked by 
throwback production numbers and questionable taste. Event producer Laura Ziskin 
commissioned filmmakers Errol Morris, Penelope Spheeris, Nora Ephron and others 
to make filmcentric appreciation pieces on various subjects, and each of them 
were standalone gems. Woody Allen’s very first Oscar appearance ever (to 
introduce Ephron’s ode to New York City) had critics speculating that he should 
be Oscar’s new host, and in light of the recent events there it seemed almost 
prescient to give special Oscars to socially conscious personalities Sidney 
Poitier and Robert Redford (the former was notably more subdued than usual as he 
thanked a who’s-who of prominent Hollywood liberals of the 1950s and 1960s, 
while the latter came the closest of anyone throughout the evening to rambling, 
although he was remarkably candid in assessing both Hollywood’s mood at the 
moment and his own currently faltering acting career).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">But it was the acting 
categories that drew the most attention. Most serious Oscar handicappers have 
the “heart” list and the “head” list, films and stars they think/hope will win 
and predictions of what academy voters will probably do. This year those voters, 
who usually reflect a pack mentality, seemed to decide as one to give the acting 
Oscars to performances they liked, rather than stars they felt prompted to 
reward. Thus, Connelly’s much-praised turn as mathematician John Nash’s 
long-suffering wife in <i>A Beautiful Mind </i>took the Best Supporting Actress 
Oscar, while British vet Jim Broadbent was the surprise Best Supporting Actor 
winner for his turn as Iris Murdoch’s long-suffering husband in <i>Iris </i>
(voters were also perhaps applauding him for his other-end-of-the-spectrum vamp 
in <i>Moulin Rouge</i>).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">What really put the 74<sup>th</sup> 
Oscars into the history books, however, were the winners for Best Actress and 
Best Actor. Halle Berry became the first black woman to win an Academy Award for 
a leading performance, her fearless turn in the little-seen <i>Monster’s Ball</i>. 
Her raw emotions during the acceptance speech were both historical and 
memorable, as she proclaimed “every woman of color … now has a chance because 
this door tonight has now been opened.” Sissy Spacek had campaigned hard for <i>
In the Bedroom</i>, and had been generally considered a lock for the Oscar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">And while few would 
promote it as a career highlight to date, the stylish police thriller <i>
Training Day </i>earned Denzel Washington his first Best Actor Oscar and second 
award overall (he becomes only the 11<sup>th</sup> actor to win in both the lead 
and supporting categories, having won in 1989 for <i>Glory</i>). Perhaps voters 
responded to the bravura nature of Washington’s turn as a brazenly corrupt cop 
(history dictates this predilection); more likely, those capable of thinking 
ahead couldn’t resist the idea of having Washington and Sidney Poitier 
brandishing their Academy Awards at each other from across the Kodak Theater (Poitier 
won in 1963 for <i>Lilies of the Field</i>). Reflecting that he’d been following 
in Poitier’s footsteps, Washington proclaimed “there’s nothing I’d rather do, 
sir.” It was perhaps the most dignified moment in a ceremony sprinkled with 
class and respect.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">This new maturity even 
seeped into the Best Foreign Film category, as Danis Tanovic’s gritty war film
<i>No Man’s Land</i> from Bosnia &amp; Herzegovina bested the overwhelming favorite, 
France’s <i>Amelie</i>, thus not only refuting the latter’s perceived 
superficiality (and slapping domestic distributor Miramax) but reminding future 
Oscar scholars that after all the societal traumas of 2001, voters responded to 
a more serious theme.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Lest these Oscars go 
down in history as precise in their kudos, shortly after the awards critic Joe 
Leydon (Variety, The San Francisco Examiner) sent an email pointing out that by 
winning a single Oscar, for sound editing, <i>Pearl Harbor </i>won one more 
Academy Award than <i>Memento</i>, <i>Mulholland Drive</i>, <i>The Man Who 
Wasn’t There</i>, <i>The Royal Tenenbaums</i>, <i>Sexy Beast</i>, <i>Ghost World</i>,
<i>Amelie </i>and <i>In the Bedroom</i> -- put together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">The ceremony itself was 
held in the brand new Kodak Theater on Hollywood Boulevard, just next to the 
landmark Chinese Theater and cattycorner to the Hotel Roosevelt, where the very 
first Oscars were presented in 1929. Even the apparently cavernous new space 
seemed dignified, as it injected much-needed life into a venerated strip of road 
that could certainly use the attention.</span></p>
