            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The remake of <i>Rollerball </i>arrives
            like a beat-up old jalopy that has just seen its last stock car
            rally. It has been stripped down to ninety-eight minutes,
            sacrificing everything but action (or, rather, movement), and it has
            the look of something that's been given-up-on during the process and
            junked. I was wondering if there was any good reason or need to do a
            remake of the 1975 film, and, after having seen the remake, I'm
            still wondering.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The 1975 film was a neo-art object
            made in muted grays and browns and set in a near-future where
            corporations have taken the place of governments and the masses are
            kept in check through the violent spectacle of
            &quot;rollerball&quot;, an arena event where international teams
            face-off against each other in a sport which combines aspects of
            roller derby, hockey, and football, with some motorbikes thrown in.
            When a U.S. team player, Jonathan (played by a husky, subdued James
            Caan), begins to take on heroic proportions in the public mind, the
            corporate leaders decide to take him down a few pegs---lest
            &quot;he&quot; become more important than &quot;the game&quot;. The
            film made some posturing towards statements about the individual and
            society, but don't be fooled:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>everyone
            went to go see it for the violence, which, with its bone-crunching
            and limb-rending, was pretty extreme for the time.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The new film dumps almost all of
            the story from the earlier film and sets its action in the present
            day. One moment, young Jonathan (Chris Klein) is doing some extreme
            skateboarding down the steepest hills of San Francisco; the next
            (or, &quot;four months later&quot;, the film says), he's the object
            of wild adulation in Kazakhstan, where he plays on a multi-national
            rollerball team before screaming masses of fans. (And announcers
            call him &quot;the next Wayne Gretzky&quot;). The team owner (Jean
            Reno, mugging and overacting shamelessly) notices that the
            instantaneous &quot;global rating&quot; readout for the satellite
            feed goes up after he prearranges for gruesome accidents to befall
            on his own team players, so he sneakily arranges for more of them.
            But who's watching this thing? Well, along with Kazakhstan, it's
            supposed to be really big in Mongolia and the Middle East (!?!?).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When Jonathan and his teammate pal
            Ridley (LL Cool J) decide to make a break for it (during a long
            sequence which is, annoyingly, filmed in green &quot;night
            vision&quot; format), the team owners (or someone) decide that they
            must be killed, doubtless so that they can't get to the nearest
            payphone and tip off Greta Van Sustren, who would certainly be very,
            very concerned over learning that people are racing around on roller
            skates and motorbikes in arenas in Mongolia while wearing outlandish
            costumes which look like they were inspired by the <i>Mighty Morphin
            Power Rangers</i> and Skeletor in <i>Masters of the Universe</i>.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The action loses credibility almost
            by the minute. The violence (and there's a lot of it, minutely
            trimmed to get a &quot;PG-13&quot; rating) is too casual and
            off-hand to become really riled about. But the film is still
            pointless, irresponsible, and steeped in decadence, from the women
            who sashay around in bustiers and waist-high vinyl boots, to the
            conclusion, where the filmmakers, desperate for anything that'll get
            a rise out of the audience, have the rollerball players, after
            viciously attacking each other, climb out of the rink and start
            attacking everyone. Or, rather (as one character puts it), &quot;the
            monsters who created them&quot;, which would probably include the
            people who made this movie. The filmmakers don't seem to care
            whether or not the film makes any sense or has any integrity,
            although Chris Klein looks capable of projecting a certain amount of
            fortitude and moral fiber, while Rebecca Romijn-Stamos gives weight
            to her role as a fellow teamplayer, a tough, dark-eyed beauty who
            has taken to wearing full-head helmets after receiving a brutal scar
            on her face. But the rollerball game itself is never entirely
            explained to the audience, and the action is filmed so that you
            can't follow what's going on between the players. The film just
            races 'round and 'round trying to con you, until after a while you
            just turn it off in your head.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"></o:p>
