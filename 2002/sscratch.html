            review by <a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 13 September 2002</i></font><p>
            <font face="Verdana" size="5">What works together</font></p>
            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Scratch</i> starts with an 
            origin story. Grand Wizard Theodore (the &quot;Thomas Edison of the 
            movement&quot;) recalls the day, way back in 1975, when his grandmother 
            told him to turn down the music he was making in front of his Bronx 
            River Houses apartment. In order to hear her, he put his hand on the 
            turntable, holding the record in place. As he moved his hand, 
            slightly, a new sound rose up. And so, he smiles, scratching was 
            born.&nbsp; </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The story of scratching involves 
            many such moments -- accidents, discoveries, instants of creative 
            inspiration. Then again, it's not just one story. Part collective 
            history, part social documentary, part personal reflection, and part 
            political rumination, Doug Pray's film tells multiple stories, 
            intersecting, reverberating, leading in and out of one another. Less 
            weary and ironic in tone than Pray's <i>Hype!</i> (which looked at 
            grunge and its commodification fallout), <i>Scratch</i> treats its 
            subject and subjects with due respect, as well as good humor and 
            appreciation. In part, this celebratory mood is a function of the 
            movement's politics and acute self-understanding. Despite the 
            increasing appearance of &quot;decorative&quot; DJs in occasional pop acts 
            (who might remain nameless but they know who they are), for the most 
            part, DJs have held onto their culture, and continue to expand and 
            complicate their art. Thus far, in other words, there's no mall 
            muzak or Ralph Lauren flannel shirts associated with turntabling.&nbsp;
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still, <i>Scratch</i> has lots of 
            work to do, for even though the movement is young, it has undergone 
            enormous, frequent, ongoing transformations. Beyond this, hiphop 
            notoriously involves multiple facets. Theodore testifies, &quot;When you 
            say hiphop, you say graffiti, you say break-dancing, you say DJs, 
            you say MCs, the way you dress, the way you talk. All the elements 
            into one, that's hiphop.&quot; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Scratching, like each of these 
            elements, draws from all the others. And, as this vibrant film makes 
            abundantly clear, by definition, scratching does not stand still. As 
            much-respected Steve Dee puts it, &quot;Hiphop is asking you a question, 
            and that question is, what are you going to do?&quot; And you need to 
            come up with an answer, day after day. Discussing the ways that 
            battling shapes his much-adored art and profession, Steve Dee 
            confesses, &quot;I'm competitive. If it's drawing a straight line, I 
            wanna draw the straightest line.&quot; Believe it: this guy draws 
            seriously insane straight lines. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This concept of competition, 
            wanting to be &quot;the best,&quot; does not keep turntablists apart (&quot;It 
            ain't like real beef&quot;). Rather, they make a point of working 
            together, sharing ideas and encouraging one another. They go on 
            &quot;digging&quot; jaunts (DJ Shadow leads the handheld camera through a 
            basement so stuffed with records that he can barely walk through -- 
            he calls it &quot;my little nirvana,&quot; then warns the crew: &quot;Careful, I 
            once found a mummified bat under one of the records&quot;), perform 
            together: several of <i>Scratch'</i>s most exciting scenes involve 
            artists playing with one another -- Mix Master Mike (perhaps most 
            famous for his work with the Beastie Boys, and also a member of 
            Invisibl Skratch Piklz) and the popular Filipino DJ Qbert (also of 
            Invisibl Skratch Piklz); or Shadow and Cut Chemist working with 
            Steinski (a.k.a. David Stein), or Jurassic 5 on stage with Cut 
            Chemist and Numark (who says of working with these pioneering MCs, 
            &quot;It's fun, but it's always a challenge&quot;). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Such collaborative brilliance is 
            integral to the movement over time, as <i>Scratch</i> lays out. The 
            film traces history, including interviews with Afrika Bambaata 
            (founder of Universal Zulu Nation in the South Bronx, in 1973), Mix 
            Master Mike, Rob Swift, Jazzy J, DJ Premier (now of Gang Starr, with 
            Guru), all discussing their &quot;first exposures&quot; (Kool Herc was &quot;like 
            God&quot;), their efforts to advance the culture, and their dedication to 
            it. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film also reveals the artists' 
            diverse approaches. Mix Master Mike jokingly extols his supremacy as 
            a DJ with the Beasties: &quot;I start scratching some roosters for no 
            reason. They have no choice. I'm the maestro and whatever I throw 
            in, they have to rhyme over it.&quot; Self-described &quot;soul searcher&quot; DJ 
            Qbert explains his process like this: &quot;It's kind of like talking, 
            you know, you just speak what you're saying. Each technique is a 
            word, so the larger your vocabulary, the more articulate you speak.&quot;
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Qbert articulates a lot in the film 
            (and is responsible for the cleverly scratched interviews and 
            introductions, say, of the X-ecutioners). And his knowledge is deep. 
            &quot;Since earth is kind of like a primitive planet,&quot; he thinks out 
            loud, &quot;What about the more advanced civilizations? What would their 
            music be like? I guess that's how I come up with my ideas.&quot; I guess. 
            Scratching does seem here to be alien, in part because it's so very 
            smart and strange. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That strangeness -- inspired and 
            exhilarating as it is -- may have something to do with the rise of 
            the MC, whose language is obviously more accessible to the average 
            listener. Several speakers rue the escalation of the MCs' role in 
            popular culture: Dot A Rock of Fantastic Freaks asserts of the early 
            days, &quot;The DJ was the backbone and we were the arms and legs and 
            everything else to make him colorful.&quot; Bam adds, &quot;The DJS are the 
            ones that put the MCs out there, but then the MCs became the power; 
            a lot of the MCs got away from the cultural part and got into 'all 
            about the benjamins,' and they left the DJs behind.&quot; The film 
            doesn't fret too much about this turn of events, however, instead 
            focusing on the ways that DJs maintain their own sense of the 
            culture, by sharing their sensibilities and politics. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Indeed, the film's organization 
            appears to follow the lead of its highly self-aware interviewees, 
            meaning, it feels &quot;organic&quot; and intelligent, rather than imposed, 
            owing to the many hours that Pray and Blondheim spent conjuring this 
            effect in the editing room, even though, as Pray admits, 
            &quot;Documentary editing is basically all lies, you push the envelope to 
            make the thing work.&quot; Pray's refreshing attitude on the commentary 
            track explains much about how the film's form came about. At first, 
            he says, he wanted to do a &quot;section&quot; on &quot;Rockit,&quot; Herbie Hancock's 
            life-changing single that turned so many of today's artists on to 
            their callings (Mix Master Mike affectionately remembers the &quot;zigga 
            zigga zigga&quot; of that most memorable scratch riff). And then, as Pray 
            tells it, he had his own moment, realizing that &quot;Rockit&quot; is not just 
            a section, but also provides an overarching structure, such that the 
            image and sounds of Hancock's 1984 Grammy Awards performance with 
            Grand Mixer DXT repeats throughout the film, little reminders that 
            history is important and also, that it keeps changing.&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Remarkably, <i>Scratch</i> is that 
            very rare documentary that can make sense for viewers who know 
            nothing and those who have their own sense of the movement's 
            history. It gives props to the originators, notes films that came 
            before (including Charlie Ahearn's 1982 <i>Wild Style</i>, which 
            shows, &quot;how it was done&quot;). In a pop culture world, where the latest 
            greatest thing can be over within months (Christina who?), such 
            veneration of the past is not only unusual, but it's also 
            instructive. Anyone who still thinks &quot;kids&quot; don't study enough, or 
            don't appreciate what's come before, need only take a brief look at 
            scratching culture to get a whole other perspective. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To that end, Palm Pictures' 
            excellent DVD is like dense-pack of information, offering the film 
            and first-rate extras, on two discs. The first delivers the film 
            proper, with chapters divided according to the film's own segments 
            (The Scratch, Elements, Wild Style, Rockit, Jamming, Turntablism, 
            Battling, DJs with MCs, Digging, Making Beats, Thud Rumble, Full 
            Circle), as well as perceptive and entertaining commentary by Pray 
            and producer Brad Blondheim. &quot;It's weird with documentaries,&quot; 
            observes Pray, early on, &quot;that at the end, they all seem like they 
            make sense, but in the beginning, their scenes are all over the 
            place.&quot; This one makes a lot of sense, in various ways -- you can 
            use it differently, according to what you want. The second disc 
            contains instruction by DJ Z-Trip (&quot;How to Rock a Party&quot;) and DJ 
            Qbert, a scratch notation demo, and selections from the documentary
            <i>Battle Sounds</i>, directed by John Carluccio (the very fellow 
            who came up with a scratch notation system). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Even as it pays earnest homage to 
            turntablists and beat jugglers, old schoolers and current 
            innovators, <i>Scratch</i> is great fun, full of the kind of energy 
            it's documenting. The film represents as well the sense of community 
            that continues to power the movement, and makes it available to 
            everyone, in persuasive digest form. The film doesn't include 
            everyone, and it doesn't pretend to tell the whole story; it tells 
            many stories and makes many links. As Pray says on the commentary 
            track, &quot;We've taken some shit about not having some great DJs in the 
            film, but the whole thing is that what we try to do while we're 
            editing, is try to have regard for what works together.&quot; </font></td>
