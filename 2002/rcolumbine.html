            review by <a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>, 18 October 2002</i></font><p>
            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Of the thirty-nine films I caught 
            during the recently completed San Sebastian Film Festival (twenty as 
            member of the New Directors Jury), the two that impressed me most 
            contained some of the most violent imagery, Paul Greengrass' <i>
            Bloody Sunday</i>, a starkly draining day-in-the-damned-life 
            recreation of the Derry, Northern Ireland massacre of thirteen 
            unarmed civilians by British soldiers thirty years ago. And Michael 
            Moore's just as biased <i>Bowling for Columbine</i>, which had 
            already captured a special fifty-fifth Anniversary Prize as Cannes. 
            I happened to catch this confrontumentary at a presentation where it 
            was competing for the Pearl of the Audience Award, carrying a 30,000 
            Euro cash prize in aid towards a film's promotion. <i>Columbine</i>, 
            which already had four unreelings early in the festival, was the 
            second to last film of eighteen eligible entries screening in its 
            field, a 9:30 PM presentation to a sold-out audience on September 
            27th, the day before San Sebastian closed its fifty-fifth annual 
            outing. Among the other films that had been in strong contention:
            <span style="color:black">Aki Kaurismäki's <i>Mies Vailla 
            Menneisyyttä/The Man Without a Past</i> (with a 3.373 out of a 
            perfect 4 score); <i>Balzac et la Petite Tailleuse Chinoise</i> 
            (3.430), <i>Bloody Sunday</i> (3.556), <i>Cidade de Deus</i> 
            (3.569), and Roman Polanski's <i>The Pianist</i> (3.538). At the end 
            of the <i>Columbine</i> screening, in which I was undoubtedly one of 
            the few Americans in the audience, I turned to fellow juror Alberto 
            Elena and predicted victory. There was that much electricity in the 
            room. Or was it the European hatred for the USA's love affair with 
            guns that I was feeling?</span></font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color:black">Of course 
            the film won with a 3.693 score. Personally I've given it a perfect 
            four stars.</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Watching the film again at its 
            first afternoon screening on the day it opened on three screens in 
            the Washington, DC area—a region under siege by a rifle-toting 
            terrorist for the last two weeks—I wondered if the nutcase who has 
            killed nine and wounded two innocent victims throughout the 
            metropolitan area might be seated in the sparse audience looking for 
            guidance, or salvation, from Michael Moore's latest (and greatest) 
            muckraking effort. The gunman thankfully wasn't waiting in the 
            parking lot outside the suburban Northern Virginia multiplex. 
            Because of the assassin's trigger-happy grip, outdoor events 
            throughout the vicinity have been cancelled, and residents are under 
            a heightened state of anxiety, enough to keep them away from movie 
            theaters - including the few playing this profoundly unsettling 
            two-hour examination of the terrifying number of Americans shot to 
            death every year and the epidemic of fear spreading throughout our 
            nation. It's hard not to think about the real-life terror going on 
            here in the Nation's Capital when you're at or even contemplating 
            going to a movie, let alone <i>Bowling for Columbine</i>. So, is the 
            coincidence of the murderer amongst us and the arrival of this 
            must-see movie considered a good or bad publicity tie-in. Are there 
            P.R. flacks out there actually confirming the adage that even bad 
            publicity is good? It's a disconcerting state of life imitating art 
            imitating life.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The situation is absurdly comic if 
            you start to consider the over-the-top media frenzy examining every 
            piece of leaked, false, or generally circumspect evidence that is 
            being dug up, packaged, and tossed out on us during the evening and 
            &quot;special&quot; newscasts about the killer in our midst. It's a subject 
            that Moore analyzes closely during his provocative piece. He wryly 
            observes the disheartening connection between several similar 
            stories (starting with the death of six-year-old Kayla Rolland by a 
            classmate in Flint, Michigan, Moore's home town) and within that 
            microcosm showcases how often-prissy and appearance-minded news 
            reporters frenzy on murder without examining the underlying social 
            factors. As for Flint and its environs, the city again bears the 
            brunt of a community shamed and abandoned, a condition exacerbated 
            by the factory pullout by General Motors that was the subject of <i>
            Roger &amp; Me</i>, Moore's award-winning 1989 landmark commentary and 
            highest-grossing narrative documentary of all time.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Moore crams a lot of disturbing 
            information, satirical analysis, dead-pan sarcasm, and 
            confrontational journalism in the 119 minutes he has our attention. 
            In the aftermath of the 1999 shootings at Columbine High School, the 
            director set out to examine why this or other high-profile acts of 
            violence (including the Oklahoma City bombing) are such an American 
            &quot;tradition&quot; and inadvertently have such close links to his own 
            neighborhood. The BIG facts alone—which he uses to defrock Charlton 
            Heston, a.k.a. Moses, in a final, surprise interview that reveals 
            the miscomprehension and frailty of the aging NRA celebrity 
            spokesman—are horrifying. In the civilized world (and outside of 
            warfare), the following countries count their annual deaths&nbsp; by 
            gunfire: Germany (381), France (255), Canada (165), the United 
            Kingdom (68), Australia (65), and Japan (39).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">United States (11,127).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Moore (and his viewers) wonder if 
            this highly immoral number is due to the oversupply of weapons or 
            some basic ethnic breakdown in the good ole U.S. of A. Our neighbor 
            to the north, Canada, has 30 million people, 7 million guns (a ratio 
            similar to that in this country), yet has less than 1.5% of the 
            total of our gun-induced killings. And many Canadians don't keep 
            their doors locked, a fact that befuddles Moore and sends him 
            scurrying about one neighborhood apologetically proving the 
            statement.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As for Littleton, Colorado, home of 
            the Columbine tragedy, Moore shows us the grainy security-camera 
            footage as Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold bring down some of the 
            twelve students, a teacher, and ultimately themselves that day in 
            April 1999. Moore's attempt to connect the area's largest employer 
            and the world's biggest weapons manufacturer, Lockheed Martin, with 
            the violent condition is less than satisfactory, although its sadly 
            coincidental that the day of the Columbine killings was also the 
            largest single-day barrage of American-financed bombs raining down 
            on Kosovo.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That last factoid is brought up a 
            second time in an interview Moore conducts with singer Marilyn 
            Manson, a keenly aware individual who believes himself wrongly 
            accused by many politicians as inspiration for the deadly events in 
            Columbine. Wherein Moore wonders if it wasn't the game of bowling 
            that Harris and Klebold played in the early morning hours of the 
            last day of their lives that could just as easily been the cause.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">One of Moore's early amusing 
            moments showcasing the easy availability of guns, occurs when he 
            strolls into the North County Bank &amp; Trust, opens a new account, and 
            takes home a free gift—a brand-new bolt-action rifle. After which 
            Moore, turning to the camera, rhetorically asks &quot;You think it's a 
            little dangerous handing out guns at a bank?&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The whole undertaking is very much 
            an archivist's product reel filled with slices of visual kitsch and 
            counter-pointed commentary, inter-cut with a couple of droll South 
            Park animations (courtesy of co-creator Matt Stone, who grew up in 
            Littleton, a mountain town that was &quot;painfully, painfully, painfully 
            normal&quot;) and Moore's semi-insurrectionary episodes. Only one is 
            ultimately (unexpectedly and wondrously) successful, in which Moore, 
            accompanying two Columbine survivors with seventeen-cent K-Mart 
            bullets embedded in their bodies, pigeonholes that retailer's 
            executives into removing all ammunition from the shelves of their 
            stores. Yet, of all the targets that come under Moore's crosshairs, 
            the biggest is the National Rifle Association (of which Moore is a 
            life member), with the sacrilegious image of Charlton &quot;From my cold, 
            dead hands!&quot; Heston unconscionably visiting Denver and Flint just 
            days after national attention has focused on tragedies in their 
            communities.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Finally, you'll be speculating 
            whether this whole shebang is guilty of being in poor taste. If 
            you're Heston or someone who honestly and shamefully believes it's 
            your American right to have a gun or two or ten in every house (and 
            Moore has shown us that there are municipalities that have passed 
            laws requiring them!), <i>Bowling for Columbine</i> will leave you 
            with a distinctly sour taste. Tough noogies. For the rest of us, 
            this disquieting, comic brand of guerrilla filmmaking is two hours 
            of subjective preaching that should be required viewing.</font></td>
