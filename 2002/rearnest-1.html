            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Undoubtedly there are literary
            purists who will belittle the new cinematic treatment (last filmed a
            half-century ago and finally due for home video release shortly)
            given Oscar Wilde's 1895 hit comedy play, but the wit of the
            well-known double-Jekyll-and-Hyde original is joyously embraced in
            Oliver Parker's refreshing update, a fitting follow-up to his <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">An
            Ideal Husband</i>. The embarrassing problems that castrated Wilde's
            successful nineteenth-century London opening—on Valentine's
            Day—whereby the author was preposterously convicted of 'gross
            indecency' and imprisoned for two years, shouldn't befall the
            current version's conspirators. It's a charming romp with an
            engaging cast more than dutifully directed with a touch of whimsical
            urgency, wonderfully supplemented by an entertainingly anxious score
            by composer Charlie Mole, Parker's musical alter-ego, and a lovely
            landscape designed by award-winning Luciana Arrighi (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Howard's
            End</i>) and captured by Oscar-nominated (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Room
            with a View</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Howard's End</i>)
            director of photography Tony Pierce-Roberts. The story is
            wonderfully appealing. It's dialogue is delightfully snappy. It's
            got four grand actors (actually more with the sublime supporting
            cast) that all brighten the screen, which translates into four stars
            of fun. Yes, a perfect ten.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There's a consummate glee in
            watching a broad smile break out on the audience's collective face
            as we are introduced to bachelors Algy Moncreef (Rupert Everett) and
            Jack Worthing (Colin Firth) conning their way with through London
            society and discovering the fun of dashing out from luxuriously
            expensive dinners at the Savoy without paying the check. That grin
            broadens considerably as the various identities, scams, rogues, and
            humorous intrigues are further revealed and intertwined in Wilde's
            deviously comedic flirtation.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jack, a reserved estate owner with
            a questionable social ancestry (more on that later), has invented a
            reprobate brother that allows for him to escape to the bustling city
            from his dull country life , spent mostly sheltering his
            well-educated eighteen-year-old niece Cecily Cardew (Reese
            Witherspoon). In London Jack becomes his irascible, imaginary
            younger sibling Ernest &quot;to amuse himself,&quot; skipping out on
            bills and having a grand time with Algy, a barely solvent yet
            utterly appealing ne'er-do-well. He's also availed himself of a
            pretend friend, the ailing invalid Bunbury (who gets a fitting
            end-credit send off), whose curiously bad health allows for Algy to
            blamefully escape numerous, more worrisome, engagements. One such
            dinner he conveniently removes himself from is with the redoubtable
            Lady Bracknell (Judi Dench, scoring exceedingly well in a smallish,
            grand inquisitress role, wickedly close to her memorable <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Shakespeare
            in Love </i>character), a.k.a. his aunt Augusta, whose beguiling,
            determined daughter Gwendolen Fairfax (Frances O'Connor) is
            romantically attached to Jack's alter-ego Ernest.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Algy uses Jack's secret to his
            benefit, invading Jack's palatial estate from the skies (via hot air
            balloon) masquerading as the now-remorseful brother Ernest. Which
            makes for an amusing episode when Jack simultaneously greets his
            servants at the front door with what are purportedly the ashen
            remains of his dearly-departed irresolute sibling, having suffered a
            horribly sudden death in Paris &quot;from a chill.&quot; One of the
            attendees is the semi-prudish, ditsy Miss Prism (Anna Massey),
            Cecily's live-in teacher, herself encumbered with a few
            show-stopping secrets. She deadpans that the deceased Worthing
            undoubtedly had learned his lesson, suggesting to the gathered crowd
            that &quot;I hope he will profit from it!&quot; She and the
            tongue-tied local rector, Dr. Chasuble (Tom Wilkinson), stutter
            through their own amorous missteps in a match made in sidebar,
            lunatic heaven. Of course, Algy/Ernest is smitten by the beauty of
            Cecily (who likewise fancifully envisions him as her knight in
            shining armor), while Jack/Ernest has to deal with locating a
            parent—he was abandoned in a cloak room at Victoria Station
            (Brighton line) as an infant—that would prove him to be of
            suitable lineage to wed the sexually sophisticated Gwendolen. The
            male suitors hit a romantic roadblock when each of their
            brides-to-be have an inexplicable unwavering attraction to men with
            a particular eponymous name. The would-be grooms are thus hard
            pressed to shed their aliases, fearful their intendeds will flee the
            altar when the seemingly minor deceit is revealed.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The entire cast is marvelous,
            bubbling with perfect energy and totally in sync with Wilde's spirit
            and Parker's slightly revisionist adaptation. Yes even Reese
            Witherspoon dons a passable British accent and lovable social
            snootiness. And don't overlook veteran thespian Edward Fox, who adds
            a short but subtly comic turn as Jack's manservant Lane. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Importance of Being Ernest</i> is a dishonorably delicious tale of
            lover's labors nearly lost. I can't remember having so much fun
            watching such scoundrels at play in the fields of society and love.
            This most deviously wonderful feast awaits you. Enjoy the meal. And
            by all means, come back for seconds, and more.</font></p>
