<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b>Charles
Stone III sits at a long table in one of those fancy hotel &quot;meeting
rooms.&quot; He smiles immediately. &quot;The kitchen is right there,&quot; he
nods to the right. &quot;So there's some noise.&quot; He's attentive to these
kinds of details, really, all kinds of details. Once best known as the guy whose
1999 short film, <i>True</i> led to the ubiquitous &quot;Whassuup&quot; ad
campaign and a lucrative contract with Budweiser, Philadelphia native Stone
comes to filmmaking with a range of experience and a lifetime love of movies. A
1988 graduate of Rhode Island School of Design, with a Fine Arts Degree in
animation, he's also directed music videos for Living Colour, Vernon Reid, PM
Dawn, and the Roots (&quot;Distortion to the Static,&quot; &quot;Concerto of the
Desperado,&quot; the groundbreaking &quot;You Got Me,&quot; and the superb
&quot;The Next Movement&quot;). His first feature film, <i>Paid in Full</i>,
starred Wood Harris as a drug dealer in '80s Harlem, and treated this well-worn
genre with unusual sensitivity and ingenuity. <o:p>
</o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
36-year-old director's new film, <i>Drumline</i>, follows Devon (Nick Cannon), a
dazzlingly talented drummer who learns, over the course of his first year with
Atlanta A&amp;T's marching band, to channel his individual gifts toward the good
of his team. The film is winning kudos from all corners for its undeniable
energy and charm, as well as fine performances by, among others, Orlando Jones
as Dr. Lee, Devon's band coach, and Leonard Roberts as his teammate and rival,
Sean. It's easy to see where all this comes from: Stone is obviously happy to be
talking movies, drums, and details. <o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b><i>Cynthia
Fuchs: </i></b>What brought you to <i>Drumline</i>?<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b><i>Charles
Stone III: </i></b>I never thought, &quot;I wanna make a movie about
drummers,&quot; to be honest. And when it was first presented to me, the
protagonist went to a school out in the Midwest, and it didn't have the kind of
impact I wanted. But when he was at a black college down South, with the
traditional show style drumming, that caught my eye. And then also, witnessing
it in person moved me. They have this really intense sense of athleticism,
choreography, and rhythms -- it's all so dynamic. It rang like a sports movie,
because the characters are like superheroes to me, like warriors, athletes,
gymnasts, and musicians, all wrapped up into one. I wanted to get that kind of
power on screen, that discipline, that allegiance to the teamwork. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">There
are a lot of scenes in it that are stereotypical of sports movies, but for me
that was important to have that, because it's <i>not</i> a football or
basketball team, so those generic moments twist what you expect. As long as the
spirit was true, I wasn't worried about clichéd shots. And I think the story of
an underdog appeals to everyone, despite the cultural specificity.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b><i>CF:
</i></b>And it emphasizes drumming per se, not just the more obviously
spectacular stick twirling, dancing, and other athletic moves. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b><i>CS:
</i></b>In anything I do, as much as I love eye candy and effects -- I grew up
on those movies -- they can't be the driving force. It was important that the
characters had some weight to them and that the musicianship was a means to show
that. We talked to musical directors from various schools, and they had concerns
about that too. The bands have an incredibly deep repertoire of music,
everything from classical to classic rhythm and blues to contemporary R&amp;B
and hiphop. And one major dramatic license we took was to split the styles of
the two bands. So, we had one band that was sensational and playing contemporary
music, and the other that was conservative and all about musicianship and
technique. But all the bands I've witnessed that do this show style, do it all.
They're like what gospel music is to traditional choir music. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b><i>CF:
</i></b>Like <i>Paid in Full</i>, this film works within a genre, but stretches
it too. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b><i>CS.
</i></b>Dig it. I think that inclination is a reflection of who I am and what
I've been exposed to, growing up -- from Warner Brothers cartoons from the '40s
or <i>Star Wars</i>, or opera, or taking pottery class when I was eight years
old, and fencing, there are so many different things, even a range of types of
music in the household where I grew up. I also had strategies. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">For
<i>Paid in Full</i>, number one, I wanted to get started in the film business,
and I didn't have any screenplays of my own or stories I wanted to get
developed. And there were certain things about <i>Paid in Full</i> that appealed
to me, for instance, that it was based on a true story. And secondly, it was
about how young men deal with power. These three guys search for it, each in a
different way. I thought, okay, this is a movie about three young black men
selling drugs in Harlem in the early '80s, directed by a music video director. I
thought, this is a perfect cliché package, and would give me a chance to really
flip it. Originally, I had ideas that were even more surreal, and the producer
[Damon Dash] and I butted heads a lot. You see some of that in the film, but I
think what's coming out in my work, in a natural way, is a respect for the human
spirit. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">In
<i>Drumline</i>, it's also about looking for power, for Devon, who sees himself
as a great solo drummer as opposed to a team player. There are so many things in
the film that appeal to me, drawn from other sources. There's combat imagery,
like when the bands are battling and Dr. Lee is watching through the binoculars.
I designed that so it looked like two battleships in the ocean, with the
commander calling in orders: &quot;Send in a lob of missiles in off the port
bow.&quot; And then in the end battle, it was like Kung Foo meets the
Transformers. The sister with the cymbals! And then it's like the dozens, being
able to berate somebody without coming to blows, without crossing that line. So
much was in my head. I'm a <i>Star Trek</i> fan too, so, for the five-yard
space, between the two bands, I told them that was the Neutral Zone. And if they
passed into the Neutral Zone, they had to be prepared that the Klingons would
come at you.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">And
the guys who were designing the cadences, we were in a rush to get them
completed before shooting that final scene. And the guy from Morris Brown
College came to me like three days before that scene, he said he had come up
with new ones. And wanted to see it, because all those cadences are like four to
six minutes, elaborate stories in their own way. I had to get it down to a
minute, maybe a minute and twenty-five seconds, but he presented this idea where
he wanted one team to use the other team's snare line. I was like, &quot;That's
so perfect, the perfect test for Devon.&quot; And things just fell into place. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b><i>CF:
</i></b>How has working on music videos affected your sensibility, or prepared
you for making films? <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b><i>CS:
</i></b>Number one: comfort in working with the medium of film, with the
structure of a large crew, designating responsibilities, communicating with an
assistant director. That's not to say that making a video prepares you fully for
forty-five days of shooting a movie, but it helps. The other thing is, you
become sensitive to storytelling. Learning the language of filmmaking,
understanding how shots tell the story, that's important. And the editing in
music video making helped me, in the sense that, for me there's a rhythm to
everything, a pace and a tempo. So, cutting dialogue can be like cutting a
video. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">For
instance, in <i>Paid in Full</i>, I didn't do it a lot, since we didn't have any
time for rehearsal, and I couldn't work with the actors to develop the lyrical
dialogue that I wanted. We got some of it in the first scene, where the three of
them are talking, eating Chinese food, and throwing that paper in the trashcan.
That happened in a spontaneous fashion, and we did a lot of pushing a pulling to
achieve a poeticism in the way they speak with one another. The slang is so
incredible, and it's so much fun. My short film, <i>True</i>, is all about that
-- the air time, the pacing. I wanted so desperately to bring that to <i>Paid in
Full</i>, and it does happen periodically. It happens according to the
characters, too, like Rico, played by Cam'ron. He's so nervous and bizarre and
repeats his lines, &quot;Whatever you need, let me <i>know</i>.&quot; I enjoyed
how he was next to someone like Mitch, Mekhi Phifer's character, or even Ace
[Wood Harris], even more introverted and kind of motionless. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">But
I didn't get to make it dance the way I wanted to, throughout. When you do a
feature film, it's so much bigger. Doing a music video is like putting together
a puzzle. Doing a film is like putting together Rubik's Cubes, every time you
move something it affects every other angle. It's hard maintaining focus for
such a long period of time, while Murphy's Law is always throwing something in
your lap. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">And
you work with actors who have their own personalities and opinions and they're
putting on their uniforms and trying to get comfortable with themselves and each
other, and reacting to their characters, and I have to react to that. I try not
to micromanage actors, at least not at this point, since I didn't write the
characters. It's such an organic process, chemical reactions and spiritual
things going. For these first two films, I've kind of sit and watch people get
used to the long-johns and get right, and then I go with it and push and pull to
help them along. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b><i>CF:
</i></b>It sounds like you talk a lot with actors, then.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b><i>CS:
</i></b>Yeah, I used to do theater, when I was at Rhode Island School of Design.
I majored in animation, but I also did a lot of stage work next door at Brown
University. And I did standup comedy. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b><i>CF:
</i></b>Is there something you haven't done? <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b><i>CS:
</i></b>[laughs] Yeah, I know. There is, actually, I don't have a bartending
license, and I want to do that. I just recently learned how to drive a
motorcycle but I don't own one. And I never played lacrosse. Yet. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">But
I have sensitivity to actors putting themselves out there. And you sort of can't
help but have that when you work with them -- like most everyone else, they're
incredibly opinionated and insecure. They want you to tell them what to do and
they want to do their thing. It's a fascinating process. Every experience is
different. Like when I worked with Chi McBride on <i>Paid in Full</i>, he's
really a stand-up, classy person. And he would make suggestions, and ask to try
things this way. Others would go through the script and say, &quot;I'm not gonna
do that. I won't say that.&quot; It's all good, but everyone has their own way
of working. Nick Cannon and Orlando Jones were great on <i>Drumline</i>.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b><i>CF:
</i></b>Jones might surprise people in this film, if they don't remember him
from <i>Liberty Heights</i>. He's so smart. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b><i>CS:
</i></b>Yeah, he's a really smart cat. The big thing with his character was to
play it down, so ordinary. And he was excited to play a teacher, since his
father is a teacher and coaches college ball. And we worked on keeping it
simple. One example I always bring up is that scene when he says, &quot;What are
you, Beavis and Black-head?&quot; Originally, he did it with a smile, and I
said, &quot;Be serious when you drop the joke.&quot; People are waiting for
Orlando Jones to make a joke. And it's funny, at every screening I've been to --
and that's a lot -- everyone laughs when Orlando first comes on screen. And then
they realize he's not going to do what he usually does, and people are walking
out going, &quot;Gee, he's really <i>good</i>.&quot; It's a shame that he's been
stuck in these extreme comedy roles. I'm so happy for him that people are seeing
him differently.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b><i>CF:
</i></b>His role as the teacher who learns something makes me think of the
complicated way the generations are delineated in <i>Drumline</i>. Usually, the
split in &quot;teen&quot; or &quot;college&quot; movies is so broad and
ridiculous. The music works so brilliantly here. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b><i>CS:
</i></b>There's a generation gap between Dr. Lee and Devon, and it's such a
classic argument [affecting crotchety voice]: &quot;When I was your age the
music was so much better than the shit you're listening to now.&quot; And I used
to joke about that, but now I think, the r&amp;b music today sucks! <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b><i>CF:
</i></b>[laughs] I noticed the R. Kelly dis at the beginning of the film. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b><i>CS:
</i></b>[laughs] Yeah! I had to slide a jab in there for real. I wanted to use
that song, &quot;You Remind Me of My Jeep,&quot; but it wasn't as popular as
&quot;I Believe I Can Fly.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Here,
Devon reflects a different new school, with hiphop and a new art of
improvisation and sampling. We had scenes between Dr. Lee and Devon where they
go at it about sampling and hiphop versus rhythm &amp; blues of the past. We did
a lot of digging into that to come to where we are now, which is minimal in
suggesting that debate between past and present. One way we did that was, as I
said before, was to divide the bands, new school and conservative. But for Dr.
Lee and Devon to come together is like bringing those sounds together as one
band. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">And
the reading music and not being able to read and write music is another
dimension to that. I've had people come out of the screening and say, &quot;I
thought that was so cool that he could only play by ear.&quot; There are a
million great musicians who don't read. One of my favorite drummers, Dennis
Chambers does not know how to read or write music, and he's a <i>bad</i>
drummer. I love that there's no judgment: one is not only right, the other is
not only right. I believe in learning how to read and write music, and expanding
on that. I got that in art in high school, from an amazing teacher. Before I met
him, I was in to drawing everything from comic books. In his class, we went
through everything from the Renaissance to Abstract Expressionism to Futurism
and Dada, Pop, the whole thing. This was in the 9th grade. I got so open to it,
that it's stuck with me. I tell kids, Don't flip the birdie at history so quick,
whether it's correct or incorrect. Learn it, and then move on, because you can
get something from it. Take what you need from it. You can expand your talent. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">I
asked some of the teachers we talked with if there are kids who can hide that
they don't read. And they said, yeah, there are kids who can listen to you play
an entire complex cadence -- once -- and know it instantly. It's such a neat
thing. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b><i>CF:
</i></b>The scene where Devon is watching that one cadence and the film
literally slows down to show he absorbs it...<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b><i>CS:
</i></b>Yeah, just like that. It's his process on screen. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b><i>CF:
</i></b>The other scene I liked for that, sort of in reverse, is when the
note-reading machine transcribes the notes Devon's playing, spits it out on
paper, and that encourages him to want to read. The technology invites him to go
back, to appreciate a skill he's dismissed before. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b><i>CS:
</i></b>Cool. I wanted to shoot additional scenes that explained how that
machine works. These machines are attached to the head of the drum and when you
hit it, they record what you play and then turn it into written music. I wanted
that show where you hear this intense drumming and see the notes being written
out. I was worried that someone like Sean using the computer would look like the
short cut. But because Sean is already established as someone who can read and
write, and play, he's serious. But you're right, ironically, that scene brings
them together, and invites Devon back into playing for the team. That's cool,
the intellectual side. <o:p>
</o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b><i>CF:
</i></b>That's your job now, as the director. <o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b><i>CS:
</i></b>Yes, to pretend! It's like when that thing when the guys drum on the
other guys' skins. That was a wonderful accident. I think that it's part of
being a director, to be able to see things happen. You have to let spontaneity
and chaos live with you, and be able to pick and choose. </span></font></p>
