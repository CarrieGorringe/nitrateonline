            review by <a href="../kj.html" target="_top">KJ Doughton</a>, 21 June 2002</i></font><p>
            <font face="Verdana" size="5">28th Seattle International Film 
            Festival</font><p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The first 
            presence we observe in the opening frames of <i>The Two Towns of 
            Jasper</i> is a rural sheriff sporting a cowboy hat, a white, 
            long-sleeved shirt, dapper, freshly pressed slacks, and a garish red 
            tie. No mistake about it. We’re in Texas. He’s driving us towards a 
            desolate road, overgrown with grass and well off the beaten trail. 
            &quot;This is where they took him,&quot; the law enforcer explains. 
            &quot;Initially, there was talk of investigating a hit and run.&quot; As we 
            continue to weave down backwoods country streets, the crime scene 
            descriptions become more vivid, until we’re hit with the shock of 
            exactly how heinous an act is being discussed. </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">On June 7, 1998, a middle-aged 
            African American named James Byrd was picked up by a trio of white 
            trash hoodlums, chained to the back of their pickup, and dragged 
            down three miles of gravel while his elbows were ground into nubs 
            and a trail of blood and skin tissue painted their route. 
            Eventually, Byrd’s head and right arm were caught on the edge of a 
            concrete pipe, and the agony-riddled man was decapitated.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Such barbarism seemed a throwback 
            to something pulled from a medieval torture manual. How could it 
            happen? And how did the mixed-race town of Jasper, Texas pick up the 
            pieces and move on following such a volatile event? <i>The Two Towns 
            of Jasper </i>was filmed by two directors, one black and one white, 
            to document the fallout from the perspectives of both African 
            American and European American sides of the local community. This 
            approach proved a stroke of genius. With Jasper boasting a 45% black 
            population, a black mayor, and a nearly even community profile 
            between the races, documentary filmmakers Whitney Dow and Marco 
            Williams discover how such a tragic event can polarize an area into 
            sub-groups, even as it brings people together to heal as a holistic 
            whole. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We peek into a community gathering 
            of white townsfolk, where the focus of conversation is on Byrd’s 
            moral character. &quot;I think he should be judged by the way he lived,&quot; 
            asserts one man as he digs into some grub at a packed dinner table, 
            &quot;not by the way he died. He shouldn’t be made a martyr. He’s not a 
            good Christian, and he’s not a role model for our children.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Another dinner guest confesses that 
            he was brought up not to mingle with the black community, stating, 
            &quot;I was told to say hi to ‘em, then bye to ‘em, then stay away from ‘em.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A few blocks down the road, a 
            cluster of African American women with hair in curlers discuss the 
            crime at a beauty shop. &quot;Jasper has a lot of skeletons in its 
            closets,&quot; one claims. &quot;This is not an isolated incident.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>The Two Towns of Jasper</i> 
            probes these contrasting views, opinions, and attitudes concerning 
            the impending trials of Bill King, Lawrence Brewer, and Shawn Berry, 
            three tattooed hayseeds who allegedly polished off a night of 
            drinking beer and looking for women by brutalizing and ultimately 
            murdering Byrd. A County Defense Attorney assigned to the case 
            describes their predatory behavior as that of &quot;a packs of dogs on 
            the heels of a deer.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film does an amazing job of 
            pushing the dirt of Jasper deep beneath our fingertips. We watch a 
            mixed race church, where a black gospel choir belts out emotional 
            hymns and the white congregation tries stiffly, in vain, to sway 
            along with such movement-prompting rhythms. Later, we watch as a 
            cemetery fence is taken down that once separated the town’s African 
            American burials from those of Jasper’s whites. Community youth 
            groups pass out yellow ribbons in remembrance of Byrd. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As the trial dates materialize, 
            Jasper buzzes with the sounds of overhead helicopters and vanloads 
            of Black Panthers who insist that their presence has resulted from 
            the requests of area families, even as such would-be invitees deny 
            this. The callousness of news reporters covering the scene is 
            revealed when an anchorwoman, wielding an intrusive microphone like 
            a cattle prod, shoves herself in front of Byrd’s sister and asks, 
            &quot;How did it feel to know he was still alive (while being dragged)?&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We also sympathize with the father 
            of one defendant, who looks like a haggard old garage mechanic 
            sucking up air from an oxygen tank. As this patron thumbs through 
            old photo albums of his now-infamous son, we realize that even a 
            participant in an act this reprehensible was once a sweet-faced 
            child, loved and raised by elders who don’t necessarily share the 
            warped perspective on humanity that their boy has since adopted. 
            When the father waits outside the town courtyard and hears a 
            &quot;Guilty&quot; verdict being announced later in the film, he props his 
            failing body against a car to gasp from his respirator. It’s 
            heartbreaking. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After two trials conclude, things 
            reach a crescendo during the prolonged final case of Shawn Berry, 
            the most familiar of the three and a &quot;hometown boy&quot; with plentiful 
            friends in the community. We see such acquaintances rationalize his 
            involvement. &quot;Being at the wrong place at the wrong time,&quot; suggests 
            one of Berry’s advocates, &quot;is not the same as committing a crime.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Another white Jasper resident 
            admits, &quot;When you know somebody, you want to cut him some slack.&quot; 
            Byrd’s family has a slightly different perspective, with one member 
            declaring, &quot;If you want mercy, show yourself to be merciful.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Comic relief is supplied by a 
            longtime racist living in a trailer with his pregnant wife and 
            children. When the proud redneck reunites with one of the film’s 
            directors after several weeks have passed, he’s asked if anything 
            noteworthy has happened. &quot;I got married,&quot; the okie proclaims, like a
            <i>Heavy Metal Parking Lot</i> refugee hammered on Pabst Blue Ribbon 
            and reeking of bongwater. &quot;Er, was it last week? This week? What am 
            I thinkin’?&quot; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ultimately, however, <i>The Two 
            Towns of Jasper</i> is no laughing matter. Even as the final guilty 
            verdict rings through the town’s crowded courtroom, and people file 
            out to attend celebratory backyard barbecues and dance parties, the 
            spirit of James Byrd hovers over the town, reminding us of how the 
            past is destined to repeat itself, should we choose to forget it.
