            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">As The Girl in Barbershop, 
            Philadelphia's own E-V-E shows one more time that she plays very 
            nicely with boys. In her first extended film role (that is, more 
            than the few lines she had in <i>XXX</i>), Eve Jihan Jeffers holds 
            her own on screen with some notably charismatic actors, including 
            Ice Cube and Cedric the Entertainer. This isn't to say that she 
            hasn't endeavored to expand her performance horizons previously -- 
            back in April, she and Salma Hayek joined other celebrities to read 
            from <i>The Vagina Monologues</i> at the Apollo. As she told 
            Newsweek (2 September 02), she takes her acting career seriously, in 
            particular appreciating the &quot;art&quot; displayed by Billy Bob Thornton in 
            Sling Blade, in which he's &quot;able to play that character throughout a 
            whole movie.&quot; </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Her enthusiasm is admirable. And 
            it's not like she doesn't have other things to do. As a matter of 
            fact, <i>Barbershop</i> is opening just over a week after she 
            dropped her third album, Eve-Olution, for which she's been doing the 
            usual rounds -- TRL, 106th &amp; Park, Leno, the cover of Complex and 
            Essence, where she's looking trés fashionable with P. Diddy -- and 
            charming everyone. Anyone who's been paying attention already knows 
            that Ruff Ryders' First Lady has had a plan for the future in place 
            for some time -- she wants to produce, invest, and give back. Toward 
            those ends, she's working with the best, winning an MTV Video Music 
            Award last year for the wonderful &quot;Let Me Blow Ya Mind,&quot; produced by 
            kingmaker Dre and enlisting the crossover magic of Gwen Stefani, and 
            hit-dueting again with this year's (slightly less wonderful) &quot;Gangsta 
            Love,&quot; with Alicia Keys. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While Eve may never be the J. Lo of 
            hiphop -- and why would anyone want to be so overexposed? -- she 
            most definitely has what they call &quot;presence,&quot; charging up the 
            screen whenever she comes in view. For the most part in <i>
            Barbershop</i>, this involves her being in said shop, where her 
            character, Terri, cuts heads and braids a few too. The film -- which 
            recalls the affable attitude and pacing of Ice Cube's Friday films 
            (the third due in theaters this November) -- takes place over the 
            course of a single day, which means that, while not a lot actually 
            happens, there's still a large crew of characters and a fair amount 
            of plot (some of it strained) to be laid out in a short time. </font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The movie's basic concept is clear 
            in the title: the shop is a traditional communal space, where folks 
            hang out, argue, tell stories, play checkers, and sharing plain talk 
            about a range of topics. Director Tim Story (who has previously made 
            music videos with R. Kelly, India.arie, and Tyrese) and Cube have a 
            vision of sorts (as much as it's schematized by writers Mark Brown, 
            Don D. Scott, and Marshall Todd), and that vision begins and ends 
            with community: like it is, was, and will be. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The primary tension of the day 
            begins when Calvin (Cube), who inherited the place from his father, 
            who inherited it from his father, sells it to a local (here, 
            Chicago's South Side) gangster named Lester (the always superb Keith 
            David). Though Calvin's pregnant wife Jennifer (Jasmine Lewis) 
            suggests that this may not be the best time to start up a new 
            business, he wants to build a studio so he can produce music. But of 
            course, she's right -- almost as soon as he has the cash in his 
            hand, Calvin's rethinking his decision, and spends the rest of the 
            day trying to figure a way out of the deal, which Lester has 
            naturally arranged wholly to Calvin's detriment anyway. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Calvin's not the only one whose day 
            isn't going so well. Terri's begins when she learns that her 
            trifling boyfriend Kevin (Jason George) is hiding a girl under his 
            bed: she arrives at work in a fury, topped off when she finds that 
            one of her coworkers drank her apple juice. Though she's clearly the 
            object of much brotherly affection among the guys, and for Nigerian 
            immigrant Dinka (Leonard Earl Howze), of a deeply felt crush, no one 
            wants to fess up, but a theme becomes apparent -- it's about 
            respect, for property, but more importantly, for people, as they 
            live in contexts, have expectations and desires, and express 
            themselves. The most trivial act can be loaded with meaning and 
            consequence -- what you do affects those around you. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is, of course, a useful, if 
            sobering lesson. Thank goodness, the film doesn't deliver it in a 
            particularly sobering fashion. This light touch stems from its 
            characters, most painted in brief, deft strokes. Eddie (Cedric the 
            Entertainer), for example, used to work for Calvin's dad, and now he 
            spends his days regaling coworkers and customers alike with stories 
            of the old days (when he demonstrates his shaving technique, 
            complete with pearl-handled razor, everyone pays attention) and his 
            rowdy, contentious opinions (&quot;All Rosa Parks did was sit her ass 
            down!&quot; or again, &quot;Martin Luther King was a ho!&quot;).&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While those who find themselves 
            caught up in Eddie's challenge-conversations might be mistaken for 
            &quot;types&quot; at first glance, Barbershop allows them a little room to 
            push against what you might expect. So, college boy Jimmy (Sean 
            Patrick Thomas) presumes that he's only cutting hair for tuition 
            money, urging his fellows to think beyond the shop walls, but he 
            comes off sounding like he's riding some high horse, and the others 
            resent it. Isaac (Troy Garity, son of Jane Fonda and Tom Hayden), 
            who is Jewish, becomes a particular target for Jimmy, underlined 
            during the scene where Isaac arrives to work, in his SUV: his black 
            girlfriend slides her tongue down his throat, his hand grabs her 
            ass, and Jimmy's face goes screwy, like he's just eaten a lemon. 
            While Jimmy catches flack for acting too straight, he criticizes 
            Isaac for dressing, talking, and acting too street. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The one barber who has street cred 
            (in the form of two strikes on his arrest record) is Ricky (Michael 
            Ealy), whom Calvin has hired in an effort to help him turn things 
            around. When, at film's beginning, the convenience store across the 
            street is robbed, the local cop (Tom Wright) immediately suspects 
            Ricky, and come by the shop to warn him they have tape of the 
            getaway vehicle, and will be calling on him when they can read the 
            license plate. Ricky protests, rightfully, and the film reveals 
            right off that he's not guilty, that the culprits are JD (Anthony 
            Anderson) and Billy (Lahmard Tate). They think they've scored big -- 
            they took the store's brand new ATM -- but of course, they'll learn 
            that crime doesn't pay. Unfortunately, while Anderson is sharp as 
            ever, the occasional cuts to this subplot (how will they get the 
            machine open?) slows everything else down, distracting from the more 
            compelling community at Calvin's. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">By the end of the day, everyone -- 
            including reluctant Calvin -- comes to appreciate both the bickering 
            and the love at the shop, and the film does a decent job displaying 
            the entertaining and supportive atmosphere. This is, in most every 
            sense, a family film, not so raunchy or puerile as, say, the latest 
            Austin Powers venture. And, unlike Carwash, for example, it's not 
            about getting over and it's certainly careful about its language 
            (early on, Calvin tells Terri to &quot;stop cussin',&quot; because this is a 
            family business, where kids and ladies get their hair cut). And 
            unlike the Fridays, it does take its family appeal seriously; even 
            Cedric tones down for PG-13 consumption. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film's multiple charms are all 
            sweet. From its opening tune, Fabolous and P. Diddy's &quot;Trade It All 
            (Part 2),&quot; which gets radio-attuned viewers in the groove 
            straightaway, to its series-of-little-vignettes structure, 
            Barbershop aims to please rather than challenge or confront. The 
            baseline problem -- will Calvin recover his shop? -- never threatens 
            to be too hard to resolve. However simple it gets, it insists on 
            being respectful: The Girl gets on with the boys, they figure out 
            how to get on with each other, and Ice Cube demonstrates yet again 
            that there's nothing he can't do well.</font></td>
