            leaving for the press screening of <i>The Mothman Prophecies</i> I
            gleaned that a copy of <i>Entertainment Weekly</i> had come in the
            office mail. It contained a review of the film and while I would
            normally avoid reading anyone else's palaver, my eye zoomed in on
            the name &quot;Nic Roeg&quot; and the title, <i>Don't Look Now</i>
            wrapped in the text. This 1973 thriller, set in a leaking, musty and
            crumbling off-season Venice, full of rats, asymmetrical dark alleys
            and a serial killer, and based upon a novella by Daphne DuMaurier,
            is one of my all-time seminal movies. So I was piqued by a statement
            that professed <i>The Mothman Prophecies</i> was reminiscent of
            Roeg's ahead-of-its-time film.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Alas,
            outside of some very obviously borrowed ideas - the foreshadowing
            sound of church bells, breath streaming in the chill, pigeons
            spiraling upward en masse and the notion that guilt - colored red in
            both films - and compounded by unresolved psychic power which should
            abort tragedy, but ultimately causes it - the comparison is only
            thinly convincing.<o:p>

            not to say I didn't like the first ominous two-thirds of <i>The
            Mothman Prophecies</i>, a zinger of an entertainment that strives to
            weld art house austerity with non-cerebral starts and jolts and
            which is stylishly directed by Mark Pellington (<i>Apt Pupil</i>).
            It's full of fast cuts and sweeping shots and makes terrific use of
            the camera as eye of its primary character - a Washington Post
            reporter named John Klein (Richard Gere, less squinty than usual) -
            whose grief over his adored wife's (well-played by Debra Messing in
            a handful of scenes) death manifests itself in strange occurrences
            and visions of a &quot;Mothman.&quot;<o:p>

            is based upon true events says the disclaimer at the start of the
            film. Indeed, in 1966, four people were parked at a lovers lane near
            Point Pleasant, West Virginia when all four saw two huge red eyes
            staring at them. This marked its first appearance, an eight-foot
            tall entity with large wings who hovered then flew off. It was a
            debut that culminated in a year or so of sightings by a hundred-plus
            different townfolk and which ended in a catastrophic event that may
            or may not have been connected with the emanation.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Pellington
            works from John Keel's investigative book, adapted by Richard Hatem
            and the result, while too far-reaching to maintain its first-half
            tension and set-up, is frequently, if nervously, enjoyable. Gere's
            John Klein is devastated when his beloved, Mary, glimpses
            &quot;something&quot; while they drive through a snowy Washington DC
            street, causing her to crash their car and landing her in the
            hospital. There she's diagnosed with a brain tumor. After she dies,
            John finds her notebook, full of sketches of a hulking, hooded
            creature.<o:p>

            years later he's on assignment, driving late at night to Virginia to
            interview an up-and-coming Democratic Presidential hopeful. His car
            stalls and when he knocks on the first available door at 2:30 in the
            morning he's received with a shotgun in the face and the claim that
            he has been there before.<o:p>

            local sheriff, Sgt. Connie Parker (Laura Linney) arrives, finds
            Klein to be clean and accompanies him to a local motel where he
            learns he is nowhere near Virginia but in Point Pleasant, a comfy
            town nestled on the Ohio River near the West Virginia border. So,
            how could he have driven 400 miles in an hour and a half?<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It
            takes great leaps of faith to follow the logic of &quot;The Mothman
            Prophecies&quot; and upon after-viewing reflection, there are chasms
            and gaps that defy reason and yet Pellington keeps the rope twisted
            so tightly for the first two-thirds that we're too tired to dare the
            dollops of disbelief that lie in front of us.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's
            only in the final third, when we can't help but question what we've
            seen and wonder how this visually thrilling director will conclude
            his paranoid entertainment that the glaring holes seem bottomless
            and evident. Questions are left unanswered and characters hang and
            twist in the chilly breeze. There is little come-uppance to many of
            the plot points and the movie actually contains more than the grain
            of truth that allows a modicum of respectabilty gleaned from tags
            like &quot;based on true events,&quot; we'll never know.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            ellipticalness gets the best of the film in the end, and in that,
            too, it's miles apart from Roeg's Venetian-based love and horror
            story. There's a full-circle, last moment purge that occurs in
            &quot;Don't Look Now&quot; which gives Donald Sutherland's John
            Baxter a slap for negating the second sight powers he has been
            blessed with but ignores, and in ultimately opening his eyes and
            becoming privy to his short-sightedness, suffers the ultimate. Roeg
            goes the book a step further with a final redemptive shot, a
            self-fulfilled prophecy of a last glimpse vision John had of his
            wife Laura, draped in mourning, gliding past on the Grand Canal.<o:p>
            </o:p>

            barely rewards its characters with any such enlightenment. The
            script finally doesn't sustain itself and even Pellington's moody
            visual style can't salvage the anticlimax. Gere and Linney, keeping
            artfully modulated profiles, are stranded in Hollywood bad-ending
            purgatory. It's a shame for Pellington, who, up till then has made a
            ripping thriller. Too bad he couldn't prophetically have conjured a
            different ending from the volumes of information that the Mothman's
            mythology affords.</span></font></span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"></o:p>
