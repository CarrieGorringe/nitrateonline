            <p style="text-indent:0in"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Oliver
            Parker opens up the action of Oscar Wilde’s 1895 sendup of class
            and custom well beyond the stage’s confines of the gentleman’s
            drawing room. He shows us London’s rowdy music halls, sinful
            smoking clubs and elegant restaurants where Jack Worthing (Colin
            Firth) carouses with his friend, Algernon Moncrieff (Rupert
            Everett). We glimpse his dual life as his brother Ernest when in
            town, while maintaining his respectability as Jack in the country.
            Under the gilt dressing and ornate plaster of her mansion, Gwendolen
            (Frances O’Connor) confesses she loves him only as Ernest, and
            Algernon, also pretending to be Ernest, courts young Cecily (Reese
            Witherspoon) amid the manicured gardens of Jack’s country estate.
            These are the bits of visual elegance to match Wilde’s droll wit
            we’ve been waiting for.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p style="text-indent:0in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The effect
            is less liberating than one might expect. Perhaps because, in his
            eagerness, Parker embellishes too much. Wilde never wrote Gwendolen
            receiving a tattoo on her butt-cheek (most indiscreet!) or a fantasy
            knight on horseback tearing up the garden beds. Did <i>Earnest</i>
            really need tarting up?</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Rupert Everett gives the
            rapscallion Algy the same laconic dash he employed in <i>An Ideal
            Husband,</i> Parker’s earlier (and more successful) transfer of an
            Oscar Wilde play to film. Everett’s long, handsome face grants him
            a sense of aristocratic indolence, making his Algernon a viper who
            is too lazy to strike. As Jack/Ernest, Colin Firth is dependable and
            dull, never seeming capable of any deep mischief. Casting <i>Legally
            Blonde</i>’s Reese Witherspoon was a clever stroke; her Cecily’s
            scheming might be dangerous if she knew anything about the world.
            O’Connor doesn’t seem to have made up her own mind about
            Gwendolen, whose intelligence never seems to have found anything
            worthwhile to be applied to.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Judi Dench looks at home as Lady
            Bracknell, Gwendolen’s imperious mother whose exacting social
            standards are Jack’s chief obstacle to matrimony. Like
            Shakespeare’s nurse in <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, Sheridan’s Mrs.
            Malaprop or Margaret Dumont’s indignant dame in the Marx Brothers
            comedies, Lady Bracknell is the matriarch that speaks ridiculously
            for respectable society. Dench perches in her armchair, dressed up
            like a bottle of bath oils, and makes pronouncements on fashion ("chins
            are worn very high at present") and the unacceptability of Jack’s
            uncertain parentage, found as he was in Victoria station’s baggage
            check. It seems like the part Dench has been waiting her life to
            play.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p style="text-indent:0in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Tom
            Wilkinson (of <i>In the Bedroom</i>) does a nice turn as the timid
            Doctor Chasuble, Wilde’s swipe at the ineptness of the church.
            Anna Massey, too, as Cecily’s tutor and Chasuble’s love
            interest, helps Wilde to mock the rules of social grace with her
            wide-eyed declarations of propriety.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p style="text-indent:0in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The play, a
            popular chestnut for college and community theater as well as
            Wilde’s biggest commercial success, is preposterous folderol, its
            romp of identity deception little more than a home for parched <i>bon
            mots</i>. While clever, it has always been dramatically weak. Jack
            and Algernon are bloodless wags who speak of love with all the
            passion of accountants comparing sums. Wilde’s view of man was
            dim, but he saw women not at all; Gwendolen and Cecily are vain,
            silly creatures who speak in absolutes but maintain few convictions.
            Yet a fan of the theater can’t help but maintain affection for its
            sense of fun.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p style="text-indent:0in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Repartee
            shouldn’t have to compete with scenery, as Anthony Asquith’s
            1952 more stage-like version proved. Algernon does not, as Parker
            has him, make a balloon-riding entrance like Phineas Fogg, nor does
            he dress in armor to reflect Cecily’s romantic dreams. But
            Asquith’s actors do speak to each other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p style="text-indent:0in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Oliver
            Parker’s enhancements don’t rescue <i>Earnest</i> from the
            contrivance of its plot. Wilde’s weightless banter struggles
            against the literal-minded, rococo flourishes that Parker has tied
            to its back. His camera seldom stays still, refusing to trust his
            actors to carry the verbal swordplay on their own. Directors of an
            earlier age, like Howard Hawks with <i>His Girl Friday </i>or George
            Cukor with <i>Born Yesterday</i>, understood that material that
            succeeds on the stage needs little dressing up. Parker’s faith in
            us is no better, drawing us pictures of what bounces around his
            characters’ empty heads.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p style="text-indent:0in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">What is
            missing most, even with the better performances, is the sense that
            the actors were in the same room. Their manner remains above the
            fray and they talk past one another. In Jack and Algernon’s small,
            overbred circle, nothing ever seems to be of much consequence. To
            Jack’s accusation, "Algy, you never talk anything but nonsense,"
            the jaded rogue replies, "Nobody ever does." That might just sum up
            this eye-catching but disappointing movie.</font></p>
