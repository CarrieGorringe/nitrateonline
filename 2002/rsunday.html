            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Director-writer Paul Greengrass (<i>The 
            Theory of Flight</i>) made his first film in Derry, Northern 
            Ireland, in 1981. Two decades later he has detonated a bomb that has 
            wiped away more than thirty years of political missteps and military 
            secrecy in <i>Bloody Sunday</i>, an unwavering recreation of the 
            violent blood-stained destruction that caught this town and many of 
            its peaceful inhabitants unaware and unprotected back on January 30, 
            1972. The moral shrapnel and mental shellshock will linger long 
            after this film has ended.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Relentlessly realistic in its 
            in-your-face close-up detail, Greengrass and Ivan Strasburg, his 
            longstanding director of photography, have opted for a color-desaturated 
            look that has drained every ounce of blue that might have been in 
            the Derry sky that day. Every shot uses almost nauseating, hand-held 
            cameras, with not a steady shot in sight. The incessant documentary 
            style most closely resembles that used in <i>Cops</i>, <i>sans</i> 
            music (except for the end-credit rendition by U2 of its mournful ode 
            to the killings), with the equivalent of two or three separate units 
            following the civilian population, primarily Ivan Cooper, a 
            middle-class Protestant and Member of Parliament who was 
            spearheading a massive civil rights march that Sunday, and the 
            stubborn British commander and his military units taking up 
            positions throughout the city. To further orchestrate the concurrent 
            timeline of events, Greengrass and his editor Clare Douglas have 
            extensively cross-cut each storyline within the shared narrative, 
            separately often, but not always, by quick fades to and from black.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">An introductory sequence announces 
            the leadership for the 10,000 locals eager to peacefully congregate 
            and the British Army, having suffering through a series of minor 
            embarrassments at the hands of juvenile hooligans and IRA-sponsored 
            saboteurs. The soldiers, some very green, but most overly anxious, 
            have been called in to quash the event. Greengrass, to more 
            personalize his day-in-a-life approach, next focuses on a 
            post-midnight parting of Gerry Donaghy (Declan Duddy, whose uncle 
            was the first to die on Bloody Sunday), a seventeen-year-old 
            Catholic having just served a six-month sentence for stone throwing, 
            and his cautious, Protestant girl friend, just off from a long night 
            of babysitting. Gerry's story highlights the lad's subdued, almost 
            childlike, anger with the British invasion and, ultimately, his 
            inclination to react rather than act against the well-armed militia. 
            &quot;I'll be fine. It's only a march,&quot; he casually assures his 
            close-knit family. His tragedy embodies that of the Everyman; his 
            demise becomes all the more a battle-cry for the IRA by the planting 
            of false materiel, as least as Greengrass tells us.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Biblically speaking, if Gerry is 
            the very young son, Cooper is the wise one. As portrayed by James 
            Nesbitt (<i>Lucky Break</i>, <i>Waking Ned Devine</i>), it's a 
            performance of a determined, perhaps too idealistic (&quot;One day we 
            could be normal.&quot;) individual trying to organize his friends and the 
            good people of Derry, modeling this peaceful demonstration after 
            those by Martin Luther King. The simple son then becomes Brigadier 
            Patrick MacLellen (Nicholas Farrell), the local commander of the 
            British Army in Londonderry nervously walking the tightrope between 
            his friend, local Chief Superintendent Lagan (Gerald McSorley), and 
            (foolish son) Major General Ford (Tim Pigott-Smith), the unflinching 
            Commander of Land Forces in Northern Ireland, eager to strategically 
            teach the &quot;hooligans&quot; a lesson at the hands of his 3,000 troops. Not 
            only does he force his battle plan on the wary MacLellen, he's got 
            one officer handling public relations to soothe out any 
            &quot;misconceptions&quot; that might arise from the planned action.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The chants of &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; 
            are too quickly doused in the ensuing melee, begun when a portion of 
            the crowd takes a wrong turn and further aggravated when this 
            breakaway group (of which Gerry and his friends are part) confronts 
            the army with chants of &quot;Brits Out&quot; and the hurling of stones and 
            bricks. The hostilities escalate and for the second half of the film 
            you stare aghast as the bullets fly and the blood flows, with the 
            soldiers unleashing their weapons as if shooting at a pond full of 
            ducks. As expected, your reaction is immediate as powerfully 
            manipulated by the filmmaker. The action moves from the gruesome 
            street battlefield, home to the indiscriminate murder of more than a 
            dozen unarmed civilians (one victim is poignantly covered in the 
            white banner, quickly bloodied, heralding the march), to the chaotic 
            Altnagelvin Hospital, where the wounded and dead are greeted by 
            grieving relatives and an emotional drained and exasperated Cooper.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The follow-up, er cover-up, is just 
            as damning. It has continued that way for thirty years now.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The whole project works perhaps too 
            well, with talk in U.K circles of this being a watershed in Irish 
            politics. Not being Irish or British, I can't read any deeper into 
            the film than viewers in the United Kingdom can (and they have). 
            Those of us in America not directly tied to or aware of the 
            political history in that part of the world will merely see <i>
            Bloody Sunday</i> as a strong, fiercely-biased statement about the 
            troubling struggle for peace and the ruthless stupidity, much like a 
            botched game of <i>Risk</i>, that castrated it.</font></td>
