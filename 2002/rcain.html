            is a sensational documentary, exploring Russia’s turbulent history
            as seen through the eyes -- and elaborately tattooed torsos - of the
            transformed country’s murderers, robbers, and substance abusers.
            As they rot in a half-dozen of the ex-Union of Soviet Socialist
            Republic’s eroding penitentiaries, bloated from hunger and
            urinating blood, these forgotten dregs of society channel their
            identities and humanity by injecting ink beneath their weathered
            skins. It’s literally the only means of artistic expression these
            abandoned prisoners have left.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">After
            winning the trust of these outcasts, the movie’s female director
            Alix Lambert persuades them to show off some of the most elaborate
            body art ever seen. Vikings, elaborate Russian buildings, Jesus, and
            winged cherubs are but some of the skin paintings that she is privy
            to. In one prison, the talent in charge of such detailed drawings is
            Aleksandr, convicted of murder and deemed the facility’s tattoo
            expert. It’s a pastime that’s not officially allowed by the
            prison guards who roam the center in black uniforms and flat, oval
            hats. However, judging from the many bodies that boast his work,
            Aleksandr is a busy man, indeed. Demonstrating his handiwork with a
            tattooing needle fabricated from an electric shaver, a guitar
            string, and a ball point pen, the artist states that &quot;this
            machine is my ticket to life here.&quot; Prisoners tell him what
            they want, and he gives them a price. &quot;As long as they
            pay,&quot; confirms Aleksandr, &quot;it makes no difference what
            they want me to do.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Slava,
            in for murder, describes how tattoos can provide clues as to the
            number of years their wearers have been sentenced for. One can also
            learn about an inmate’s rank in the elaborate caste system honored
            in Russian jails. If one’s &quot;tats&quot; indicate that he’s a
            &quot;Thief In Law,&quot; a classification reserved for the top of
            the prison hierarchy, an onlooker can assume that he’s a man of
            importance. &quot;Downcasts&quot; make up the lowest-ranking
            category, sleeping under cots, forced to be sexual receptacles, and
            acting as literal slaves to the rest. &quot;If a
            &quot;downcast&quot; even looks me in the eye,&quot; says one
            remorseless higher-up, &quot;I’ll smash his face.&quot; Sergei,
            imprisoned for murder, assault, and robbery, explains that the
            sailing ships marking his flesh indicate that he has lived &quot;the
            roaming life.&quot; Meanwhile, he explains that a pirate is the mark
            of a robbery, the skull is indicative of murder, and the likeness of
            a hooded executioner is usually associated with a hardened
            &quot;killer.&quot; Crosses identify the highly respected
            &quot;Thief In Law.&quot; <o:p>

            <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Mark of Cain</i>
            continues, we’re transported to a handful of other convict-jammed
            hell holes, including a women’s penitentiary where inhabitants are
            confined for primarily substance abuse-related charges. In addition
            to the glimpses of this system-wide human art gallery, we hear
            firsthand testimonies of degradation and torture that seem… well,
            like something out of a movie. A popular means of punishing a snitch
            -- or extracting information - is dubbed &quot;The Cell Press&quot;,
            in which the marked man must share a room with up to twenty-six
            other inmates. &quot;They beat you excessively,&quot; states a
            seen-it-all con, &quot;and take away your honor, if you know what I
            mean.&quot; Another inmate recalls that during his transfer to the
            penitentiary, he was released into a tunnel, where guards
            &quot;sicked the dogs on me, and pricked me with bayonets.&quot; In
            one detention center, inmates are so crowded and closely confined
            that not all of them can stand at once in the cramped cells. A
            long-time resident of a prison known as The White Swan remembers a
            fellow occupant committing suicide by throwing himself onto a power
            saw during a woodworking session. For some, the option of death is
            more inviting than a life of intimidation, poor health, and despair.<o:p>
            </o:p>

            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Meanwhile,
            the film does not present its subjects in a softer-than-thou light,
            but comes to unflinching terms with why they ended up here. One
            gruff, dark-haired murderer talks of seeing his mother’s grave
            site desecrated, before avenging the act by decapitating the three
            robbers and impaling their heads on the cemetery’s fence posts.
            We’re also provided an insider’s look into an intricate system
            of communication practiced by these incarcerated men. Like eager
            fishermen casting lines from their windows, prisoners attach strings
            to sticks and dangle them into between-cell alleyways. At lower
            levels, their fellow inmates can pull cigarettes, tea, and messages
            from the strings and replace them with similar items, in a kind of
            makeshift bartering system. Meanwhile, Lambert contrasts images of
            men strumming guitar strings and belting out soulful ballads during
            music gatherings, with the harsh, rust and metal landscape of
            fences, barbed wires, antennas, bars, and keys that surround such
            vanquished individuals.<o:p>

            concludes with a telling commentary by a handful of the older, more
            experienced prisoners, who mention that even in this relatively
            lawless subculture, they lament the erosion of tradition. One
            bearded gent shakes his head, stating that with the &quot;older
            generation&quot; of inmate, tattoos were a literal map of one’s
            history, with intimate, personalized images. Vikran, an older
            prisoner who sports a body etched with the likenesses of Lenin and
            Marx, says that back in Communist times, &quot;if you had tattoos of
            Soviet leaders, the guardsmen would not shoot you.&quot; Eagles were
            another popular tattoo during the twenties and thirties. The new,
            post-communist generation of younger residents, however, are content
            to merely choose the latest trendy Chinese motif, or sport a skull
            ‘n crossbones logo simply because it looks tough. As democracy
            takes hold in Russia, so do equally trivial tattoos featuring dollar
            signs and western icons. The tats etched during these different eras
            act as an unlikely metaphor to illustrate how the country’s values
            have changed during Russia’s communist-to-democracy upheaval.<o:p>

            is one of those gut-wrenching, mesmerizing documentaries that makes
            most crime-themed feature films look cartoonish, contrived, and
            insincere by comparison. By means of soot-based ink forced beneath
            the skin, Lambert’s unique vision acts as testimony, that even
            under the most wretched of settings, human expression finds a way to
            bloom. </font></span></font>
