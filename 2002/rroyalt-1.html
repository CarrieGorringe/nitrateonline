            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Families.
            Most people spend their lives recovering from them. And most artists
            spend their lives making art out of them. Case in point: Wes
            Anderson's work to date, <i>Bottle Rocket</i>, <i>Rushmore</i>, and
            now, <i>The Royal Tenenbaums</i>. In each film, he has worked
            through, in increasing detail and with increasing precision, the
            pains and tribulations that make up families. And lucky for him, it
            appears that he's found his own sort of spiritual
            &quot;brother&quot; in Owen Wilson, who has co-written and appeared
            in all three films. Together, they have dissected, deconstructed,
            and re-concocted an assortment of too-familiar familial
            relationships. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Unsurprisingly,
            this assortment tends to focus on boys and fathers, and the most
            compelling characters tend to see women as unreachable objects. <i>The
            Royal Tenenbaums</i> does this again. For all the critical and
            popular attention being paid to Gwyneth Paltrow's performance as the
            Tenenbaums' adopted daughter Margot, this is a tale of boys trying
            not to be men. As such, it's clever and precise, self-conscious
            enough not to be wholly obnoxious, but treading a borderline from
            which obnoxiousness is always visible. That's the jokey calculation:
            the Tenenbaums are on the edge of being tedious, too rich, too New
            York (though the city is never specified, it's New Yorkish), too
            affected, too self-absorbed to know that they are any of those
            things. But the movie knows all, and puts you in the position of
            knowing all as well. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's
            possible to read <i>The Royal Tenenbaums</i> -- so strategic and so
            smart -- as a smug film. Indeed, it is nothing if not
            self-conscious. Everything about this movie is strategic, from its
            selective release schedule (from pre-Xmas limited to early new-year
            wide) to its stylish frame compositions and snarkily nostalgic
            soundtrack (including the Beatles, Paul Simon, and Nico). But it's
            not just strategic; it's also elegant and adroit, conjuring
            card-boardish, coolly smart-ass characters from whom you might
            maintain your distance and reserve investment, it also imbues them
            with vaguely familiar imperfections, so that you are inclined to
            identify, or at least sympathize, with them. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            distance that is also intimate is initially intriguing, in a glib
            and immediate way. (It's not so fresh as the first time you saw it,
            in <i>Bottle Rocket</i>, but you can see the resemblance, and for
            that you're willing to cut <i>Tenenbaums</i> some slack.) To
            initiate the safe-seeming distance, the film is set up like it's a
            book, literally. Pages turn, narrator Alec Baldwin tells the story
            in a slightly arch tone, and the family is laid out neatly, first as
            child versions, then adult versions. The child versions are all
            high-achieving geniuses: brother Richie is a tennis prodigy, brother
            Chas is a real estate whiz, and Margot is a gifted playwright,
            produced by age fourteen. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Then,
            the page turns, and the kids grow up into miserable, early-onset
            has-beens. Chas has grown up to be a churlish Ben Stiller, mourning
            the airline crash death of his wife and raising two boys who look
            like miniature version of him; Richie (Luke Wilson) has quit tennis
            and run off on an ocean liner cruise, to avoid his relatives; and
            Margot (Paltrow) now decorates her eyes with racoonish mascara and
            chain-smokes while soaking in the bathtub, in the apartment she
            shares with her academic husband, Raleigh St. Clair (Bill Murray, so
            inventive in <i>Rushmore</i>, here doing his best with a shell of a
            part). All emotionally immobilized, the once-gifted kids now mourn
            the loss of their radiant pasts and hopes for the future. Though
            Margot and Richie share a longtime, unspoken mutual affection (not
            quite incestuous, since they're not blood relatives), she's also
            been involved on and off with their shared childhood friend, the
            insufferably conceited Eli Cash (Owen Wilson in cowboy hat, fringe
            jacket, and perpetual smirk). <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Reportedly
            inspired by J.D. Salinger's Franny and Zooey stories, Orson Welles' <i>The
            Magnificent Ambersons</i>, and Anderson's fuzzy initial ambition to
            make a Western (hence, perhaps, the cowboy hat), the Tenenbaums'
            dysfunctions are at once idiosyncratic and stereotypical, outlandish
            and recognizable. Cartoonish and flat, sketched in deft snippets of
            dialogue and tidy compositions (Richie lives in a yellow tent in the
            Tenenbaum living room, and when Margot comes to visit him inside,
            their tentative utterings of affection is consecrated by a gentle
            lemony light; Chas and his boys tend to pose as a group, all dressed
            in red Adidas sweat suits), the family interactions have the
            feelings of photo albums. They exist as a series of discrete
            occasions more than as continuous personalities, which is
            appropriate, given the disjointedness of their senses of themselves.

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            grown-ups (or whatever they have become in their thirties), the kids
            don't talk with one another anymore, or spend much time with their
            mother, kindly urban archeologist Etheline (Anjelica Huston. And
            none of them is in touch with disbarred lawyer dad, Royal (Gene
            Hackman). Royal was kicked out by Etheline years ago and has since
            lived in a fancy-schmancy hotel, on credit. At the beginning of the
            film's present action, he decides that he needs to move
            &quot;home,&quot; partly, he tells himself, because he longs for his
            family connections, however many years too late (&quot;Lord knows
            I've had my share of infidelities&quot;), and partly because he's
            run out of money. This doesn't affect his sense of privilege,
            however, and he behaves as he always has -- with arrogance and an
            alarming lack of sensitivity -- but Hackman, an ingenious and
            uncommonly generous performer (whether as Buck Barrow, Popeye Doyle,
            Little Bill Daggett, or even Sigourney Weaver's wild-eyed paramour
            in <i>Heartbreakers</i>), makes Royal more bearable than he might
            have been. <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still,
            Royal is, as his name suggests, used to getting what he wants,
            bluffing his way through any situation. Aided by his loyal servant
            Pagoda (Kumar Pallana), with whom he shares a bizarre history
            involving accidental shooting, Royal sets out to convince his family
            that he is dying (in six weeks) of stomach cancer, in hopes that
            they will take him back. This despite and because of the fact that
            Etheline is currently becoming interested in her longtime
            accountant, Henry Sherman (Danny Glover), who has in turn finally
            worked up the nerve to ask for her hand in marriage (at the very
            moment he does so, he falls into a pit at one of her archeological
            sites -- it's a nifty bit of comic timing and Glover is grand). <o:p>

            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            budding romance is, in fact, the least potent barrier to Royal's
            return -- his kids are angry with him, blaming him for their various
            insecurities and miseries. Not only was he a negligent father, he
            was also dissolute in his dealings wit the kids, stealing stocks
            from Chas (definitely upsetting to the money-minded tyke) and more
            than a little abusive in his emotional dealings with all. Still, his
            return, however selfishly motivated, inspires rethinking, on his
            part as well as others', and it appears that the entire family needs
            a little nudge to realize their best selves. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            course of action is cute, and follows Anderson's previous films in
            granting moral and emotional guidance to the eventually well-meaning
            patriarch, or at least the male child who stitches together his own
            story from the threads left dangling by said patriarch. The
            intricacy and precision of the educational process in <i>The Royal
            Tenenbaums</i> (for characters and viewers) are surely admirable,
            but they leave little room for surprises or upsets. The Tenenbaums
            learn to recover from themselves, and go on. Just like you know they
            will.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><o:p>
