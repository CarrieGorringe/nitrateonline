            <font face="Verdana" size="5">Scary as hell </font></p>
            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kelly Robinson (Eddie Murphy) is 
            the champ. More precisely, he's the current middleweight champion of 
            the world. Clever and cocky, he's attended by a bevy of bald-headed 
            yes-men and booty-babes. During one Vegas bout, he wags his head 
            like Stevie Wonder (&quot;I'm blind! I'm blind!&quot;), encouraging his 
            hapless opponent to step in so he can lay him out with one punch. 
            Afterwards, he marks the triumph by having a stroke tattooed on his 
            mighty bicep: now he has 57 strokes. </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Given his self-absorption and 
            affection for luxury, you might think that being recruited for some 
            super-international secret agent business might change Kelly's life. 
            It doesn't. Instead, when he's paired with sweet-natured spy 
            Alexander Scott (Owen Wilson), Kelly remains as smug and plucky as 
            ever, with maybe a little time out to learn how to use a nifty spy 
            gadget.&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In <i>I Spy</i>, director Betty 
            Thomas' insipid film version of the groundbreaking 1965-68 tv 
            series, Kelly serves a couple of functions. For one, he (along with 
            Wilson) inverts the racial dynamic in the tv series, wherein Robert 
            Culp played Kelly the tennis player and Bill Cosby played Alex the 
            Rhodes scholar/spy. And for another, he more or less reinvents Kit 
            Ramsey, the <i>Bowfinger</i> movie star character whose excessive 
            self-love is often funny, because he inhabits it so completely and 
            articulates it confidently. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Credited to four writers, working 
            as pairs who, it seems, didn't talk with each other (Marianne Sellek 
            Wibberley and Cormac Wibberley, David Ronn &amp; Jay Scherick), the plot 
            is as rudimentary as such tv-to-movie plots tend to be. Alex 
            (nicknamed Surfer Boy by his new partner) is assigned to recover the 
            Switchblade, an incredible new-fangled jet that turns invisible, 
            thus allowing devious delivery of all types of bombs, including 
            nuclear devices. Stolen by Arnold Gundars (Malcolm McDowell, who has 
            precious little screen time), the jet is now in Budapest, available 
            for bidding from the most nefarious and, of course, the wealthiest 
            of evil-doers. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Alex has a couple of uninteresting 
            reasons for wanting to complete the mission: he seeks the career 
            boost that success will bring, and he also seeks to beat out his 
            primary rival at the agency, Carlos (Gary Cole, in dark-skin makeup 
            and ponytail, affecting a corny Latin lover-style accent: it's 
            possible that this performance was hilarious on set; on screen, it's 
            pretty tired). It's hard to read Alex's skill level: he's hindered 
            by the fact that all his Bondian doohickeys are out of date and huge 
            instead of micro (&quot;Size matters!&quot; he whines to the designated 
            gizmo-geek), but he also appears to be more or less adept on the 
            ground (even if he does, in the film's first sequence, fails to keep 
            a suspect he's supposed to keep alive, alive). What is clear is that 
            he's a lonely buddy looking for another buddy: this movie is nothing 
            if not formulaic. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The buddy-ness grinds into gear by 
            way of Kelly's access to Gundars, a boxing fan who has invited the 
            champ to a mucky-mucks' ball in Budapest. Alex tags along, posing as 
            a member of Kelly's entourage. When Kelly's crew is understandably 
            skeptical of the white boy, he assures them that he's been assigned 
            to a big-dealio secret mission, namely, taking care of the 
            President's retarded nephew -- upon which he compliments Alex on 
            achieving an appropriately &quot;mentally challenged look&quot; and the crew 
            starts calling him &quot;Rainman&quot; (as in: when Alex speaks Hungarian to 
            insure their hotel accommodations, one guy observes, &quot;Rainman got 
            skills!&quot;) And he proceeds to demonstrate his lack of savvy 
            repeatedly, as when he insists that he and Kelly arrive at the party 
            at the time on the invite, 8pm. No, no, no, the infinitely more 
            fashionable Kelly announces. &quot;Kelly Robinson be there at 11.&quot; </font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The basic opposition between 
            sheepish Alex and suave Kelly sets up a series of trivial conflicts, 
            some less tedious than others. Worse, the ensuing action is 
            uninspired: unspeedy car chasing, unthrilling plane flying, some 
            minor fisticuffs, not especially well choreographed. The buddies 
            argue, misbehave, and engage in a little homoerotic, joint lusting 
            after beautiful fellow spy Rachel (Famke Janssen), by way of a 
            camera-contact lens that allows Kelly to see what Alex sees, namely, 
            her body in mid-strip, as Alex attempts a seduction. Off in another 
            room, Kelly plays a raunchy Cyrano, ventriloquizing &quot;Sexual Healing&quot; 
            for terminally awkward Surfer Boy. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But this is not just another case 
            where the black sidekick enables white folks to couple. Rather, as 
            the shared perspective/split screen effect suggests, girlfriend is 
            only a diversion: the real romance involves Alex and Kelly, or 
            perhaps more accurately, Wilson and Murphy, the former seeking yet 
            another franchise partnership, following his work with Jackie Chan 
            and Ben Stiller; the latter more likely resisting any partnership 
            that isn't with himself, as in the Klumps movies. While Wilson might 
            still be feeling his way around superstardom (so recently thrust 
            upon him with <i>Behind Enemy Lines</i>), Murphy plainly knows a 
            little something about taking up all the air in a room and the space 
            on a screen. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As predictable as <i>I Spy</i> is, 
            one brief moment spills over into insight into the necessary 
            self-pride and willful blindness of celebrity culture. The most 
            telling demonstration of the spy cam/split screen device comes when 
            Kelly first puts on the lens, then suddenly sees himself from Alex's 
            point of view, while simultaneously seeing Alex from his own point 
            view. Kelly starts throwing punches excitedly, proud to see both 
            himself and Alex ducking away: &quot;That's what they be seeing! That's 
            scary as hell!&quot; Here he's exactly where he wants to be, schizzily 
            perfected -- both subject and object, dazzling superstar and 
            ultimate fan, black and white. No wonder he talks about himself in 
            the third person.&nbsp; </font></td>
