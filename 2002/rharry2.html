            review by <a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 22 November 2002</i></font><p>
            <span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="5">Darker </font>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700">
            <font size="2">It's likely you've heard already that the new Harry 
            Potter movie is &quot;darker&quot; than the first. That, and star Daniel 
            Radcliffe's voice has dropped. Supposedly, both have to do with 
            maturation: as the book series and its readers age (not to mention 
            author J.K. Rowling and assembled filmmakers), they're more able to 
            comprehend and learn from difficult images or distressing themes. As 
            you grow up, stuff happens. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">In fact, <i>
            Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i> is &quot;darker&quot; than <i>
            Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone</i>, slightly. In particular, 
            this concerns its sideways engaging of race prejudice (more on this 
            below). For the most part, however, the movies are very similar, 
            right down to the tediously episodic structure and the assortment of 
            mostly unrelated special-effected set pieces: the hugely elegant 
            mess-hall meals, the cameo appearance by Nearly Headless Nick (John 
            Cleese), the quidditch match (here more like a force-be-with-you 
            chase scene through narrow confines than a bunch of broomsticks 
            flying around in open air), the classrooms where some magic trick 
            goes cutely wrong, the traipse into the shadowy woods, the scary 
            secret at Hogwarts that must be found out. And so on. </font></span>
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The new film, 
            again adapted by Steve Kloves, begins much as the old one did: Harry 
            (Radcliffe) is feeling blue at the home of his nasty aunt and uncle 
            (Fiona Shaw and Richard Griffiths). He endures the requisite bit of 
            oppressive acting out: uncle blustering, aunt sniggering, cousin 
            sniffing. The film's metaphorical darkness makes its first 
            appearance at Harry's home, in the form of an unnervingly well 
            digitized &quot;house elf&quot; named Dobby (voiced by Toby Jones). He comes 
            to warn Harry not to return to Hogwarts, that some terrible fate 
            will befall him there. And don't you know, this makes Harry want 
            more than ever to go back (not to mention that he absolutely hates 
            his hateful aunt and uncle). </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Unfortunately, 
            whenever the elf believes he's made a mistake of any kind, he 
            launches into a little paroxysm of self-abuse, slamming his head 
            against furniture, hitting himself with an appliance (and at these 
            moments he veers nearly into Jar Jar Binks territory -- the &quot;other&quot; 
            as object of unkind humor). This routine is hilarious for young 
            viewers, as slapstickishly violent self-abuse tends to be, perhaps 
            especially when it's enacted by funny little creatures with pointy 
            ears, but it also gets old pretty quickly. Harry is mostly concerned 
            that his uncle will discover the elf and punish Harry; he seems 
            unbothered by the elf's self-punishment <b><i>per se</i></b>. </font>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Neither does he 
            seem terribly troubled by the fact that Dobby is &quot;owned&quot; by an evil 
            wizard family, under a spell to do his master's bidding until he's 
            set free (he's snuck out and risked his life to warn young Harry). 
            Though Harry is at this moment an earnest kid with his own concerns 
            -- mainly, escape from the frightful home where he lives -- it's not 
            hard to guess that he will be instrumental in Dobby's freeing, or 
            that he will become a better boy for it. How fortunate for him that 
            Dobby is so clownish than no one need sympathize with him, much less 
            identify with him. The focus is on the young white wizard learning 
            the lesson, and to that end, Dobby appears and disappears 
            instantaneously, so as not to worry Harry or anyone else for too 
            long about his status as slave. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Just when it's 
            clear that his own life sucks immeasurably, Harry is rescued by 
            fellow wizard-student Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), who drives by in 
            his dad's flying Ford Anglia, accompanied by his redheaded siblings. 
            The situation at Hogwarts is much as it was when they left: the 
            Gryffindor and Slytherin houses remain rivals, Hagrid the Giant 
            (Robbie Coltrane) sleeps off in his own cottage with his dog, and a 
            similar line-up of professors -- Snape (Alan Rickman), McGonagall 
            (Maggie Smith), Sprout (Miriam Margolyes), and Dumbledore (Richard 
            Harris) -- presides over class and cafeteria periods. </font></span>
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">A new prof 
            appears, the self-loving celebrity author and teacher of Defense 
            Against the Dark Arts, Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh, in a 
            boisterous performance). Introduced at a book signing where the 
            girls swoon and the boys make faces, Gilderoy enlists Harry's help 
            in signing his stacks of promotional photos to send to fans: 
            &quot;Celebrity is as celebrity does!&quot; he instructs. (Ironically, 
            perhaps, Gilderoy's scenes are the least self-congratulatory in the 
            movie: Branagh looks like he's actually having fun, and everyone 
            else more or less keeps up.) Harry might take a pointer on the costs 
            of fame, as his peers and insecure adults are increasingly inclined 
            to inflict on him their jealousy and fear. But Gilderoy's foppery is 
            more an object lesson in what not to do, since Harry &quot;naturally&quot; 
            carries himself with poise, humility, and charm. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">As before, the 
            most important lessons in <i>Chamber of Secrets</i> are taught 
            outside of classrooms, in particular, the titular chamber of 
            secrets. And while the film spends far too much time on the tricks 
            -- CGI blue Cornish pixies, giant spiders that aren't so nifty as 
            those in <i>8 Legged Freaks</i>, screaming mandrake roots, and a 
            humungo and not very well realized snake that makes poor Harry look 
            like he's suddenly been transported into <i>Jason and the Argonauts</i> 
            -- it does provide several choice moments for stalwart Hermoine 
            Granger (Emma Watson), as she learns about prejudice. </font></span>
            </p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The main 
            purveyor is the ferrety Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), who brings a 
            particularly Aryan look to his baleful glare and assorted 
            discriminations. It's obvious that Malfoy is egged on by his equally 
            small-minded and pale-maned father (Jason Isaacs) and that their 
            combined spitefulness is a function of long-term, learned 
            insecurity. And so, Draco despises Ron for being poor and dirty (his 
            enthusiastically wizardy family lives simply), and is afraid of 
            Harry's essential Harry-ness (being legendary, sweet, heroic, and a 
            half-human, to boot). This film underlines Harry's difference by 
            revealing that he is a Parselmouth (he speaks &quot;snake&quot;), which makes 
            him seem even more powerful and, of course, &quot;dark&quot; than in the first 
            film (as even Harry doesn't know how he has come to have this 
            language or what he's saying when he uses it). </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The cruelest of 
            Malfoy's bigotries is directed against lovely, diligent Hermoine, 
            for she is the child of muggles (humans). Malfoy actually makes poor 
            Hermoine cry when he starts calling her names, and Harry and Ron 
            come to realize an important lesson, articulated by another target 
            of prejudice, Hermoine's usual champion, Hagrid: that a wizard who 
            is not pure-blood is called &quot;mud-blood.&quot; That the film (and so far, 
            the series) is unable to represent race and race differences 
            directly is hardly unusual. Like the old <i>Star Trek</i> episodes, 
            the <i>Potter</i> films include occasional characters of color 
            (black and Asian Hogwarts students) to indicate a certain 
            &quot;diversity,&quot; and unlike in the old <i>Star Trek</i> series, they are 
            not summarily killed off, but rather, relegated to cheering on the 
            white heroes (one even has a comprehensible line to speak during the 
            quidditch business.) </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Amid all the 
            other excitement that goes on in <i>Chamber of Secrets</i>, 
            Hermoine's personal encounter with Draco actually takes up very 
            little time or energy, though her new friendship with gloomy 
            ghost-girl, Moaning Myrtle (Shirley Henderson) suggests that 
            Hermoine herself is as free of prejudice as the great Harry, and 
            rather remarkably patient and discerning to boot. (And Hermoine is 
            very sadly removed from the action partway through the film, for 
            reasons that the book's readers know well enough.) Still, the film 
            does address her concerns, via further displacement, in the plot 
            concerning the chamber of secrets, which involves an apparently 
            longstanding conflict over whether the student body will be &quot;mixed&quot; 
            or &quot;pure&quot; of blood. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">That <i>Harry 
            Potter and the Chamber of Secrets</i> takes on this struggle as one 
            that is &quot;historical&quot; as well as contemporary, is surely commendable. 
            That it piles up a lot of episodic enchantments and digital wonders 
            is disappointing, but not unexpected, given that it pretty much 
            follows the first film's formula. Chris Columbus told Katie Couric 
            on <i>Today</i> (13 November 2002), &quot;The only reason to do a sequel 
            to a film like is to make it better.&quot; That's disingenuous, of course 
            -- the reason to make a sequel to a &quot;film like this&quot; (which made 
            some $967 million total gross) is to make lots more money. Still, if 
            it can also explore a little &quot;darkness,&quot; metaphorical, ideological, 
            or political, along the way, more power to it. Now, if it can only 
            pick up the pace. </font></span></p>
