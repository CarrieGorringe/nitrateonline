<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">I, the Jury.</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">On any given day you'd think I was joking 
about an old Mickey Spillane novel/film, the latest headline-grabbing court 
case, or a re-run of an old <i>Perry Mason</i> episode. Yet, having survived 
half a century in my obscure corner of the film business (movie researcher, 
copyright searcher, rights tracker, archivist liaison, film archive &amp; festival 
logistician, film critic, and, yes, I even mow my own lawn) and actually making 
a living at AND enjoying it, I now have an extra bullet on my resume: Film 
juror.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Guilty.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It came as an enjoyable and totally unexpected 
surprise this spring that the illustrious San Sebastian Film Festival 
(celebrating its 50th Anniversary this year), nestled away in the Basque country 
of Northern Spain, invited me to participate as one of seven jurors in its New 
Directors selection of films. When Festival director Mikel Olaciregui emailed me 
that the honor was mine to be had, who am I to say no to a nearly two-week 
all-expenses-paid &quot;working&quot; vacation in this great seaside town and former 
pirate sanctuary?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Arriving a day early to help fight off any 
evidence of jet lag, my wife and I have settled in at the lovely Hotel de 
Londres for ten days of work (for me) and play (my spouse). Sure, you're 
wondering; work? Seven judges, twenty films (thirty-one hours, twenty-two 
minutes), ten days. Sharing the jury box with me are: local writer Ramon 
Saizarbitoria, Spanish cinema professor Alberto Elena, Toronto International 
Film Festival director Piers Handling, Italian film critic Angela Prudenzi, 
British Film Institute archival booking officer Bryony Dixon [the only other 
member I've actually met before], and Peter Scarlet, recently with the 
Cinématèque Française.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's not that I'm a stranger to this part of 
the world. I've shipped thousands of American films to the Cinemateca Portuguesa 
(Lisbon) and Filmoteca Española (Madrid) over the last two decades. These are 
generally older repertory titles, selected to supplement the vast programming 
efforts that thrive at these two Iberian archives. I also helped program an 
extensive salute to American horror icon Tod Browning a half dozen years ago at 
San Sebastian, a sidebar event coupled with the publication of the Spanish 
translation of the Browning biography, <i>Dark Carnival</i>, I had co-written 
with noted horror author David J. Skal.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">(A sidebar on the sidebars. Aside from the 
Official Section, Made in Spain, and Zabaltegi (a forty-three-film parallel 
official section with looser parameters and housing eighteen of my must-see 
features), there are retrospectives this year celebrating Francis Ford Coppola 
(nine films), Michael Powell (forty-three), Volker Schlöndorf (twenty-three), 
and <i>50 from the 50s</i> (a salute commemorating a decade's connection to the 
Festival)</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">An obvious conundrum arises: scheduling 
conflicts. On any given day you must select from tens of films which handful of 
titles you actually view. After a shorter opening day schedule (thirty-six 
screenings), the second day more than doubles that! Plus, only a handful get 
pre-noon start times, and everyone (viewers, projectionists, the entire town) 
always take time off for lunch (2-4 pm). It's not unusual to see full houses for 
the numerous late night screenings. Aside from the demands I have as a juror, I 
desperately want to see at least nearly a dozen other films including Neil 
Jordan's <i>The Good Thief</i>, François Ozon's <i>8 Women</i>, <i>Balzac et la 
Petite Tailleuse Chinoise</i>, Dai Sijie's adaptation of his own book, Stephen 
Frears' <i>Dirty Pretty Things</i>, Michael Moore's <i>Bowling for Columbine</i>, 
Roman Polanski's <i>The Pianist</i>, and the collected parts of <i>Ten Minutes 
Older</i>, a film project involving fifteen directors telling ten-minute 
stories. The Zabaltegi and Official Section titles generally screen four or five 
times over a three-day period, the repertory prints even less. If I'm lucky I 
might catch one (<i>A Matter of Life and Death</i> hopefully) of the Powell 
titles, and probably none of from the Schlöndorff and other sidebars.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">My key responsibility is watching all twenty 
entries (including two U.S. titles—Todd Louiso's <i>Love Liza</i> and Patricia 
Cardoso's <i>Real Women Have Curves</i> (the only film I was able to pre-screen 
back home)—and commiserating with my fellow panelists on which of these films 
receives the New Directors Award. Unlike the two other festival juries, our 
award has quite a financial heft to it. The Official Section Jury, chaired by 
Wim Wenders, hands out the Shell awards (Golden for best film; Silvers for best 
director, actress, and actor; Jurys for best photography, screenplay; and an 
optional Special Award) as bestowed by its seven members. They have twenty films 
to watch; two, New Zealand's <i>Whale Rider</i> and <i>Hafid (The Sea)</i>, from 
Iceland, overlap with the New Directors series. The Made in Spanish Award Jury 
(of three) will select from thirteen titles the best feature produced in Latin 
America or focusing on the Latin community throughout the rest of the world. 
Cash prize: Euro 18,000. Not a bad chunk of change, although the Jazztel-sponsored 
New Directors Award is worth Euro 150,000.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As the festival begins, I must temporarily 
forego my writing chores to focus on the necessary jury duties. It will be an 
interesting, yet exhausting experience….</font></p>
