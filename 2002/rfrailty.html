            review by <a href="../kj.html" target="_top">KJ Doughton</a>, 19 April 2002</i></font><p>
            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">After a rather unsavory start, <i>
            Frailty</i> develops into anything but that which its title 
            suggests, opting instead to become a strong, good old-fashioned 
            suspense/horror story with lots of creepiness along the way.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Frailty</i> is full of 
            disturbing axe attacks, most of them dealt out in front of 
            preadolescent children.&nbsp; After painting this unsavory-looking 
            premise, it may seem a bit odd that Bill Paxton’s directorial debut 
            unfolds as a traditional, old-fashioned thriller seasoned with 
            thunderous religious overtones.&nbsp; With every chunky &quot;thud&quot; of the 
            axe, there are gobs of biblical references blanketed inside a 
            crimson quilt of family values.&nbsp; It’s Lizzy Borden meets The Waltons.&nbsp;
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Telling the story of a rural Texas 
            widower fathering two upstanding boys until a supernatural force 
            disrupts their idyllic existence, <i>Frailty</i> hacks pieces from 
            such past thrillers as <i>The Dead Zone</i>, <i>The Rapture</i>, <i>
            The Sixth Sense</i>, and <i>Unbreakable. </i>Paxton sews these 
            macabre cinematic limbs together into a coherent whole, with the 
            same seamless precision practiced by twisted seamstress Jame Gumb 
            sewing one of his fleshy woman-suits from <i>Silence of the Lambs</i>.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Dad&quot; Meiks (played by director 
            Paxton) is a hard-working, blue-collar papa who puts the 
            fundamentalist fear of God into his two young boys, Fenton (Matthew 
            O’Leary) and Adam (Jeremy Sumpter), through regular church-going 
            sessions. However, his sons become alarmed when the elder summons 
            them together one night and proclaims, &quot;I heard a voice from God. He 
            told me to rid the world of demons.&quot;&nbsp; Eventually, Dad reveals to his 
            sons that The Almighty has sent him a hit list of names to be 
            dispatched with a crowbar and an axe.&nbsp; Before you can say &quot;Whack ‘em 
            and stack ‘em,&quot; he’s gathering up local townsfolk, carting them to 
            the family work shed, and chopping them into kindling.&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The senior Meiks orchestrates such 
            slaughter as a family ritual, with both offspring reluctantly 
            viewing all as troubled eyewitnesses who love their father, yet 
            grimace at his seemingly insane handiwork.&nbsp; Eventually, one boy will 
            betray the father, creating an even more complex web of mystery that 
            is never completely resolved until <i>Frailty</i>’s final frames.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Frailty</i>’s other key story 
            threat involves Matthew McConaghey, who plays a mysterious visitor 
            to the Texas FBI headquarters. Requesting to talk with Agent Wesley 
            Doyle (Powers Boothe) and claiming to know the identity of an 
            at-large serial murderer dubbed The God’s Hands Killer by 
            authorities, the man suggests that he is one of the grown Meiks 
            boys.&nbsp; The remainder of the film forces viewers to re-evaluate past 
            information, and judge what forces are really at work here: have the 
            killings resulted from human madness, or has an omniscient, 
            supernatural hand actually willed such gruesome acts?&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Until a terrific final act, where 
            all is laid out bare after some diabolical twists, <i>Frailty</i> 
            takes its own sweet time to wedge its pieces into place. Perhaps 
            Paxton’s slow pacing bogs down what could have been a more tightly 
            knit project.&nbsp; Even so, the fact that <i>Frailty</i> gradually 
            fleshes out its trio of compelling characters is a refreshing 
            contrast to the rapid-fire, MTV-inspired crosscutting that plagues 
            nine out of ten multiplex features.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The acting is&nbsp; first-rate, with 
            Paxton giving a believable performance as a man struggling with the 
            impulse to kill for what he feels is a just, spiritually sanctioned 
            cause.&nbsp; Previously known for his stints as a character actor in such 
            James Cameron films as <i>Titanic, Terminator, Aliens</i>, and <i>
            True Lies</i>, he layers his good ol’ boy, aw-shucks mannerisms with 
            urgent, troubled obsession.&nbsp; O’Leary and Sumpter are fine as the two 
            boys who must weigh their love of a supposedly righteous parent with 
            their inherent revulsion over his deadly deeds.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Frailty</i> is a film to be 
            commended in this age of overbloated, corporately tainted &quot;movies&quot; 
            like <i>Pearl Harbor</i> and <i>Coyote Ugly</i>, gaudy production 
            values thrown at the screen posing as stories.&nbsp; Paxton gives us a <i>
            real</i> story, and fuels it with conviction and momentum without a 
            bunch of headache-inducing window dressing. In the words of one of 
            the film’s Bible-thumping protagonists, Amen and Hallelujah to that.</font></td>
