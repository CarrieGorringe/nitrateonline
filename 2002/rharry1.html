            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of 
            Secrets</i> has thrown a dark, velvety vampire’s cape over the 
            draggy, expository blandness of its predecessor.&nbsp; </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Remember how <i>Indiana Jones and 
            the Temple of Doom</i> pushed the boundaries of a PG rating, with 
            its sinister child slavery ring and flaming hearts being pulled from 
            chests?&nbsp; Or how <i>The Empire Strikes Back</i> snatched away <i>
            Episode IV</i>’s cozy ending and replaced it with the unsettling 
            image of Han Solo being sealed into carbon freeze?&nbsp; The second 
            &quot;Harry Potter&quot; installment shares the more malevolent spirit of such 
            sequels, trading the whimsical light of the first film for streaks 
            of sinister malice.&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The pitter-patter of creeping 
            spiders’ feet and the crimson graffiti staining Hogwarts’ hallowed 
            walls juice up this sophomore outing, and inject <i>Harry Potter and 
            the Chamber of Secrets</i> with a more dynamic spirit than last 
            year’s <i>Sorcerer’s Stone</i>. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of 
            Secrets</i> meets its hero (a deeper-voiced, almost-pubescent Daniel 
            Radcliffe trading in his scarecrow cuteness for a slightly more 
            swashbuckling attitude) as he once again endures a miserable, 
            repressed existence under the roof of his stifling aunt and uncle’s 
            sterile abode.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Soon, however, he’s cast into the 
            academic melting pot of Hogwarts to continue his study of wizardly 
            ways. The same motley crew of magic-makers is there to whip Harry 
            and his colleagues into top-notch wand-wielders, including 
            headmaster Dumbledore (the late Richard Harris, looking pallid and 
            winded), Professor McGonagal (Maggie Smith), and Snape (Alan 
            Rickman, again resembling an usher for the Satanic Church of San 
            Francisco). Hairy, lovable Hagrid the Giant (a portly Robbie 
            Coltrane) is also around to complete this coven of old reliables.
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still with me? The introductions 
            have only just begun. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We’ve not yet touched on Hogwart’s 
            bastion of young wizards, including Harry’s carrot-topped buddy Ron 
            Weasley (Rupert Grint), brainy gal pal Hermione (Emma Watson), and 
            tow-headed mischief-maker Draco (Tom Felton), all previously 
            introduced in the first film.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But wait – what about the <i>new</i> 
            necromancers in town? Gilderoy Lockhart (Kenneth Branagh) joins the 
            Hogwarts staff as the school’s pompous Professor of Defense Against 
            the Dark Arts. Meanwhile, the charismatic Jason Isaacs (whose 
            villainous redcoat breathed malicious life into <i>The Patriot</i>) 
            plays leering, sneering Lucius Malfoy, father of Draco. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To <i>Chamber of Secrets</i>’ 
            credit, these key players are thrown onto the carpet with brisk, 
            minimal strokes so that Harry &amp; Co. can get on with the business of 
            resolving a series of nasty on-campus shenanigans.&nbsp; Why are cats 
            being strung up in the corridors of Hogwarts, while messages 
            scribbled in blood paint the walls?&nbsp; Like a schizophrenic haunted by 
            auditory taunts, Harry is soon fighting off macabre voices 
            instructing him to commit evil acts, while other students become 
            frozen, like stiff pillars of salt.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Who is behind such wickedness, and 
            how can Harry end this chain of evil events?&nbsp; Do such sinister 
            forces come from the long-sealed Chamber of Secrets, and if so, who 
            dared to open its forbidden door?&nbsp; Was it Draco Malfoy and his 
            intimidating father, both of whom share the fascist belief that 
            mud-bloods (children with human parents) should not attend 
            Hogwarts?&nbsp; Their beliefs, Harry comes to understand, were shared by 
            Salazar Slytherin, one of Hogwarts’ first house teachers. Is there a 
            connection?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of 
            Secrets</i> culminates in a series of impressive, well-staged set 
            pieces.&nbsp; Just like <i>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom</i> threw 
            viewers onto the rails of an underground coal car and had them 
            clutching theater armrests with iron grips, this second Potter 
            picture has Harry and Ron braving a forestful of spiders as 
            cringe-worthy as the mechanical arachnids from <i>Minority Report</i>.&nbsp; 
            Meanwhile, in a genealogical twist borrowed from <i>The Empire 
            Strikes Back</i>, Harry is forced to confront his heritage by 
            entering the Chamber, sword in hand, like Luke Skywalker wielding a 
            light saber.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As much of an improvement as <i>
            Chamber of Secrets</i> is over the first Potter plodder, it’s still 
            dragged down several notches from the classic playing field of 
            Indiana Jones and Star Wars by overlength and paint-by-numbers 
            pacing. Reined in by its unswaying allegiance to J.K. Rowling’s 
            source material and the need to stuff in each and every detail from 
            her 1999 book, there’s something strangely impersonal about the 
            film. One never forgets that they’re watching a slick, glossy 
            Hollywood &quot;product.&quot;&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Even so, director Chris Columbus 
            flicks a few fresh surprises into the tried ‘n true mix.&nbsp; As a vain 
            author of the autobiography &quot;Magical Me,&quot; Kenneth Branaugh joins the 
            distinguished list of British thespians populating Harry Potter’s 
            U.K.-spirited world.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Radcliffe looks more confident and 
            seasoned wearing Harry’s demanding shoes. There’s a restless glint 
            in his eyes that makes Harry appear hungrier and less indifferent 
            than he did in the first film.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">However, the entire Potter cast is 
            completely upstaged by Isaacs, an underrated character actor often 
            miscast in military roles (<i>Black Hawk Down</i>), but just as 
            often mesmerizing when allowed the chance to shine (<i>The Patriot</i>).&nbsp; 
            Possessing an air of snobby, self-righteous arrogance, Isaacs’ 
            senior Malfoy appears capable of doing nearly anything to justify 
            and satiate his own needs and beliefs, however twisted and 
            self-serving.&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Harry Potter is back with a 
            vengeance, but for how long?&nbsp; Pretty soon, Radcliffe’s elementary 
            school charm will fall victim to the unsparing rites of puberty.&nbsp; 
            Can audiences accept an older, wiser adolescent Harry?&nbsp; Rowling 
            should gamble that they will, and rough out her next series saga –
            <i>Harry Potter and the Clearasil Curse</i>. </font></p>
