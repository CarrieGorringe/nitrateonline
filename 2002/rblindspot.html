            </span><i>I Was Hitler's Secretary!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span></i>Unfortunately, young Traudl Junge (née Hupps) lived out
            that very role (right up to and including the infamous end in the
            sub-Chancellery Bunker), and, fortunately, decided to tell her story
            just before her death (she died from cancer just hours after the
            film premiered at the 2002 Berlin Film Festival).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>In the process, she works her way through historical
            territory which by now is well-known (if not well-worn).<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>By the end, she is seen bitterly regretting the
            &quot;young fool&quot; that she was when she resided within the
            range of Hitler's charisma, but there have been many similar post
            facto renunciations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As with all of this post-Nazi-era
            tales, however, there's always the nagging question of just how much
            of this repentance was inspired by fear of reprisals or cynicism.
            Frau Junge's, however, is far more persuasive in its claim to
            legitimacy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She was
            never a party member, but saw the idea of going to work in the Nazi
            steno pool as both something fun to do, and also as a means of
            escaping the notorious emotionally (and often physically) brutal
            upbringing that many of her contemporaries shared (it's ironic that
            it was through a most tangential relationship to the Nazi party –
            with its anti-feminist beliefs – that Frau Junge may have
            experienced her greatest personal and financial liberation).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>She gained her position more through talent and luck (as the
            result of an open competition) than through having the right
            connections, and she claims not to have known that, at the end of
            the contest, the winner would be working directly with Hitler.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Moreover, Frau Junge wasn't quick to cash in on her fame:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>she reluctantly conceded to tell her story, and was, perhaps,
            one of the few members of Hitler's entourage who nearly didn't.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>As you watch the film, there's less of the usual feeling of
            voyeurism that you get from these so-called &quot;confessions;&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Frau Junge's tale unfolds like a form of personal catharsis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>This, it seems, is the &quot;real&quot; story from as
            ordinary a person who was close to the inner circle as he/she was
            likely to get:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>the person who
            walked out from the belly of the beast with her morals reasonably
            intact.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But, did she
            really, and how are we to ever know?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </span>Paradoxically, in many ways, her forthrightness adds to the
            ambiguity (the &quot;deathbed confessional&quot; nature of her
            interviews also adds a touch of unease) and this is what keeps her
            nevertheless remarkable story from becoming yet another of these
            I-was-in-the-bunker-with-Hitler stories.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
