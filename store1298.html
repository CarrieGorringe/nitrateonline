<p><em><strong><big><big><a name="BASEketball" href="rbaseket.html" target="_top">BASEketball</a>
(1998) (December 29)</big></big></strong></em></p>

<p>The quirkiest, most fearless comedy of 1998 is a bawdy and exuberant sendup of
America&#146;s obsession with professional sports that marks the triumphant teaming of two
generations of humorists, &quot;South Park&quot; creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone, and Airplane!
co-director Jerry Zucker. The boys play the co-hatchers of the title sport, which they
parlay into a wildly popular industry with its own league (including the Detroit Lemons
and Roswell Aliens), TV contract and attendant problems. These last include ruthless
businessman Baxter Cain (&quot;The Man From U.N.C.L.E.&quot; himself, Robert Vaughn,
appearing in his 100<sup>th</sup> film); game Jenny McCarthy as the conniving widow of
team owner Theodore Denslow (Ernest Borgnine, who enthusiastically performs a bit of Right
Said Fred&#146;s &quot;I&#146;m Too Sexy&quot;); and Jenna Reed (Yasmine Bleeth), who runs
the financially-imperiled Dreams Come True Foundation for terminally ill children
(although she prefers to call them &quot;survival impaired&quot;). The games are played to
the music of Reel Big Fish, who perform live on the imaginatively-designed stadium set
(and do a wicked cover version of a-ha&#146;s &quot;Take On Me&quot;). Destined to be a
cult favorite on tape and cable (like Airplane! it&#146;s one of those episodic
comedies that you can walk away from for large chunks of time without missing anything
except more jokes), BASEketball does for sports what The Loved One did for
funerals. The DVD will feature music highlights, cast and crew biographies and web links.</p>

<p><em><strong><big><big><a name="The_Big_Hit" target="_top">The Big Hit</a> (1998)</big></big></strong></em></p>

<p>This way-too-hip comedy, as intermittently funny as it is determinedly distasteful,
posits that good-looking young hitmen have fairly normal problems -- in this case a
demanding fiancee, high-maintenance future in-laws, piles of unpaid bills and the
resulting upset stomach -- just like the rest of us. When it is making fun of these
mundane, workaday things, The Big Hit often mines a darkly humorous vein. But the
mannered, venomous performance of Lou Diamond Phillips as Cisco, the leader of an
assassination squad, infects the entire movie, effectively negating the sweetly dorky turn
by Mark Wahlberg (acting an awful lot like he did in Boogie Nights) as the put-upon
professional Melvin, who must first work with and then elude the wild Cisco when a
freelance kidnapping goes awry and he&#146;s stuck with the hostage (these sequences hint
at the social burlesque that may have been at the heart of the project at one time).
Directed by Che-Kirk Wong, a protégé of Hong Kong action filmmaker John Woo (who is a
co-executive producer), The Big Hit can&#146;t quite overcome an annoying smugness
that seems born of unchecked improvisational wisecracking; in the end, it just tries too
hard. The Special Edition DVD features deleted scenes as well as audio commentaries from
the director and screenwriter Ben Ramsey.</p>

<p><em><strong><big><big><a name="Doctor_Dolittle" target="_top">Doctor Dolittle</a> (1998)</big></big></strong></em></p>

<p>A bump on the head gives successful San Francisco doctor John Dolittle (Eddie Murphy)
the ability to talk to the animals -- who, in this sassy update of Hugh Lofting&#146;s
stories and the 1967 musical film version with Rex Harrison (minus the big hat),
aren&#146;t shy about expressing their often raunchy opinions. With jokey references to Rocky
III, Sling Blade, The Usual Suspects, Dead Man Walking, Austin Powers,
Jurassic Park and others, Murphy&#146;s second star vehicle based on a 1960s movie
(following the smash hit The Nutty Professor) is a glossy gagfest that benefits
greatly from surprisingly good writing (until the inevitably ramshackle ending, anyway),
first-rate special effects and the sleekly paced direction of ex-comic Betty Thomas.
Celebrity voices on hand include Albert Brooks as a suicidal tiger, Chris Rock as Rodney
the impudent guinea pig, Garry Shandling, Ellen DeGeneres, Gilbert Gottfried, Jenna
Elfman, Paul Reubens and, most memorable, The Firesign Theater&#146;s own Phil Proctor as
a drunk monkey (although the scene where Murphy gives CPR to a flatulent rat will stay
with you too). The movie is narrated by and co-stars Norm MacDonald (he&#146;s the voice
of the dog Murphy rescues from the shelter), whose own howlingly funny comedy Dirty
Work -- along with BASEketball the most unjustly neglected laff riot of the
year -- is also new on tape.</p>

<p><big><big><strong><em><a name="Halloween_H2O" href="rh20.html" target="_top">Halloween: H2O</a>
(1998) (December 15)</em></strong></big></big></p>

<p>Twenty years after that nightmarish Halloween in Haddonfield, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee
Curtis) is the headmistress of the tony and remote Hillcrest Academy, tucked into the
Northern California mountains under an assumed name and somewhat over-protectively raising
her son John (Josh Hartnett). But despite the distance of years and protective coloration,
she&#146;s got wicked bad nightmares, a jones for pills and a persistent drinking problem.
In short, the monstrous killing machine Michael Myers may or may not have died (you know
how this genre goes), but in the disastrous effect he&#146;s had on Laurie&#146;s life
it&#146;s like he never really went away. And neither, really, has the Halloween
franchise, offering sporadic chapters over the years that have systematically plundered
John Carpenter&#146;s genre-defining 1978 original. If Halloween: H20 (the title
has nothing to do with water) is respectfully but marginally better than the tired sequels
that preceded it, chalk up the modest success to a coolly jaded script that has some fun
with Curtis&#146; real-life Mom Janet Leigh and her own horror film legacy
(&quot;we&#146;ve both had bad things happen to us,&quot; says Mama, over bits of the Psycho
score as she walks towards the very same car she drove in that horror classic) as well as
the younger actress&#146; own iconographic presence -- her first since the 1981 sequel.
When she&#146;s got the right material she inhabits a part with the best of them (see Trading
Places, A Fish Called Wanda and True Lies), and the haunted melancholy
she brings to the role -- &quot;oh, no, not again,&quot; she seems to be saying as actress
and character -- is the best reason to revisit one woman&#146;s private hell. The first
four films in the series are also available on DVD.</p>

<p><big><big><strong><em><a name="The_Lion_King_II" target="_top">The Lion King II: Simba&#146;s
Pride</a> (1998)</em></strong></big></big></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A worthy follow-up to the Disney hit that became the best-selling video
of all time, Lion King II follows the grown-up Simba (voice of Matthew Broderick)
and mate Nala (Moira Kelly) as they raise their daughter Kiara (Neve Campbell). As
Scar&#146;s former mate Zira (Suzanne Pleshette) schemes to regain control of the
pridelands through her son Kovu (Jason Marsden), the youngsters pull a Romeo-and-Juliet
number to try and settle their differences. Also along for the ride are the sassy meerkat
Timon and his warthog buddy Pumbaa, voiced as in the original by Nathan Lane and Ernie
Sabella. The movie is a dramatically satisfying stand-alone feature (short but just right
for the kiddies at 75 minutes), and is refreshingly and cheerfully dismissive of the
original&#146;s most overused ideas -- to the point where Timon dismisses the concept of
&quot;hakuna matata&quot; (&quot;stop living the past,&quot; he tells Pumbaa). The five
new songs (the best of which is Kevin Quinn &amp; Rany Petersen&#146;s comic reggae
shuffle &quot;Upendi,&quot; sung by Robert Guillaime&#146;s Rafiki with, among others,
Ladysmith Black Mambazo) were composed by veteran conductor Nick Glennie-Smith, whose
previous scores include music for The Man in the Iron Mask, The Rock and Cool
Runnings. As a pleasant bonus the movie is gorgeous, with all the rich colors and
meticulous production values of the original (director Darrell Rooney was an animator on
the Disney films Tron and Something Wicked This Way Comes). The DVD release
of this title is due in the new year.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It must be the same thing Jamie Lee Curtis had to fight in Halloween:
H20: how to make a character fresh after being associated with it so closely for so
long. The remedy employed by director Richard Donner and stars Mel Gibson and Danny Glover
is very different than Curtis&#146; solution, as Lethal Weapon 4 is a loose, almost
improvisational action epic that seems so cheerfully weary of its basic premise -- loose
cannon white cop is best pals with his partner, a black cop with family man leanings --
that no time at all is spent filling in audiences that may not know who these guys are.
And while they started as a couple of edgy misfits, they&#146;re now like a bickering old
married couple, affectionately razzing each other as bullets fly and things explode
(starting with the Warner Bros. logo, which vaporizes before you&#146;ve even settled in
your chair). Back for encores are Joe Pesci as motormouthed Leo Getz and Rene Russo as
kickboxing cop Lorna Cole (now pregnant with the child of Gibson&#146;s Martin Riggs). New
to the extended family -- and that, believe it or not, is exactly how the movie has been
made and sold, down to the decade-spanning scrapbook under the closing credits -- are
Chinese action star Jet Li as sort of an updated Oddjob and Chris Rock as the foil to
Glover&#146;s anxious Roger Murtaugh, forever on the verge of a serene retirement but
goaded into hair-raising feats of derring-do by the newly-altruistic Riggs. This
edition&#146;s spotlight cause is slavery, but plot is decidedly incidental to the great
stuntwork, which includes the series highlight to date, a car and mobile home chase on an
elevated freeway and through an adjacent office building. Audience friendly in the extreme
-- there&#146;s a reason they don&#146;t use roman numerals for these things -- Lethal
Weapon 4 is loud, pleasing hokum. The Special Edition DVD is a digital scrapbook of
the franchise, sporting a documentary on the evolution of the series, audio commentary by
the director and two original stars, deleted scenes, an &quot;interview gallery&quot; with
the cast and crew and theatrical trailers for all four Lethal Weapon films.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Knowing that the director of this two hour and ten minute version
of the beloved story of the suave bandit and his fast-paced adventures is Martin Campbell,
the same guy who helmed the Bond outing <em>GoldenEye</em>, helps prepare you for the
strange mix of leisurely, old-fashiomed storytelling and high-tech hijinks (explosions and
the like) that make this one of the most unique and confounding movies of the year -- and
that&#146;s not necessarily a compliment. On one hand, the comic interplay among the three
leads, Antonio Banderas as the rakish bandit, the eternal Anthony Hopkins as his mentor
and Catherine Zeta-Jones as the ravishing love interest, is for the most part clever and
refreshing (Zeta-Jones&#146; swordplay, particularly), putting one in mind of nothing so
much as a vintage Errol Flynn Warner Bros. outing. Yet for all of the beguiling brio of
its swashbuckling scenes, the movie seems bloated and often unwieldy, suffering
particularly when it pauses for some alarming mugging my Banderas that may up his
heartthrob factor but also has the unfortunate effect of screaming &quot;look how clever
we are!&quot; Still, this is a grand time at the picture show, aided immeasurably by James
Horner&#146;s rousing score, the fight choreography of veteran blade blocker Robert
Anderson, and the gorgeous lensing of <em>GoldenEye</em> cinematographer Phil Meheux (who
also shot the 1980 British crime drama <em>The Long Good Friday</em>, just out on DVD and
a fine companion piece to John Boorman&#146;s soon-to-be-released <em>The General</em>). <em>The
Mask of Zorro</em> is also out in a DVD edition that includes a photo gallery and
making-of featurette.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><strong><big><big><em><a href="rnegotiator.html" name="The_Negotiator" target="_top">The Negotiator</a> (1998)</em></big></big></strong></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Samuel L. Jackson gives an authoritative yet perfunctory
performance as a police hostage negotiator who turns the tables on the cops who frame him
in this vigorous but ultimately by-the-numbers action thriller. Promising his new wife
(Regina Taylor) that &quot;crazy&#146;s on the bus&quot; -- that is, he&#146;ll settle
down in married life -- he instead grabs a handful of people on the twentieth floor of the
Chicago administration building and demands to meet with Chris Sabian (Kevin Spacey), a
legendary colleague who does the same thing (and, in the movie&#146;s laudable but hollow
attempt to flesh out the characters, is first seen mediating a tiff between his wife and
daughter). Although both actors rise above the material admirably, the essentially B-movie
script glosses over its lack of depth with lots of testosterone-fuelled platitudes laced
with police jargon, sternly barked by a large and distinguished supporting cast (including
J.T. Walsh, who passed away this year and to whom the film is dedicated). As in his
previous film, <em>Set It Off</em>, director F. Gary Gray gets the blood pumping with
scenes of efficiently staged action, but loses touch with the human element through a kind
of visceral overkill that is all too common in movies that try to condemn violence and
deceit by larding on layers of violence and deceit. Like the situation itself (apparently
based on something that really happened in St. Louis), <em>The Negotiator</em>, in the
end, represents an awful lot of firepower deployed to specious effect. The Premiere
Collection DVD includes commentary tracks by Jackson and Spacey as well as a documentary
on the Chicago location shoot and information on real-life police negotiators.</p>

Days, Seven Nights</a> (1998)</em></strong></big></big></p>

<p>Anne Heche is the antic, blustery heart of this dangerously by-the-numbers
romantic/screwball comedy from director Ivan Reitman (<em>Ghostbusters</em>) in which her
ditzy yet intense photographer and Harrison Ford&#146;s charmingly crusty pilot become
stranded on a spectacular desert island in the South Pacific. She&#146;s just been
proposed to by David Schwimmer (who is, truth to tell, making slow but steady progress on
the big screen), and he&#146;s left masseuse pal Jacqueline Obradors at the same hotel,
and the movie gathers what little forward motion it has from the parallel developing of
these unlikely pairings. With a sublime instinctual timing that seems to be a tribute to
the great Jean Arthur and other screen comediennes of years past, Heche takes great
strides toward laying to rest the controversy surrounding her increasingly public private
life. Her subsequent work, in the thoughtful <em>Return to Paradise</em> and Gus Van
Sant&#146;s triumphantly subversive remake of <em>Psycho</em> (hey, if Sheryl Crow does a
good cover version of a Bob Dylan song -- &quot;Mississippi,&quot; to be exact -- does
that make it any less of a Bob Dylan song?) proves that she&#146;s not only a skillful
mimic but an actress of uncommon focus and range possessed of the sort of face that the
camera finds endlessly fascinating. These attributes, more than sexual preference, ensure
her continued success. The DVD includes that truly weird theatrical trailer with the
hand-up-the-dress gag. </p>

<p><strong><big><big><em><a name="Sliding_Doors" href="rsliding.html" target="_top">Sliding Doors</a>
(1998)</em></big></big></strong></p>

<p>With <em>Shakespeare in Love</em> poised to delight moviegoers in search of smart
holiday diversion, let us now praise that movie&#146;s leading light, Gwyneth Paltrow, who
is quietly balancing the commercial (<em>A Perfect Murder</em>) and adventurous (<em>Hard
Eight</em>) in a career of pleasing depth and commitment. In writer-director Peter
Howitt&#146;s <em>Sliding Doors</em> she essays the challenging dual role of Helen, a
contemporary British career woman whose future takes two distinctly differing paths after
a chance encounter with a subway door. When Helen catches the train, she meets and
romances James (John Hannah); when the doors of fate slide shut in her face, she misses
out on John and instead falls into an emotional funk after catching her callow live-in
boyfriend Gerry (John Lynch) with his old American flame Lydia (Jeanne Tripplehorn).
Although the movie isn&#146;t without its charming faults -- James&#146; constant
references to Monty Python become grating and a late-in-the-game plot twist seems overly
contrived -- the film is held together by Paltrow&#146;s bravura performance, which
manages to create two wholly credible Helens, each sculpted from the happiness and pain of
each life&#146;s arc. A deceptively slight movie with surprising emotional resonance,
Sliding Doors is thoughtful, provocative and mischievously entertaining. This title is
also available on DVD. </p>

<p><strong><big><big><em><a name="Small_Soldiers" href="rssoldiers.html" target="_top">Small Soldiers</a>
(1998)</em></big></big></strong></p>

<p>A shrewdly marketed movie about the shrewdness of entertainment marketing, <em>Small
Soldiers</em> is the latest in a long line of -- dare it be said? -- shrewd social satires
from Joe Dante, who patented this kind of thing with his segment of <em>Twilight Zone: The
Movie</em>, <em>The Explorers</em> and, of course, the Gremlins franchise (fair warning:
this movie is just as cheerfully violent). An overzealous toy company wonk accidentally
procures a batch of surplus military computer chips, which are installed in two lines of
action figures: the Commando Elite, a caricatured line of muscled military men (voiced by
some of the original <em>Dirty Dozen</em> plus Bruce Dern), and the lovably misshapen,
peace-loving Gorgonites (led by Archer, with the soothing voice of Frank Langella,
supplemented by the guys who starred in <em>This is Spinal Tap</em>). Once these
perfunctory plot points are out of the way, the movie vigorously mines the comic
possibilities of havoc within a comfortable suburban existence, as the warring toys do
battle in amongst the befuddled citizenry (including Phil Hartman, whose last role this
was). Best scene: Kirsten Dunst, wholesomely far from her earthy turns in <em>Interview
with the Vampire</em> and &quot;E.R.,&quot; is attacked by her newly-animated distaff
Gwendy Doll collection (voiced by Sarah Michelle Gellar and Christina Ricci) to the
strains of Led Zeppelin&#146;s &quot;Communication Breakdown.&quot; Saturated with pop
culture references -- another Dante trademark -- <em>Small Soldiers</em> also benefits
from the skillful animatronic work of special effects veteran Stan Winston, which gives
new meaning to the plaque under the youthful protagonist&#146;s computer: &quot;Question
Reality.&quot; The DVD includes behind-the-scenes footage, interactive game demonstration,
production notes, biographies of the cast and crew and the theatrical trailer.</p>

<p><big><strong><big><em><a name="Funny_Games" href="fsiff98-1.html#Funny_Games" target="_top">Funny
Games</a> (1997)</em></big></strong></big></p>

<p>&quot;Terrifying&quot; doesn't describe your average film festival entry and it
certainly isn't an adjective guaranteed to lure uncertain moviegoers who might be put off
by subtitles. Yet those with an interest in and tolerance for a full-throttle onslaught of
disturbing, confrontational images in the service of intellectual discourse on the place
and effect of violence in media and our complicity in this awful spectacle need to see --
endure? -- this singular new Austrian film, the latest work from uncompromising maverick
Michael Haneke. On a visceral level, <em>Funny Games</em> is both shocking and
mischievous, a leisurely, malicious story of home invasion and human suffering in which a
bourgeois family is attacked and killed in and around their vacation house by a pair of
tender youths who unleash the most vile and evil impulses imaginable on their helpless
prey. No stranger to this theme (the film follows the equally harrowing <em>The Seventh
Continent</em> [1989], Benny<em>&#146;s Video</em> [1992], and <em>71 Fragments of a
Chronology of Chance</em> [1994]), Haneke approaches his incendiary material with the
aplomb of a pathologist revealing the life-ending mysteries hidden within an increasingly
messy vessel. &quot;You can't solve the problem by chatting about it,&quot; the director
told the prestigious British film journal &quot;Sight and Sound,&quot; so be cautioned:
the controversial <em>Funny Games</em> isn't casual conversation. But it is one of the
best films of the year.</p>

<p><strong><big><big><em><a name="Guantanamera" target="_top">Guantanamera</a> (1994)</em></big></big></strong></p>

<p>Popular Cuban filmmaker Tomas Gutierrez Alea (he co-directed the 1993 art-house
hit <em>Strawberry and Chocolate</em> -- the first Cuban film to be nominated for the Best
Foreign Film Oscar -- with long-time collaborator Juan Carlos Tabio) died in 1996, but not
before teaming with Tabio one last time on this 1994 satire that pokes fun at the rampant
bureaucracy of his native land in its story of a truck-driving Lothario (Jorge Perrugoria)
who joins a funeral cortege on the long trek from Guantanamo to Havana with the body of
recently-deceased opera singer Yoyita (Conchita Brando). The performer&#146;s
government-wonk son-in-law has the bright idea to avoid a country-wide gasoline shortage
by changing the cortege&#146;s cars in each town they pass through, a scheme which serves
not only to highlight a catalogue of absurd rules and regulations, but to drive his
exasperated wife into the arms of the happy trucker as well. Gutierrez Alea made movies
for almost a half century, and the ease with which he sends up the restrictions of his
native land is balanced by the ingenious ways people subvert the reigning authority and
spiced with the instantly recognizable musical motif, &quot;Guajira Guantanamera.&quot;

<p>On a sun-drenched French Riviera nearly devoid of adults, in the shadow of the
twin shark fin-shaped rock outcroppings known as the Bay of Angels, 15-year-old petty
thief Orso (Frédéric Malgras), who isn't very good at what he does, meets 14-year-old
vixen Marie (Vahina Giocante), who spends her time entertaining Americans on and around a
nearby base. Eventually, they come together, only to be separated by cruel fate and the
power of a gun. Conjuring up such seminal films of disaffected youth as <em>Breathless</em>,
<em>The 400 Blows</em> and <em>Pixote</em>, this debut feature -- five years in the making
-- has been prompting critics and programmers to compare writer-director Manuel Pradal's
shimmering, fragmented style to &quot;pure poetry,&quot; in the words of Toronto
International Film Festival director Piers Handling, &quot;Rimbaud and Kerouac transcribed
onto celluloid, a breathless film for the 1990s.&quot; Profoundly disturbing and
undeniably powerful, <em>Marie baie des anges</em> is a singular, memorable moviegoing
experience.</p>

<p>Director Manuel Gómez Pereira has pioneered an astonishingly successful genre
of contemporary Spanish screwball comedies this decade, with a run of glossy and
cheerfully carnal box office smashes including <em>Salsa Rosa</em> (1992), W<em>hy Do They
Call it Love When They Mean Sex?</em> (1993) and <em>You Men are All the Same</em> (1994).
This howlingly funny merry-go-round of mistaken identity and misplaced lust starring
Javier Bardem (Bigas Luna's Jamón, Jamón) as an aspiring actor come to Madrid in hopes
that his pushy agent (Maria Barranco of Almodovar's <em>Women on the Verge of a Nervous
Breakdown</em>) can land him a role in a Hollywood movie. While he waits for his break he
takes a job at a phone sex service to hone his craft, where a call from repressed gay
plastic surgeon Ricardo leads to an in-person assignation with the doctor's wife Amanda
(Aitana Sanchez-Gijon from A Walk in the Clouds) -- or is she? And if she's not she, who
is she? Then who's he? Imagine Preston Sturges fluent in Spanish and clutching a lifetime
supply of Viagra and you're close to approximating the movie world of Manuel Gómez
Pereira, who has elevated the raunchy yet tastefully done sex farce to new heights of
hilarity.</p>

<p><em>Nenette and Boni</em> is about an estranged brother and sister buffeted
about by the world who, once reunited in a Marseille far removed from <em>The Umbrellas of
Cherbourg</em>, learn to tolerate and accept each other. Within the deceptively simple
plot summary of this fine film, French director Claire Denis and her stock company of
collaborators behind and in front of the camera crystallize the themes of that have run
through her films (including <em>Chocolat</em> and<em> I Can't Sleep</em>): dreams and
discord, displacement and reconciliation. Anchored by remarkably erotic performances from
Grégoire Colin (Pascal Aubier's <em>The Son of Gascogne</em>) as pizza maker Boni --
&quot;more or less a good guy,&quot; Denis told an interviewer -- and Alice Houri (who
co-starred with Colin in Denis' <em>U.S. Go Home</em>) as the independent Nénette, the
film is as personal yet accessible an auteurist statement as has been seen this year,
featuring a memorable score by the British band Tindersticks as well as global acclaim --
including the Golden Leopard for best film at the 1997 Locarno festival. Five features
into her career, Claire Denis may be counted among the most intuitive and honest
moviemaking talents in the world</p>

<p>This atmospheric and haunting American International Pictures release has been
hard to find on video over the last few years, so it&#146;s good to see it back in print.
A very young Dennis Hopper stars as Johnny Drake, a shy sailor on leave who meets Mora
(Linda Lawson), an odd yet beautiful woman who works as a mermaid at a sideshow attraction
on the Santa Monica pier. As they fall in love, Johnny learns that a few of her previous
lovers have drowned (which explains her chaste approach to their romance) and she believes
herself to be descended from actual sea creatures. Director Curtis Harrington was an
experimental filmmaker who moved first into genre features (<em>Who Slew Auntie Roo?</em>,
What<em>&#146;s the Matter With Helen?</em>) and then to television, directing episodes of
&quot;Wonder Woman,&quot; &quot;Charlie&#146;s Angels&quot; and &quot;Dynasty,&quot; among
others. The strong visual strains of the avant-garde here include whiffs of Jean Cocteau
(the lovely black and white photography is by <em>The Hideous Sun Demon</em>
cinematographer Vilis Lapenieks) and even Val Lewton&#146;s <em>Cat People</em>. Also
worth tracking down is Harrington&#146;s 1967 psychological thriller <em>Games</em>,
starring Simone Signoret (in her Hollywood studio debut), Katharine Ross (<em>The Stepford
Wives</em>) and a very young James Caan. The music is by David Raksin, whose dozens and
dozens of scores include memorable music for <em>Laura</em> (1944), <em>Force of Evil</em>
(1948) and Nicholas Ray&#146;s <em>Bigger Than Life</em> (1956).</p>

<p>The refurbishment of Jackie Chan&#146;s huge oeuvre continues apace with this
enjoyable romp in which the &quot;Asian Hawk&quot; (Chan himself, who also directed) and
his pop star pal (Hong Kong heartthrob Alan Tam) go the Indiana Jones route as they pursue
some valuable relics through Germany and Yugoslavia, pausing for the trademark blend of
action (Chan was hurt badly in the infamous opening stunt, there&#146;s a great car chase
in the middle and a jaw-dropping balloon leap at the end) and comedy (look quickly for the
spoofy pop band Losers at the beginning). Although skillfully done, the dubbing can&#146;t
quite hide the surreal sight of everyone apparently speaking their own language -- but who
cares? This is Chan when he was at the merry peak of his Keatonesque powers, shortly after
the seminal 1985 urban action masterpiece <em>Police Story</em> (also newly available in a
&quot;remastered&quot; full-frame version) and just before the astonishing <em>Project A
II </em>(1987). For new fans of the action star, the stunt work here will be nothing short
of a revelation. As always, make sure to watch the closing credits. Also available on DVD.</p>

(1997)</strong></em></big></big></p>

<p>Featured at the 1997 New York Film Festival, this new work by Belgian siblings
Luc and Jean-Pierre Dardenne (1986's Falsche, 1992's Je pense à vous) is a stunningly
effective metaphor for the new evolving European order and a sublime, memorable
coming-of-age drama in which family bonds are put to the ultimate test. Fifteen-year-old
newcomer Jérémie Renier -- chosen by the experimental and documentary-trained directors,
as were all the actors, because they &quot;looked right&quot; for their parts -- stars as
Igor, who helps his father illegally import immigrants until the fatally wounded Hamidou
persuades the boy to care for his family. Although at first colluding in the coverup of
the tragedy, Igor begins to see his father for the amoral opportunist that he is, and this
revelation leads the boy to a choice of moral gravity and immediate consequence. Filmed
with a gritty immediacy that underscores the weight of the issues and the volatility of
the circumstances, <em>La Promesse</em> denounces the capitalistic urges that must
inevitably lead to tragedy while exalting the goodness of the lower classes, alarmingly
marginalized by the winds of change but capable, as Igor proves, of goodness and decency.
This is mature, powerful, thrilling cinema.</p>

Spanish Prisoner</a> (1998)</em></big></big></strong></p>

<p>&quot;We have no idea who anyone is,&quot; someone says near the beginning of
this riveting intellectual thriller from playwright-turned-director David Mamet (Glengarry
Glen Ross, House of Games, The Edge). This theme manifests itself in a labrynthine story
of industrial espionage and the attendant vanity, paranoia and greed that are at the heart
of the writer's best work. Steve Martin is superb as enigmatic Julian &quot;Jimmy&quot;
Dell, who befriends Joe Ross (Campbell Scott), inventor of a potentially lucrative
business practice called &quot;The Process&quot; (shades of Kafka) for his boss Mr. Klein
(Ben Gazzara). When &quot;The Process&quot; is endangered, Ross goes to his smitten
secretary Susan (Rebecca Pidgeon) for help. Discover the rest of the plot for yourself: it
includes a Don Budge tennis book, airport x-ray machines, St. Patrick's Day, surveillance
videos and the title confidence scam -- all played with the distinctive musical rhythms of
Mamet's often oblique dialogue. Reminiscent of Hitchcock's <em>The Man Who Knew Too Much</em>,
<em>The Spanish Prisoner</em> -- also available on DVD -- is sinister, memorable, and one
of the best films of the year.</p>

<p><strong><big><big><em><a name="Village_of_Dreams" target="_top">Village of Dreams</a> (1996)</em></big></big></strong></p>

<p>Winner of a Silver Bear for &quot;outstanding single achievement&quot; at the
1996 Berlin Film Festival, this delicate, deceptively simple new film from veteran
director/editor Yoichi Higashi and co-writer Takehiro Nakajima (a director in his own
right) is the autobiographical tale of artist Seizo Tashima and his identical twin brother
Yukihiko, and their idyllic childhood in the summer of 1948. Left largely unsupervised,
over the course of the lazy season the boys catch fish, draw, pinch vegetables and have
their tonsils removed. There is an element of the fantastic, too, as Seizo hears
mysterious voices underwater, a loincloth develops a mind of its own, and the village is
observed by three old witches, who conjure up a climactic thunderstorm. There's depth if
depth is desired, as the film suggests a Freudian perspective on impending puberty as well
as a reaffirmation of the traditional Japanese values prevalent immediately following
World War II. In any event, with its langorous pace and touches of magic, <em>Village of
Dreams</em> weaves a beautiful and seductive spell.</p>
