<p><big><strong><big>T</big></strong>he plundering of boomer TV memories continues apace
with <i>Lost in Space</i>, a busy but decidedly flat version of the television show about
a family, a robot and a stowaway knocking around the cosmos looking for a way home that
ran for 83 episodes between 1965 to 1968 on CBS. Originally titled <em>Space Family
Robinson</em> but rechristened at the last minute over fears that Disney might sue (<em>Swiss
Family Robinson</em> had been a hit a few years earlier), the show is remembered chiefly
for the interplay among the unnamed but perpetually panicky <i>Forbidden Planet</i>-inspired
Robot (&quot;Danger Will Robinson!&quot;), prissy and conniving stowaway Dr. Smith
(Jonathan Harris), and the brave, resourceful object of the Robot's warning (Billy Mumy).
This louder, more gadget-stuffed version of the tale will be remembered principally for
special effects overkill and a dramatically lethal misinterpretation of the original that
serves only to alienate fans of the original and frustrate it's younger target audience
&#150; which is hopefully jaded to such derivative, franchise-friendly fare.</big></p>

<p><img src="images/rlostinspace-1.gif" alt=")" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="152">In
September 2058, earth has reached population overload (amusingly, the genuinely creepy
1965 TV pilot &#150; readily available in video stores &#150; is set in October 1997).
Professor John Robinson (William Hurt) has been selected to lead his family into space on
the Jupiter 2 spacecraft, piloted in a last-minute substitution by hot-dogging pilot Major
Don West (Matt LeBlanc). As smart as they are, Professor Robinson's family is far from
peaceful: mother Maureen (Mimi Rogers) is upset that their children are being neglected in
the name of science, while no-nonsense eldest daughter Judy (Heather Graham) busies
herself with active involvement in the mission. Middle child Penny (Lacey Chabert) is the
wildest of the family, sneaking out of the house and pouring out her heart to her portable
camcorder (&quot;Pennyvision&quot;). Young Will Robinson (Jack Johnson) misses the
presence of his father, but seems to have a natural aptitude for machinery and a good head
on his shoulders.</p>

<p>Goaded by the mysterious Business Man (Edward Fox), the Robot on board Jupiter 2 is
sabotaged by the brooding, awkward base physician Dr. Zachary Smith (top-billed Gary
Oldman). Left for dead onboard the ship by his deceitful handler, Smith becomes a
reluctant confederate of the Robinsons as they fix the dangerously damaged ship, fly
directly through a sun, battle dangerous space spiders on an abandoned spaceship and
finally come face-to-face with a sinisterly altered future (involving <a href="fsiff96-4.html#I-Shot-Andy-Warhol" target="_top"><i>I Shot Andy Warhol</i></a> star Jared Harris,
son of actor Richard Harris) after they crash-land on a strange planet.</p>

<p><img src="images/rlostinspace-2.gif" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="151">In this
atmospheric but clumsily retooled new version, based in large part on that 1965 pilot
episode, the goofily appealing straight-arrow approach of the show (which sunk sadly into
self-parody and surrealism in later episodes) is replaced by a dramatic gravity wholly
inappropriate to the spirit of adventure. And the comedy elements used to leaven the
crisis, which usually consisted of Smith's efforts to sell the Robinsons down the nearest
celestial river to whichever species of alien they happened upon that week and/or the
Robot's antics attempting to protect the inquisitive Will, are almost entirely missing.
Without this balance, the film grinds to a halt under the weight of politically correct
Issues inserted into the plot: the dysfunctional nature of the Robinsons (who knew from
dysfunctional in 1965?), followed by the inevitable bonding and sentiment obviously meant
to teach the values of family togetherness and unified problem-solving. </p>

<p>The first sentence of the film's presskit trumpets the &quot;more than 750&quot;
special effects in the film, and the movie's problems begin here. There's just too much
going on, most of it stolen from other genre films (from <i>Blade Runner </i>to <i>Star
Wars</i>) to get any original momentum going. There's even a cute alien, Blawp, added for
a desperate bit of comedy relief, and a Darth Vader-like entity (dubbed &quot;Spider
Smith&quot; in the credits) tacked on to the Dickens-meets-<i>It's a Wonderful Life</i>
end for some equally yearned-for dramatic tension. The tragedy here is that perhaps a
dozen craft and special effects outfits, lead by the venerable Jim Henson's Creature Shop
and featuring such distinctively named firms as Cinesite, Framestore, The Magic Camera
Company and Men in White Coats, employed hundreds of people to create digital effects that
look for the most part dull and two-dimensional, like the skin of a lizard. That could be
overlooked if they served a unified dramatic purpose &#150; which they don't. Director
Stephen Hopkins brings the same indecision to this movie that sank some of his previous
efforts, including the fifth and least successful <i>Nightmare on Elm Street</i> movie (<i>The
Dream Child</i>, 1989), <i>Judgment Night</i> (1993),<i> Blown Away</i> (1994) and 1996's <i>The
Ghost and Darkness</i> (to his credit, however, 1990's <i>Predator 2</i> improves
significantly on the premise &#150; if not the execution of &#150; original).</p>

<p><img src="images/rlostinspace-3.gif" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="151">The more
conventional moviemaking crafts are equally populated &#150; the carpenters and plasterers
alone take up more than one page each &#150; and similarly muddled. While Norman Garwood's
production design provides an eye-catching update of the cavernous Jupiter 2 (he also
designed Terry Gilliam's <i>Brazil</i>), Vin Burnham's costume designs echo far too
closely her principal claim to fame, which is designing various Batsuits for the first two
editions of that franchise (the Robinson's flight suits appear far too kinky for family
wear). And, if like many of the plot devices, the rhythm and pace of the cutting seem
familiar, editor Ray Lovejoy counts among his credits Stanley Kubrick's pivotal <i>2001: A
Space Odyssey</i> and James &quot;King of the World&quot; Cameron's&nbsp;rousing <a href="ralien.html#Alien2" target="_top"><i>Aliens</i></a>. The early John Williams score of the TV show
(any kid stopped on the street during the show's run could've hummed it) is given a
full-bore updating by Apollo Four Forty, with additional contributions from Juno Reactor
&amp; The Creatures, Propellorheads, Death in Vegas, Fatboy Slim (amusingly sampling Edwin
Starr's &quot;Everybody Needs Love&quot;), The Crystal Method (Aha! Now &quot;Busy
Child&quot; makes sense!) and, inevitably, Space. Yet as interesting as the music is, it
is one more example of creative suffocation that sucks the life out of a genial original.</p>

<p>The name-driven cast does the best it can with directionless material. Before judging
Hurt too harshly for stooping to genre, remember that he made a most auspicious big-screen
debut in Ken Russell's <i>Altered States </i>nearly 20 years ago. His distinctive
mannerisms &#150; that deliberate speech pattern, subdued double take-cum-squint and small
shake of the head &#150; are jarring in this context, but somehow reassuring; he nails the
self-absorbed father, guilty for missing his children's childhood but vitally concerned
with the affairs of the world. Although she has great chemistry with Hurt, Mimi Rogers'
Maureen is underwritten to the point of shrewishness; better to catch her in the
extraordinary 1991 drama <i>The Rapture</i>, which is about as far away from this kind of
family fare as you can get and proves that it's the role, not the actress, that limits her
effectiveness here.</p>

<p>Oldman's Dr. Smith is the film's main flaw and the source of the movie's listlessness.
As played by the remarkable, now 84-year-old TV veteran Jonathan Harris (soon to be heard
as the voice of praying mantis Manny in <i>A Bug's Life</i>), the TV Smith was a
exuberantly contrary creation, three parts schemer to five parts penitent. The movie Smith
is written seriously and performed with much gravity by Oldman, who for all the worlds
seems pissed off at having to play him. There's no unpredictability and no fun at all in
the character that on the small screen could most be counted on to bring a broad wink to
the otherwise grave proceedings.</p>

<p><img src="images/rlostinspace-4.gif" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="left" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="149">Among the
younger players, Lacy Chabert (from Fox's &quot;Party of Five&quot;) is all vulnerable
rebellion as Penny &#150; sort of an intergalactic Alannis Morissette &#150; while Jack
Johnson as the ver-say-die Will emerges as the emotional center of the movie, whether
calmly fiddling with cast-off parts or saving the family by using the robot as a sort of
virtual reality game to blast those pesky spiders (young Johnson, the grandson of
Hollywood hyphenate Nunnally Johnson, has been acting since age 4, and his sizeable resume
includes recent Pepsi commercials with Shaquille O'Neal). Heather Graham expands her range
significantly by moving from <a href="rboogie.html" target="_top"><i>Boogie Nights</i></a> to the rather
more chaste Judy (she's also in the new Robert Downey Jr. movie <i>Two Girls and a Guy</i>),
but the movie stumbles severely by wasting a surprisingly rugged performance by
&quot;Friends&quot; star Matt LeBlanc as Major West &#150; who instead of being already
involved with Judy as in the original program is transformed into a leering, macho boor
for the sole purpose, it seems, of a few protective reaction shots from Papa Robinson.</p>

<p>The movie is peppered with cameos that range from the predictable to the cryptic. The
original Maureen Robinson, June Lockhart, has an amusing scene at the very beginning of
the picture as Will's morphing school principal, while a well-preserved Mark Goddard does
a crafty turn as LeBlanc's boss (Goddard was the first West). Edward Fox, of all people,
has a blink-and-you'll-miss-him bit as the &quot;Business Man&quot; who enlists Smith in
the sabotage scheme, while you don't have to be blinking to miss Marta Kristen (Judy) and
Angela Cartwright (Penny) as reporters. Remarkably, the movie manages the canny wit of
tracking down original Robot voice Dick Tufeld, and then squandering the opportunity by
limiting the expansion of the Robot's role to the clever spider sequence that finds Will
repeating orders through the machine.</p>

<p><img src="images/rlostinspace-5.gif" alt=")" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="152">As
certain as the fate of <i>Lost in Space</i> would appear to be (and at a bit over two
hours the movie is absurdly long for it's apparent target audience of 8 to 14-year-olds),
the wave of big-screen TV show adaptations is far from over. In the next 18 months expect
to see movies made from such familiar properties as <i>The X-Files</i>, <i>Inspector
Gadget</i>, the inevitable sequel to <a href="rmi.html" target="_top"><i>Mission: Impossible</i></a>, <i>My
Favorite Martian</i> and <i>Star Trek IX</i>. And, in a final irony, Goldsman is currently
working on the long-delayed new Superman movie, now apparently called <i>Superman Lives</i>.</p>

<p>As Hollywood moves towards a release cycle in which movies make most of their money in
the opening weekend and then virtually disappear, look for the relentless television
advertising and word-of-mouth to lure <i>Lost in Space</i>'s target audience to theaters
in big &#150; but not titanic &#150; numbers (the weather may help, as rain is predicted
over some of the country). &quot;This mission <i>sucks</i>,&quot; says the sassy new
Penny. While it doesn't do that, exactly, neither will it attract or excite the
demographic most likely to appreciate &#150; if not rejoice at &#150; a straight-faced,
issue-laden rendering of a childhood favorite. <i>Lost in Space</i> will very soon be lost
to theaters, and the sequel it so desperately seeks, if made, should by all rights go
straight to video or the Saturday morning cartoon wasteland.</p>
