<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Like his three feature films, the low-budget <i>Public
Access</i> (which won the Grand Jury Prize at the 1993 Sundance Film Festival), his
breakout 1995 hit <i>The Usual Suspects</i> (the movie shunned by 25 companies which won
Oscars for Kevin Spacey and childhood chum-turned-screenwriter Christopher McQuarrie) and
the sleek new thriller <i>Apt Pupil</i>, Bryan Singer is smooth and focused in person,
with a piercing stare and diplomatic aplomb in all things relating to the making of motion
pictures.</b></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Born 31 years ago in Princeton Junction, New Jersey, Singer began shooting 8mm films in
his teens before studying at the prestigious School of Visual Arts in New York. Moving to
Los Angeles, he enrolled in and graduated from the Critical Studies Program at the
University of Southern California (taking numerous menial jobs along the way). Enlisting
another pal from the old neighborhood, Ethan Hawke, Singer wrote and directed <i>Lion's
Den</i>, an award-winning short about five high school friends who check in with each
other after graduation. That got the ball rolling, and Singer today is one of the most
in-demand directors in Hollywood, currently sheparding <i>Apt Pupil</i> (adapted from the
Stephen King novella by yet another life-long friend, first-time screenwriter Brandon
Boyce) to the marketplace and preparing the much-delayed, effects-heavy X-Men project --
which could top out at $100 million, a far cry from the $15,000 he scraped together to
make <i>Lion's Den</i>, the quarter million it took to get <i>Public Access</i> (which has
Boyce in a small role) made, the $6.6 million he spent on <i>The Usual Suspects</i> and
the positively parsimonious $15 million spent on this new movie's lushly sinister look.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At a critics' roundtable amidst the hubbub of the Toronto International Film Festival
(where <i>Apt Pupil</i> had its world premiere as a Special Presentation), Singer took a
few minutes to talk about his pungent, creepy new film, starring Sir Ian McKellen as a
dissolute Nazi war criminal ferreted out of his Southern California hiding place by
inquisitive high school student Brad Renfro -- and the high-stakes power struggle that
develops between the two.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">EC:</font></b></i> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> What appealed to you about the story?</font></p>
<i><b>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">BS:</font></b></i> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> The part of the novella that I really liked, that really intrigued me the
most, was the idea that this terrible, awful thing that happened so many years ago, so
many decades ago in Europe, the awfulness of it, the collective awfulness of it, like a
Golem, would somehow have crept up, across the ocean, through time, and into this
beautiful Southern California, suburban neighborhood and this seemingly normal,
all-American, young man. And that interested me. And it wasn't about socialism or Nazism
or racism or anything. It was just about the pure collective deed, manifesting itself in
the present, that really interested me, the essence of evil.</font></p>
<i><b>

<hr size="1">

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">EC:</font></b></i> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> How did you and screenwriter Brandon Boyce approach the novella?</font></p>
<i><b>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">BS:</font></b></i> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> The book takes place over four years and covers Tod's age from 14 to 18. I
didn't want to do that with the movie so I tried to localize it into a 16-year-old senior.
And the book gets involved in a lot of ultra-violence and a lot of murder, a lot of things
happening, I felt that although it worked so beautifully on the page, in the film world it
might become a little less believable and potentially repetitive and exploitative. But
again, it works fantastically in the book. The essence of the story is there; I believe
this movie is horror.</font></p>
<i><b>

<hr size="1">

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">EC:</font></b></i> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> Isn't there a previous movie version of this material?</font></p>

<p><em><strong><font face="Verdana" size="2">BS:</font></strong></em> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> They tried to make this movie in 1988 with Ricky Schroder
and Nicol Williamson, they shot for ten weeks, and put together an hour of continuity;
I've never seen it.</font></p>
<i><b>

<hr size="1">

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">EC: </font> </b></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">Did you add anything to King's story?</font></p>
<i><b>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">BS:</font></b></i> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> Nothing drastic. I think we made Ian more pro-active. I had Ian show up at
the guidance counselor's office as opposed to having Brad convince him to. I had a few
other sequential changes and alterations just to make things different. I loved it in the
book, because it was the perpetuation of this evil from the past manifesting itself on the
world. Trouble is, when you try to show an audience that visually, they're going to get
real tired of seeing bums get whacked. So how do you end it? Here, we decided to play a
psychological game.</font></p>
<i><b>

<hr size="1">

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">EC: </font> </b></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">Are you worried about the Holocaust aspect?</font></p>
<i><b>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">BS:</font></b></i> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> Sure, of course I thought about it, I studied it and talked to Stephen King
about it. I'm Jewish, but Stephen is not. We talked about it, he experienced some
resistance from his agents and Jewish representatives at the time when he wanted to
publish it. I screened the film at the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles, and it went
beautifully. It was quite wonderful, I got a fantastic congratulatory letter about the
importance of the picture and any support that the center could offer the movie, a
premiere or something like that. I don't know if I would do that because I think the
people who would attend that kind of event might be older Jewish people and that's not
necessarily the first audience you want to trust in your theater with this movie.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Any time you reference the shoah in any form, whether it be in a popular entertainment
form, like a horror movie like <i>The Keep</i>, something like that, or <i>Schindler's
List</i>, more of a docudrama, or <i>Apt Pupil</i>, which is somewhere in the middle, I
guess, I think it's a good thing, because it reminds you that the event happened, that it
was real, and it should always be remembered. I don't think it's pro-Nazi or pro-Fascist.
In fact, it's really not about Fascism at all. It's not about Nazism at all. It's not
about that. It's about, this character could have been any monster who committed murder,
and if not enjoyed, thrived somehow on it.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And then my father told me, when he fought in the Korean war, he was in an artillery
unit, he said there were men who would opt to pull the cord, fire the cannons, they wanted
to. And there were men who didn't, like him. And he said it wasn't unusual: nobody was a
killer, there were just some men who wanted to do that.</font></p>
<i><b>

<hr size="1">

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">EC:</font></b></i> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> Was there an idea before you started that there was a backstory with Todd
Bowden [Brad Renfro's character], a core of evil that was being disturbed or was he pure
as the driven snow and then it all came down like a curtain?</font></p>
<i><b>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">BS: </font> </b></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">I don't believe for one minute that he was as pure as the driven snow. I
think anybody could be fascinated. I was tremendously fascinated by the Holocaust and by
these atrocities when I was a young man. But the capacity to blackmail an old man,
obviously there's a search for something going on that's just one good hard step beyond
innocence. And that was a function of Tod's character. It could have been the same thing
that provoked some kid to shoplift or do drugs or something.</font></p>
<i><b>

<hr size="1">

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">EC: </font> </b></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">This may sound odd, but it's striking in the film: was there a conscious
effort to film Tod with his head slightly down, like an animal backed into a corner?
Because it's hard to do something like that by accident...</font></p>
<i><b>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">BS:</font></b></i> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> Well, it changes, you remember in the scene where [Todd] makes him
[Dussander, McKellen's character] try on the uniform, the camera's actually beneath him
for most of the scene. So, it depends on which scene requires it. For me as a filmmaker
it's very instinctual, I literally put the camera where I believe it should go, I've been
doing it since I began making movies. It seemed right to me. I actually decided that the
lower angle made [Todd] weaker. For some strange reason, some weird reason, shooting him
from the lower angle, where normally you would think the character would be empowered, up
on high, made Brad weaker.</font></p>
<i><b>

<hr size="1">

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">EC:</font></b></i> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> What was your experience simultaneously directing stage-trained Ian
McKellen and Brad Renfro, who described himself as very raw?</font></p>
<i><b>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">BS:</font></b></i> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> I'd done this before with <i>The Usual Suspects</i>. You had stage actors
and movie stars and standup comedians. It's just different styles of acting, and that's
what makes it exciting. I love matching people together. I think if you were entertained
by the movie at all, or taken in to it, that's one of the elements that might have done
it, is the difference in the way they approach. It's really not how I approach them, it's
how they approach the material that I think comes across.</font> </p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Having to rest this film on two characters in such a conflicted setting, I like the
idea that I can do that. When I talk to executives about <i>The X-Men</i>, this big movie
I'm doing next, they say &quot;well, you know, we're concerned about talk.&quot; I say
&quot;you don't understand, the best Bond films were the ones with all that conversation
and all that relationship stuff,&quot; and then some action happened and you cared, you
know?</font> </p>
<i><b>

<hr size="1">

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">EC:</font></b></i> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> Could you talk a bit about your collaboration with John Ottman, who has
worked with you now on all three of your features?</font></p>
<i><b>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">BS:</font></b></i> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> He's intrinsic to it. We work very closely together. We're terrific friends
and it's one of my favorite parts of the process. He's the editor and composer, the only
one in the world who does both jobs. And he only does these tasks for me, he scores for
other people but he does the most important and unglamorous job of editing just for me.
He's just terrific. There isn't a lot of preconception about the music, he cuts the
picture separate from scoring it, does his own temp tracks, his own orchestrations. He
doesn't like me to mention it, but when he did the score for <i>The Usual Suspects</i>, he
had to write the letters of the keys on the piano, he didn't know them. So he's a real
virtuoso. He's like, &quot;people won't think I'm a serious musician...&quot;</font> </p>
<i><b>

<hr size="1">

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">EC:</font></b></i> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> What about the thematic similarities between <i>The Usual Suspects</i> and <i>Apt
Pupil</i>, the covering of identity? It's almost as if you're not done talking about that
yet.</font></p>
<i><b>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">BS:</font></b></i> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> Quite frankly, I don't think I'll ever be done talking about that, it
always fascinates me, the face behind the face behind the face. I love the idea of things
not always being what they seem. To me that's an incredibly exciting notion to either
center a picture around or to at least incorporate into the pictures that you're making,
for me that's something that just fascinates me. Every day, when you look at life, there's
always a Verbal Kint passing you on the street.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What did somebody say the other day? I read a review of this movie on an internet site,
because they had seen it like on videotape or something, probably with microphones
bouncing in and the wrong aspect ratio. I read this review and the guy got so into it that
at the end he wrote this funny thing, he wrote &quot;Who are the scariest people? Old
people! Be afraid of them, when you're walking home at night. You know why? Because
they're the most dangerous, horrifying people. Why? Because they have nothing to
lose!&quot; And that was so scary, because that's what the book does, this indictment of
age, decrepitness, the fingers, the nicotine on the teeth and fingernails, the
alcoholism... I really love that stuff, I pushed that in the movie. I said to Ian,
&quot;You're knocked out, you're lying there, there's your bourbon, the cartoons are on,
you're just this disheveled creature. You're still an alcoholic as the movie goes on,
you're just a different kind of alcoholic.&quot;</font></p>
<i><b>

<hr size="1">

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">EC:</font></b></i> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> Did you at some point plan some erotic tension between the two of them?</font></p>
<i><b>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">BS:</font></b></i> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> I never intended any between the two characters, but there is a smattering
of that with the guidance counselor [David Schwimmer] and the homeless guy [Elias Koteas],
which can be kind of interesting...</font></p>
<i><b>

<hr size="1">

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">EC:</font></b></i> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> Did McKellen want to play that up or play that down? Did you discuss that
with him?</font></p>
<i><b>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">BS:</font></b></i> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> No, he had no desire, he wanted whatever I wanted.</font></p>
<i><b>

<hr size="1">

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">EC:</font></b></i> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> Did you want him to play the character potentially with gay overtones?</font></p>
<i><b>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">BS:</font></b></i> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> No, not at all, I don't think so, no. In fact he played it very straight,
and that made the one scene where he falsely seduces the homeless guy quite disturbing.
It's almost like &quot;why are you doing that, that's not what you are.&quot;</font> </p>
<i><b>

<hr size="1">

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">EC: </font> </b></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">Have you seen that great film he co-wrote and co-produced, <i>Richard III</i>?</font></p>
<i><b>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">BS:</font></b></i> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> That was actually a hindrance, as he'd done the uniform and that whole
thing. The performance is wonderful, of course. The difference is in that movie, he was a
dictator, a tyrant who killed no one himself, who ordered death and basically operated out
of fear and paranoia. This is a different character, a very different character. Here,
he's just getting started...again.</font></p>
<i><b>

<hr size="1">

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">EC:</font></b></i> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> You mentioned The X-Men; how's that project coming along, what shape is it
taking?</font></p>
<i><b>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">BS:</font></b></i> <font face="Verdana" size="2"> It's about these unlikely and reluctant superheroes who are cursed, if you
will, with these powers. They experience a lot of prejudice while defending a world that
might condemn them. Yeah, I'm excited about it. I visited the set of <i>Titanic</i> in
Mexico, I went to the set of <i>Star Wars</i> in London, which was neat, a neat
experience. I talked a lot with Lucas, Spielberg and Cameron as well as the heads of all
these special effects companies. We've done an enormous amount of research and I'm really,
really looking forward to being able to expand my imagination beyond the confines of
police precincts and small houses.</font></p>
