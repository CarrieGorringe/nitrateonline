<p>As is well-known by now, this new version of <i>101</i> is a live-action version of the
much-beloved animated classic from 1961, and I admit to having had many suspicions, not to
mention outright trepidation, over what this remake might accomplish. How can one
effectively accomplish the conversion of a cartoon into a live-action film without
surrendering many of the cartoon-like features, especially the limitless sense of movement
and visual formations, that made the original so magical? The result of all this
tinkering, admittedly, is somewhat uneven overall, but has some truly remarkable moments. </p>

<p>The weaknesses, surprisingly, generally don&#146;t come about from the transition from
animation to live-action via special effects; many of the recreations cast a fine sense of
illusion and &quot;realism;&quot; only one computer-matched shot, of a puppy emerging from
a drain pipe, looks really clumsily executed, and it&#146;s not on screen long enough to
detract from the cumulative effect. Instead, the film is weakest when it dwells upon the
lives of Roger and Anita. For whatever reason, both Daniels and Richardson, so fine in
other performances, simply don&#146;t generate enough enthusiasm here for audiences to
fall in love with them; their initial &quot;meet-cute&quot; and subsequent relationship
has a pall of blandness about it that threatens to cast a similar pall over the rest of
the film. In particular, Richardson&#146;s portrayal of Anita is characterized initially
by an excess of emotional constraint, as if the actress is hesitant about investing
herself in the role; unfortunately, she never really loosens up enough throughout the
course of the film to provide the necessary spark of authenticity required by the
lightening-quick development of the relationship between Roger and Anita. Joan Plowright
attempts to brighten things up overall, but, given the limited constraints around her
character, she is soon reduced to two modes of expression: happy fussiness and panicked
fussiness. The sweetness here is so sticky, and, at times, so patently false, that you
could drown in it -- not an uncommon situation in traditional Disney products; since this
film&#146;s pedigree dates from the immediate post-Walt period, it&#146;s not surprising
that it retains elements of this overbearing sentimentality.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the filmmakers preserved that second most important of traditions in
Disney films: great villains and comic henchmen that can act as a counterpoint to all of
the sweetness and light. Nothing could have been more effective in this case than to
render Cruella&#146;s personality more vibrant than the two-dimensional cels on which she
originally sat (and she wasn&#146;t all that milquetoast to begin with). In this version,
Cruella is more than simply an evil means to a happy ending. and, as the villainous center
of the piece, Close is absolutely magnificent, Dahling. Screenwriter Hughes helps the
cause along by giving Close much of the best dialogue and many excellent situational
setups. Close&#146;s performance obviously owes much to her recent Tony-winning portrayal
of Norma Desmond on Broadway; it also suggests images of the outrageous Tallulah Bankhead
in her campiest period during the 1960s, especially in Close&#146;s vocal phrasings that
act as an homage to the breathlessly languorous and insolent drawl that rolled from
Bankhead&#146;s mouth. It was refined, but with a hint of depravity never far from the
surface (a symbolic advertisement, perhaps, for the outrageous life of the actress
herself), and its inclusion here gives Cruella&#146;s character just the right flavoring
for an arch villain. Indeed, the tone is set from the very beginning of the film when the
lady hisses with sardonic disdain at an unfortunate assistant, &quot;What kind of a
sycophant are you?&quot; After a few false starts, the factotum finally manages to
stammer, &quot;What kind of sycophant would you like me to be?&quot; Yet, Close never
indiscriminately devours her role to the point of cannibalism, though she flirts with the
possibility just often enough to make things interesting; instead, she responds by
savoring every syllable provided as if it were the finest caviar, and then spitting them
out with malicious glee. Close is also amply assisted by Oscar-winning costume designer
Anthony Powell who, along with Rosemary Burrows, has clad the nasty Ms. De Vil in clothes
as angular and ice-cold as her personality; never before has fur seemed so uninviting
(except, perhaps, to a PETA member), nor has the expression &quot;bad hair day&quot; ever
been so aptly demonstrated (courtesy of Paul Huntley&#146;s wigs). This De Vil is
malevolently De Vine. </p>

<p>In addition, there is no discounting the considerable benefits to be gained when one
fine performance is complemented (and complimented) with the addition of excellent comic
support. Laurie and Williams make a masterful pair of bumbling fools (as the butt of
nearly every evil plan that goes awry, Williams has a wonderfully plastic face on which
the most exquisite of dimwitted expressions are made manifest both before and just after
any given moment of doom), and Shrapnel is sufficiently menacing as the strong, silent and
sinister type. In sum, there are pleasures to be had from this new, and improved, <i>101
Dalmatians</i>. So, a word of advice: let the first half hour of this film wash pleasantly
over you, take pleasure in the special effects and the dalmatians, and then wait for
Cruella and co. to take over. You won&#146;t be disappointed. </p>

<p>Special note to animal lovers: Fears have been expressed that the animals used in this
film, (in particular, the puppies) were possibly subjected to abuse, no matter how
inadvertently caused. As a matter of fact, according to the filmmakers, all of the animals
were given the finest care available. Special climate-controlled shelters were
constructed, anyone working with the puppies had to undergo a stringent disinfection
process beforehand and the filmmakers worked around the puppies&#146; schedule, rather
than the other way around. In addition, the filmmakers used special effects at any time
when there was even the slightest chance that an animal would be placed in danger. If
there is any doubt in your mind as to the veracity of this report, I encourage you to see
the film for yourself. Signs of animal abuse are almost impossible to hide, no matter how
skillful the camera angles and edits, and I could not find any evidence of it in this
case. </p>
