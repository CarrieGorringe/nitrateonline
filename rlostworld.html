<p><font size="5"><strong>D</strong></font><font size="4">r. Ian Malcolm (Goldblum) has
experienced a rough four years since we last encountered him in the billion-dollar baby
known as <i>Jurassic Park</i>. After the failure of the park, Malcolm has been derided by
the media as a fraud who has spread lies about that nice multinational biotech corporation
known as Ingen whose motives for genetically engineering dinosaurs can only be as pure as
the driven snow; consequently, his professional life is in shreds, people stare at him on
the subway and laugh, etcetera, etcetera. He is saved from said morass through a summons
to Ingen&#146;s headquarters where the doddering old fool who started this genetic mess in
the first place, our old friend, Dr. John Hammond (Attenborough), informs Malcolm that
there is another cache of Ingen&#146;s dinosaurs on another one of those obscure islands,
this one named Isla Sorna. Hammond informs Malcolm that &#150; wouldn&#146;t you know it
&#150; there&#146;s been yet another &quot;little&quot; problem: these dinos have managed
to transcend their genetic engineering and have taken over the island. Unfortunately, the
island was also discovered by a rich couple, whose daughter nearly became an appetizer.
So, now, if Malcolm wouldn&#146;t mind terribly much, would he take a team of four
specialists over to the island and do a little recording for posterity, before everything
is quarantined, and save Ingen&#146;s bottom line in the process? As an additional
incentive, Hammond tells Malcolm that Malcolm&#146;s girlfriend, paleontologist Sarah
Harding (Moore), is already at the site. So Malcolm gathers up an expedition team, says
goodbye to his disgruntled teenage daughter, Kelly (an inspired performance by Chester),
and sets off for Isla Sorna with the intent of getting Harding and her team off the island
as soon as possible. </font></p>

<p><img src="images/rlostworld-1.gif" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="264" HEIGHT="165">However,
Hammond&#146;s nephew has other ideas, including a reworking of some of Dad&#146;s nuttier
plans, so he, too sends over a team of Great White Hunters to capture some animals (led by
Pete Postlethwaite, possessed of all fanatical earnestness and great gaunt cheekbones),
and, before you can sing a chorus of <i>Do You Know the Way to San Diego?</i>, everyone is
off in mad pursuit of something, whether it&#146;s an unintentional end as dino dinner or
to thwart those misguided plans that threaten Civilization As We Know It. For an added
soupcon of tension, the audience is informed that Isla Sorna is part of a chain of islands
known as the &quot;Five Deaths&quot;, so you just know that the participants&#146; paths
to salvation aren&#146;t going to be smooth. </p>

<p>Unfortunately, there is a sixth death in the offing, and that is the film itself. For
an action film, <i>Lost World</i> is surprisingly endowed with very little of it in
comparison with its on-the-edge-of-your-seat predecessor; the dinosaurs in this film may
be from the Jurassic age, but the film&#146;s pace is most assuredly a product of the Ice
Age. Glaciers move faster than does the first hour of <i>Lost World</i>. During this
introductory entr&#146;acte, Spielberg and Koepp overload the audience with superfluous
detail concerning Malcolm&#146;s personal life, as if the character was ever meant to do
anything other than to provide wryly ironic commentary about himself and/or the chaos
around him. This is not to say that Jeff Goldblum doesn&#146;t live up to the expectations
assumed of him and more, but the whole affair reeks of an attempt to elevate one of the
few holdovers from the original film into a more significant role; this is also referred
to as a gilding of the lily &#150; why should the audience care at all about
Malcolm&#146;s personal life, except in the most superficial sense? The key interest for
the audience is to get to the dinosaurs&#146; use of the invading humans as take-out food
as soon as possible, and to make the process of getting there as painfully damaging to
one&#146;s fingernails as possible. From what has taken place earlier, it is obvious that
part one of the process doesn&#146;t come off as expected. </p>

<p><img src="images/rlostworld-2.gif" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="300" HEIGHT="200">Neither, most
shockingly of all, does part two; aside from a few brief scenes to stir some interest, the
only tension the average filmgoer will derive from this film is the twitching of glutei
maximi from sheer boredom. In addition to Koepp&#146;s lackluster script (he also crafted
the dull and confused script for last year&#146;s film version of <a href="rmi.html" target="_top"><i>Mission:
Impossible</i></a>), Spielberg&#146;s direction is appallingly half-hearted; One gets the
impression that Spielberg has become bored with the genre he and George Lucas practically
revived and patented some twenty years ago; it&#146;s as if, after the critical success of
<i>Schindler&#146;s List</i>, Spielberg doesn&#146;t want to be the audience&#146;s
playmate anymore. Only the work of Postlethwaite and Goldblum provide any real center to
this film, because they are the only ones who can actually invest this ridiculous
enterprise with the appropriate amount of authenticity to make it seem plausible without
taking themselves too seriously, unlike those in charge of the production. Even the final
sequence, best described as <i>T-Rex Versus San Diego</i>, is not only inexcusably silly,
but also appallingly predictable, as Spielberg and Koepp drag out threadbare parodies of <i>Speed</i>
and <i>E.T.</i> that anyone can see coming from shot one. The sequence does possess a few
trademark Spielbergian touches of nasty mischief (including one between said T-Rex and a
family dog), but the mixture of violence and humor contained therein, and in the rest of
the film, is so sour and so sluggishly executed that it can inspire little more than
forced laughter. In the film&#146;s defense, it can be said that the special effects have
gotten better, but, without the skillful interspersing of scenes carefully crafted to
extract the maximum amount of perspiration from the filmgoer, the entire exercise is one
in futility and a waste of time.</p>

<p>Finally, there is a significance to the cumbersome nature of the title affixed to this
film, one which suggests less a lack of originality than an attempt to link <i>Lost World</i>
with the 1925 classic film , <i>The Lost World</i>, which also had dinosaurs (courtesy of
special effects pioneer Willis O&#146;Brien); despite its now-primitive look, overly
melodramatic acting and stilted dialogue (as read from intertitles), still has the power
to generate a great deal of excitement and wonder for one reason: one senses
O&#146;Brien&#146;s joy in the exercising of his craft. Given the anemic and joyless
offering from Koepp and Spielberg, there really is no danger of such confusion occurring
between the two films.</p>
