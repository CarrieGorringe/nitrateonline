<p><big><big>&quot;<strong>T</strong></big>hings get very complicated here very
quick,&quot; announces acerbic Lolita Dedee Truitt (Christina Ricci, all growed up)
moments into this trenchant social satire from writer-(first time) director Don Roos, who
scripted <i>Single White Female</i> (1992) as well as the woefully underrated <i>Boys on
the Side</i> (1995) and 1992's <i>Love Field</i> (he also wrote that dreadful 1996 Sharon
Stone remake of <a href="rdiabol.html" target="_top"><i>Les Diaboliques</i></a>, but hey, everyone's
gotta eat). One of the freshest &quot;little&quot; movies of the summer, <i>The Opposite
of Sex</i> is at once shockingly funny and resolutely original, an outspoken antidote to
the cardboard characters and safe stories that proliferate this time of year at the
googolplexes; call this the opposite of sucks.</big></p>

<p>Dedee's not kidding about the complexity of the plot. In the rapid-fire first four
minutes of the film (get to the theater on time), she runs away from her mother in
Louisiana and plants herself at the Indiana house of her gay, independently wealthy
half-brother Bill (Martin Donovan) and his boyfriend Matt (Ivan Sergei). She's soon
seducing Matt, trading barbs with the tightly-wrapped Lucia (Lisa Kudrow) &#150; brother
of Bill's former lover, &quot;Tom-the-dead-guy&quot; &#150; and setting in motion a chain
of events that would be tragic if they weren't so funny. Bill is forced to resign in the
face of (untrue) allegations of molesting former student Jason (Johnny Galecki), the
now-pregnant Dedee persuades Matt to steal ten thousand dollars from Bill (while she
swipes &quot;Tom-the-dead-guy&quot;'s ashes) and the ensuing chase leads to Los Angeles
and beyond. Joining the crowd is Sheriff Carl Tippett (Lyle Lovett), who finds himself
falling for the constantly kvetching Lucia. And what about Dedee's twangy high school
boyfriend Randy (William Lee Scott)? How does he fit in?</p>

<p><img src="images/roppositeofsex-1.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">Roos'
resolutely outrageous script is a model of what might be called, for lack of a better
term, postmodern screwball. Taking on virtually every topic that's been pc'd to death in
contemporary society, Dedee's malicious musings include meditations on sex (&quot;if you
don't breathe in, a person can do anything for ten minutes&quot;), marriage (&quot;sex
always ends in kids, or disease, or like, you know, relationships&quot;), same-sex
domesticity (&quot;gays love houses&quot;), propagation of the species (&quot;cute, stupid
people survive with lots of cute, stupid babies who also survive; it was like watching
evolution at work&quot;) dead-end jobs (&quot;you know how hard it is to get fired from
Kinko's; it's like the post office, you practically have to start shooting people&quot;)
AIDS (&quot;I mean, I could drink out of the same cup or something&quot;), and much, much
more. It's almost as if Roos kept a notebook, storing up observations on things he
probably think people tiptoe around instead of addressing through frankness and humor.</p>

<p>Perhaps the film's biggest gamble is Dedee's omniscient narration, which comes across
as a blend of distaff Holden Caulfield (&quot;If you're one of those people who don't like
movies where some person you can't see talks the whole time, and covers up all the holes
in the plot, and at the end says 'I was never the same after that summer,' or whatever,
like it was so deep they can't stand it, then you're out of luck...&quot;) and every
overcaffeinated whiner you've ever heard (&quot;if you think I'm just plucky, and scrappy,
and all I need is love, you're in over your head. I don't have a heart of gold and I don't
grow one later, OK? But relax: there's other people a lot nicer coming up: we call them
losers&quot;). Yet Roos ties it all together with an elaborate storyline, Mason Daring's
dryly ironic jazz score and a firm grasp of the intricate checks and balances necessary to
sustain a movie in which the lead character is an unrepentant, heartless schemer. In the
end just about everyone discovers that they're looking for what Dedee calls the opposite
of sex: relationships that are stable and lasting (but don't expect a sentimental ending).</p>

<p>Ricci raw sexuality is a revelation, and she plays Dedee with frank abandon and gleeful
enthusiasm. After graduating from a Manhattan high school recently, the actress will
appear soon in a blizzard of movies, including <a href="rfllv.html" target="_top"><i>Fear and Loathing
in Las Vegas</i></a>, <i>Buffalo 66</i>, John Waters' <i>Pecker</i> (!!!), <i>Desert Blue</i>
and <i>200 Cigarettes</i>; it's hard to see how she'll top this. Recently, she was quoted
as saying &quot;I like playing people who are so afraid and ashamed of who they are and so
disgusted by everyone around them that they decide to become the ultimate extreme of what
they're afraid they are,&quot; and that's as accurate a reading of Dedee as one could
expect.</p>

<p>Donovan's deadpan reading of the nice guy/chump anchors the film in reality, while
Kudrow gives an unexpectedly intense performance as the nagging Lucia (who would
&quot;hate Phoebe, the character I play on 'Friends,'&quot;). Sergei (&quot;John Woo's
Once a Thief,&quot; <i>Dangerous Minds</i>) is a scream as the hapless, lunkheaded Matt,
sort of the switch-hitting Ralph Bellamy of the piece, while Lovett's stiff delivery is
put to good use in the context of the story. In a smaller role, Galecki (<i>I Know What
You Did Last Summer</i>, <i>Suicide Kings</i>) is memorable as the vengeful, opportunistic
gay guy who, uh, fingers Bill to the cops.</p>

<p>As everyone suffers, the omniscient Dedee (&quot;a human tabloid,&quot; someone calls
her), asserts &quot;They've never had more fun in their lives.&quot; Neither have you; in <i>The
Opposite of Sex</i>, things get very funny very quick &#150; and stay that way. </p>
