<p><font size="5"><strong>N</strong></font><font size="4">ear the beginning of <em>Striptease</em>,
the sleazy proprietor of what is euphemistically referred to as a &quot;gentlemen&#146;s
club&quot; asks one of his girls, Erin Grant (Moore) to consider participating in nude
wrestling in a pile of agricultural commodities to improve attendance. Just like Warner
Baxter giving a pep talk to Ruby Keeler in a &#145;30s Warner Bros. musical, the
proprietor assures her that the &quot;team&quot; relies on her support, except that,
unlike Keeler, Grant is not going to come out of the situation better than she went in.
&quot;You go into the corn,&quot; he tells Grant, &quot; you set a great example for the
other girls.&quot; By this time, there&#146;s been so much corn on screen that her
physical descent into the corn pile would only serve to illustrate the obviousness of the
unintentional metaphor. </font></p>

<p>But this new addition to her job description is the least of Erin&#146;s problems. She
has a deadbeat, trailer-trash husband whose main occupation is theft and who also has
custody of their daughter. To earn enough money to rectify the custody situation, Erin is
forced to work as a stripper at the &quot;Eager Beaver,&quot; becoming one of its star
attractions. In the process, she attracts the unwelcome attentions of one Congressman
Dilbeck (Reynolds), a dishonorable Member of the House who, from the looks of him, should
never have a lighter activated near his mouth at precisely the same instant he decides to
exhale. Entranced by Erin&#146;s erotic variations on the two-step, he decides to do a
little dosey-do on the stage with her, indifferent to any prospective cameramen nearby
which, thanks to the provisos of Murphy&#146;s Law and the requirements of the script, are
close at hand. </p>

<p>Soon the congressman is obsessed with finding his &quot;angel&quot; Erin, and the
congressman&#146;s aide frets that Delbeck&#146;s &quot;going psycho in a titty bar&quot;
will probably cost him votes if the incident ever comes to light. The powerful sugar
interests who pull the congressman&#146;s strings are determined to control this aspect of
his life as well, even if murder is the result (it need hardly be mentioned that Delbeck
is a Republican whose campaign centers around the deliberately undefined issue of
&quot;family values,&quot; and whose favorite extracurricular activity, aside from
pursuing Grant, is to smear himself all over with Vaseline, put on his cowboy boots and
hear his toes squishing around inside them). Meanwhile, a Lt. Garcia (Assante) has taken
an interest in the fascination of the congressman for the lovely Ms. Grant, especially
after one of her customers ends up dead following a visit to the congressman&#146;s condo.
If Erin isn&#146;t careful, she may end up being the second bird killed with the same
stone.</p>

<p>It&#146;s too easy to call this film a bust, but there really is no other word to
describe it. From an anatomical, or even a prurient perspective, there&#146;s nothing
wrong with Ms. Moore&#146;s body -- far from it. The lady&#146;s corpus is so hard that
she makes the robot Maria from <em>Metropolis</em> look like a first-class piker in the
fitness realm; indeed, the conditioning of Moore&#146;s thighs alone would merit a
five-page article in any fitness magazine (or, at the very least an article on the most
efficient method of shelling walnuts). Her skills as an ecdysiast show off said body and
the work of choreographer Marguerite Derricks to best advantage. But Ms. Moore, an actress
who seems to have lost all sense of humor in direct proportion to the amount of influence
she now possesses in Hollywood, doesn&#146;t regain it here. or much of anything else.
That&#146;s because <em>Striptease</em> has a slight problem with irreconcilable
differences, so to speak, and we&#146;re not talking about Grant&#146;s divorce decree.
Although it is obvious that Moore is desperate to elevate Carl Hiaasen&#146;s satirical
novel into a depressing tome on the sexual degradation of women, she is enough of an
exhibitionist to want to put a little seductive spin on the displays of T&amp;A (as if her
<em>Vanity Fair</em> covers weren&#146;t proof enough). It&#146;s this contradiction that
sinks the film before it ever approaches anything close to critical mass. You can&#146;t
have your cheesecake and eat it, too.</p>

<p>As the central character in this piece, Moore&#146;s work is some of the weakest in a
career not known for emotive highlights. Because she is so hell-bent upon making us feel
Erin&#146;s pain, she forgets how to make us laugh, and, to writer/director Bergman&#146;s
credit, his adaptation does contain some potentially hilarious dialogue, but Moore&#146;s
delivery of some of the funniest lines in the film fall with a rather painful and
reverberating thud. In her mouth, elements of hilarity become embarrassing remnants of
what should have been. Only when Ms. Moore interacts with her on-screen daughter (played
by her off-screen daughter, Rumer Willis) is any hint of internal fire discernible.
Unfortunately, the other thing that is discernible, on a very unintentional basis, is the
ability of the pint-sized Ms. Willis to act her mother right under the table. Only Rhames,
as the bouncer at the &quot;Eager Beaver&quot; and Reynolds are able to escape from this
mess with their dignity intact. In fact, someone must have neglected to inform Reynolds
that actually acting in this film was an option; he gives a strong performance as the
lecherous and lush-ous Delbeck, as if his professional life depended upon it (and, after
his recent tabloid woes, it most certainly did). If you want to understand how badly <em>Striptease</em>
fails to fulfill its promises to the audience, watch Reynolds and Rhames, and ignore
everyone else. </p>

<p><em>Striptease</em> is a film that might be best referred to as an anomaly: it&#146;s a
comedy that isn&#146;t very funny. It was also supposed to be the film that was supposed
to demonstrate Moore&#146;s worth as an actress; the return in the latter case is as
skimpy as her dancing clothes. The plot has even less going on under the surface, a not
uncommon complaint with films released this summer. But the action films have a real
advantage over <em>Striptease</em>; in the former case, there&#146;s always something
intriguing to watch.</p>
