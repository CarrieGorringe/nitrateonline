<p><big><strong><big>N</big></strong>ever less than involving, contemporary Irish films

Norway's <a href="fberlin98-5.html#Junk-Mail" target="_top"><i>Junk Mail</i></a>, the Austrian thriller <a href="ftiff97-3.html#Funny_Games" target="_top"><i>Funny Games</i></a>) that have been providing strong
alternatives to suffocating Hollywood fare &#150; <i>I Went Down</i> is a slight but
memorable twist on the mismatched buddy movie that parlays the engaging good will of its
leads to overcome the predictable trajectory of the underworld story.</big></p>

<p>Having been abruptly dumped by his girlfriend Sabrina (Antoine Byrne) while in prison,
the mournful Git (newcomer Peter McDonald) pops round the pub upon his release to check
out his competition, Anto (David Wilmot), only to run afoul of local Dublin crime boss Tom
French (Tony Doyle, <i>Circle of Friends</i>). Doing penance for his affront, Git is
paired with the menacing Bunny Kelly (Brendan Gleeson, <i>The Butcher Boy</i>) and
dispatched to Cork in search of &quot;The Friendly Face&quot; (Donal O'Kelly, <i>The Van</i>),
who will in turn lead them to Frank Grogan (Peter Caffrey, <i>Criminal Conversations</i>),
a former confederate of French who has stolen a great deal of money from him.</p>

<p>Nothing, however, proceeds according to plan: As tightly wrapped as Git is reticent,
the borderline pyschotic Bunny manages to steal a series of malfunctioning cars that cause
them to miss their meeting with &quot;The Friendly Face.&quot; Rebounding admirably, they
finally locate Grogan, who turns out to be annoyingly talkative (&quot;Did you ever make
love to a gangster's wife?&quot; he asks at one point. &quot;You can't really enjoy
yourself.&quot;).</p>

<p>After a series of convoluted adventures &#150; including a daring rescue, a klutzy
romantic interlude and lots of talk &#150; during which the mismatched pair form an
improbable bond of convenience, they survive the final bloody showdown between French and
Grogan (and presumably their own conflicting personalities) to emerge wiser and even a
little richer than when they began.</p>

<p>The movie is punctuated with increasingly ironic intertitles (&quot;a daring
rescue!,&quot; &quot;the value of an education&quot;), a device that can often backfire
but here serves to reassure the audience that <i>I Went Down</i> is at heart a
good-natured comedy. Many Irish films come from writers prominent in other circles
(novels, the stage), and such is the case with screenwriter Conor McPherson, who took an
MA in Philosophy from University College Dublin in 1991 and has written over a dozen plays
for his own Fly By Night Productions and others &#150; including &quot;This Lime Tree
Bower,&quot; which began as a BBC Radio 4 drama, is scheduled to be mounted off-Broadway
this fall and will become his feature film directing debut project. Sharp-eyed viewers can
also catch his wordless cameo as a red-jacketed would-be ladykiller in one of <i>I Went
Down</i>'s inevitable pub scenes.</p>

<p>Director Paddy Breathnach gives the film a satisfying balance of peculiarity and
propulsion, avoiding self-consciousness in the well-staged action scenes yet providing
enough space for the actors to savor the florid script. The film began as &quot;very
plot-driven,&quot; he told Sight and Sound, &quot;but as we went on the humor began to
emerge.&quot; An emergence stimulated, no doubt, by the scene-stealing performance of
Gleeson, who plays Bunny as a mad cross between Guy Kibbee and Udo Kier, with a bit of the
old Elvis thrown in for the hell of it. McDonald holds his own as a fine foil to Bunny's
idiosyncrasies (the latter loves chocolate and moves his lips while he reads), while
Caffrey's off-the-wall monologues are a scream and Doyle's chilling menace grounds the
film in a tangible genre reality.</p>

<p>Another sign of the film's adherence to current genre demands is the atmospheric
blues-based score, which includes Buddy Guy's &quot;We're Ready,&quot; Junior Wells'
&quot;Chitlin Con Carne Alternate&quot; and a handful of King Curtis tunes but makes room
for songs by The Magnetic Fields, Sergio Mendes Brazil '77, The High Llamas, Revelino,
Lir, and even the Golden Earring chestnut &quot;Radar Love.&quot;</p>

<p>If there's anything wrong with <i>I Went Down</i> (other than the often impenetrable
patois) it is the derivative nature of the tale, which summons up not only the inevitable
Tarantino comparison (seemingly every national cinema has taken a crack at the genre,
including an annoying but immensely popular German movie called <i>Knockin' On Heaven's
Door</i>), but such disparate but predictable recent American movies as <i>Midnight Run</i>,
<i>Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead</i> and, of course, <i>Reservoir Dogs</i>. But
what sets <i>I Went Down</i> apart from the pack is the same cocky confidence found in its
characters. Any gangster movie that opens with a quote from Plato's Republic (for the
record: &quot;I went down yesterday to the Piraeus with Glaucon the son of Ariston&quot;)
and builds its plot around a few satisfyingly plausible explanations of its title
immediately sets itself apart from the pack and demands inclusion on any discerning
moviegoers must-see list for the summer season. </p>
