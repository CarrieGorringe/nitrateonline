<p><font size="5">T</font><font size="4">hat contemporary American society is far enough
along some bizarre cultural path to create a movie which can be described as a dour
pastiche of serial killer movie clichés is a thought to give anyone pause, but there you
go: sort of a <i>Phantom of the Silence of the Usual Manhunter Copycat Lambs</i>, <i>Kiss
the Girls</i> is so severely derivative of these and a handful of other top-notch movie
and not-so-top-notch television thrillers that even those who don't normally groove on
figuring out whodunnit will have no trouble identifying the sadistic but rather
half-heartedly fey &quot;Casanova&quot; killer (&quot;<i>kiss</i> me,&quot; he breathes
about twice &#150; thus the title), who collects young, strong-willed female victims in
some sort of underground antebellum torture chamber and kills the ones who become too
feisty (hint: these kinds of movies are seldom built around characters played by actors
with low billing). Positing <a href="rseven.html" target="_top"><i>Seven</i></a> as a seven, <i>Kiss the
Girls</i> is no more than a three &#150; and only that much because both Morgan Freeman
and Ashley Judd give their impressive alls to roles that lack both dimension and
motivation.</font></p>

<p>Not that you'd know it from the sketchy exposition &#150; unless, of course, you'd read
James Patterson's source novel, probably while imprisoned on a wide-body somewhere over
the Atlantic &#150; but the film revolves around Washington, D.C.-based Dr. Alex Cross
(Freeman), a widower and supposedly brilliant forensic pathologist who takes it personally
and hard when his niece Naomi (Gina Ravera) turns up missing from her college dormitory in
North Carolina.</p>

<p>Cross apparently has powers of intuition in matters concerning murders and stuff (he
can look <i>very</i> pensive when he wants to), but as he arrives at the New South's
so-called Research Triangle to assist in an investigation that now encompasses seven other
missing women and two bodies, he discovers that the laconic local constabulary, lead by
Chief Hatfield (Brian Cox) and detectives Nick Ruskin (Cary Elwes) and Davey Sikes (Alex
McArthur), seem long in sinister southern fake charm but obviously want to delay him from
profiling until at least the millennium.</p>

<p><img src="images/rkiss-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="162">Complicating matters
for both protagonist and audience are peripheral characters Agent Kyle Craig (Jay O.
Sanders) from the F.B.I, Naomi's hostile boyfriend Seth Samuel (Richard T. Jones) and
Priapean professor Wick Sachs (William Converse-Roberts) &#150; all of whom may know more
than they're letting on, but probably not. Also along, presumably for veracity, is the
immediately recognizable Roma Maffia (Disclosure, Eraser, &quot;Profiler,&quot;
&quot;Chicago Hope&quot;) in her lawyer/detective/cop/doctor authority figure mode (she's
a commanding presence, but desperately needs a change of pace).</p>

<p>Cross' status changes abruptly when supposedly brilliant medical intern &#150; doesn't
this stuff ever happen to normal, non-brilliant people? &#150; Kate McTiernan (Ashley
Judd) is abducted by the killer. Using her kickboxing skills (!!!) to escape the
white-masked killer's well-hidden underground lair (no, it isn't under the Durham opera
house), she verifies in a press conference that the other women (including Cross' niece)
are alive and being held captive.</p>

<p>Since in movies like this Every Moment Counts, Cross and McTiernan Must Join Forces to
track the killer (or killers) on a journey that takes them to Los Angeles and the
suspicious activities of Dr. Will Rudolph (Tony Goldwyn). They are aided there by Sampson
(Bill Nunn) and Henry Castillo (Jeremy Piven), who might be cops or in Sampson's case
might be related to Cross but by the fifth reel who knows? Then it's back to North
Carolina and the inevitable atmospheric showdown with the killer, which in this day and
age requires not only at least one fakeout ending but a final showdown with a spunky but
wounded woman, a senseless justification speech from the felon and some fancy marksmanship
that metes out brutal but deserving justice.</p>

<p><img src="images/rkiss-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="186">There's more
backstory in the above than you'll find in the movie. Cross' motivations are obscure in
the extreme, as he's shown at the beginning of the film boxing with presumably inner-city
youth (following a shot of D.C.'s toney Georgetown waterfront!) and spouting exposition in
a quickly-sketched family scene &#150; neither one of which is ever referred to again.
Similarly, Kate McTiernan could just as easily be the head of the hospital as an intern,
for all the information provided. And by the time the two finally band together, all logic
flies out the window as a pseudo-cop and a civilian apparently are able to commandeer an
entire investigation while apparently living together with no embarrassment or discomfort
in a series of huge hotel rooms. If this weren't enough, the filmmakers add insult to
injury by breaking the cardinal rule of honest exposition: the killer has no backstory
whatsoever, and a key character is introduced after about the third reel.</p>

<p>Hooey on such an epic scale can be (and often is) embraced by an adoring public, but in
this case it'll be no sale for sure: exacerbated by a script that is both shallow and
distracted, and cluttered with characters who serve no discernable purpose, the film spins
its wheels hopelessly in an attempt to create some sort of tension. That it feels so
comfortable lifting plot elements wholesale from such revered genre touchstones as <i>Manhunter</i>
(the secluded house invasion), <i>The Phantom of the Opera</i> (sadist as masked tortured
soul), <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i> (seductively creepy killer with demented taste vs.
dogged good guy &#150; er, gal &#150; with intellect and gumption), <i>The Usual Suspects</i>
(the key hint is in front of everybody on a wall full of case-related paperwork) and <i>Copycat</i>
(uh, it copies stuff from other killers) is at first faintly reassuring, then annoying and
finally intolerable. Better to rent all of the above (along with the incomparable <i>Seven</i>)
and have a serial killer film festival, if that's what sharpens your cleaver.</p>

<p>All that said no movie is completely without appeal, even <i>Kiss the Girls</i>: as
perfunctory and ridiculous as things get, Freeman and Judd sell it well with performances
of focused intensity. Movies like this depend on a ruminative authority figure whose life
can be read in lines of worry upon the face, and in this Freeman is virtually without peer
in contemporary American cinema. As with his William Somerset in <i>Seven</i>, Freeman's
Alex Cross is awash in an uneasy mixture of melancholy and regret, seasoned with an
intellect and dogged sense of justice that won't allow sleep until resolution.</p>

<p>At first given less than nothing to work with, Judd doggedly carves a soul out of her
one-dimensional character, whose abduction, flight through the woods and subsequent
remorse over the perceived abandonment of the other prisoners give this emotionless movie
something eloquently human to identify with. As to the rest of the cast, they're not even
given enough to struggle valiantly with &#150; and the movie even wastes the sly
opportunity of casting the original Hannibal Lecter, esteemed British character actor
Brian Cox (see <i>Manhunter</i>), as a lawman by giving him a fine genre setup &#150;
pipe-sucking southern gentleman &#150; followed by nothing to do.</p>

<p><img src="images/rkiss-3.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="162">Director Gary
Fleder, whose freshman effort <i>Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead</i> was also a
case of more visual promise than narrative result, retained much of his behind-the-scenes
craftspeople for his sophomore slump: production designer Nelson Coates has mixed
authentic North Carolina and California locations with truly frightening manufactured
interiors to spectacular effect, while cinematographer Aaron Schneider has graduated from
camera operator to create an authentically creepy and palpably dank widescreen palette. </p>

<p>But as with <i>Things</i>, Fleder exercises a great deal of style in pursuit of an
utterly empty story. Having not read the source novel, a guess might still be hazarded
that the culprit here is neophyte screenwriter David Klass, who has authored numerous
novels (&quot;Night of the Tyger,&quot; &quot;Wrestling with Honor,&quot; &quot;California
Blue,&quot; &quot;Danger Zone&quot;) but apparently has never had a script produced prior
to this. Although the tired story placed him at a disadvantage from the opening bell,
clearing away much of the character clutter in favor of some solid motivation would have
gone a long way towards providing some sorely lacking luster.</p>

<p>Veteran co-producer Joe Wizan remembers that &quot;this was not your typical suspense
novel. Something suddenly happened in the plot to take it into another orbit, and it
became a spellbinding thriller.&quot; Regrettably, that something appears to have been
left out of the film, and the resulting product (with all the soullessness that word
connotes) is not only in a much lower orbit, spellbinding-wise, but is proof positive that
a good little airplane read doesn't automatically translate to the big movie screen. </p>
