<p><font size="5" face="Times,Times New Roman"><strong>A</strong></font><font size="4" face="Times,Times New Roman">nchored by an extraordinary leading performance by Emily
Watson, making a film debut of ferocious passion and mesmerizing intensity, <em>Breaking
the Waves</em> is the fifth feature film from director Lars von Trier, whose <em>Zentropa</em>
was a solid art-house hit a few years back. Winner of the Grand Jury Prize at the 1996
Cannes Film Festival, <em>Breaking the Waves</em> has cemented the director's
international reputation as a filmmaker of natural, prodigious talent. Should the magical
spell woven by its overheated melodrama--a not-unpleasant Sirkian rhythm capable of
sucking in even the most staunch resister of the genre -- find a receptive audience in the
United States, the resulting popularity could signal a revival of the form.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">In early seventies Scotland, the pious, defiant,
young Bess (Emily Watson) goes against the strict Calvinist teachings of the town elders
to marry Jan (Stellan Skarsgård), a strapping worker on the offshore oil rig. Their
marriage is solid until, in time, Jan must return to work. A virgin when they wed, the
deeply religious Bess is now distraught with physical and spiritual hunger, pleading with
God (with whom she carries on a constant prayerful dialogue) to return Jan to her. After a
paralyzing accident does just that, Bess begins an agonizing downward spiral from saint to
martyr when she struggles to honor Jan's firm request: find lovers, spend time with them,
and describe the encounters in detail. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">At first horrified, Bess reluctantly agrees, only to
draw her faithful sister-in-law Dodo (Katrin Cartlidge, from Mike Leigh's Naked and Milcho
Manchevski's Before the Rain) and Jan's doctor (Adrian Rawlins) into her awful quest. The
genre demands tragedy, and soon Bess, cast out and humiliated, meets her humiliating fate
even as Jan miraculously heals.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">For the London-born Watson, her casting was an act
of faith on von Trier's part comparable to the choices made by her character, Bess:
&quot;The scenes are so emotional, so on the edge, that I had to become swept away by the
character's passion and put my trust in Lars that he was guiding us all in the right
direction. It's too hard to stand outside Bess and judge her, as an actress. There has to
be a commitment to Bess' passion. It's not easy, but it is rewarding.&quot; Von Trier
concurs. &quot;We had auditions with many young actresses,&quot; he remembers, &quot;But
as soon as I saw Emily on tape I knew that we had found Bess. Emily has a face that
expresses an enormous range of emotion; a face that you can never tire of watching. Many
of the scenes demand massive emotional investment. I myself thought it was such a shame
for Bess when I wrote this story, but the cast thinks it's even more of a shame. The
lassies who play Bess and Dodo invest an enormous amount in the film, an enormous amount.
They are wretched all day long if they have to do a sad scene at the end of the afternoon.
At the same time it's cops and robbers with feeling, and actually we're having a load of
laughs.&quot; Incredibly, in a career that now numbers five features in 12 years, <em>Breaking
the Waves</em> is von Trier's first film in English.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">&quot;Though it feels like a stunt,&quot; no less a
cultural bellwether than Leonard Maltin's Movie and Video Guide says of the visually
arresting <em>Zentropa</em>, &quot;this is a rare contemporary movie that makes one feel
privy to the reinvention of cinema.&quot; Although the subject and style are light years
away from that film, much the same is true of <em>Breaking the Waves</em>: von Trier has
such a command of the medium that what should be (and may well have been) a technical
nightmare plays effortlessly. Photographed by the great Robby Muller with a widescreen,
handheld camera strongly reminiscent to American television viewers of Jean de Segonzac's
work on Homicide:<em> Life on the Street</em>, the film has also been bleached of much of
its color. While jarring at first, the vertiginous, almost sepia mise-en-scène, combined
with the tension between Watson's florid acting and everyone else's naturalistic style
transports viewers to a world where everything is simultaneously identifiable and
completely different. Add to this the hyperreal panoramas that break up the film into
chapters and the familiar yet almost absurdly out-of-place period songs (by Mott the
Hoople, T. Rex, Thin Lizzy, Elton John and others) and the cumulative effect is of
profound dislocation, as if watching melodrama made by another civilization.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Given the story's melodramatic roots, that
otherworldly feel is just as well. &quot;The strength of my films is that they are easy to
mock, and that's how it should be,&quot; von Trier told an interviewer during location
filming in Scotland. &quot; I have a lot of respect for people you can mock.&quot; The
conversation, reprinted by the film's American distributor in the domestic presskit,
reveals a kinder, gentler filmmaker at peace with himself and completely focussed on the
demands and rigors of filmmaking: &quot;I think my strength is that I am so madly
convinced of the qualities in what I do.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Not everyone is. The film von Trier made between <em>Zentropa</em>
and <em>Breaking the Waves</em>, The Kingdom, is a maddening and derivative opus made for
Danish television on the mystical doings in a Stockholm hospital that uses many of the
same filmmaking techniques as his new work but feels for all the world like a tedious
retread and blending of <em>Twin Peaks</em> with <em>E.R.</em> And at four and a half
hours, it is an unpleasant reminder of a bizarre subgenre in which foreign television
serials are spliced together for the American art-house market. Call it the Cinema of
Endurance.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Yet many of the qualities that make <em>The Kingdom</em>
virtually unendurable are, in <em>Breaking the Waves</em>, virtues. Von Trier himself
admits that &quot;the philosophy for my other films has been 'Evil Exists.' The philosophy
for this one is 'Goodness Exists.'&quot; Despite Bess' ultimate sacrifice, von Trier is
adamant about the film's ultimate message: &quot;There are no bad guys, only
misunderstandings.&quot; Faithfull to vintage melodrama yet presented in a new and
memorable way, <em>Breaking the Waves</em> is a love story of substance, craft and lasting
impact.</font></p>
