admirers of Wesley Snipes, or just plan aching to see some action after the disappointing <a href="ravengers.html" target="_top"><i>The Avengers</i></a>. <a href="rh20.html" target="_top"><i>Halloween: H20</i></a>
has just about disappeared from your local multiplex and <i>Blade </i>picks up the slack.
Call it the pent-up action demand; it doesn&#146;t have to be good, it&#146;s just got to
move. Possible ad line: &quot;It&#146;s a Marvel it&#146;s made!&quot;</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman"><img src="images/rblade-1.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">In adapting the 25-year-old comic strip to the big screen, the producers,
director Stephen Norrington, writer David S. Goyer (<a href="rdarkcity.html" target="_top"><i>Dark City</i></a>),
and star Snipes are going for the jugular, in much the same manner as <a href="rspawn.html" target="_top"><i>Spawn</i></a>, <i>Steel</i>, <a href="rbarbwir.html" target="_top"><i>Barb Wire</i></a>,
and <i>Judge Dredd</i>, several of the more recent efforts adapted from what we used to
call the funny pages. There&#146;s no charm here and not much laughter, just relentless
meat and potatoes, and not too much of the latter. Snipes cuts a dashing figure as the
half-man, half-vampire (&quot;The power of an immortal. The soul of a human. The heart of
a hero. Yada, yada, yada.&quot;), but his no-nonsense attitude makes the character a
one-dimensional undead-slaying machine. My son, a comic book aficionado, tells me that
this role was made for Snipes. I guess the star felt the same way, as he&#146;s also one
of the film&#146;s producers. The typical patrons distributor New Line and Norrington, an
seasoned effects and music-video director on a sophomore binge (after his low-budget <i>Death
Machine</i> four years ago), are after are the older teenage through 30s crowd (males for
the destructive energy, females for Wesley), and what a perfect time to release the
film--the tail end of summer vacation&#133;kids still out of school. We critics may be
complaining, but Snipes is having a fine laugh on the way to the bank.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">Basically Blade and his aging sidekick Whistler (Kris
Kristofferson, also seen in <a href="rdance.html" target="_top"><i>Dance With Me</i></a>, but with or
without make-up, neither performance much to talk about) team up with Karen Jensen, a
convenient hematologist rescued from a vampire&#146;s dastardly incision and enlisting
herself to find a medical cure for the &quot;retro-virus.&quot; <img src="images/rblade-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">Strange how she manages to
&quot;borrow&quot; hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of equipment and instantly
relocate it among Blade&#146;s industrial warehouse hideout. Bet if she had time,
she&#146;d float an IPO for financial backing. Our hero, infected pre-birth way back in
1967 when a vampire contaminated his mother, is raised since a teenager by Whistler, who
has his own sad tale. The pair had been concocting a special serum to control Blade&#146;s
blood hunger, while also manufacturing silver bullets and spikes, essence of garlic mace,
and other techno-vamp weapons, when the new gal on the block joins their party in the
ferocious fight (supplemented with numerous digital special effects and swooshing saber
swings). The triumvirate face off against punk renegade &quot;suckhead&quot; leader Deacon
Frost (Stephen Dorff) and his ghoulish goons, among them the crispy fried and surly
multiple-re-amputee Quinn (Donal Logue) and flatulent blob Pearl (Eric Edwards), a Jabba
the hut clone, and the &quot;familiars,&quot; support-staff Renfields hoping for a
sideways promotion. An ingenious sort, Frost simultaneously matches wits with Blade, plots
against his pure masters (including Udo Kier, a staple of numerous 1970s Italian horror
films but left for dead until current resurrection), and unravels ancient vampiric texts
to awaken a primitive blood god. Eventually all met for the bloodfight at the Temple of
Eternal Night (and for Blade a family reunion), although the good doctor seemingly takes a
back seat to most of the action.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times New Roman">The production design by Kirk Petruccelli is slick urban
disco dark layered on a paper-strewn cityscape, but not as enjoyable or edgy as the
settings for 1994&#146;s <i>The Crow</i>, that still my favorite film of the
made-from-a-comic-book genre. Over-glossed and done to death, <i>Blade</i> leaves us
(unfortunately) with a &quot;Let&#146;s get out of here!&quot; and the usual open-door,
sequel-begging, ending with the crimson-drenched hero relocating to Moscow for another
spiritual cleansing. As if the fall of the Russian ruble wasn&#146;t enough to scare the
locals over there.</font></p>
