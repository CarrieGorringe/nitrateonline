<p><big><big><strong>T</strong></big>he legacy of the horror movie sequel was nicely
summed up in <i>Scream</i> by Jaime Kennedy&#146;s film geek character: more bodies, more
elaborate deaths, more gore. It&#146;s nice to see that Steve Miner, Kevin Williamson,
Jamie Lee Curtis and company have taken the high road in <i>Halloween H20</i>. They know
their conventions, but rather than take the self-aware <i>Scream</i> route, <i>H20</i>
returns to an almost slasher film purity: innocent horror movie fun , a lean, sharp thrill
ride that delivers scares rather than gore. It&#146;s the best <i>Halloween</i><b> </b>film
since the original and the smartest horror film to come along in quite some time.</big></p>

<p><img src="images/rh20-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">Jamie Lee Curtis is
Keri Tate, headmistress of a posh California private school, but Keri Tate is Laurie
Strode, the survivor of the Haddonfield, Illinois, Halloween massacre twenty years ago.
She faked her death and gave herself a new identity and a new life. Twenty years later her
horror still lives on. After waking up from a particularly ghastly nightmare (Michael
Myers trapping her in a closet) we find out the terror doesn&#146;t end at dawn. She sees
him everywhere: reflected in mirrors, lurking in the distance, stepping out from around
corners, and in one particularly effective scene walking up the street right at her,
refusing to go away even as she closes her eyes to will the apparition away. A single mom
with a 17 year old sick to death of her &quot;unreasonable&quot; fears she&#146;s turned
to the bottle, a secret alcoholic trying to lose herself in a drunken haze. </p>

<p>But I get ahead of myself. The film begins with Nurse Marion Chambers (Nancy Stephens
reprising her role from the first two films) returning home from work to find her house
broken into. In the office is a wall full of clippings and notes on the dreaded
Haddonfield murders twenty years before, along with a newspaper article on Laurie&#146;s
death in a car accident (the only reference to a <i>Halloween </i>outside the first two --
in number <i>4</i><b> </b>that death is reported). The house belonged to Dr. Loomis (the
late Donald Pleasance, whose voice returns in a wonderful tribute over the opening
credits), the fearless psychiatrist that chased Michael through five films (three of those
don&#146;t count, of course, and his files have been ransacked -- including, we suspect,
the true story of Laurie&#146;s &quot;death.&quot;</p>

<p>Well, no surprise the burglar is Michael and Miner uses the sequence to tease us --
which is just what it feels like, a playful bit of jest as expectations are built higher
and higher while we wait for the knife to fall. For the next half hour or so the script
resorts to the standard rules of slasher movie set-up: establish potential victims, lay in
the necessary number of coincidences to leave them sitting ducks (in this case a weekend
long field trip which clears out the campus -- but for a few key stragglers -- on
Halloween), and beat the audience over the head with false scares and cheap shocks.</p>

<p>The kids aren&#146;t any worse than similar movie meat -- the screenplay doesn&#146;t
really give them all that much to work with -- but it&#146;s Jamie Lee Curtis that gives
this whole set-up its punch. The legacy of Laurie has provided a creepy real world
dimension to the horror fantasy, an emotionally scarred, psychically devastated survivor
for whom the nightmare never ended. Curtis invests Laurie with cutting humor and a hollow
exuberance, putting on a good show for her son John (Josh Hartnell), lover Will (Adam
Arkin), and nosy &quot;let me be maternal&quot; secretary Norma (a cute but brief
tongue-in-cheek appearance by real life mom and <i>Psycho</i> scream queen Janet Leigh).</p>

<p><img src="images/rh20-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">There&#146;s enough
in-jokes and references to keep avid thriller junkies entertained (from clips of <i>Plan 9
From Outer Space</i> and <a href="rscream.html" target="_top"><i>Scream II</i></a> to Leigh&#146;s exit
in her <i>Psycho</i>-mobile Ford Fairlane) and they zip by quickly enough not to distract
the uninitiated. But once Michael hits campus the film discards these asides to begin its
slow rollercoaster climb to an all new terror train. Miner doesn&#146;t just return to the
classic mode, he brings back the wide, wide Panavision frame that Carpenter used so well
in <i>Halloween</i>. Michael doesn&#146;t leap out of closets or hide conveniently off
screen for some cheap shock effect, he&#146;s always in the frame well before the kill
shot, whipping around corners like a Tasmanian Devil, striding up on his victims with the
tenacity of the Mummy and the pace of a race walker. Shooting down hallways that cut off
options, creating a sense of doom with walls and ceilings that seem to close in on the
protagonists, Miner uses the widescreen to create a claustrophobic atmosphere.</p>

<p>Holding it all together is the family reunion. In the film&#146;s best moment brother
and sister stare at one another through the thick glass of a locked door. The fear seems
to drain from Laurie&#146;s eyes for a moment replaced melancholy, while Michael, with his
black puppy dog eyes under a ghastly death-white mask, shows no hate or anger or anything
we&#146;d associate with a killer. He becomes even more enigmatic and terrifying because
there&#146;s nothing there to fathom. And as the stalking continues Laurie becomes a rare
horror heroine that comes to expect the unexpected. Having seen Michael rise from the dead
before she&#146;s not about to turn her back now.</p>

<p><img src="images/rh20-3.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">It&#146;s got its
problems, sure. The teenage stuff feels obligatory and still married to one cliché that
should have been dropped long ago: sexually active kids watch out, the boogeyman is going
to punish you! More than an enigma, Michael is preternaturally brilliant, traversing the
terrain of the California campus like he designed it and cutting off phone and electric
sources like a vindictive lineman. But after a rather obligatory set-up, <i>H20</i> turns
into sleek, lean thrill ride which, at only 82 minutes, it never overstays its welcome.
Instead of victims paralyzed by inaction we&#146;re given smart, capable kids who have the
gumption to stay out of basements and dead end hallways and fight back. At one point teen
cutie Molly (<i>Dawson&#146;s Creek&#146;s</i> Michelle Williams) becomes almost
incoherent with her crying, but only after she&#146;s dared to brain Michael with a rock
to rescue her boyfriend. She&#146;s earned her respite -- hell, it&#146;s the idea that
she&#146;s over it that allows her the space to fall apart.</p>
<i>

<p>H20</i> delivers a smart, slick slasher movie that treats both its characters and
audience with a modicum of respect and without the self-consciousness of <i>Scream</i>.
Shakespeare it ain&#146;t, but it works for me. </p>
