<p><font size="5"><strong>C</strong></font><font size="4">ombining familial whimsy and an
oddly tense air of melancholy in equal measure, <i>The Myth of Fingerprints</i> is a movie
sure to cast a warm spell over those prepared to enjoy the deliberately tantalizing
mysteries of a film endowed with such an appealingly inscrutable title. Reminiscent of
every family get-together that never came off as planned, it showcases a strong ensemble
cast and an elusive yet purposeful script by a first-time director who exhibits strength
and grace in equal measure. </font></p>

<p>In the days immediately preceding Thanksgiving, four children gather at the remote,
snowbound farmhouse of their parents, the broodingly eccentric Hal (Roy Scheider) and the
gentle, loving Lena (Blythe Danner) to celebrate the holiday as a family for the first
time in three years<img src="images/rmyth-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="148">.
There's Mia (Julianne Moore), a tightly-wrapped soul who is first seen on a train
aggressively making love to her Significant Other Elliot (Brian Kerwin), a clueless
intellectual who is so dim he'll spend the weekend never knowing Mia's playfully wild-eyed
younger sister Leigh (Laurel Holloman) is coming on to him. Their superficially cocky
brother Jake (Michael Vartan) also brings a lover, the bubbly and lusty Margaret (Hope
Davis), who eventually charms the family but whose <i>joi de vivre</i> serves to remind
them just how reserved they really are. And then there's the sad-eyed Warren (Noah Wyle),
a regular but terminally mopy guy who's let three years of his life trickle by pining for
Daphne (Arija Bareikis), the girlfriend he reluctantly separated from after the defining
moment &#150; shown in flashback &#150; which will fuel a central conflict of the film.
Finally, there's Leonard Morrison (James Le Gros), a childhood friend of the family who
never left town, changed his name to Cezanne for reasons never made clear, and now seems
to be able to see into Mia's soul with frightening clarity.</p>

<p>Over the course of the holiday they re-acquaint themselves with each other and grapple
with the changes that have distanced them. After a gently comic sequence in which the
first night is gradually filled with the sounds of lovemaking (much to the lonely Warren's
consternation), Mia and Leigh rekindle what appears to be an intense sibling rivalry (with
Elliot as a new pawn), Warren tracks down Daphne, and Jake and Margaret bicker.</p>

<p>The film's largest and most provocative gamble comes as the true reason for the breakup
between Warren and Daphne is revealed, and how the issue is confronted &#150; but not
really resolved. After these and other revelations, the Thanksgiving dinner itself is
almost anticlimactic, and this too reflects how these holidays really are: the long-term
truths are usually lurking in the background, not exhibited on the main stage.</p>

<p>Filmed in and around a rambling homestead in Maine (Andover and Bethel, to be precise),
the movie provides an authentic glimpse into the complex workings of a group of people
that has long since ceased to care for one another as friends and seem bound together only
by the slender thread of family. If this sounds like every wretched cliché of
Thanksgiving rolled into one, well, it is. Bookended by home movie footage that gradually
takes on added depths of meaning as the family's individual personalities are revealed,
the message is clear: you can go home again if you want to, as long as you realize that
the only thing that might not have changed all that much is the house itself.</p>

<p>Freundlich is a director satisfied with using less to tell more. &quot;This is about
the characters, not the story, &quot;he has said. &quot;If you trust that you've
established your characters well enough, I believe you can allow them to do a lot of
things that aren't directly explained in the film. A lot of the time in life, people's
behavior isn't directly understandable, or explainable. And I didn't want this movie to be
about going from point A to B to C.&quot;</p>

<p>With the one-two punch of Mia and Amber Waves, the physically substantial but
emotionally frail porno star of the upcoming <i>Boogie Nights</i>, Julianne Moore confirms
her status as the bravest actress currently at work in the movies. Equally as comfortable
with big-budget Hollywood escapist fare (<i>Assassins</i>, <a href="r9months.html" target="_top"><i>Nine
Months</i></a>, <a href="rlostworld.html" target="_top"><i>Jurassic Park: The Lost World</i></a>), <img src="images/rmyth-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="151">she has also been outstanding
in risk-taking independent fare (<i>Safe</i>, <i>Short Cuts</i>, <i>Vanya on 42nd Street</i>)
and will be seen in the upcoming Coen Brothers film <i>The Big Lebowski</i> and John
Turturro's <i>The Hand That Rocks the Cradle</i>. For <i>The Myth of Fingerprints</i> she
has created a woman who is at once domineering and completely lost in her own misery.
&quot;She doesn't know how to free herself from her anger,&quot; Moore has said.
&quot;Rather than participate, Mia sort of orbits her family. I don't know that you can
root for her and I sort of like that.&quot; It is this very attraction to characters well
beyond the mainstream, coupled with the facility to tolerate lowest-common-denominator
popular entertainments, that give her such breathtaking range. &quot;She is able to
communicate an enormous range of emotions and thoughts simply by being still,&quot;
explains Freundlich. &quot;And when she smiles, she is transformed, her entire person
changes. And that was very important.&quot; Initially nervous about confronting such a
large cast for his very first feature, Freundlich apparently overcame his apprehensions:
he and Moore are now living together in Los Angeles and expecting a child.</p>

<p>Another standout in the cast include Wyle, who remembers &quot;I had been reading a lot
of scripts, and very few have such three-dimensional characters ... Warren needs to get to
a place where he can go on living his life. A key for him getting to that place is his
relationship with Daphne.&quot; And a key to Wyle's performance is a pivotal flashback
involving his father and Daphne at a previous family gathering, a scene he plays with the
sympathetic confusion that he brings to the character of Dr. John Carter on television's
&quot;E.R.&quot; (it must've been something on the set: Wyle is now also involved with a
crew member of the film).</p>

<p>The trickiest character in the film is Hal (Scheider), who remains an unapproachable
cypher for the entire movie. &quot;I approached Hal as a combination between the written
father, my father and me,&quot;<img src="images/rmyth-3.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="149"> he explains. &quot;There is a lot of the dark side of me that is cynical and
competitive, as there was with my own father. Not many people live up to their parents'
expectations. Hal sees how frustrated his children are. He wants to tell them it doesn't
matter that much if they live up to his expectations. But he can't. He doesn't have the
equipment or the tools to sit down and talk to his children. He realizes that he is of no
use to them. He loves his children, but he's lost the capacity to tell them that. He's
left it up to his wife for too many years.&quot; Perhaps the most complex and vulnerable
character he's ever played. Scheider rises to the challenge and gives Hal a vaguely
sinister confusion that makes the character both authentic and a metaphor for every father
that can't be understood by a grown child.</p>

<p>Also worth singling out are Laurel Holloman (<i>The Incredibly True Adventures of Two
Girls in Love</i>) as the frisky Leigh, Brian Kerwin (<i>Jack</i>) as the befuddled
Elliot, whose musings on mustard provide a quirky comic relief during one dinner scene,
and James LeGros (<i>Drugstore Cowboy</i>, <i>My New Gun</i>) as the sage Cezanne, who
adds yet another distinctive character to his gallery of American originals. </p>

<p>Now, about that title: it is, apparently, taken from a Paul Simon song, &quot;All
Around the World or <i>The Myth of Fingerprints</i>,&quot; the 11th and final track on his
1986 record &quot;Graceland.&quot; As elliptical as the film, the song seems to use
fingerprints as a metaphor for the universal stamp of humanity (&quot;I've seen them all
and man/They're all the same&quot;): you can't really escape who you are and where you
come from, and this fate is shared by all of us (&quot;Well, it's not just me/And it's not
just you/This is all around the world&quot;).</p>

<p>Refreshingly, Freundlich isn't coy about illuminating this: &quot;A fingerprint points
to the fact that all these people are genetically related and, in a lot of ways, are very
similar to one another. But the children in the family have also developed very
differently from one another. The question it presents is: how much are there identities
tied to where they grew up and who was around them? And how much of their personalities
have they had to create from scratch in order to go on with their lives? That's what
fingerprints represent to me &#150; these people's identities: something that on the one
hand is genetic, and thus inherited, and yet at the same time is completely unique.&quot;</p>

<p>Ultimately, the film will be most affecting for people who not only have had to spend
the Thanksgiving holidays with unfamiliar families, but actually enjoyed trying to figure
out how those strangers related to one another. Lazy viewers need not apply, as the film
has no patience for those who demand easy narratives and sympathetic characters (however, <i>Home
for the Holidays</i> is probably still available at your local video store). By tackling
this slippery, maddeningly inconclusive topic (dealt with in different ways in at least
two other upcoming films, <i>The Ice Storm</i> and <i>The House of Yes</i>) with a steady
hand and a sublime ensemble cast, Freundlich has announced himself as a filmmaker of
perception and purpose who is unafraid of nuance and character.</p>
