<p><big><big><strong>W</strong></big>ith a bald head and wearing a simple cotton caftan,
and first seen bending to the ground to sense a sunlit area of lawn grass, Eddie Murphy
should be risible, but he's not. Playing a spiritual pilgrim, Murphy projects a perfectly
convincing blend of calmness, sincerity, and candid delight of the type that causes people
to either immediately put up their defenses, or to drop them. It's an ingratiating
performance. Unfortunately, Murphy doesn't have a movie in which to play this role.</big></p>

<p>Murphy's character is shown meeting up with a couple of TV businesspeople -- played,
agonizingly, by Jeff Goldblum and Kelly Preston -- who get him to appear on a home
shopping channel because, apparently, his demeanor will cause people to buy products. But
there's no more reason for him to go on a home shopping channel than there is for him to
appear on VH1 or CSPAN, and the movie doesn't provide one, either. (Except that someone,
somewhere, thought that home shopping channels were funny in and of themselves. They were
wrong.) Instead, the movie grinds along contriving ways by which Murphy's character
confounds everyone's expectations while dispensing simple, subtle truths. It also makes
Morgan Fairchild the victim of a grotesquely unfunny, but nonetheless prolonged, sight
gag.</p>

<p>Ploddingly directed (by Stephen Herek) from an sometimes abysmal script (by Tom
Schulman), this film, vapid and transparent, would be worth attacking if the effort didn't
seem so ultimately pointless, like pummeling a ghost.</p>
