            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>As the first wave of summer
            Hollywood blockbusters knock and stumble about in multiplexes across
            America, two new documentaries are having their theatrical premieres
            in New York City and will, hopefully, be coming soon to a town or
            screen near you. Both films provide generous amounts of interest and
            insight, the kind of thing one would want, or hope, to see from a
            movie for which you plunk down your two bits, then wrestle your way
            through the concessions stand and make it into your seat just in
            time for the lights go down and the first of seven preview trailers
            start to unreel before the main feature makes an appearance.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In <i>W.I.S.O.R.</i>, a group of
            engineers take on a challenging but seemingly feasible project:
            design, make and implement a robotic device that could perform the
            type of basic maintenance work in the New York City underground
            steam pipe system which would normally require a team of workers to
            dig up the pavement and snarl traffic all over the city. The New
            York steam system was first put into place over a hundred years ago
            (as seen in historical footage included in the film) as a safer and
            cleaner alternative to coal-burning heat. But normal deterioration
            in the pipe system has resulted in burst mains which, in some
            instances, spew asbestos, used as pipe insulation before it was
            found to be a health hazard, over entire city blocks, forcing
            temporary evacuations of buildings and cleanup efforts.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The situation presented to the
            engineers of Honeybee Robotics is to come up with a near-autonomous
            device that could travel inside the underground pipe system and can
            perform inspections and spot-welding. This would, in turn, require
            the device to be able to perform a number of functions. It would
            need to be able to stop the flow of steam in the pipe that it is
            working on (achieved with an inflatable, inner-tube-like device that
            goes 'round the outside of one of the robot's components). It would
            require parts that could withstand high degrees of temperature (the
            steam can reach up to 400 degrees Fahrenheit, and travel at up to
            100 miles-per-hour). It would have to be able to get around inside
            an underground system that runs for hundreds of miles under downtown
            Manhattan, serves over 2,000 office buildings (including all of the
            city's main skyscrapers), and can operate in systems where the pipe
            fittings are not all of uniform diameter (smaller pipes feed into
            larger ones, then back into smaller ones). There are possible
            scenarios to take into consideration. What if the robot gets stuck
            in a pipe that provides heat to the World Trade Center on the
            morning before an important meeting is to be held there?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The engineering team, headed by
            Stephen Gorevan, who has a great shock of greying hair and keen,
            piercing eyes, are all skilled and intelligent men in their
            respective areas, and we follow them as they go through the initial
            paces of trying to come up with what W.I.S.O.R. will need, how it
            will do it, then create its components, testing them, and their
            reactions to when they do not do what they are supposed to do, such
            as a simple electronics system that would enable the robot to
            communicate with its &quot;human interface&quot; on the surface.
            (W.I.S.O.R., pronounced &quot;wiser&quot;, stands for Welding and
            Inspection Steam Operations Robot, and it will end up weighing 700
            pounds.) We see the men's reaction to mishaps, partial failures,
            things that keep going kerflooey time and time again and they can't
            figure out why; they become impatient, exasperated (&quot;Optimism
            is a disaster waiting to happen,&quot; says one engineer, who places
            his faith in proof and certainties rather than hope), pushed to the
            point of endurance. They not only want to see the robot work, so
            that all of their work will not be for nothing: their company, which
            operates out of fairly modest quarters, has created specially-made
            robots for everyone from N.A.S.A. to Coca-Cola, and they make a
            point out of the fact that they have always delivered a project.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The director Michel Negroponte --
            whose earlier documentaries include <i>Jupiter's Wife</i>, an
            affecting portrait of a woman living in the streets of N.Y.C. and in
            Central Park -- keeps the film from turning into a dry, academic
            account of an endeavor. Not only does the film make each of the
            engineers distinctive (they exchange philosophies, worry openly,
            debate topics such as baseball and the existence of God), but it
            also does the same for the robot that they are bringing into being
            -- the film eavesdrops on what it might be thinking as it regards
            how it is being put together by its creators, in words that have for
            the most part been re-mixed and reproduced from words and phrases
            that have been already spoken by the humans, while working on
            W.I.S.O.R. or in small talk, then recombined to form the robot's
            thoughts. The result is that the film pulls you in and becomes a
            fascinating, even exciting, experience, a sort of race-against-time
            story in which a group of fallible but smart and dedicated men
            attempt to save a city that could be blown from its foundations by a
            subterranean force that it has nonetheless come to depend upon, with
            W.I.S.O.R. as both its tamer and the city's savior. In the end, when
            the completed W.I.S.O.R. is packed-off to go to work for the first
            time, the film makes W.I.S.O.R. sound invincible, in the manner of
            the old robot &quot;menaces&quot; in some 'Fifties science-fiction
            thrillers. Given the enormity of the responsibility it's supposed to
            perform, though, you can't blame it for sounding that way.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meanwhile, on the other side of the
            country, ten of the students attending John Marshall High School,
            just outside of Hollywood, were handed ten video cameras with the
            directive that they were to use them to record their lives for a
            week, after which they would pass on the cameras to ten other
            students who would do the same, and so forth… The director Kirby
            Dick (whose last film, <i>Sick:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The Life and Death of Bob Flanagan, Supermasochist</i>,
            detailed the controversial practices of a cystic-fibrosis sufferer
            who attempted to turn his pursuits in S&amp;M, triggered in part by
            his medical condition, into art) and editor Matt Clarke have
            assembled <i>Chain Camera</i> from the video &quot;diaries&quot;
            made by sixteen students attending the school during the 1999-2000
            academic year.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Almost immediately, one calls into
            question how much &quot;truth&quot; we are seeing in the footage and
            how much may merely be acting-out in front of the camera. After all,
            the students (not to mention the filmmakers) can be as selective as
            they want over what they choose to reveal and how they want to
            reveal it. We are living in a very media-savvy age, where just about
            everyone knows how to manipulate the medium to get whatever kind of
            message they want to get across. Each of the students is given a
            fairly short amount of screen time, and many end up falling into
            &quot;types&quot;: the guy who never has had a girlfriend, but would
            like to have one before too long; the girl who doesn't think she's
            &quot;pretty&quot; but who thinks that her boyfriend is just
            &quot;the hottest&quot;; a guy who lives to play football, but can't
            play on the team this year because of his grades. The student body
            at John Marshall encompasses &quot;forty-one ethnic
            backgrounds&quot; and the whole range of economic living status.
            Many of the students in the film come from single-parent families,
            and some have to take on the added responsibility of looking after
            siblings and even running the household.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There are many surprises to be
            found in the film. The aforementioned guy looking for a girlfriend
            is affable, upbeat, has a fine relationship with his mother (who
            works two jobs), and lives with her and his younger brother in an
            apartment space that appears to be no bigger than a closet, with
            outside walls that are pock-marked from drive-by gunfire. Another
            guy is first seen using every sort of racial epithet in the book,
            because he can &quot;say whatever the f*ck I want&quot;, but has
            already set his sights on working in law and civil liberties and is
            shown presently channeling his energies into volunteer community
            work. A third boy turns out to be an astonishingly gifted singer,
            songwriter, and musician, playing the guitar like he was ringin' a
            bell. One girl has given up on guys because of all the expectations
            she found they kept making on girls, and has started going-out with
            another girl, and not only do they appear to be getting along just
            fine but they also attend the senior prom together. And a member of
            the school's academic &quot;Decathlon Club&quot; doesn't think
            anything about openly saying that the reason he has been able to do
            so well in the honors program is because of his &quot;one basic
            truth: the majority of people in the world are stupid&quot;.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The graduation ceremony at the
            conclusion of the film comes with a troubling but telling moment,
            when the student commencement speaker suddenly starts chastising the
            school administration, during her speech, for &quot;enforcing a
            million self-defeating rules, at the cost of the overall success of
            the students&quot;, but then adds that, actually, is a good thing,
            because, by being unfair to the students during their school year,
            the adults have prepared them for the fact that &quot;nothing is
            fair. Get used to it.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The statement comes across as a
            petty and easy one to make, and it gets the wildly enthusiastic roar
            of approval from the graduates that the speaker seems to, in part,
            have been angling for. It also seems like something of a booby trap
            sprung on the administration, judging from the reactions of those
            sitting on the podium. But one wonders how many of the students are
            buying into what is being said, and in what way. The speaker
            concludes that, as they enter adult life, they shouldn't have to
            &quot;get used to it&quot; what with the &quot;knowledge and
            vision&quot; they have armed themselves with. These students are
            going to be the ones who will be shaping this country over the next
            fifty years. Will they put forth the effort that sometimes has to be
            made in life, even if you don't see anything immediate in return for
            it or should even expect anything in return, or will they have
            already started to resign themselves to the consideration that,
            well, life is &quot;not fair&quot;, so, &quot;So what?&quot; We'll
            have the next fifty years to see what mighty trees from these acorns
            will grow.</font>
