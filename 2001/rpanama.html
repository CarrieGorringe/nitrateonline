            Osnard (Pierce Brosnan) is a British spy who has recently screwed up
            (actually, he has been discovered having an affair with a diplomat's
            wife) and been dispatched to Panama, an assignment that on its face,
            looks like it will be dull and dreggy. So begins <i>The Tailor of
            Panama</i>, an international spy movie with a little more on its
            mind than the usual Bondian gizmos and girls -- yes, please note the
            cute nod, in Brosnan's casting as a chic and arrogant operative, to
            his most famous role, and it's not Remington Steele. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Andy's
            disappointment with his new assignment leads him to seek out ways to
            stir things up. And so, immediately on his arrival, he seeks out the
            colorful characters. Among these, the most gossipy is Henry
            (Geoffrey Rush), a self-exiled British tailor who spends much of his
            time hobnobbing with the tiny nation's wealthy denizens, drunks, and
            assorted official has-beens. On meeting Andy, Henry describes the
            local scene to him as &quot;<i>Casablanca</i> without heroes.&quot;
            Indeed, between the divey bars and the brothels (where Henry and
            Andy spend some awkward minutes on a magic-fingers bed, discussing
            business and looking very silly), the place is both depressed and
            depressing. Henry, you soon learn, has his own reasons for being
            stuck there, namely, a seamy past that he's keeping from his wife
            Louisa (Jamie Lee Curtis) and their two kids. Though he does all
            right as a tailor and gossip, he's also incurred some debts that are
            making his present life, a bit, ah, tight.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            other words, Henry's in need of cash, and if some low-stakes
            adventure comes with it, that's fine with him too. The trouble comes
            in the size of the stakes. When Andy hints that the British
            government will pay for information concerning the status of the
            Canal (recently turned over to Panama by the United States), Henry
            can't resist. He begins spinning increasingly elaborate spy-like
            stories about people he knows, including the manager of his tailor
            shop, the mysterious and badly scarred Marta (Leonor Varela); the
            town drunk Mickie Abraxas (Brendan Gleeson, yet again terrific); and
            Louisa, who happens to work for the office overseeing the Canal. <o:p>

            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's
            obviously a bad idea, but once he starts, Henry can't stop -- the
            stories become more and more tangled, even as he conjures up his own
            conscience-figure, a deceased mentor, Uncle Benny (Harold Pinter),
            who pops up periodically in the tight space of the fitting room to
            offer Henry advice and admonitions. Meanwhile, Andy develops his own
            investment in the stories -- to the point that it hardly matters
            whether they're real or not. Andy sees the exchanges of
            &quot;information&quot; and money as a means to salvage his own
            sagging career, or at least break up the tedium and get back at the
            suits who banished him. As a bonus, he's also improving his sex
            life: enticed by the fact that he's working on something
            &quot;big,&quot; his British office coworker, Francesa (Catherine
            McCormack), agrees to a series of secret, sweaty, unsentimental
            trysts. Almost incidental to everything else that goes on here,
            these scenes become almost mechanical -- this is what good-looking,
            affluent white folks in spy movies do when they're bored. <o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
            film is full of twists and turns, blackmails and betrayals, all
            leading the two men deeper and deeper into a fictional hole from
            which they will be unable to extricate themselves. Based on John
            LeCarr</span>é<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'s novel and produced, directed, and co-written by John
            Boorman (his co-writers are LeCarré and Andrew Davies), <i>The
            Tailor of Panama</i> is often darkly witty, in its focus on the
            white &quot;imperialists&quot;' perpetual misapprehension of the
            local culture and the individuals who actually have lives apart from
            those outsiders who think themselves &quot;superior,&quot; at the
            very least in their tastes in fashion and liquor. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></span></font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            once-robust Mickey is one example of the consequences of such
            misjudgment. Broken and sad, he lumbers about, occasionally erupting
            in drunken fits, naming names and pointing fingers, only to be
            carted off to bed by Henry, the ultimate smoother-over. But if
            Mickey's a tragic figure, he's also a blustering, somewhat
            ridiculous one, a man who feels impotent, he's resorted to
            self-destruction. The quietly watchful Marta may be the more perfect
            embodiment of how things can go wrong in neo-colonialist states.
            Surrounded by men who can't help but stare at her damaged face and
            wonder how she came to be that way, Marta remains a tantalizing
            enigma. Some of her former compatriots (including Mickey and Henry),
            remember her as she once was -- a flawless beauty ruined during a
            brief rebellion against the occupying forces. None of the men can
            see her in any way beyond his own fantasies and needs. Even Henry,
            who has memories of the terrible event that scarred one half of her
            face, understands her only in terms of his own self-perceived
            tragedy. He's so locked inside his own experience that he can't act,
            can't be smart, and can't be generous. And that, in <i>The Tailor of
            Panama</i>, is the ultimate sin.&nbsp;</font></span>
