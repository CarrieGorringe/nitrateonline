            need not be a fan of the audacious style of Jackson Pollock to
            admire Ed Harris’ decade-long journeyman effort to bring the
            tortured life of one of America’s true originals to the screen.
            It's an tremendously ambitious project, staged simply yet with bold
            performances that have earned Harris and co-star Marcia Gay Harden
            Academy Award nominations as the explosive, self-destructive genius
            and his deliberately self-sacrificing wife/den mother Lee Krasner.
            The film's two hours' length compresses fifteen years into a
            exhausting, snippet-filled portrait of the artist as a troubled man,
            sputtering, stalling, and ultimately collapsing into an alcohol- and
            depression-steeped death. Pollock's end in the summer of 1956 came
            less than a year after James Dean's demise robbed the '50s of
            another important icon. They shared nothing in common save that they
            both ended their lives with their feet on the accelerator pedal and
            their heads in the clouds. Whenever a super-sized personality as
            talented as Dean or Pollock is cut short, it's inevitable that we
            pause and reflect on what could have been. Last week it was Dale
            Earnhardt's final drive that shared another undeserved spotlight. We
            collectively mourn for these stars that dim too early. James Dean
            had a postage stamp honoring him. Now, with a distance of nearly
            fifty years, Ed Harris wipes off the crusty tears, lifts the black
            veil, and mails you his ruggedly honest missive about the dark side
            of America's first &quot;Art Star.&quot; Actually, what Harris hand
            delivers is a whomp to the sides of our heads with his booze-filled
            memoir of the tormented abstract expressionist fighting, and
            eventually losing, the battle against too many personal demons
            daring him onward and downward.</b><o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            script by Barbara Turner and Susan J. Emshwiller (based on </font></span><font face="Verdana" size="2">the
            book <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Jackson Pollock: An
            American Saga</i> by Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times">)
            casts the painter's circle with formulaic glimpses never fully
            developed. It dashes about the New York landscape, landing in a
            gutter here, a bedroom there, before settling down at The Springs,
            the actual Pollock/Krasner property where most of the movie was
            filmed. The characters tear about too briefly to register beyond Amy
            Madigan (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Field of Dreams</i>)
            as art doyenne Peggy Guggenheim and Jeff Tambor (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Larry Sanders Show</i>) as Clement Greenberg, a critic who
            championed the artist for the New York intelligentsia. The rest of
            the top-billed cast barely makes an appearance beyond a few minutes
            of screen time. Jennifer Connelly pops up only during the last
            twenty minutes as an easy squeeze for the philandering Pollock. Bud
            Cort (God Bless <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Harold and Maude</i>!) is nearly unrecognizable in the early going as
            Harold Putzel, a.k.a. The Eyes of Peggy G, looking decades older
            than he could possibly be. The screenplay fails to adequately define
            Jackson's brothers beyond a worrisome brood concerned about the fame
            and liquor going to his head. Val Kilmer has a walk on (two,
            actually) as artist Willem DeKooning, and John Heard has a few lines
            in the role of &quot;trusted friend Tony Smith.&quot; Director
            Harris affords the well respected cast preciously little quality
            screen time while he and Harden battle it out in front of the crowd.
            No ensemble flick here.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            film begins on November 28, 1950, with Jackson celebrated at a well
            attended showing of his work at the Betty Parsons Gallery. He's the
            talk of the town and gawked at by fans unaware of his weakening
            mental condition. Moments later we're back to a month before the
            bombing of Pearl Harbor, the kernel of Jackson's eventually
            melancholy seeded with his sponging off brother Sande and his
            irritable, pregnant wife in their cramped Greenwich Village tenement
            apartment, his alcoholism already tearing at the family's soul. More
            and more of the same follows, tempered by the arrival of </font></span><font face="Verdana" size="2">inquisitive
            neighbor/fellow artist Krasner, a brash Brooklynite who pushes
            herself into Pollock's life, even after he offers her the
            left-handed compliment, &quot;you're a damned good woman
            painter.&quot; Their tenuous relationship is handled rather nicely.
            Pollock's eyes are terminally pointed downward, his anxiousness
            subdued as he stands in Krasner's darkened hallway. He's an
            unwitting voyeur as she disrobes in distant silhouette. Her control
            of his life begins here, as she unbuttons the wooden puppet that he
            is. It's a damned good scene that shows Harris' promise as a
            director. He's got another, during one of Jackson's early artistic
            epiphanies. After spending months searching for inspiration, he
            springs before a large canvas, furiously hurling brushloads of
            pigment. Lit from behind the artist, the shadow of the creator
            reflecting off the work imprints him within the picture. It's
            quaint, but effective.<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><o:p>

            Harris paints his cinematic canvas with slow-paced deliberateness,
            whether watching the chain-smoking Pollock mope around a barren room
            or try to light a match. You might feel pummeled by all the abundant
            mood swings, perpetual alcoholic binges, embarrassing situations,
            and tossed tables. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Pollock</i>
            is a definitely a bitter cup of tea, and probably not one that will
            endear itself to repeated viewings. Ed Harris and his directorial
            hand dyes this peculiar American legend with Technicolor hues
            (thanks to director of photography Lisa Rinzler and production
            designer Mark Friedberg) and the musical palette of Jeff Beal's
            jazzy score and plucky theme music. You won't find a touch of
            sentimentality around, just troubling truths aching for an audience.</font></span></p>
