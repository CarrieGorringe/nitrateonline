            Wayne Wang is best known for his earnest, compassionate portrayals
            of familial and social relationships in movies like <i>The Joy Luck
            Club</i> (1993), <i>Smoke</i> and <i>Blue in the Face</i> (both
            1995), and <i>Anywhere But Here</i> (1999). The Hong Kong born
            director has made a few edgier, politically inclined independent
            films (perhaps the most notable being his first, <i>Chan Is Missing</i>
            [1982]), and he recently partnered with Francis Ford Coppola and Tom
            Luddy in the production company Chrome Dragon, dedicated to
            supporting independent filmmakers in Asia, but the &quot;nice&quot;
            movies have made his Hollywood rep. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">According
            to interviews, Wang's desire to complicate this reputation informed
            his decision to make his new film, <i>Center of the World</i>, which
            deals with racy subject matter that borders on
            &quot;pornographic.&quot; Like Darren Aronofsky's <i>Requiem for a
            Dream</i> (2000), Wang's film is being released without an MPAA
            rating, but that doesn't mean the images are graphic or the sex
            &quot;real.&quot; It only means that the ideas are difficult enough
            that an &quot;adult&quot; audience might be better suited to
            comprehend the film than a non-adult audience, and that the implied
            sex is non-standard (including some anal and oral activities, and an
            image of menstrual blood, that is, ironically and tellingly, faked).

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Even
            with all this potential controversy and outrageousness swirling
            about, the most interesting questions raised by <i>Center of the
            World</i> have to do with some unsensational definitions: what does
            it mean to be adult? To be responsible or connected to others? Or,
            for that matter, to be real? For that is what's at stake in
            pornography -- its realness, or its capacity to solicit real
            (physical, sexual) reactions in its consumers. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            plot concerns two vulnerable, self-consciously adventurous
            characters: they're never quite sure how brave they want to be, but
            erratically push themselves to whatever brink they imagine is out
            there. Richard (Peter Sarsgaard) is a lonely geek boy, a millionaire
            dotcommer who's already sick of making money (even video games,
            where he's always in charge, have lost their allure). And Florence
            (Molly Parker, amazing in Lynne Stopkowich's <i>Kissed</i>) is a
            stripper who's simultaneously bored and distressed by her work, and
            would really rather pursue her dream of drumming for what looks like
            a punk-lite band. These lost souls meet when he visits the
            conspicuously named Pandora's Box, the club where she's employed,
            and he's so taken by her (lap dance) that he asks her to come to
            Vegas with him for three days: no strings and lots of money.
            Exploring each other's fantasies in a deluxe hotel room, they come
            up against some long-buried traumas and longings. While Florence
            struggles to maintain &quot;control,&quot; Richard tries to let go.
            But this particular gendered conflict is as trite as they come:
            Richard thinks the &quot;center of the world&quot; is in his laptop,
            by which he surfs the public sphere at any old time he likes; for
            Florence, the &quot;center&quot; is a woman's &quot;cunt,&quot; from
            which all life flows. She's just your average earth mother dressed
            up like a pole dancer. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            most frustrating aspect of Wang's movie -- co-written with Paul
            Auster (with whom he worked on <i>Smoke</i> and <i>Blue in the Face</i>),
            with input from Auster's wife Siri Husvedt and performance
            artist/former stripper Miranda July, under the collective name,
            &quot;Ellen Benjamin Wong&quot; -- is that it traipses over such
            well-traveled ground. The topic and the approach -- using digital
            cameras that allow unconventional intimacy along with a cheesy,
            porn-like look -- make the film appear, at first glance, to be bold
            and new. It's not. The first version of this story that came to my
            mind was a famous one -- <i>Klute</i>, the 1971 movie that made Jane
            Fonda a &quot;legitimate,&quot; award-winning actor. The conceit in <i>Klute</i>
            is that Fonda's Bree is an unhappy prostitute, seeing a shrink to
            learn the reasons for her self-destructive behavior and inability to
            commit. Then she meets Klute (Donald Sutherland), the real man who
            makes her feel real emotions. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            dynamic in <i>Center of the World</i> is depressingly similar, in
            that it sets up a likely romance between unlikely partners, who are
            struggling to figure out what's real, about themselves and each
            other. Their Vegas hotel room starts to feel very claustrophobic.
            Richard and Florence are initially so complete in their parallel
            aloneness and repeated efforts to seduce and then reject one
            another, that it looks like you won't even see another character.
            And then come two interlopers, whose function is to -- how to say
            it? -- &quot;flesh out&quot; the principal couple. In the script's
            clunkiest device, Richard and Florence are each is assigned a
            drop-in friend who sheds light on his or her motivations. His is a
            college classmate, Brian (Balthasar Getty), so smug and
            self-involved that he makes Richard look well-adjusted. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Florence's
            illustrative &quot;friend&quot; is Jerri (Carla Gugino), with whom
            she once shared Vegas tricks, and some other desperate history that
            the movie only hints at. Beaten by her thuggish boyfriend, Jerri
            arrives at Florence's door, her face bloody and bruised. Here again,
            Richard looks like a relatively healthy &quot;catch,&quot; vaguely
            moved by Jerri's pathetic seduction, but more practically,
            understanding what he does do well: he offers her much-needed money
            just because she's Florence's friend. &quot;What planet is he
            from?&quot; Jerri asks, between tearful gurgles. With a flash of
            insight, the film presents this entire scene from Florence's
            perspective: she leaves the room and comes back in to see Jerri all
            over Richard, but it's not jealousy that sparks her next decision.
            It's fear. She sees in Jerri a mirror image of herself, past and
            future: what if this guy <b><i>is</i></b> too good to be true? Truth
            is elusive, a matter of faith more than proof. And still, people
            with means -- money, power -- can create their own realities. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">While
            both Richard and Florence's mutual attractions are based on personal
            needs rather than external, observable realities, or even much
            recognition of one another in that hotel room, his projections have
            a power that hers do not. He has options and can make decisions that
            she cannot. This difference between them is crucial, and underlines
            the violence of fantasy when it concerns someone else. Put simply,
            you can't imagine, anticipate, or make sense of someone else's
            desire, and that is precisely the problem posed by porn: its
            ostensible and much-vaunted realness is, by definition,
            &quot;fake,&quot; performed in exchange for money. But if porn is
            pretty much endlessly fascinating (deciding what's fake and what's
            not is only the first problem; the more substantive one is deciding
            whether it <b><i>matters</i></b> what's fake and what's not), <i>The
            Center of the World</i> gets simple early on. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Its
            first moments are promising: opening with shots of artifices
            associated with Las Vegas (those bizarre replicant versions of the
            Statue of Liberty, the Eiffel Tower, and of course, the Sphinx), the
            movie seems poised to probe its characters' (and its own) inability
            to define terms: reality and fiction aren't so easily
            differentiated; fiction can be more effectively real than reality;
            etc. But <i>The Center of the World</i> never gets past its own
            investment in arty pretense, as if it's wondering how to be
            not-a-porn film, but still teeter on that titillating edge? <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Taking
            the film on its own terms, what appears to matter is the inevitably
            developing emotional bond between Florence and Richard. That she
            resists this bond is predictable. She's in a business that Richard
            can only understand as consumer, and her performative integrity --
            her self-orchestrated remove from him -- is her only means to
            control, however simulated. She is vigilant, which, in this movie's
            tired vocabulary, translates into her being damaged and unable to
            move forward. (Thank goodness, she recognizes at least that Richard
            is <b><i>not</i></b> the optimum vehicle for movement.) <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For
            Richard, control is outwardly a less vexed issue: he's
            super-privileged, a straight white man with lots of money who's used
            to getting his way, in his virtual life and elsewhere. But according
            to the dictates of the <i>Klute</i>-et-al. plot, he will have to
            reckon with his control, his responsibility for someone else, and
            his own gauges of realness. Predictably, before he comes to his
            epiphany (if that's what he comes to), Richard's idea of what's
            &quot;real&quot; leads him, in his own frustration and rage, to a
            base physical dominance, demanding Florence's submission as a
            function of her &quot;honest&quot; desire. This is, of course,
            exactly what she cannot give him, but the fact that he makes the
            demand reveals that he's not from another planet after all, but from
            right here on earth, centerless as it must be. <o:p>
