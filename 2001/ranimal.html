            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In <i>The Animal</i>, Rob
            Schneider, with his googly eyes and barn-door ears, plays a lowly
            clerk in a small-town police department office, where he is pelted
            by children and sneered at by his adult co-workers. One day, while
            responding to an emergency call, he swerves to avoid hitting a seal
            (the type with flippers, that swims) in the middle of the road and
            flies off an embankment, falls and hits another one, then another,
            then lands after which a big boulder falls and smashes on top of....</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Does this sound familiar? Yes,
            indeedy, we're back in that big, wonderful part of movieland where
            people think you don't need jokes to make a comedy. Instead, what
            you use is, 1) people being smacked up one side of the head, hard,
            very hard, 2) people hurling pretty nasty insults and abuse at other
            people, 3) people being placed in the lowest, crudest, and most
            embarrassing of situations, and, 4) everyone is made to look as
            stupid as possible. It is becoming wearisome.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Schneider's character emerges after
            being reconstructed by the local mad scientist (Michael Caton), who
            lives in the local woods, with animal organs. Which animals and from
            where is never explained up front, so the filmmakers can dispense
            with having to fool with any sort of plot and just have Schneider
            act goofy whenever they want him to. He barks and snarls like a dog,
            chases a cat, swims like a dolphin, humps a mailbox like a horse,
            marks his territory with urine, and has enhanced olfactory senses.
            After busting a guy who's carrying concealed drugs, a reporter asks
            him, &quot;Is it true that you can smell things up people's
            butts?&quot; He also attracts the attentions of a pert-looking young
            lady (Colleen Haskell, previously seen on a T.V. reality show) who
            runs an animal shelter. There, Schneider gets into a fight with an
            orangutan.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Actually, what happened was that
            somebody saw a video of Paul Schrader's 1982 remake of <i>Cat People</i>.
            This picture imitates that film's nighttime P.O.V. prowling shots,
            along with the scene where Nasstasja Kinski asks John Heard to tie
            her to the bedposts. (This film's version stops just short enough to
            retain its PG-13 rating.) There are also several instances where the
            film flirts with portraying bestiality to the point where it becomes
            skin-crawling.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            isn't really the type of movie that deserves to be beaten-up on, but
            it's impossible to get around the fact that there's the distinct
            impression that the filmmakers think their audience is made up
            entirely of morons and that they laugh at the most incredibly
            cretinous things. Since this is pretty much all that Hollywood is
            currently offering people in the way of comedies, though, there's
            nothing else to turn to. The laughs that I heard at the screening I
            attended had the hollow ring of people who has shown-up and were
            determined to have a good time, no matter how lousy the movie
            actually turned out to be.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
