            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 13 July
            2001</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>About fifteen years ago, <i>Omni</i>
            magazine asked several Hollywood directors to describe a film they
            think they would make for moviegoers at the beginning of the
            twenty-first century. Several directors described pet projects that
            they had been wanting to make for years -- Richard Attenborough said
            he would make a film about Thomas Paine, Mel Brooks a film version
            of Oliver Goldsmith's eighteenth-century comedy <i>She Stoops to
            Conquer</i>. (Personally, I'd rather see the Brooks film.) Susan
            Seidelman, who had just made the hugely successful <i>Desperately
            Seeking Susan</i>, said that she would make a movie starring Marilyn
            Monroe and Robert De Niro: technology will have advanced at that
            time to where an electronically-recreated Monroe could seamlessly
            and easily play scenes opposite the real De Niro.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I recalled Seidelman's remarks both
            before, during, and after seeing <i>Final Fantasy: The Spirits
            Within</i>, the first film in which the entire cast of characters
            has been created using computer technology. (This is also the second
            film to appear this summer based on a video game. The film's
            director, Hironobu Sakaguchi, also developed the <i>Final Fantasy</i>
            video game.) The characters have been rendered in minute detail,
            right down to the shine in their eye and the strands of their hair,
            but, in focusing so much attention on creating simulations that can
            be mistaken for &quot;real&quot; people, the filmmakers have
            forgotten (or ignored) what film actors and directors have been
            saying for years: that film is a medium capable of recording the
            process of thought. Even though there are fleeting instances where
            your eye is fooled into thinking it's seeing something that's
            &quot;real&quot;, the characters in <i>Final Fantasy</i> never come
            off as anything more than computer imagery, and they never take on a
            life of their own. The film turns into a procession of walking,
            immaculate mannequins, and after a while you not only stop caring
            about what's happening on the screen, you don't even care about
            looking at the screen: when you do, you feel like you're staring at
            Tupperware. By comparison, even the simple hand-drawn characters in
            Jules Feiffer's <i>Munro</i> or the old <i>Crusader Rabbit</i> T.V.
            cartoons seem infinitely more cognizant.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At the same time, there is a
            gesture towards narrative in the film, involving story elements, all
            squished-together like Play-Doh, about &quot;phantoms&quot; that
            have arrived on Earth during the second half of the twenty-first
            century (and which look, for the most part, like angry halitosis
            bacteria), worrisome distinctions between the physical and spiritual
            properties of things, a metaphysical philosophy involving
            &quot;Gaia&quot; (which, for some reason, I kept confusing in my
            mind with the artist Salvador Dalí's demon wife, Gala), an attempt
            by scientists to collect seven &quot;spirits&quot; which together
            are supposed to stop the marauding alien &quot;phantoms&quot; while,
            at the same time, renewing the ravaged planet,, and a U.S. military
            ruler who just wants to get rid of the pesky visitors by means of
            one big blast from a huge space gun (reflecting the eternal conflict
            between Reason and Brute Force). Absolutely none of this makes any
            sense at all, the dialogue isn't of much help, either (&quot;We can
            get through this! I still have the wave!&quot;), we're never clearly
            told what the seven &quot;spirits&quot; are or how they are found or
            what kind of power they're supposed to have, and characters throw
            themselves in and out of one situation after another without seeming
            to think. Then it turns out that the &quot;phantoms&quot; are, in
            fact, not invaders at all, but the remnants of life from a planet
            that has exploded. They're refugees! All of a sudden, the idea of
            blasting them to a ka-zillion pieces seems about as appealing as
            massacring people in lifeboats from the <i>Titanic</i>. Why not
            negotiate a detente with the &quot;phantoms&quot;? It would save on
            a lot of firepower, and manpower.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But this would be at cross-purposes
            with what the filmmakers want to do. Even though an impressive array
            of talent has been obtained to put voices to the animated faces
            (Donald Sutherland and Jean Simmons provide the most expressive
            elocutions, while Steve Buscemi must've been tickled to do the voice
            for a paramilitary character who looks just like Edward Norton), the
            story has been stripped of logic, explanation, method -- most of the
            things which engage or make us want to identify with a story -- so
            that it's focused entirely on escapes, pursuits, battles, and
            explosions. In other words, the people who made this film are still
            making video games.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's not as if the technology
            itself is creating an impediment. It could be wonderfully used
            towards bringing something like Harlan Ellison's screen adaptation
            of Issac Asimov's <i>I, Robot</i> to the screen. (Ellison's
            screenplay has been languishing for over twenty years, waiting to be
            made into a film.) But instead of bringing us stories that would
            amaze and inspire us, what we're getting is clods blowing things up.
            What the film most brings to mind is the Japanese fad of <b><i>otaku</i></b>:
            small, artificial dolls that are nonetheless perfectly rendered down
            to the last detail. <i>Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within</i> may be
            the most expensive <b><i>otaku</i></b> ever made.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
