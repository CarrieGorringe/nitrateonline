            review by <a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 26 October
            2001</i></font><p><font face="Verdana" size="5">Hard as stone</font></p>
            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">During Snoop's recent guest 
            appearance on <i>The Daily Show</i>, Jon Stewart predictably asked 
            him about his new film's title, <i>Bones</i>. You know, did it refer 
            to the same kind of &quot;bones&quot; that Stewart, putting his fingers to his 
            lips in a smoking gesture, had in mind? Sporting a pair of crazy 
            diamond-rimmed glasses and a sample from his recently launched 
            clothing line, Snoop was good-natured as always, leaning <i>way</i> 
            back in the red sofa, his long skinny legs splayed out in front of 
            him. He smiled quietly and gave the appropriate answer: the movie is 
            named after Jimmy Bones, Snoop's character, who spends most of his 
            time on screen as a ghost, come back to avenge his brutal murder by 
            associates and supposed friends. Jimmy also shows up in flashbacks 
            to 1979, when he's a neighborhood &quot;patron,&quot; dressed up in a pimp 
            suit, sauntering along the sidewalk as folks young and old wave 
            hello and grasp his hand in gratitude. </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The role suits Snoop Dogg, 
            legendarily amiable and good to his people. Most consumers know 
            Snoop for his laid-back rap style, his lucrative partnership with 
            mentor Dr. Dre, or perhaps the headlines that have kept him in the 
            public eye over the years, including the uproar over the cover art 
            for his 1993 album <i>Doggy Style</i>, or the congressional hearings 
            on &quot;rap music&quot; that singled out Snoop's &quot;explicit&quot; lyrics. Maybe 
            they recall his arrest and trial for murder in 1994, his defection 
            from Suge Knight's Death Row for Master P's No Limit, and most 
            recently, his 18 October bust for marijuana possession while on his 
            Puff, Puff, Pass Tour bus. But Snoop, né Calvin Broadus, has also 
            been working an alternative career, with a series of 
            straight-to-video productions, with titles like <i>Urban Menace</i>,
            <i>The Wrecking Crew</i>, and <i>Hot Boyz</i>, as well as <i>Murder 
            Was the Case</i>, the 1994 long-form video directed by Dr. Dre, in 
            which Snoop plays a banger who pays dearly for his actions. And oh 
            yes, he's developing a porn video business, apparently drawing from 
            his experience at Death Row (see, for instance, the video release,
            <i>Death Row Uncut</i>). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Bones</i> marks Snoop's initial 
            move into mainstream stardom, following strong supporting roles 
            earlier this year in two high-profile pictures, John Singleton's <i>
            Baby Boy</i> and Antoine Fuqua's <i>Training Day</i>; later this 
            year, Snoop has yet another starring role, alongside Dre, in D.J. 
            Pooh's <i>The Wash</i>. All this activity suggests that Snoop, or 
            someone, has a plan concerning his Hollywood career. Obviously, he's 
            a charismatic guy, and I believe him when he says that he was 
            waiting for the &quot;right&quot; role for his first starring vehicle. Whether 
            or not Bones is that role is another question. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film has a lot going for it. 
            Directed by Ernest Dickerson and written by Adam Simon and Tim 
            Metcalfe, <i>Bones</i> lifts from several scary-movie predecessors, 
            including Clint Eastwood spaghetti Westerns, <i>Tales From the Hood</i>,
            <i>The Crow</i>, <i>Candyman</i>, <i>Hellraiser</i>, and <i>
            Nightmare on Elm Street</i>: Jimmy Bones has even been assigned his 
            own spooky children's rhyme, &quot;This is the story of Jimmy Bones / 
            Black as night and hard as stone / Gold-plated deuce like the King 
            of Siam / Got a switchblade loose and a diamond on his hand...&quot; All 
            good sources -- they inspire faith that the filmmakers have a grasp 
            of the political potentials for horror films, and indeed, the 
            resulting film makes a rudimentary case regarding the introduction 
            of crack into underclass urban neighborhoods, as one small component 
            in an economic system that gives little or no thought to human 
            costs. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Granted, this crack as urban menace 
            idea isn't exactly new (and the case has been made more emphatically 
            in Mario Van Peebles' <i>Panther</i>, where the FBI introduced crack 
            into black neighborhoods as part of COINTELPRO). But it's not a bad 
            idea for a horror movie, given its genuinely horrific effects. But 
            the film doesn't push this socio-political angle, instead using it 
            as a way to heroicize Bones, in his big pimpy way. Because he 
            refuses to sell it on his block, Bones is murdered by the usual 
            local idiots who are looking to cash in on the next big thing. These 
            include the usual corrupt cop, Lupovich (Michael T. Weiss, best 
            known for his work on TV's <i>The Pretender</i>), and the usual 
            smalltime hustler, Eddie Mack (Ricky Harris, memorable in the Dogg 
            Pound's video, &quot;Doggy Dogg World&quot;), whose depravity is marked by the 
            following stock details: 1) he wears tired '70s outfits, even in the 
            present day scenes; 2) he runs his business from out of a gloomy 
            pool hall; 3) he has a skanky white girlfriend named Snowflake (Erin 
            Wright); and 4) he wears a hairnet in a decidedly uncool way. </font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">However you read these characters 
            -- as self-conscious stereotypes or just badly written villains -- 
            they don't do much to help the horror part of <i>Bones</i>, already 
            somewhat hampered by some corny effects. Dickerson has a famously 
            sharp eye (in addition to once being Spike Lee's cinematographer, 
            from his NYU films through <i>Do the Right Thing</i> to <i>Malcolm X</i>, 
            he also directed <i>Juice</i>), and it's in evidence here in the 
            non-FX shots: grainy, skewed-angle footage and deeply shadowed 
            interiors, and orange-filtered fish-eye lenses for demonic point of 
            view shots. The much less interesting visuals in <i>Bones</i> are 
            low-rent-looking long-fingered shadows on the wall, silly swirling 
            mists, flames that are obviously licking no one, and the jet-black 
            wolf-dog who serves as Bones' earthly familiar, and whose red eyes 
            make him look like a battery-powered toy.&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Predictably, the story concerns 
            those left behind after Bones' untimely death, in particular those 
            present at the murder scene, the shooter and those others he forces 
            to stab Bones, so everyone has some reason to cover up the crime. On 
            its face, this plot point seems strained, especially since one of 
            these characters is Bones' lady love, Pearl (played by the great Pam 
            Grier), but considering that she's a black woman up against a white 
            cop, perhaps we can let it go. She has a premonition that things 
            will go wrong that night, but Bones is a little cocky, so by the 
            time she shows up at his office to help, well, he's already in too 
            deep, and she's sucked in right after him. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Bones comes back when his old house 
            (very stone-scary looking) when some kids come in with plans to 
            renovate it for use as a dance club, to be called Illbient. As it 
            happens, these entrepreneurs are the children of Bones' old partner 
            (and another one in that room full of guilty parties back in 1979), 
            Jeremiah (Clifton Powell), whose own ill-gotten gains include a 
            house in a nice neighborhood and a white wife. The kids -- Patrick (Khalil 
            Kain), Bill (Merwin Modesir), and Tia (Katharine Isabelle) -- bring 
            along their buddy, a DJ and aspiring player named Maurice (Sean 
            Armsing), who makes the mistake of taking that big old diamond ring 
            off the skeleton they find in the basement; not only that, he breaks 
            off the finger to get the ring -- double no-no. This greediness 
            initiates Bones's time-lapsed return, his veins, muscles, and skin 
            slithering onto his skeletal remains. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At last, he's fully fleshed into 
            Snoop, easily the movie's best effect. Bones creates havoc in 
            Illbient on opening night, what with all those pretty kids dancing 
            and looking to score. His vengeance takes the form of that 
            flesh-ripping pooch, hellzapoppin fires, a gooey wall full of 
            tortured human faces and limbs, and lots and lots of maggots. He 
            takes out all his assailants, then goes after Patrick, appointed 
            love interest for Cynthia (Bianca Lawson, last seen beating up Julia 
            Stiles in <i>Save the Last Dance</i>), who happens to be Bones and 
            Pearl's beautiful, strangely serene-about-all-this daughter. </font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Dad's interest in his daughter's 
            happiness may be &quot;natural,&quot; but he's supernatural, so, well, there's 
            some generational tensions. Still, Cynthia keeps her wits about her, 
            perhaps because she has a bit of her mother's gift for &quot;vision&quot; in 
            her, and knows what's coming. Then again, it's not so hard to guess 
            all that, since the movie is nothing if not predictable. Still, 
            Cynthia is sharp and confident, survives a nasty blood-doused 
            nightmare that somehow involves dad in a sexual-looking business 
            that I'm not sure I want to explore too deeply, and knows how to get 
            out of the house when it counts. She's also pretty clear on what she 
            wants, and that would be Patrick, on her own terms (no sex before 
            she's ready). Bones is cool, but of all the characters in <i>Bones</i>, 
            Cynthia is the one who most merits a sequel. Oh, and did I mention 
            that Pearl is now working as a storefront Miss Cleo to make ends 
            meet? No wonder Cynthia's feeling defiant. </font><br>
