            can't recall another movie scene that is so immediate, moving, and
            bizarre as the one that jump-starts the romance in <i>The Princess
            and the Warrior</i>. A young nurse is crossing a not-so-busy small
            town street when she's hit by a truck. Bam. In a violent instant,
            she's underneath the vehicle, flat on her back, and struggling to
            get her breath. The space beneath the truck is dark, and though feet
            scuffle nearby and traffic passes, the sounds dwindle, so that soon,
            all you hear are her labored gasps and voice-over recollection of
            the astounding &quot;silence&quot; that overwhelms her. And then a
            young man appears: he slides under the truck with her, actually on
            top of her, then cuts her throat open and slips in a tube,
            performing a rushed and raggedy tracheotomy. All the while, Sissi
            gazes up at him, an extraordinary range of emotions racing across
            her tear-stained face. The time is stretched out, eerie: she's
            transfixed, horrified, grateful, and afraid. <o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">On
            its surface, the second collaboration between writer-director Tom
            Tykwer and Franka Potente couldn't be more unlike than their first,
            the wonderful <i>Run, Lola, Run</i>. Where that film was fast and
            urgent, <i>The Princess and the Warrior</i> is (as the above scene
            demonstrates) deliberate, almost meditative. Still, the two movies
            share common, provocative ideas about fate and passion, the nature
            of time and the rhythms of life. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            the new film, Potente plays the titular &quot;princess,&quot; or
            more precisely, a psychiatric nurse named Sissi. Her warrior -- the
            guy who slits her throat open -- is Bodo (Benno Furmann), an
            ex-soldier suffering the emotional aftereffects of his young wife's
            dreadful accidental death in a gas station explosion. Both Sissi and
            Bodo live under difficult, extraordinary circumstances, but are
            simultaneously suffocating inside routines. He lives with his
            brother, Walter (Joachim Krol), who accommodates Bodo's depression.
            He's inarticulate and sunk inside himself but also hyper (Furmann
            creates a sustained tension between this self-immersion and Bodo's
            surface-edginess). Unable to sleep at night because of bad dreams
            and flashbacks, Bodo distracts himself during daylight hours with
            military and martial arts drills.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sissi
            has an equally but very differently isolated existence, even though
            she's surrounded by people, specifically the mental patients under
            her care. Gifted but also limited by her incredibly generous and
            nonjudgmental spirit, Sissi doesn't object when one man begs her for
            a hand-job, and another attacks her without warning. She's been the
            asylum for so long that such erratic behavior has become commonplace
            for her.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Both
            Bodo and Sissi are thus limited by their experiences and
            expectations of pain. He can't trust anyone, she can only trust
            everyone; neither extreme allows for movement or ambition. Where
            Bodo's desperation leads him to plot a bank robbery with his
            brother, he doesn't quite believe that a wad of cash will change
            anything. His collision with Sissi will change everything. After
            spending some weeks in the hospital following the tracheotomy, she
            sets out in search of her savior, determined to discover who he is
            and why they came together. While there's a broad,
            what's-the-order-of-the-universe bottom line type of question here,
            fortunately, the film is less interested in pursuing such causes
            than in exploring effects. And so it looks most carefully at how
            Sissi and Bodo respond to one another, in repeated, increasingly
            weird circumstances. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sissi
            tracks him down and is literally grounded by the force of his rage
            and sadness. She locates him at Walter's, in the yard practicing a
            martial arts move, but Bodo's so into what he's doing that he
            doesn't see her come up behind him, and whomps her in the face as
            she approaches. Bam (again). She goes down. You might expect that
            this violence would upset her, but no, Sissi remains implacably
            nonjudgmental, taking his fist in some kind of stride. This is
            because she finds it familiar, not comforting or pleasant certainly,
            but something she knows how to handle, something she can absorb and
            comprehend. Later encounters with Bodo are also hurtful, as he
            rejects her again and again: &quot;We can't go on like this,&quot;
            he says when she comes to the house once more. &quot;I'm not
            leaving,&quot; she says. And so, he throws her out the door, into
            the pouring rain. And she just keeps coming. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For
            me, Sissi's capacity to roll with such abuse, to take ignoble -- or
            at least ignorant, miserable, and unsocialized -- men as they come
            to her, is the most disturbing element of <i>The Princess and the
            Warrior</i>. This isn't to say that the violence that stems from
            Bodo and Walter's attempted bank robbery isn't troubling, or that
            the mix of absolute intensity and absolute boredom in the asylum
            isn't also distressing. But Sissi occupies a peculiar and yet all
            too familiar position in relation to violence enacted by men against
            women. What is most alarming about Sissi's relentlessly big-hearted
            response to her cruel and often frightening environment, is that it
            echoes responses from many women, so used to being abused, that
            they're conditioned to expect it, to believe it's their
            &quot;fate.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At
            the same time, the fact that her absorption of pain <b><i>is </i></b>disturbing
            would appear to be the point. In traditional fairy tales, girls do
            tend to take the passive role -- they wait to be rescued, they
            suffer patiently while longing for true love to change their lives.
            What <i>The Princess and the Warrior</i> ends up doing, after laying
            out this convention, is to turn it upside down, to celebrate Sissi's
            openness, survival, and sense of invention: she finds a way out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>At times behaving like a prototypical nurse-by-nature, caring
            for everyone as if he's a patient, Sissi isn't simply
            representative. She's also inspired and unnervingly inspirational,
            not in the sense that you would want to follow her example, but in
            the sense that she is resilient and eventually learns from her
            experiences. Still, she embodies a certain element of faith and
            childlike &quot;magic,&quot; and it's this fairy tale-ish aspect
            that allows Sissi to, in effect, &quot;save&quot; Bodo, in effect,
            to reintroduce him to himself. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Tykwer's
            lyrical framing and dead-on choice of music make these themes
            unavoidable -- the camera is ever-restless, while the music thrums
            and pulses, there is movement and a sense of imminent transition
            everywhere in this film. Bodo and Sissi's romance is surely bizarre,
            but also full of grace and tenderness. Perhaps the greatest surprise
            is just how the film brings you inside these characters, who on
            their surfaces look so strange. The pace is meticulous and also just
            slightly &quot;off.&quot; Watching the first hour or so of <i>The
            Princess and the Warrior</i> is like listening to someone sing just
            a bit behind the beat, fascinating, and sometimes unsettling too.
            Bodo and Sissi interact with a series of other characters before
            they have an actual conversation, and even when they do speak with
            one another, they appear at first to be crossing wires. They are
            hardly your usual romantic pairing, and the film never quite does
            what you think it will. But it's the very slowness of their
            development, their steps back and forward as characters and as a
            couple, that makes them so visually and emotionally riveting. <o:p>
