            review by <a href="../kj.html" target="_top">KJ Doughton</a>, 16 November 2001</i></font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="1"><o:p>

            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Let me set the record straight. 
            I have not perused even one page of J.K. Rowling’s celebrated Harry 
            Potter prose.&nbsp; Such blockbuster books as <i>Harry Potter and the 
            Chamber of Secrets, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, </i>
            and<i> Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</i> sound about as 
            appealing to me as a sit ‘n spin atop the Sword of Excalibur. Making 
            matters worse was the endless orgy of pre-show advertising thrust 
            upon me as I hunkered down in a multiplex and geared up for <i>Harry 
            Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone</i>, the first cinematic chapter of 
            Rowling’s phenomenally successful vision of possessed wizard’s hats, 
            mail-delivering owls, and menacing ogres.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Indeed, what preceded <i>Potter</i> 
            was a typical surge of “event movie” commercials and previews that 
            rammed itself down my throat with the subtlety of a fireworks 
            display. Fox television advertised a holiday boob-tube special. 
            Lexus previewed their latest overpriced luxury vehicle. Screaming 
            cats, buzzing planes, zigzagging skateboarders, and ass-biting dogs 
            stampeded across the screen, alerting viewers to such gentle holiday 
            features as <i>Stuart Little 2</i> and <i>Snow Dogs</i>. If this 
            weren’t enough to induce post-traumatic stress disorder, equally 
            raucous ads for <i>Lord of the Rings</i> and <i>Scooby Doo: The 
            Movie</i> stormed the screen. Don’t we hide out in the cinema to <i>
            escape</i> such noisy bouts of shameless sales tactics?&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The barrage of offensive 
            advertising raised a big question, as <i>Harry Potter</i>’s 
            beginning credits hit the screen. Would this latest big-budget movie 
            variation of a successful children’s franchise lower itself to the 
            same soulless, homogenous standards as the ads preceding it?&nbsp; After 
            all, its director was Chris Columbus, a filmmaker known more for his 
            audience-pleasing, fortune-making studio hits (<i>Mrs. Doubtfire, 
            Home Alone</i>) than for anything resonant or profound.&nbsp; As one of 
            the few adults in a sold-out theater full of candy and pop-saturated 
            tots, I remained the lone skeptic. The familiar Harry Potter logo 
            flashed across the screen and was met with a chorus of enthusiastic 
            “oohs” and “aahs.”&nbsp; This Potter fellow really seemed to have a 
            following.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">An otherworldly atmosphere cloaks
            <i>Harry Potter</i> from its opening frames, where the camera 
            follows an owl to Privet Drive. A trio of witches and wizards is 
            delivering a mysterious baby to the mist-enshrouded, moonlit English 
            neighborhood. At the scene is Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith), a 
            strict-yet-loving old dame who can turn from female to feline. 
            Professor Dumbledore (Richard Harris, who allegedly took the role 
            only after his granddaughter, a big fan of the books, insisted on 
            it), sporting a gray, Rasputin-length beard and wise, world-weary 
            eyes, also attends the gathering. Hairy Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) , 
            who pulls up on a motorcycle, conjures forth memories of the 
            fearsome biker from <i>Raising Arizona</i> but possesses the heart 
            of a gentle teddy bear. All three of these authorities in magic work 
            at the Hogwarts School for Witchcraft and Wizardry, and they’re also 
            looking after this mysterious infant, who is planted on a doorstep. 
            Who is the family living there, destined to raise young Harry Potter 
            until the lad is ready to further his occult education at Hogwarts?&nbsp; 
            This is the first of many mysteries presented during <i>Harry Potter 
            and the Sorcerer’s Stone</i>.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film then zips forward eleven 
            years, and we’re privy to the plight of a preadolescent, 
            bespectacled Harry as he suffers with his foster parents,&nbsp; 
            UncleVernon Dursley (Griffiths) and Aunt Petunia (Shaw). Proclaimed 
            “the worst sort of <i>muggles</i>” (term translation: non-magic 
            types) by Hagrid, the two pathetic guardians make Harry their 
            whipping boy, blaming him for their many shortcomings.&nbsp; Harry is 
            sentenced to a life lived in a cupboard under the stairs, while 
            their spoiled putz of a son, Dudley (Melling), complains that he’s 
            received only thirty-six birthday presents. “Last year I had 
            thirty-seven,” he sobs.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Harry’s uncle is a bungling 
            walrus of a man who, literally and figuratively, pushes his weight 
            around the house like an overgrown bully. “Any funny business,” he 
            menaces Harry before a family outing to the zoo, “and it’s no meals 
            for a week!”</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Fast forward to the zoo, where 
            Harry demonstrates why he is different from his boring, muggle 
            relatives. He converses with snakes. He causes glass walls to 
            disappear.&nbsp; Soon, such unique powers prompt the folks at Hogwarts to 
            summon Harry into their enchanted university. He’s ready to polish 
            up his alchemy and magic, and become a first-string wizard.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The next third of the movie 
            involves Harry’s training at the Hogwarts School, strewn across a 
            medieval castle on a desolate island.&nbsp; The imagery is dark and 
            gothic as Hagrid helms a boat full of Hogwart students from the 
            mainland to their new stomping grounds, but upon their arrival, the 
            school echoes those stuffy, English private schools from <i>Chariots 
            of Fire</i> or <i>Dead Poets Society</i>. It’s <i>The Paper Chase</i> 
            meets <i>The Witches of Eastwick</i>, as Harry conforms to the 
            establishment’s rules just enough to avoid expulsion, while breaking 
            them just enough to unearth mysteries from his past. For instance, 
            precisely what happened to Harry’s deceased parents, and why is he a 
            celebrity around Hogwarts' staff and students? </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Director Columbus paints his 
            overwhelming set pieces using confident, epic stokes.&nbsp; A 
            cathedral-like banquet room hosts white candles suspended in 
            mid-air.&nbsp; One minute, the hundreds of brass plates lining each table 
            are empty – with the flick of a wand, they’re alive with the 
            organic, fresh color of exotic fruits, vegetables, and meat.&nbsp; The 
            dazzling visual panache of <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone</i> 
            is comparable such feasts for the eyes as <i>What Dreams May Come</i> 
            and <i>Gladiator</i> in terms of scope and creativity. Covered in 
            emerald-green grass, a playing field hosts the fast-action game of 
            Quidditch, a kind of wizard’s hockey involving flying broomsticks 
            and balls with names like Bludgers, Quaffles, and The Golden 
            Snitch.&nbsp; This well-staged game played between two student teams 
            brings to mind the kinetic rush of <i>The Phantom Menace</i>’s 
            frantic pod race.&nbsp; A three-headed dog threatens Harry with snarling 
            lips and copious drool.&nbsp; A menacing ogre (think <i>Shrek</i> gone 
            postal) faces off with Harry, and is put in his place via a 
            strategically placed wand.&nbsp; An army of hooting owls drops hundreds 
            of snowflake-like telegrams from the sky.&nbsp; At these moments, <i>
            Harry Potter</i> shows the promise of a potential children’s classic 
            – something ranking with <i>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory</i>,
            <i>E.T</i>., or <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>.&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Alas, it is not to be.&nbsp; Like Steven 
            Spielberg’s overreaching <i>Hook</i>, or George Lucas’s <i>The 
            Phantom Menace</i>, the movie’s sense of wonder is deflated by long, 
            expository scenes, in which characters are introduced and plot 
            points are clarified.&nbsp; For instance, Alan Rickman emerges as a goth-garbed 
            alchemist (and dead ringer for the similarly sinister Trent Reznor 
            of industrial band Nine Inch Nails) who may or may not be Harry’s 
            nemesis.&nbsp; He’s a dour, sneering prince of darkness with great 
            potential, but the buildup leads nowhere.&nbsp; Harry’s Hogwarts friends, 
            the earnest, red-headed Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), and the 
            know-it-all Hermione Granger (Emily Watson), are enthusiastically 
            played by game young actors, but even they have little room to 
            breathe as full-blown characters.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the villain is a 
            mostly-absent fiend named Voldemort, whose climactic battle with 
            Harry is a bit of a dud.&nbsp; Where’s Darth Vader when you need him?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Even so, <i>Harry Potter and the 
            Sorcerer’s Stone</i> will not disappoint Rowling’s legions of fans. 
            Played by Daniel Radcliffe, Harry comes across as a humble bloke who 
            enjoys a good laugh and stands up for what’s right.&nbsp; When Draco 
            Malfoy (Felton) a cut-throat, competitive student and Harry's rival, 
            steals the magical orb of an injured rival, Harry has the guts to 
            retrieve it.&nbsp; He’s like a more scholarly, understated Luke 
            Skywalker.&nbsp; Too bad his film didn’t boast a more potent villain, or, 
            at a sleep-inducing two-and-a-half-hour running time, a better 
            editor. Without these two key players, <i>Harry Potter</i> risks 
            turning into something even worse than a toad – <b><i>Harry Plodder</i></b>.</font>
