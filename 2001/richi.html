            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As might be expected at the center
            of a film about the Yakuza, there's nearly always an archetypal hit
            man who takes a little too much joy in his work, and Takashi Miike's
            <i>Ichi the Killer</i> doesn't disappoint. This one, named Kakihara
            (Tadonobu Asano), sports a bleached-blonde pompadour, as well as a
            taste for S&amp;M. He is searching for a missing Yakusa boss named
            Anjo, both for the sake of &quot;family&quot; pride and power, but
            also because Anjo introduced him to the pleasures involved in
            receiving as well as giving pain (although Kakihara evidently still
            possesses a preference for the latter; there is one scene involving
            meat hooks and boiling oil which is best left to the imagination).
            Complete with a sadistic giggle which grates on the nerves, he's
            like a Japanese version of Tommy Udo, the villain from Henry
            Hathaway's 1947 <i>noir </i>classic, <i>Kiss of Death</i> (but at
            least he doesn't run around calling everyone &quot;squirt&quot;).</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While Kakihara is running around
            upsetting the yakusa social order, two mysterious figures enter his
            life. One is a erstwhile gangster named Jijii (Shinya Tsukamoto) who
            might have information relevant to Anjo's disappearance, but he soon
            disappears before he can provide it. The second, and strangest of
            all, is a lummox named Ichi, whose behavior veers wildly between
            passive and homicidal. Equipped with a bodysuit emblazoned with a
            super-hero insignia, knives, and a vast knowledge of kung fu, Ichi
            is transformed into the savior who appears at the scene of the crime
            in the proverbial nick of time, or, rather, he would be, if he was
            more discriminate in his attacks. Once Kakahara discovers Ichi, the
            hit man's motives become less focused upon pursuing anyone who can
            assist him in locating Anjo.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After surviving 129 minutes of
            graphic depictions of violence that escalate to and beyond the
            points of comprehension and even tolerance, one has to ask whether <i>Ichi
            the Killer</i> is a legitimate forum for exploring human attitudes
            towards violence . The director has justified the level of violence
            he depicts in his films by saying that audiences aren't shocked
            enough by the content in films currently in release; this time, he
            may have just reached his own personal apogee. But, by doing so, is
            he raising yet again the usual questions about creating and
            perceptions of visual media that still remain outside the realm of
            consensus, such as the responsibilities of both artist and the
            public in creating violent art (i.e. is it not only a case of
            &quot;if you build it, will they come,&quot; but also &quot;they
            will come because you built it&quot;?)? The answer really has to be
            no; on balance, the film is more exploitative than exploratory.
            Miike permits -- one might say, obliges -- the audience to witness
            the violence either through Kakahara's point of view, or from the
            neutral perspective of a middle-shot range. Thus, the film's
            attitude oscillates between sadism and indifference to suffering.
            This is not the comic, over-the-top violence seen in other Japanese
            films like <i>Battle Royale</i>: violence with a human dimension,
            one that is not necessarily symbolic, but one that does allow for
            development of relationships between others and a sense that
            something greater is at stake (The only duo who possess a mutual
            bond in <i>Ichi</i> is introduced and dispatched as quickly as
            possible, making Miike's priorities very clear.). To assert that <i>Ichi
            the Killer</i> possesses any sort of deeper message is to grant the
            film more credit than it deserves.</font></p>
