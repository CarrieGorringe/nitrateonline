            the start of the American home video version of Rob Sitch's
            inaugural sleeper, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Castle</i>,
            the first preview promotes <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">A
            Walk on the Moon</i>, which coincidentally deals with the same
            historical imprint as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Dish</i>,
            his second feature born from the same mixed-up working-dog minds
            responsible for both extremely enjoyable Australian ensemble
            comedies. The new film is a whimsical, character-driven charmer
            based on a little known episode surrounding the 1969 lunar landing,
            wherein a mammoth, 1,000-ton radio telescope—the most powerful in
            the Southern Hemisphere—becomes the primary receiver for the
            televised pictures of mankind's first steps on the moon. Armed with
            the marketing clout of Warner Bros., a growing number of favorable
            reviews, and great word-of-mouth, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Dish</i> blasts off into the proud skies that shine on a nation and
            the world, as a small group of persevering scientists, a wacky slice
            of small-town humor, and a big metal dish in the middle of a sheep
            paddock combine for a triumphant splash down for extended orbits at
            area theaters. Gale force success predicted.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Most
            of us here in the States think of Mad Max and Crocodile Dundee as
            prime Aussie filmmaking commodities, but <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Dish</i> is destined to become much more than a down-under footnote
            in global cinematic history. The underlying element of ingenuity in
            the face of adversity is similar to that found in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">October
            Sky</i>, Joe Johnston's affectionate tale of budding aeronautical
            talent in the backwoods of a West Virginia mining town. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Dish</i> bears a comic affinity as much to the British Ealing
            comedies of fifty years ago as it does to Australia's quirky, more
            recent, counterparts; films like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Muriel's
            Wedding</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Strictly
            Ballroom</i> (edited by Jill Bilcock, who spliced and diced <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Dish</i>). The story was actually mulled around by producer-writers <span style="color:black">Santo
            Cilauro, Tom Gleisner, Jane Kennedy, and Rob Sitch long before they
            made <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Castle</i>.</span><o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Told
            in extended flashback, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Dish</i> begins with a gray-haired, liver-spotted Cliff Buxton (Sam
            Neill) reflecting upward on the heroic moments of 30 years earlier,
            looking skyward at the football field-wide telescope in rural
            Parkes, New South Wales. This scene is reminiscent of one that
            begins <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Castle</i>, where
            daffy patriarch Darryl Kerrigan stares up at his own family's
            dish—a television aerial atop his tacky domicile. It's the same
            reflection of pride in their eyes, of a gratifying humanist
            determination that imbues each film with ultimate David vs. Goliath
            undertones. In the former, it's a family and community's battle
            against a real estate conglomerate; in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Dish</i> the enemies are the freakish forces of nature. Pluckish wit
            and disarming humor are the sling-filled stones that defeat each
            giant. One small satisfying tv antenna for man, one large inspiring <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Dish</i>
            for mankind.<o:p>

            the secondary of two central communications points (the other being
            in Goldstone, California), the Parkes observatory was called into
            action when the crew of Apollo XI decided to alter their moonwalk
            schedule. Prior to that last-minute adjustment, the townspeople had
            been preparing for the arrival of the amiable American Ambassador
            (John McMartin) and Australia's puffy Prime Minister (Bille Brown),
            part of the week long celebration in advance of the man-on-the-moon
            outing. Homespun mayor Bob McIntyre (Roy Billing), instrumental for
            the building of the telescope in his burb's backyard, tries to
            remain calm amid the town's excited citizens, his socially liberated
            wife May (Genevieve Mooy), their two children, and the staff manning
            the telescope.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            scientists form their own microcosm. Senior scientist Buxton is a
            recently widowed, pipe-smoking, calming center of the encroaching
            storm. Swirling around the dishmaster are Ross &quot;Mitch&quot;
            Mitchell, a bitchin' technician who fears his cultural territory
            being invaded by &quot;Ugly&quot; American and NASA consultant Al
            Burnett (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Seinfeld</i>'s
            Patrick Warburton). Social butterfly and electronics whiz Glenn
            Latham (Tom Long) finds it's easier to locate a lost spacecraft than
            to break the ice with the lovely, cashmere-encrusted, mini-skirted
            town beauty Janine (Eliza Szonert), who provides snacks to the men
            and her brother Rudi (Tayler Kane), a bumbling, over-precautious
            security guard at the installation.<o:p>

            all flecked with abundant humor, arrive when a temporarily blackout
            (&quot;Not that damn pie server&quot; the mayor suggests as the
            cause of the disaster) drives the dish out of whack and out of touch
            with the moon-bound astronauts. A slick cover-up by the scientific
            quartet keeps Houston busy as the boys of summer get out their slide
            rules, blackboard and chalk, and thinking caps to fix the problem.
            The unannounced arrival of the U.S. Ambassador at this most
            inopportune time provides for one of the funniest bits that leave
            the diplomat fully impressed yet blissfully unaware that all contact
            with the shuttle has been lost.<o:p>

            the yokels party, welcoming their overseas guest with a truly
            inspired rendition of a national anthem unlike any other, another
            destiny-filled moment occurs just before Neil Armstrong settles to
            the lunar surface: sixty-five-mile-per-hour winds pummel the area
            and elicit duct-tape heroics of grand proportions.<o:p>

            Sitch doesn't misstep in getting honest performances from every
            member of his laid-back cast. The pace is pleasantly brisk and Sitch
            has a marvelous flare for showing Parkes in wonderful light,
            especially in early morning sequences when the town awakens (the
            milk truck in the street, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Good Morning Starshine</i> on the soundtrack). Even the smaller roles
            (the mayor's kids, the brave but oblivious reservist cadet/next-door
            neighbor) manage their own small poignant moments.<o:p>

            cheering and comedy never stop in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Dish</i>. The sugar-coated back-slapping daring-do of the filmmakers
            and the performers is glazed with more than enough intelligence,
            perfect timing, and a rousing soundtrack (featuring well-selected
            hits of the day) that leaves little escape not to be honestly moved
            to tears and laughter after watching the film. We who were glued to
            our television sets back in '69 can now gloriously relive the
            moment. Beyond it's historical perspective, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Dish</i> is an entertaining, funny, and strong lesson in
            collaborative initiative, community spirit, and a rousing sense of
            humor. What a lovely adventure!<o:p>
