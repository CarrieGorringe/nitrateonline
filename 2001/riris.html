            review by <a href="../gianni.html" target="_top">Gianni Truzzi</a>, 14 December 2001</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Imagine the personal ad:
            awkward, pudgy young Oxford professor of English literature with
            speech impediment wishes to meet lively and brilliant sex kitten for
            bike rides, swimming and exchange of manuscripts. If such a pairing
            seems unlikely, it makes the true-life romance and lifelong pairing
            of John Bayley and acclaimed literary novelist Iris Murdoch all the
            more astounding.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Watching
            their story in the new film <i>Iris</i>, one understands afresh
            Murdoch's quip, &quot;Writing is like getting married. One should
            never commit oneself until one is amazed at one's luck.&quot;</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Based largely on Bayley's memoir, <i>Elegy
            for Iris,</i> Judi Dench plays Murdoch in the last five years of her
            life, a celebrated grand dame of letters struggling to complete her
            twenty-seventh novel as the fog of Alzheimer's descends. It's a grim
            fate for a woman whose entire life has been spent with words, from
            proclaiming the gospel of precise expression on television
            interviews to complaining in the grocery about the misuse of
            language on canned vegetables. &quot;Without words, how does one
            think?&quot; asks Kate Winslet in flashback as the young Iris, a<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>vivacious, scandalously indiscreet, Oxford scholar. It seems
            all the more tragic when, in her seventies, the words flee from her,
            leaving her helpless.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Despite Murdoch's literary stature
            (and Dench's imposing presence), it's Bayley who is the more curious
            and compelling figure. Anyone can -- and does, it seems -- fall for
            vibrant young Iris (even easier when she's Winslet), but what does
            she see in <i>him</i>? He is a plain man, stammering and proper.
            When Iris visits him in his rooms, he protests that he's not
            supposed to have young women there. When she kisses his wrist, he
            brings up marriage. Even in his dotage when the grocery clerk offers
            him premium points, he asks, &quot;Are we entitled?&quot; Sure, he's
            sweet, gentle and gallant, but since when has that been enough to
            win a wild woman's heart?</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hugh Bonneville and Jim Broadbent,
            who play (respectively) the younger and older man, are so unified in
            their masterful performances that one has to double-take the credits
            to confirm that the part was played by two actors. Jointly, they
            convey the quality that drew Murdoch to him, a quiet but genuine
            intelligence that could match her own frantic genius. Bayley was
            himself an admired, if less revered novelist, and chaired the
            committee for the Booker prize. With him, she could think, even
            wordlessly.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Winslet has now had ample
            opportunity to demonstrate in her post-<i>Titanic </i>roles that she
            can act, once given a decent script (like <i>Quills</i>). Here, she
            displays a rascally magnetism, with a deeply concealed inner life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Bonneville asks her, a little too juicily, if she also sleeps
            with women, and Winslet's silence is a rich feast for the
            imagination.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Murdoch's emphasis on the weight of
            words makes a reviewer consider his own. <i>Iris</i> commands
            superlatives; the film is important, powerful, absorbing. Primary
            screenwriter Charles Wood (best know for his adaptations of the
            Sharpe novels for the BBC) shows he is worthy of Murdoch's demanding
            precision, the way he employs slim dialogue to exacting efficiency.
            Yet what <i>Iris </i>is not -- like the real Murdoch, some might say
            -- is enjoyable.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Nor is it completely truthful. I
            would be loath to dispense with Winslet's performance, but to be
            accurate, she is nearly ten years too young. Murdoch was 35 when she
            met Bayley, a 29-year-old virgin, at Oxford. She had already worked
            as assistant principal at Treasury, and then for the UN Relief and
            Rehabilitation Administration, joined and abandoned the Communist
            Party. The film also leaves you with the impression that, once
            Murdoch decided Bayley was a worthy suitor, she committed herself to
            him faithfully. Alas, she did not, continuing to have affairs after
            they were married.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">By devoting so much screen time to
            her declining years, the film becomes less about Murdoch's
            brilliance than the disease that took it. Watching Iris's growing
            non-sequiteurs (&quot;When are we leaving?&quot; becomes as
            torturous as <i>Marathon Man</i>'s<i> </i>&quot;Is it safe?&quot;),<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>and Bayley's loving patience only underscores how Alzheimer's
            is a thoroughly hopeless ailment. The literary couple who devoted
            themselves to writing (her at a desk, him with the typewriter
            balanced on his knees) never owned a television until Murdoch's
            final months -- so she could watch <i>Teletubbies</i>.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But ultimately, the film is about
            love and, as hard as some of it can be to watch, the fact that it
            deals with the subject without much varnish is its saving grace.
            Murdoch was right, her luck was unbelievably good, and, fortunately
            for her, she had the good sense to recognize it when it came.</font>
