            and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

            misguided marketing campaign that entices you with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Ghost</i>-like curiosity, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Bone
            Collector</i> police intrigue, twist-of-fate <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Sixth Sense </i>conundrums, and love with the mysteriously improper
            stranger ramifications. That might be enough to lure you into the
            theater, but you'll want to join in a class-action complaint to the
            FTC because Luis Mandoki's queasy direction of such a hybrid script
            provides only a thinly-spread wholly mess that's less then the
            promised sum of its divergent parts. Poor forlorn J. Lo is
            bed-ridden with a depressing case of blue flu playing hard nosed
            South Side Chicago street cop Sharon Pogue opposite battle-scarred
            accident victim Catch—&quot;just Catch&quot; (Jim <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Frequency </i>Caviezel), a dazed and confused good Samaritan caught in
            life's headlights too many times. There's more excess emotional
            baggage behind the two leads than Anne Robinson carries behind her
            weakest link on any &quot;good&quot; day.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Director
            Mandoki delves into personal demons here just as he did with his
            half-baked romantic drama <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Message
            in a Bottle</i>. There may not be a stormy, hanky-drenched ending in
            <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Angel Eyes</i>, but the trite
            dialogue and tear-jerky ending certainly runs aground. And both
            boats carry the same depressing crew of death-framed stragglers-on,
            looking for love in all the wrung-out places. Trade in introverted
            widower Kevin Costner for soft-spoken, near-comatose widower
            Caviezel; winsome Windy City journalist Robin Wright evolves into
            curious Chicago cop J. Lo. Do we see a pattern here?<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">A
            year after a horrible car wreck opens the film, disheveled mess
            Catch wanders the streets turning of car lights and returning
            apartment keys forgotten on the wrong side of the door. Tough-cookie
            copper Sharon is marked as the family outcast after busting her dad
            (Victor Argo) for beating his wife (Sonia Braga) years earlier. Now
            she's pissed that her weak-willed mother has agreed to renew wedding
            vows with the brute, so she snaps on her sports bra, peels on her
            Kevlar vest, and takes out her aggression on any local thug who
            crosses her path. Catch, ever the watchful angel, becomes the errant
            knight in dull, smelly armor and thereafter her ghostly romantic
            interest. Scenes in which he regularly delivers groceries to Elanora
            Davis (Shirley Knight), a disabled woman who always turns two framed
            photos face down when Catch enters her life, add to the
            &quot;what-the-heck-does-that-mean&quot; moments that pepper the
            film. Another jazz club scene makes you question how many times
            DiPego's script is going to take us down the wrong alley.<o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">You
            may end up watching the film closer than you should, looking for
            tell-tale scenes of the enigma that is Catch. Does he sleep? (Maybe,
            he's got a moth-eaten mattress in his otherwise barren apartment.)
            Does he eat? (God, who knows what might be in his refrigerator!)
            Does he sip that beer in his hand? (This is Chicago, buddy.) Is this
            film for real? (You tell me!) Other questions come to mind. Does
            Catch ever shower? How can Sharon stand his presumed body order? I
            assume he brushes his clean, sparkly teeth, although after a year in
            the streets the enamel should have stained based on the rest of his
            mental condition and physical appearance.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            constantly roving, hand-held camera often tracks behind his angel
            eyes and Polish director of photography Piotr Sobocinski (who sadly
            passed away while on location in Vancouver for Mandoki's next film, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">24
            Hours</i>) gives this tilt-a-whirl view a rough-seas, other-world
            feel that seduces the viewer into thinking something else is afoot,
            when the end result is merely a slight nauseous sensation. When
            focused on Sharon's street-fighting, crime-bashing techniques, the
            mood switches to close up <b><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

            skinhead's face.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Caviezel's
            moody performance portrays the self-inflicted sadness as the eternal
            loner. &quot;I don't talk to a lot of people,&quot; he
            half-heartedly offers when trying to initiate conversation with the
            physically and mentally wounded Sharon. He may be smitten, but
            damned if he shows it.<o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For
            two characters whose lives are so spiritually intertwined after a
            tragic auto wreck, you would think that when they finally find a
            road out of their loneliness they would at least be wearing
            SEATBELTS! Right. Done once you can blame it on a bad continuity
            check. It is unconscionable that the film does it twice. For what
            little the film has going for it, you don't want to deflate their
            life-renewed balloon and alienate any safety-conscious viewers with
            such a dimwitted oversight. Granted, Mandoki is not the only
            director who has made such goofs (Henry Bromell likewise screwed up
            in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Panic</i>), but here it's almost like a plot twist.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Anyway,
            there's just nothing terribly special here to merit the ride in
