            the year 2176 AD, the face of technology marches ever onward. The
            planet Mars has been no stranger to change over the past 200 years:
            thanks to the miracle of terraforming, the red planet now has the
            ability to sustain life. 640,000 colonists call the dusty ball home,
            fighting to tame the harsh frontier.</b><o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            the outpost of Chryse City, a badly damaged commuter train returns
            on auto-pilot. Investigators soon discover that the vehicle is
            deserted, save for a Martian police officer named Lt. Melanie
            Ballard (Natasha Henstridge), who has been severely wounded and
            chained to a bed railing. Demanding an immediate report, the Martian
            rulers hold an exploratory hearing. This is the setting for most of
            the story, which is told in flashback as Ballard narrates the events
            that preceded her strange arrival in Chryse City. Ballard spins
            quite a tale, one which the committee has a great deal of trouble
            swallowing. Melanie had been sent, along with her commander Helena
            (Pam Grier) and a host of other police officers, to Shining Canyon
            Station (a place rather like <i>Star Wars's</i> Mos Eisley, but
            without the pulse) to supervise the transfer of prisoner James
            &quot;Desolation&quot; Williams (Ice Cube) to a more secure locale.
            Williams, a fiendishly intelligent criminal, is suspected of
            murdering six people, and requires close supervision -- hence the
            large detail of police.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Once
            inside the jail, however, Ballard and her companions find several
            anomalies, not the least of which is the complete absence of all the
            guards -- the inmates, literally, have taken over the asylum. Even
            more bizarre, arguably, is the discovery of Whitlock (Joanna
            Cassidy), a woman who voluntarily committed herself to the prison
            because, she said, jail was &quot;the last safe place&quot; for her.
            When prompted for an explanation, she reveals that a strange force
            has been unleashed on the surface of the planet, something with the
            ability to possess a person's mind and body, converting them into a
            helpless puppet controlled by an unseen force -- a Ghost of Mars. Is
            Williams behind the disappearances of the prison staff, or do
            Whitlock's claims have any basis in fact? This is what Ballard and
            her friends must find out. (Hint: Look at the title of the movie.)<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Although
            brimming with expensive-looking costumes and sets, <i>Ghosts of Mars</i>
            has a darker, grittier feel than much of Carpenter's recent work; in
            terms of tone, it's far more similar to the sparse <i>Assault on
            Precinct 13</i> than, say, <i>In the Mouth of Madness</i>. The film
            is part ghost story and part war flick, and contains a great deal of
            suspense and action. Or, more correctly, it contains a great deal of
            suspense, followed by a great deal of action. If you've seen Robert
            Rodriguez's <i>From Dusk Till Dawn</i>, you'll understand what I
            mean: the first half of the story, which sets the plot in motion, is
            primarily concerned with establishing a dark, brooding, atmosphere
            full of intrigue and mystery. The movie's second half, on the other
            hand, is concerned with blood, death, quick editing, and lots of
            running and jumping. Nothing wrong with that, of course, but the
            mindless (and at times overwhelming) amount of action can catch
            viewers off-guard if they aren't prepared.<o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            always, John Carpenter is confident and sure behind the camera,
            giving us a film that looks consistently terrific, if uncomplicated
            from a technical standpoint. He's the consummate cinematic
            craftsman, known to spend insane amounts of time on any given shot
            in order to get it photographed in exact accordance to his wishes.
            I'm not sure where the film ranks in Carpenter's canon, however: <i>Ghosts
            of Mars</i> is not <i>Halloween</i> or <i>The Thing</i> -- heck,
            it's not even <i>Vampires</i> -- but one gets the sense that the
            director wasn't trying to best his other films. There are none of
            the usual Carpenter trademarks that die-hard fans such as myself
            have come to expect, including highly stylistic camera movements and
            long, unbroken takes. <i>Ghosts</i>, in many ways, feels more like
            homage to the genres of the past, including the western picture
            (Carpenter's acknowledged favorite genre), and the beloved zombie
            flicks of George Romero (<i>Night of the Living Dead</i>, etc).<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I
            cannot gush enough about the film's excellent art and production
            design, which paint the dusty plains of Mars in a strikingly
            beautiful way. Filmed almost entirely at night, the movie's set
            design emphasizes the stark loneliness and isolation of the titular
            locale, with red-tinged dust clinging to every conceivable surface,
            and yet even amongst the blood and carnage of the final act, the
            planet is never anything less than hauntingly beautiful. The sense
            of Mars as a real place came through quite clearly here -- no small
            feat.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">John
            Carpenter is a master (or at least a frequent employer) of abrupt,
            ambiguous endings, and <i>Ghosts of Mars</i> continues his tradition
            of crafting a conclusion that raises more questions than it answers.
            Although this lack of closure is often unsatisfying on the first
            viewing, it does give Carpenter's best work a tenacity that far
            surpasses other filmmakers' more prosaic offerings. But <i>Ghosts of
            Mars</i> is a little disappointing because it spends so much of its
            time <b><i>implying</i></b> closure and resolution (via its use of
            flashbacks), and then not following up, or even explaining the
            origin of the things we see. I can't decide if the film's final
            scene is left ambiguous for dramatic effect, or merely because
            Carpenter and Screen Gems are hoping to spin the story off into a
            sequel. It seems like the wrong choice to me, but it's a small flaw
            in an otherwise enjoyable action-adventure-horror-sci-fi romp.<o:p>

            warned, however: there is rather a lot of blood and gore here --
            including a number of graphic decapitation sequences -- that could
            potentially upset more sensitive viewers. Factor this into your
            viewing decision.)</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
