            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700">
            <font size="2">Jack the Ripper is the ostensible subject of Albert 
            and Allen Hughes' <i>From Hell</i>, but this legendary figure is 
            more a point of departure, an obviously sensational hook, than the 
            film's focus. The real subject is the street, or rather, the street 
            as a cultural concept, simultaneously brutal and beautiful. From the 
            moment the camera begins its descent -- from a breathtakingly lurid 
            orange skyscape, down into the filthy closeness of London's 
            Whitechapel slum, 1888 -- it's clear that <i>From Hell </i>takes its 
            own title quite literally. As the camera continues moving, now 
            sinuously tracking the red-haired prostitute Mary Kelly (Heather 
            Graham, who, it must be said, looks far too milky and soft to be 
            living Mary's hard life) through back alleys and past dingy 
            doorways, the city's dark ferocity is almost palpable. </font>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">It's a 
            self-consciously &quot;cinematic&quot; opening, technically stunning and 
            indicating immediately that the movie is as interested in the ways 
            stories are told as in the stories themselves. <i>From Hell</i> is 
            about the ways that economic, cultural, and political systems -- 
            systems visible day to day on the street -- create monsters. Even 
            beyond this, and much like the Hugheses' previous films (<i>Menace 
            II Society</i>, <i>Dead Presidents</i>, and <i>American Pimp</i>), 
            it is about the intimate relations between media and monstrosity.
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The Hugheses' 
            choice this time to tell the Ripper story is appropriate in all the 
            ways that they have been articulating in interviews: never 
            identified, he has become an enduring emblem of street violence and 
            the basis of endless stories. He killed at least five prostitutes 
            (or, as they were delicately referred to at the time, 
            &quot;unfortunates&quot;) with ritualistic, obviously well-educated precision, 
            often cutting out their genitals or internal organs (livers and 
            uteri), and (perhaps) writing cruel, smug letters to the London 
            newspapers and police department. Though it's not clear whether any 
            of these letters was genuine, at least one suggested the Ripper's 
            grim, long-term effect: &quot;One day men will look back and say that I 
            gave birth to the twentieth century.&quot; </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">It's a bloody, 
            awful process. The fact that the Hugheses open their film with these 
            words underlines the connections among the street, the century, and 
            the self-consciousness enabled and even necessitated by media, press 
            and movies included. Where other films of the Ripper tale have been 
            chastely spooky, this one vividly exposes the dreadful Victorian 
            moment that produced Jack, with scenes detailing the surgical 
            classes at London Hospital (specifically, the performance of frontal 
            lobotomies, with appalling needles); the Prince of Wales's &quot;secret&quot; 
            syphilis; the commercial exploitation of John Merrick (the Elephant 
            Man, who first appears in <i>From Hell</i> on the very street where 
            Jack skulks, then again as he's put on display for a titillated, 
            well-dressed crowd); and everyday horrors endured by poor folks. 
            Filmed in disorienting swish pans, time-lapse, and digital 
            discoloration (the greens here are just painful), the murders are 
            increasingly graphic. And though Peter Deming's camera never lingers 
            on these violent tableaux, they are nonetheless instantly effective, 
            and with them, the film invites you inside the monster's mind.
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">This invitation 
            is proffered through the film's moral center, intrepid Inspector 
            Fred Abberline (Johnny Depp), but it's never easy to accept. 
            Certainly, Abberline is charismatic (he's Johnny Depp!), but he's 
            also wracked by dysfunction and personal pain. Aided by his 
            rock-steady associate, Sergeant Godley (Robbie Coltrane), and using 
            the few crude tools available to nineteenth-century forensics, 
            Abberline studies wounds and crime scenes, consults surgeons, 
            attempts to reconstruct the killer's thinking, and, most terribly, 
            suffers skitchy, disturbing &quot;visions&quot; of the murders while under the 
            influence of opium and laudanum-laced absinthe. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">He's a 
            sympathetic addict, complete with a recognizable motive (grief over 
            his wife's death during childbirth a couple of years before), but 
            like the Ripper, he is a product of his environment, a reflection 
            and judgment of urban &quot;progress.&quot; In fact, one of Abberline's 
            hallucinatory rushes is introduced by the camera's descent into a 
            gramophone (strangely, recalling a similar descent into Jeffrey/Kyle 
            MacLachlan's ear, in <i>Blue Velvet</i>), as if the machine's very 
            nature, its capacity for reproduction and artifice, makes it somehow 
            suspect, an emblem of modernity's continuous collapsing of what's 
            real or meaningful and what's not. This lack of distinction is 
            troubling for any number of reasons, not least for the legal and 
            social confusions it allows (Where is the line between insanity and 
            sanity? Does insanity absolve criminals of responsibility? Can a 
            callous or neglectful society be held accountable for the insanity 
            of its members?) Abberline's role in this is to embody sober insight 
            and moral perspective while walking, or maybe imagining, the thin 
            line between fact and fiction. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">And of course, 
            Abberline's high offers no escape from his tragic memories or 
            questions about his career choice (to be a cop in this vile time and 
            place simply offers no reward), only more intense perceptions of 
            everything. The high is as metaphorical as it is literal, anyway. 
            You never see Abberline make a street buy, for instance, but when, 
            in search of information, he must mingle with members of high 
            society, his face seems especially pale and his lips tight with 
            distaste, as if he can barely stand it. For, as Abberline knows too 
            well, while the underclass streets put vice and misery on full view, 
            the less visible and more insidious depravity resides in privilege.
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">This is <i>From 
            Hell</i>'s point: the monstrosity of the class system that allows 
            the wealthy to believe they're not responsible for anything but 
            satisfying their own desires. In this, its 1888 London iteration, 
            this system victimizes white women most plainly, but the systemic 
            and results are similar to those versions that the Hugheses have 
            been dissecting in all their work. While the film ennobles the 
            Ripper's victims, showing Mary and her friends' heroic efforts to 
            survive -- to pay off street punks and bad cops, at the same time 
            that they must solicit the creepiest of clients -- it indicts those 
            who observe the Elephant Man with their hands placed delicately over 
            their mouths, or use prostitutes, drink, and drugs as cheap 
            stimulations. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Though 
            Abberline rejects the class sensibility, he nonetheless maintains 
            his own clandestine addiction, and is able to do so in part because 
            of his social standing (Godley covers for him, apparently 
            repeatedly). And so the film constructs a complex condemnation of 
            its primary target -- the decadence of what passes for &quot;normal&quot; 
            society -- by including its hero as part of the problem. Abberline's 
            own rejection of the tabloid coverage of the murders, not to mention 
            his inevitably failing efforts to control such coverage, makes him 
            seem even more sympathetic -- at the very same time that you are 
            participating in such tabloidish practice, as viewer of this movie. 
            For the storytelling here is all about the storytelling, the 
            ugliness of its material process, the solicitation of readers, the 
            recitation of &quot;facts,&quot; the production of answers. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Still, this 
            insight into the process doesn't exactly make up for the 
            less-than-convincing conclusion that <i>From Hell</i> comes to 
            regarding the Ripper's identity. As saturated as it is with 
            remarkable atmosphere and pointed politics, Terry Hayes and Rafael 
            Yglesias's script eventually does deliver a villain (and in a 
            decidedly corny way, including some frankly goofy Masonic 
            ritualizing of the murders and their motivations, whereby the film 
            at this point sort of veers into territory already traversed in <i>
            Eyes Wide Shut</i>: the psycho-sexual gyrations of an all-male club 
            makes for very perverse notions of righteousness and &quot;normalcy&quot;).
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">To be fair, the 
            film's educated guess as to the Ripper's identity is derived from 
            its source, Alan Moore and Eddie Campbell's remarkable 1999 graphic 
            novel (also called <i>From Hell</i>), and Moore has as much as 
            admitted that this is a guess that is more dramatically and 
            politically expedient than undeniably &quot;factual.&quot; Given the industry 
            that currently exists around the Ripper (which is comparable to the 
            JFK assassination conspiracy), the possibility of a single answer is 
            probably long gone. The many Ripperologists (those enthusiasts who 
            have studied the photos, drawings, descriptions, and reports, handed 
            down now for over 100 years), all have their pet theories, and many 
            of them disbelieve the one promulgated by <i>From Hell</i>, both 
            graphic novel and film. It seems clear enough that the primary 
            function of this identification in the film is to sustain its (the 
            film's) feminist and class analysis of the case and its presumed 
            cover-ups. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Despite this 
            capitulation to convention (that it must name a killer), the film 
            stubbornly and ultimately eschews an emotionally tidy resolution. 
            And so, the Ripper sustains his secret because he is created and 
            protected by his own kind. Abberline's fate is something else, part 
            tragic and part mythic. The lack of a &quot;happy ending&quot; is, no 
            surprise, of a piece with <i>From Hell</i>'s most dearly held 
            conviction, that the social, penal, and legal processes given such 
            vivid form by Jack the Ripper continue to this day. And that's the 
            real story that won't go away. </font></span></td>
