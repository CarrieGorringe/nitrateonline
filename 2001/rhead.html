            review by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 9 February
            2001</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Head
            Over Heels</i> is billed as a comedy, but it plays more like a
            Frankenstein monster. Assembled from together with clichés from
            several different genres, the movie lumbers along clumsily as if its
            legs were never meant to walk together. It took four credited
            writers (John J. Strauss, Ed Decter, David Kidd and Ron Burch) to
            try to glue all of this together, and their work doesn’t gel.
            Anemic hints of macabre, gross-out humor, corny <i>double entendres</i>
            and mawkish romanticism fall together as unnaturally and
            unconvincingly as the two leads.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Monica Potter (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Patch
            Adams</i>) stars as Amanda Pierce, an art restorer who throws
            herself into her work as an art restorer because her love life has
            been so disappointing. Men have dumped her or cheated on her with
            impunity. When her latest beau is found beneath another woman, she
            tries to find another place to live. The one place that is in her
            price range is a closet in expensive loft inhabited by four models:
            Jade (Shalom Harlow), Roxana Ivana Milicevic, Candi (Sarah O'Hare)
            and Holly Tomiko Fraser).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This setup is the first of several
            mistakes. Potter is simply too attractive to pass for a plain Jane.
            The only difference between her and her roommates is that she
            isn’t greedy or lobotomized. Even in her painting smocks, she
            looks so comely that when her roommates &quot;dress her for
            success,&quot; the audience can’t tell the difference. In
            addition, the quartet has one-note characters that aren’t
            particularly amusing. Candi, a backward Australian who fits every
            stereotype about blondes, has an incestuous personal history that is
            mistakenly played for laughs. Director Mark S. Waters, who also
            tried this angle in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The House
            of Yes</i>, may want to consider expanding his repertoire.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The center of the film is supposed
            to the relationship between Amanda and a young, wealthy fashion
            executive named Jim Winston (Freddie Prinze, Jr.). Like his
            predecessors, Winston seems ideal when introduced (except for his
            ferocious Great Dane). Her perceptions change when she believes that
            she witnesses him murdering a young woman. Waters handles the shift
            in moods awkwardly, and Prinze (like Harrison Ford in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">What
            Lies Beneath</i>) is not up to the challenge. With his puppy-dog
            eyes and earnest demeanor, it’s easy to see why he’s become a
            heartthrob. Nonetheless, he doesn’t demonstrate the range
            necessary to convince in this sort of role. The interaction between
            him and Potter isn’t terribly engaging or well thought out, so
            never once does a viewer get a sense they belong together.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Waters attempts to match the
            Farrelly brothers in a series of lame body functions jokes.
            Unfortunately, he lacks the siblings’ creativity. They have a
            knack for finding the dark side of using dental floss or hair gel,
            whereas Waters assumes that the sight of four women being sprayed by
            feces is amusing in itself. The director also attempts to stage some
            pratfalls, but he has no ideal how to shot or edit them (can you
            spot the stunt double?). The actors also have little idea how to
            perform them.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Just like an unholy creature put
            together from the dead, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Head
            Over Heels</i> threatens to fall apart in motion and lives up to its
            pledge.</font>
