surrounds Swinton in water, hot water, true, but symbolic<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>of her lonely character's isolated state. The mother of three, Swinton's<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Margaret Hall opens the film, her extreme closeup bathed in blue
artificial<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>light and cold steel as
she prepares for a confrontation with her seventeen-year-old<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>son's thirty-year-old lover. That the lover is another man seems
irrelevent until<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Margaret is
eventually confronted by a blackmailer's videotape. It reveals a<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>sexual act involving her child that skins this mother raw. The backdrop
of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Margaret's own eruptive sexual
and personal awakening is shadowed by a death,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>a cover-up and a journey ending in a lover's meeting that rattles
Margaret's<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>staid family foundation
as well as her dormant, repressed lust.<o:p>
</o:p>

</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
film is based upon the 1940's <b><i>noir</i></b> novel <i>The Blank Wall</i> by <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>Elisabeth
Sanxay Holding and contemporarily mirrors the 1949 Max Ophuls<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>directed thriller, <i>The Reckless Moment</i>, which starred Joan Bennett
in the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>pivotal resourceful mother
role and James Mason as her seductive blackmailer.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Swinton
is a marvel as Margaret, deftly generous in her ability to<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>present the character's clock-like, internal thought process and ultimate<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>transformation to the audience. That Goran Visnjic plays Alek, her<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>blackmailer-turned-salvation doesn't hurt either. The pair share a final <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>scene
that could go down in cinematic annals as both erotic and erratic. <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Swinton's
hard-working ethic roots from her collaborative &quot;laboratory&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>years with the late gay filmmaker, Derek Jarman, for whom she became
&quot;dearest<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>friend, surrogate
wife, muse,&quot; according to Jarman biographer Tony Peake. It<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>was an education she savors and values, an ingrained way of life that
gave<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the Scottish, Cambridge
scholar a strong base. Their &quot;marriage&quot; gave the film<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>world <i>The Last of England</i>, <i>War Requiem</i>, <i>The
Garden</i>, <i>Wittgenstein</i>,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>Blue
</i>and Swinton's award-winning role in <i>Edward II</i>.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">She
says she &quot;can't imagine life without that time because &quot;It's so<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>ingested.&quot;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;These
days particularly, talking to people in your position I realize<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>more and more what an extraordinary piece of luck it was,&quot; she says.
&quot;It<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>suited me so well and I
wonder if I would even be working in the cinema if I<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>hadn't met him. I think he made a filmmaker of me and I don't mean he
made a<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>director of me but he made a
filmmaker of everybody he worked with. He wanted<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>your sensibility. He wasn't interested in your skill, and
certainly I am not<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>apprised of
having any skill, he just wanted all of you so that's what I'm in<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>the habit of providing.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span>&quot;I do the same with David Siegel and Scott McGehee even though I
haven't<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>known them for eight years
and we haven't drummed up this project around the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>kitchen table together. This film was brought to me in a very orthodox
way -<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>it was already funded,
already written and it didn't need messing around<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>with. But I approached them in the same way as I have anybody else.&quot;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I've
also become knowledgeable about the process of filmmaking as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>I'm aware, more than ever, of what an actor's life is like, though I've
never<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>been very aware of an actor's
life because I don't know any actors and I very<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>rarely work with them and I'm only learning more about it from people
asking<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>me questions and realizing
the kinds of answers they're used to getting.&quot;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">She
says she astonished by actors who don't want &quot;involvement with the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>process&quot; and aren't &quot;knowledgeable or interested in the science
of it.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>&quot;I'm
too much of a scientist to want to be kept away from the smoke and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>mirrors aspect of it. I'm used to holding my own light,&quot; she
reminds.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I
note that she continues to work with people who enforce her credo -<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>John Maybury, Sally Potter, Lynn Hershman-Leeson - and she interrupts<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>excitedly, &quot;Absolutely, absolutely. That's my constituency, that's
where I<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>live. In fact, John Maybury
and I are working together again now. We're<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>developing a &quot;Medea&quot; project together.&quot;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I
ask if motherhood - Swinton<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>has
three-and-a-half year-old twins with her<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>partner, writer John Byrne - has changed the way she gauges
her roles. It's a<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>question that she
ponders momentarily and says, &quot;It's changed me on a<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>molecular basis as it couldn't fail to do.&quot;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;You
can't join up the dots really. I work my way through my curiosities<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>very slowly. I don't choose roles, I choose people, that's always what
I'm<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>going for; dialogue, the
filmmakers and then we can decide on what the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>projects are. Typically my interests determine the projects. For example,
I'd<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>only just had my babies when I started to think about <i>Medea</i>,
so I talked to<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>John Maybury and,
you know that's pretty sick to think about <i>Medea</i> after<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>giving birth, but it's true.&quot;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Tim
Roth came to me with <i>The War Zone</i> and the reason it was of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>interest to me at the time was because I knew I could take something<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>authentic to the film because I was on the verge of giving birth to twins
and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>had just given birth when we
shot the film. It was like serendipity. So what<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I'm interested in at the time affects absolutely what I do.
I'm very lazy and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>I have a low
boredom threshold and I know myself well enough to know if I<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>involve myself in something that's not going to engage me for the
duration of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the film, not to say
three years later, then it's not for me.&quot;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Swinton
enjoyed working with Siegel and McGehee because they had similar<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>values. &quot;We worked very closely on how to build up the [visual]
shorthand for<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>the audience, the signs and the signals. We worked closely on
the calibration<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>of the aesthetic
and the frame and therefore the calibration of the<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>performances. It was important to know what sort of weight was needed so,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>yes, we struck deals on the language we were going to be talking.&quot;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Much
of <i>The Deep End</i> represents a different kind of action picture.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Sure, the cerebral Swinton dives and runs but this is quintessentially<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>exhaustive, interiorized action that's antipodean to, say, the externally<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>physical thrashing about in Danny Boyle's more traditional adventure <i>The<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Beach</i>, in which Swinton played a catalyst role as cult leader, Sal.
Was <i>The<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Deep End</i>, with its
tense, internal coil, harder than traversing forests and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>jungles and seducing the likes of Leonardo DiCaprio?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's
a question that seems to delight Swinton.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Oh
no, no, not at all, no. You know, it's no effort for me at all to<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>think.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;In
fact,&quot; she laughs, &quot;this was really great.&quot;<o:p>
</o:p>
