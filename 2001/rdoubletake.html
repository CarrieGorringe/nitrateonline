            Chase (Orlando Jones) has it all -- a fine NYC apartment, designer
            suits, a prestigious job with a Wall Street Banking firm, a
            runway-model girlfriend named Chloe Kitt (Garcelle Beauvais), and a
            super-competent assistant (Vivica A. Fox) who anticipates his every
            need. But for all his worldly goods and breezy confidence, Daryl's
            got another thing coming, in the form of con man Freddy Tiffany
            (Eddie Griffin). Appearing first as a sidewalk breakdancer, wearing
            the requisite bright orange tracksuit and busting his moves outside
            Daryl's swank condo, Freddy improbably begins popping up repeatedly
            throughout the banker's well-ordered day (&quot;This is some
            easy-ass sh*t!,&quot; he exclaims, on seeing the office, &quot;Your
            fancy furniture and what-not!&quot;). This day and Daryl's comfy
            lifestyle are breaking down <i>seriously</i>, and according to some
            familiar, if barmy, devices. By the time Daryl is assaulted by a
            Mexican hitman and on the run from the NYPD, you see where this
            movie is headed: the out-of-touch rich guy will get his comeuppance
            at the hands of his new acquaintance.</b> <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Indeed,
            <i>Double Take</i> is, for the most part, just what it looks like.
            If you've seen <i>Bad Boys</i>, <i>Rush Hour</i>, <i>Blue Streak</i>,
            or even 1988's <i>Midnight Run</i> (not incidentally, written by <i>Double
            Take</i>'s writer-director, George Gallo), you've seen most
            everything this movie has to offer -- undercover missions and
            mistaken identities, bad cops and sneering drug dealers, psycho
            mafiosos and inept feds, competing egos and big guns, barely-clad
            beautiful women and some more big guns. Even the &quot;twists&quot;
            are routine: it won't surprise anyone that these nascent buddies
            aren't entirely who they appear to be, and their ostensibly
            unrelated dilemmas are actually closely connected. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At
            the same time, and as its title suggests, <i>Double Take</i> is a
            film that asks you to look again. And it does have a few tricks up
            its sleeve (emphasis on <i>few</i>). For one thing, it has an
            unlikely source. It's based on a 1957 drama starring Rod Steiger, <i>Across
            the Bridge</i>, which was in turn based on a Graham Greene novel.
            From this foundation, <i>Double Take</i> lifts basic plot elements,
            mostly having to do with Daryl taking Freddy's identity in order to
            flee to Mexico, where, he learns, Freddy is himself a wanted man.
            And why is Daryl going to Mexico? Here you have to bear with the
            script's many implausibilities -- after the Mexican hitman episode,
            he's advised by a CIA agent named McReady (Gary Grubbs), who has
            conveniently appeared to save him from the hitman, to go to Mexico.
            In an understandable panic-- as he notes, he's a black man being
            hunted by the cops in Manhattan -- Daryl agrees. He leaves Chloe and
            his credit cards behind and tries to board a train from Penn Station
            (that's right, a train to Mexico). At the station, he spots
            evil-looking suits everywhere, so when he (again!) runs into Freddy,
            who notes right away that Daryl looks scared: &quot;You got the
            NYPD-shoot-a-nigger-41-times-in-the-ass look!&quot; Just so, Daryl
            pleads with Mr. Streetwise to help him scam his way South. At
            Freddy's suggestion, they exchange clothes and IDs, at which point
            Freddy starts teaching Daryl how to walk and talk &quot;black&quot;
            (&quot;Put a little pep in your step!&quot;). The switch allows the
            actors to imitate each other's characters: Griffin does the
            Harvard-educated, suave and snooty executive, and Jones acts the
            foul-mouthed, crotch-grabbing, gold-toothed fool. The switch leads
            to a number of outsized comic exercises, including the challenge
            that Daryl issues to a nonplussed dining car waiter, in the scene
            running in the film's omnipresent ads: &quot;What!?! No Schlitz Malt
            Liquor!? You ain't representin'! You ain't keepin' it rrreeeaaal!&quot;

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Strangely,
            in a movie that so conspicuously flouts reality -- there's really
            not a reasonable plot turn or believable physical stunt in sight --
            this question of keeping it real ends up being front and center.
            Certainly, the question of what constitutes a genuine
            &quot;black&quot; identity has come up a lot in mainstream movies
            and tv, especially in relation to class (<i>Livin' Large</i>, <i>Strictly
            Business</i>, <i>The Fresh Prince of Bel Air</i> were early,
            notorious attempts to ask this question). In its own irreverent and
            frankly preposterous way, <i>Double Take</i> expands the parameters
            of this question, by revealing that any reality, in any culture and
            any movie genre, comes down to a matter of accepted conventions.
            What's &quot;real&quot; is what's believed and accepted at the
            moment, usually by the people with the power to enforce what they
            believe. The point that <i>Double Take</i> makes is this: once you
            throw the conventions out the window, all bets are off. And then
            anything can pass for real, even Freddy's patently absurd
            interpretations of events and unlikely master-spy abilities. <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            is not to say that <i>Double Take</i> holds together as anything
            resembling a realistic film. It does not. Irreverent and silly, it
            careens between being a not-very-suspenseful thriller and a broadly
            slapstick comedy, piling up all the usual action scenes, including
            the car chase, the shoot-out, the exploding truck, the assault by a
            team of sweaty, mustachioed Mexican border guards (though I will say
            that, compared to the last two U.S. movies I've seen set in Mexico, <i>Traffic</i>
            and <i>All the Pretty Horses</i>, <i>Double Take</i> may be least
            offensive regarding such stereotypes, precisely because it is so
            hyper-conscious of them as stereotypes). <i>Double Take</i>
            accelerates these predictable moments until they reach a kind of
            hyper-real warp speed (Malcolm Campbell's editing in these scenes is
            breakneck) and sets them to an appropriately bizarre, wha-wha
            '70s-style score by Graeme Revell. <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At
            the center of all this ruckus are the entirely unbelievable
            protagonists, whom Jones and Griffin more or less keep afloat by
            sheer force of will and a decent chemistry between them. While Jones
            has obvious mainstream appeal (even if you are sick to death of
            those obnoxious 7-Up commercials), the lesser known Eddie Griffin
            may be a harder sell for a Touchstone marketing campaign -- though
            again, judging by the deluge of ads, it appears they've reached a
            strategy). And Griffin does some with a fanbase who love his spastic
            comedy and undeniable electricity on screen, all underscored by
            Jones' well-timed straight-man reactions. That all their feuding
            will lead to a solid partnership is, of course, the film's foregone
            conclusion. Since Daryl is the one learning the righteous lesson, to
            trust his fellow black man, the film reassures viewers early on that
            Freddy is worthy. In particular, he has a straight-up weird but also
            adorable affection for a fluffy white doggie named Delores, who
            loves him in return. Their relationship is both cute (repeated shots
            of her tippy-tippying on her little toenails) and crude (repeated
            occasions where she's referred to as a &quot;bitch&quot; or Freddy's
            &quot;little white girlfriend&quot;), a mix that unexpectedly
            humanizes Freddy, while again, demonstrating that reality is
            probably overrated.</font><o:p>
