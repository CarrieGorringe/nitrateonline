            Flemish comedies go, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Everybody's
            Famous</i> is a low-brow, blue collar farce with as much charm as a
            spicy slice of Wynendale cheese, ideal for a quick bite of
            Flanders-based humor. Trying to find an American foothold might be
            another story for this Oscar nominated feature (losing out to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Crouching
            Tiger, Hidden Dragon</i>). As art house audiences here tend to like
            their foreign fare with subtitles instead of the more plebian
            dubbing, most of these viewers still aren't going to be too
            discriminating that this has Flemish dialogue instead of French,
            German, or any other unfamiliar language. The film wins because it
            spins a sweet tale fleshed out with well drawn characters and
            unsophisticated humor, in much the same way such brilliant
            Australian comedies like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Castle</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Muriel's Wedding</i>,
            and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Strictly Ballroom</i> have
            captured audiences' hearts over the last decade.<o:p>

            director-writer (and co-producer with his costume-designer wife
            Loret Meus) Dominique Deruddere's homespun tale about one
            well-meaning father's attempt to find fame and fortune for his
            overweight nightingale of a daughter—whose angelic voice turns
            sour when confronted with a lukewarm case of stage fright—is as
            flaky as a napoleon, and the ending might just leave you with a
            giggly custard cream smile.<o:p>

            <p><span style="color:black"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            story, broad as a smile, centers around Jean Vereecken, a mid-40s
            quality control technician working nights at a bottle factory. As
            dedicatedly portrayed by long-time friend (and godfather to one of
            the director's children) Josse De Pauw, a beloved Belgian actor
            whose career closely parallels Deruddere's, Jean dutifully earns the
            family bread. His wife Chantal (Gert Portael) suffers his remaining
            hours at home playing stage father for his soon-to-blossom
            seventeen-year-old Marva (newcomer Eva Van Der Gucht), named after a
            real-life Flemish singer popular in the 1970s. Jean still lives in
            that carefree decade of puffy floral shirts and mutton chops,
            despite the hard knocks of today's economy. And his business model
            collapses when his job of twenty-six years, that of his best friend
            Willy van Outreve (Werner De Smedt), and the rest of the plant are
            out of work when management declares bankruptcy. Despite the
            close-knit nature of the family, Jean keeps the news from his
            family, although I was hard pressed to believe at least some of his
            wife's friends had husbands sharing a similar fate worthy of
            neighborhood chit-chat.<o:p>

            <p><span style="color:black"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meanwhile,
            in the cutthroat world of media conglomerates, iridescent diva
            Debbie (Dutch heartthrob Thekla Reuten), a gorgeous chanteuse who
            entrances three million viewers every week, has the body and job to
            die for, but suffers the disappointment of a private life lost to a
            world where her face is recognized by every Thomas, Robbe, and Hugo
            in the far-flung corners of her adoring viewer arena. She rakes in
            tens of millions of dollars for her powerful manager Michael Jansen
            (Victor Löw), chockfull of the cunning and looks of Jann Wenner.<o:p>

            <p><span style="color:black"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As chance
            has it (the only way the story actually works), Debbie, on a rare
            day off, is bicycling along a canal path and happens upon Jean's
            broken down jalopy. She's hidden behind full biking regalia and
            helmet until she lets her hair out and shows her true colors…as an
            amateur car mechanic. She'd love to trade in her career for a good
            monkey wrench. Jean, armed with sleeping pills to battle his (non)
            work-induced insomnia, offers her some &quot;refreshment&quot; and
            she wakes up a day later, the subject of a pay-as-you-go kidnapping
            scheme that eventually involves Willy as his criminal cohort. Which
            suits the young lad just fine as his live-in girl friend off to a
            three-week conference in Madrid with a dark-skinned
            &quot;mathematician,&quot; only showing how much Willy is out of the
            social equation.<o:p>

            Well, Jean has been humming up a ditty that he wants his daughter to
            warble on <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Song Organ</i>, that ever-popular musical program. Over the course of a
            week he &quot;negotiates&quot; with Michael to audition Marva and
            doctor Jean's song up into a possible hit entitled <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Lucky
            Manuelo</i>. Debbie and Willy have their own agenda to follow, while
            Michael envisions a financial windfall, orchestrating his network to
            keep a stunned nation informed of the latest details in the
            ultra-hyped case (and selling millions of Debbie's new single), all
            the time tagging poor Jean, completely out of his element, along as
            for a fool's ride.<o:p>

            <p><span style="color:black"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For all
            the lunacy going on, the film never seems terribly frantic. It's
            pace is almost too leisurely. Yes, I admit it, the film's corny, but
            there's nothing wrong with this can of sweet, imported niblets.</font></span></p>
