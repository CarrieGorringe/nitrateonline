            beautiful work that deserves a better reception than you know it's
            going to get. It's a fact of American life that the surest way to
            ensure that only a handful of people will see or read something is
            to tag it with a label of highest praise: to call it literary.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p style="text-indent:0in;line-height:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            astounding debut of first-time director Todd Field, <i>In the
            Bedroom,</i> has already won the Sundance Special Jury Prize and the
            New York Film Critics Circle Awards for its lead actors Sissy Spacek
            and Tom Wilkinson, the L.A. Film Critics Award for best film, and
            has been nominated for three Golden Globes. A reviewer in the
            hinterland, where the film receives a late broad release, has never
            felt more irrelevant. What else can be said, when the major critics
            have already praised it for its Wyeth-like visuals and emotionally
            tortured portrayals of a family?</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p style="text-indent:0in;line-height:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Based
            on a short story by Andre Dubus, Ruth (Spacek) and Matt Fowler
            (Wilkinson) are an educated-class couple in small-town Maine whose
            grown son Frank (Nick Stahl) is involved with Natalie (Marisa
            Tomei), a young, nearly-divorced mother of two. Frank tells his
            worried mother that it's &quot;a summer thing&quot; but clearly more
            serious than he lets on -- the aspiring architect even considers
            delaying his career a year. He's not fooling anyone, least of all
            Natalie's estranged and violent husband Richard Strout (a
            wonderfully creepy William Mapother), the son of the local canning
            baron.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p style="text-indent:0in;line-height:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            plaudits for Spacek and Wilkinson are well deserved. As Ruth, Spacek
            is a world away from the hysterics that earned her initial acclaim
            in <i>Carrie</i>, playing a New England mother who roils with essays
            unspoken. No wonder that Natalie is frightened of her; the
            working-class girl's attempts to make innocent conversation at a
            picnic are quashed by Ruth's gulf-widening explanation that she did
            her thesis on Eastern European folk music. Her controlling nature is
            subtle, as in the late-night sandwich she makes for Frank, insisting
            &quot;you must be hungry.&quot; Yet these are small things, human,
            forgivable and rooted in love, never releasing us from sympathy. Her
            husband Matt, meanwhile, is a true man of Maine, a family doctor
            descended from lobster fisherman who loves his son and happily
            envies his youth. Like a lobsterman, he navigates both the warning
            buoys between his wife and son, and the shoals of his own
            recriminations.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p style="text-indent:0in;line-height:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            story turns when, as we know is inevitable, Frank is killed by the
            jealous husband Richard, and Field's skill as a director comes fully
            into bloom. We are given a surprising story, in which grief is not,
            as it is so often simplistically portrayed, a hovering shadow, but a
            force that pushes its bearers like a gale-force wind. Field shows us
            not just a couple trying to cope with loss, but a community that
            can't quite deal with it either -- or, more specifically, doesn't
            know how to deal with them. Their struggle to function in everyday
            ways, like mowing the lawn or having breakfast, which Field shows us
            in brief, blackout vignettes, takes on the weight of boulders. The
            couple's frustration at the slow, unwieldy justice system that can't
            seem to grant them any satisfaction is manifested, for most of the
            film, without words, such as Spacek's descent into chain smoking or
            Wilkinson's glassy stare at the corporate truck bearing the name
            &quot;Strout&quot; -- the surname of his son's killer. These low-key
            scenes do little to prepare you for the film's third act, in which
            revenge is neither sweet nor satisfying.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p style="text-indent:0in;line-height:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Most
            astounding is Field's minimal touch. There is very little sound
            throughout the film, with the only memorable soundtrack the Balkan
            women's chorus that Ruth conducts for a Labor Day program, which
            Field uses to haunting effect. Unlike many new directors, he is
            willing to hold a shot, and to rely on his actors to do their work
            on his behalf (much like, as has been pointed out by others, Stanley
            Kubrick, in whose <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i> Field acted). Just as
            impressive is Field's establishment of place, the village of Camden,
            Maine, by the repeated use of the same establishing locales such as
            the white arch announcing &quot;Camden,&quot; the cannery or the
            lobster docks. Anyone who has spent time in a small settlement can
            recognize the importance of regular, recurring landmarks seen every
            single day. It's Field's simplicity and elegance that makes this
            film recognizable as literature.</font></p>
            <p style="text-indent:0in;line-height:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's
            interesting to note that <i>Bedroom</i> is accompanied on its
            nationwide release by <i>The Shipping News</i> (also reviewed on
            this site), based on another literary source, the Pulitzer-winning
            novel by E. Annie Proulx. The difference between the approach of the
            two films, with Lasse Hallström's sweeping cinematography versus
            Field's introspective reliance on character, only underscores the
            distinction between films that want to be literature and a film that
            truly is.</font></p>
            <p style="text-indent:0in;line-height:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yet,
            the curse of literature is that, barring a feature on <i>Oprah</i>,
            it goes tragically unread, and the same may often be said of good
            films like these. With its initial release in New York and L.A., <i>Bedroom</i>
            has to date grossed less than $1 million, and even though the rest
            of us now get a chance to see it, the bitter business truth of this
            kind of film is that they actually get <i>most</i> of their box
            office in a handful of major cities. The low take suggests that this
            worthy work will lose money. That's the curse of the literary, I
            suppose, and that uncomfortable fact spurs a grief of its own.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"></o:p>
