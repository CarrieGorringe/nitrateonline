            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>There's
            something suspicious about a movie that might uses slogans as
            dialogue. This one lays out its competing democratic and
            capitalistic ideals by such shorthand. For example: &quot;Never
            underestimate radical vision,&quot; the motto of NURV, the
            Microsoft-like corporation at the center of <i>Antitrust</i>, headed
            by the Bill Gates-like Gary Winston (Tim Robbins). When Gary points
            to the motto on a drawing board during a meeting with his worker
            bees on the NURV Campus, their eyes light up. When he tells them
            that the computer business is &quot;binary -- you're a one or a
            zero, alive or dead!&quot;, they sit up a little straighter in their
            seats and nod their heads in understanding. And when he exhorts them
            to &quot;Surprise me, challenge me, defy me! Defy <i>yourselves</i>!&quot;,
            they applaud. A few even jump to their feet as if in a fit of
            admiration. Amen and hallelujah! This guy is a god!<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yeah,
            right. Unless you haven't been getting out much lately, you probably
            know that the most common movie villains these days -- aside from
            the usual standby Nazis -- are lawyers and computer executives,
            especially those who are obscenely wealthy. Robbins adopts an
            appropriately Anti-Christ-like posture in <i>Antitrust</i>. He's
            soft-faced and slightly rumpled, wearing khakis and geek-boy
            glasses, and his eyes are squinty (maybe even a little shifty?) from
            years spent staring at computer codes. While he's pondering some
            mysterious bit of brilliance that may (or may not) be wafting
            through his mind, he chomps on handfuls of Pringles, and for a
            minute, he looks like a regular man, or better, a kid who's figuring
            out some hard-to-crack videogame. In truth, Gary isn't very
            charismatic, but that's part of the magic -- by his very like-themness,
            he inspires groveling devotion from his emotionally screwed-up
            minions. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">No
            surprise, <i>Antitrust</i> has a bone to pick with this billionaire.
            Like other technophobic movies (<i>The Net</i>, <i>Virtuosity</i>,
            and the insanely entertaining <i>Lawnmower Man</i> come to mind),
            this one pits the bad corporate structure, embodied by Gary, against
            independent thinking, embodied by Milo (Ryan Phillippe). Milo is
            introduced as an idealistic computer whiz, just graduating and
            looking for a way to bring his wondrous talents to the public
            sector. At first, Milo has a utopian vision, which he shares with
            his best friend and partner-on-school-projects, Teddy (Yee Jee Tso),
            of creating a satellite-delivered global communications system, to
            connect all communications devices with one content source, also
            known as &quot;digital convergence.&quot; Milo and Teddy have
            visions of this system working for the public good -- you know, like
            the &quot;Eyes Only&quot; streaming video in tv's <i>Dark Angel</i>,
            where good guys valiantly expose corruption and bust criminals
            during a daily feed to all televisions and radios, sort of <i>Cops</i>
            without the racism or the nightsticks. But Gary has other ideas.
            And... [insert tension-making music here] he's not about to let
            anyone get in his way. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Gary
            invites Milo for a weekend at the Campus, and after about 20 seconds
            of thinking it over, the kid abandons his best friend and his
            ideals, and moves to Portland, along with his girlfriend Alice
            (Claire Forlani), where he's given a new SUV, a cozy home, and all
            kinds of instructions about where he can and can't go on Campus. He
            meets some geek-boys (one called Stinky, because you know, of
            course, that computer freaks don't wash) and a geek-girl, Lisa
            (Rachel Leigh Cook, again, as in <i>She's All That</i>, passing for
            the anti-glamour girl). Once Milo starts working on this system,
            which is rigged with an arbitrary, looming deadline, the film lapses
            into total ridiculousness (I mean, total, on the level of <i>The
            Skulls</i>). A tragedy befalls one of Milo's school buddies, and
            almost immediately, Milo figures out that Gary's behind it.
            Ordinarily, his figuring would seem too fast and too convenient, but
            given that viewers have reached this realization <i>long</i> before,
            the poor kid just looks dim-witted. Immediately following, the film
            takes a few leaps and bounds of logic and suddenly Milo's caught up
            in some surveillance antics straight out of a Bruce Willis movie, or
            better yet, <i>Mission Impossible</i> -- the derivation is so
            obvious that one of Milo's assailants asks him, in
            mid-kick-to-the-head, &quot;What's with all the <i>MI3</i> bullsh*t?!
            You're a geek!&quot; Indeed he is, but now he's living out the
            geek's dream, fully capable of running, jumping, and kicking ass
            like Lara Croft. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">No
            matter that all of the above makes little sense. Halfway through <i>Antitrust</i>,
            you're more than likely to have given up on that angle, and will be
            watching just to see what other lunatic elements pop up (and there
            are plenty, including Milo's fatal allergy to a certain foodstuff,
            Alice's tragic backstory, and Gary's snide jokes about Bill Gates).
            Amid the chaos, <i>Antitrust</i> makes two rudimentary arguments.
            The most obvious is also the most hypocritical and least surprising:
            corporations are bad. Or at least, the ones with monomaniacal heads
            are bad. I suppose that the corporations that produce tripe like <i>Antitrust</i>
            let themselves off the moral hook, or frankly don't care what you
            think of them. The other argument is less convincingly made, but
            it's the one that you might presume provided a nominal reason, aside
            from cash, for Robbins and Phillippe (both performers with
            well-known and committed liberal politics) to sign on for this
            feeble project. This is the argument voiced as a motto by Milo,
            which he says has been handed down to him by a wise elder:
            &quot;Human knowledge belongs to the world.&quot; And there you have
            it, straight from MGM: Napster is a good thing. <o:p>
