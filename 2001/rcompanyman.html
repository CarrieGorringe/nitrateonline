            jokes rejected decades ago from <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Get
            Smart!</i> and disbarred vaudeville routines. Hanssen's former
            employer, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, is off the hook, too,
            as the CIA bears the brunt of the nooseless gallows humor from the
            vapid minds of writer-directors Peter Askin and Douglas McGrath, the
            latter also starring as a Connecticut grammar school teacher and
            driver education instructor turned ineptly successful secret agent.
            In search of a dangling participle or misplaced adverb, milquetoast
            Allen Quimp (McGrath) is the black sheep of his blue blood family of
            Nobel Prize winners, and the mild-mannered scapegoat of his
            overbearing, unquenchably greedy wife Daisy (Sigourney &quot;what
            the heck am I doing in this film&quot; Weaver). To earn their
            respect (&quot;Why bother?&quot; I kept saying to myself) he
            fabricates a convoluted tale that eventually provides a nonsensical
            revisionist spin on the Bay of Pigs and, in a kicker, the Vietnam
            war. His big lie lands him a big job with the Central Intelligence
            Agency, just one of the many federal and foreign bumble-headed
            groups pock-marked by the perpetrators of the mirthless ode to the
            1960s. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

            film, &quot;based on some true events,&quot; starts out in
            Washington, 1962, with Quimp the subject of a secret Congressional
            committee of two (I want to say both are Jeffrey Jones based on his
            exaggerated girth these days) investigating into the spy's several
            years with the CIA. This dissolves into a handful of flashbacks and
            guest stars. Ryan Phillippe is the defecting Russian dancer Rudolph
            Petrov, forced to chase the high school teacher and one his
            flustered pupils (Heather Matarazzo) around in circles. The Company
            takes notice because Quimp the Wimp is masquerading as one of their
            own, then realize that he has inadvertently caught a big Soviet
            fish. Forced to hire the dope, the spymasters opt to package him off
            to a small backwater island to keep him out of trouble:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

            damp tropical setting sure brings some bad acting out of the soggy
            woodwork. Dennis Leary is Officer Fry, a turncoat agent done in by
            Quimp's compulsive attention to grammatical detail and the outright
            theft of Abbott and Costello material. Woody Allen, unbilled, is the
            beret-bedecked Lowther, the long-reigning local CIA station chief
            and resident nebbish. John Turturro is Quimp's renegade predecessor,
            a pumped up soldier-of-fortune jungle revolutionary who has watched
            too many Burt Lancaster movies. Alan Cumming is an effete, Carmen-Mirandized
            <b><i>Generale</i></b> Batista battling wits with a madcapped Castro
            (Anthony LaPaglia). Batista is preciously upset at being deposed and
            worried about losing his policies—especially his home owner's.

            Monroe and JFK stand-ins make brief encounters with the participants

            (LSD, hair loss, poisoned cigars, bad humor). In fact there are more
