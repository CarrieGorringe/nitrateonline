            review by <a href="../gianni.html" target="_top">Gianni Truzzi</a>, 15 June 2001</i></font><p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Disney's latest film, <i>Atlantis,</i>
            is an eleven-year old boy's dream of an animated adventure film.
            Heavy on action, light on mush, thankfully singing-free, it speeds
            at a race-car pace toward a conclusion full of spectacle and great
            big bangs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Like most
            dreams, however, it will probably be only dimly remembered in the
            morning.</font>
            <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Young Milo Thatch
            (given voice by Michael J. Fox) is an underfed, overeager wanna-be
            adventurer of 1914 who shares his departed grandfather Thadeuss'
            obsession with discovering the lost city of Atlantis. He listens,
            wide-eyed through large round glasses, as his grandfather's old
            partner, wealthy Preston B. Whitmore (John Mahoney), agrees to
            finance an expedition to search for it,using the ancient book
            Thaddeus discovered as a roadmap. Fortunately, Milo reads ancient
            Atlantean, due to his fanatical studies. Whitmore lays out dossiers
            of the crew like a heist film, where each one has a special talent
            to apply to the job, such as the explosives expert <span class="content">Vinny
            Santorini (Don Novello), and the dig-happy minerologist Mole (Corey
            Burton), </span>a cross between Charles Addams' Uncle Fester and
            Peter Lorre. They're led by Commander Lyle T. Rourke (James Garner),
            a swaggering mercenary, and the swivel-hipped Helga <span class="content">(Claudia
            Christian) </span>into the ocean depths.</font>
            <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's in the briny deep
            that the expedition encounters formidable obstacles to prevent their
            entry, such as a giant, mechanical crustacean, which inspires the
            rugged Rourke to order, &quot;Tell Cookie to melt the butter and
            bring out the bibs! I want this lobster served on a silver
            platter!&quot;</font>
            <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Once Atlantis is
            found, of course, the true motive of Milo's compatriots is
            discovered, to hijack the legendary power source of Atlantis and
            sell it to the highest bidder -- even if that's the Kaiser. It's
            left to Milo to save the dying lost city, and protect his newfound
            love, the 8,000-year-old <span class="cimagetext">Princess Kida </span><span class="content">(Cree
            Summer).</span></font>
            <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The art direction is
            thoughtful, if derivative. The drawing shares the outsized hands and
            feet, with pronounced muscle outline of the recent <i>Tarzan</i>,
            continuing the break from the traditional Disney look. Yet they have
            scavenged their own past with a submarine that mimics Captain Nemo's
            in the 1954 live-action <i>20,000 Leagues Under The Sea</i>.
            Atlantis reminds one of ancient Mayan and Aztec cultures, with
            bright blue tatoos and feathered headdresses, yet it draws from
            everywhere, including Byzantine mosaic.</font>
            <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There are six writers
            credited on this film, but it seems like a waste. How many people
            should it take to rewrite Frank Capra's 1937 <i>Lost Horizon</i>?
            All the same elements are here: the stranded explorers, the hidden,
            blissful city, the romance between outsider and princess, and the
            intrusion of modern-world greed that threatens to destroy paradise.
            Atlantis has some pretty cool technology, but that's about the only
            substantive difference it shows from Shangri-La.</font>
            <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film's setting of
            1914 seems almost arbitrary, and often ignored. The women don't wear
            corsets. Nobody ever cranks a motorcar. They don't even <i>call</i>
            them motorcars. And the submarine, with its expansive, glass bubble
            windows is thoroughly beyond any possible technology of that era.
            The early 1900s were an exciting time, when modernity suggested
            that, with progress, anything was possible. But there's no trace of
            that feeling here.</font>
            <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Events move at such a
            rapid clip that there's no opportunity to explore or enjoy the time
            period. The filmmakers are impatient with exposition, and seem in a
            hurry to get to the good stuff. The obstacles appear and disappear
            without adequate tension or rest. They've forgotten that the journey
            is the most fun for the audience, and is the best opportunity to
            learn. The Disney team should watch the 1966 film,<i> Fantastic
            Voyage, </i>with its micronauts drifting through the body's
            bloodstream<i>.</i></font>
            <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">What's missing most is
            any conveyance of how absorbing real archaeology can be. This was
            the time, after all, of some of the greatest archaeological
            discoveries, ranging from Heinrich Schliemann's discovery of Troy to
            Flinders Petrie's remarkable digs in Egypt, or even Howard Carter's
            later discovery of Tutankhamen's intact tomb. Yet kids never get the
            sense of what riches await them in the real world.</font>
            <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">While the images of
            Atlantis are beautiful, they're completely fantastic, derived less
            from Plato than from every piece of utter rot found in a New Age
            bookstore. The lost city's inhabitants sport crystals, which give
            them the power of healing. They build in stone and dress like
            primitives, yet they fly in machines like Jedi pilots. Eight
            thousand years ago, Neolithic man was just figuring out how to
            cultivate crops. How did this bunch get so advanced? It's never
            really explained.</font>
            <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It would be nice if <i>Atlantis</i>
            opened its young viewers eyes to real-world ideas that might spark
            their interest, and send them on their own adventure to the library
            stacks. Instead, it's nothing more than a vaporous diversion, a way
            to kill a couple of hours while escaping the summer heat. The
            problem is, after seeing the marvels of the lost city of Atlantis,
            what do you do for the <i>rest</i> of the day?</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
