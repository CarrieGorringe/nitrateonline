<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Born
in 1961 in St. Louis, Missouri, Lemmons decided early that she wanted to act,
and took up dancing as a means to improve her acting. She began her movie career
early: at 18 she played a &quot;Hostage&quot; in <i>11th Victim</i>, a TV movie
directed by Jonathan Kaplan. From there, she appeared in a series of memorable
movies (<i>School Daze</i>, <i>Silence of the Lambs</i>, <i>Fear of a Black Hat</i>)
and TV series (<i>Cosby</i>, <i>Walker, Texas Ranger </i>[!]). All the while,
she was also writing scripts -- she calls writing her &quot;straight job.&quot;
Currently, Lemmons and her husband, actor-director Vondie Curtis-Hall (<i>Gridlock'd</i>),
split their time between making films and raising their four-year-old son and
sixteen-month-old daughter, but it wasn't so long ago that Lemmons was a new
talent. In 1997, she wrote and directed the lovely and innovative <i>Eve's Bayou</i>.<o:p>

</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
Lemmons' highly anticipated second film, <i>The Caveman's Valentine</i>, written
by George Dawes Green and based on his Edgar Award-winning novel, Samuel Jackson
plays Romulus Ledbetter, a homeless man and former piano prodigy who solves a
murder mystery. <o:p>

<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>Cynthia
Fuchs:</i></b> <i>The Caveman's Valentine</i> is populated with characters who
don't get much play in mainstream movies -- the homeless, a crazy man,
sexualized middle-aged characters, interracial sex, a black woman with a gun,
gay men, and an upscale art scene, all in a film that's considerably bigger than
your first one. Was it difficult to put all these elements together? <o:p>
</o:p>

</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>Kasi
Lemmons: </i></b>Well, it's a bigger film than <i>Eve's Bayou</i>, but still in
a medium-to-small budget range. It is a very ambitious movie, though, very
dense. And even though you're dealing with some difficult things --
homelessness, junkies, homosexuality, and marginally, the S&amp;M avant-garde
art scene -- there's this Alice-Through-the-Looking-Glass quality, like you just
fell into a world, that made me think it was very beautiful. I thought that the
fact that the Caveman was a voice for a disenfranchised population, a
fringe-dweller, was really moving. <o:p>

<hr size="1">
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CF:
</i></b>The multiple layers come in part from the novel on which it's based,
which takes place mostly inside Rom's head. How do you translate that kind of
subjectivity to film?<o:p>
</o:p>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>KL:
</i></b>That's sort of the fun of it. It's something that appeals to me. And
it's a big question to answer, for me. When I was in film school in New York in
1987, I made a short film called <i>Fall from Grace</i>, seven minutes long,
about homeless people. And I didn't know any better, I didn't know the rules,
how you make documentaries or anything like that. So I would make sandwiches for
some people and ask, &quot;Do you mind if I sit here this afternoon and film
you?&quot; Some of them minded and some didn't and the ones that didn't, I would
take my camera with a long lens across the street and kind of spy on them, wait
until they forgot I was there. Part of the reason I wanted to make the film then
was that the White House had recently decided to release a lot of people from
mental institutions, and they ended up on the streets of New York, suddenly.
What I captured in this short film was this extraordinarily dynamic life that
was going on with these people, that you could photograph, but you couldn't get
inside. It was so compelling, and in a sense it was so much not what I expected,
because what I wanted (and I got that too) was this one-step-over-the-line,
slipping into darkness, you just made a single mistake and things get out of
control for a second, and you're homeless. But there was something else -- I got
a lot of people talking to themselves, talking to the sky, screaming at the sky.
And as you're watching you know, obviously, something is going on that is big
for this person, and I wanted to know what that thing was. So, cut forward to
years later, and I get this script for <i>The Caveman's Valentine</i> and I have
the opportunity to imagine and express what somebody like this is seeing and
thinking and feeling. George [Dawes Green] had written this from his book, and
the character is so beautifully drawn in the book, he's a mythic character, a
millennium mythic character, something you haven't seen before. I fell in love
with Romulus Ledbetter. <o:p>

</i></b>He wrote the first two drafts, I wrote the next three, and he wrote the
last one and I rewrote it, so we worked on it together, but it's George's
script. Even when I was working on it, it was as a director, shaping the visual
language. <o:p>

<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CF:</i></b>
As you write, even your own original scripts, do you think in terms of images? <o:p>
</o:p>

</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>KL:
</i></b>Yes, absolutely. I am a screenwriter for a living, it's my straight job.
But unless you're writing for yourself, it's not great form to write that way,
because you want to leave it blank for the director, but that's the way it
presented itself to me. So people would say, &quot;Can you pull that back?&quot;
Now that I write for myself, I put it all in, because it's like directing it. <o:p>

<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CF:

projects? <o:p>

</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>KL:
</i></b>No, it's almost like the ones that I'm involved in, I found a long time
ago or they found me, and it's something that I've just attached to. Somebody
will say, &quot;Have you read that book?&quot; and I'll say, &quot;Oh, I love
that book!&quot; I haven't reached out for anything new in a long time. One of
the other things I'm involved with is a story I've been following for fifteen
years, and another is a script I wrote a long time ago when I was writing for a
living, that has now come back to me with an offer to direct it. If I could only
do the projects that I'm interested in now, and then <b><i>retire</i></b>
[laughs], that'd be okay too. <o:p>

<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CF:
</i></b>Can you talk some about the women characters in <i>The Caveman's
Valentine</i>? Though Romulus is so huge as a presence, the women, especially,
to me, his daughter Lulu [played by Aunjanue Ellis], are so carefully
delineated. How different are they from the novel? <o:p>
</o:p>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>KL:
</i></b>The relationship between Romulus and Lulu is a big difference actually.
It's something that George and I went back and forth on, and now we agree. I
felt very strongly about it -- the relationship in the book is much sweeter. I
thought it would be interesting and appropriate if she was really embarrassed.
She's trying to make a living, and to toe the line -- she's a black woman cop in
New York, you talk about being in a man's world, and the sh*t she has to hear,
about her dad and everything else. I felt it was such a great opportunity for
dramatic tension. In the book, it's very beautiful. I gave it an arc, which I
felt was realistic and could be painful in a good way. I have a father-daughter
thing, and it can be such a beautiful relationship. It's so primary, and is so
great to write about. <o:p>

</i></b>You never see Sheila [played in the film by Tamara Tunie] except from
the back, on the edge of the frame, or as a projection from Romulus. <o:p>

</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>KL:
</i></b>She's his version of Sheila. That was a big question, and not in the
book. But I thought about it a long time, and realized that I would be driving
down the streets of Los Angeles and seeing people I knew from high school, and
then realizing it wasn't them, but people who looked like how I remembered them.
When you picture somebody you haven't seen in seventeen years, you don't age
them conspicuously, the way that they would have aged. You imagine them the way
that they were, but less realistic version, because memory is subjective. So he
remembers her as what we called &quot;Sheila Fabulous,&quot; the best part of
him, the sanest voice of his. She challenges him but she also encourages him. <o:p>

<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>KL:
</i></b>I love Moira. She went through a lot of changes from the book, along the
lines of, how not to kitschify her? And yet, she's this free spirit, living on
the fringe of her brother's fame and that whole world, but she's this earthy,
sexy person. She's kind of rock'n'roll, she's got a bit of an edge and she's
sexy, she doesn't give a f*ck. She has a lot of humanity, marching to her own
drummer, and I love that in a person, and in a woman. <o:p>

<hr size="1">
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CF:
</i></b>Did you give any thought to the recent controversies over interracial
relationships on screens, say, over Eriq LaSalle's [as Peter Benton] brief
liaison with Alex Kingston [as Elizabeth Corday] on <i>ER</i>? <o:p>
</o:p>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>KL:
</i></b>Well, you know, television is very interesting, there's a built-in
conservatism, and you're bound to represent because there's so few characters
[of color]. But for me, it's wonderful. Anything provocative is good, to a
certain extent. And all kinds of people sleep together -- it's very human. My
parents are interracial, my mother married my stepfather when I was nine, so
it's life to me. I would never shy away from it. But it's amazingly provocative.
I knew it was, but when we tested this movie, people went nuts, especially
because Rom's homeless, so there's this whole &quot;sullying&quot; thing. But to
me, that's really, really fun. I just like to stir it up a little. <o:p>
</o:p>

<hr size="1">
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CF:
</i></b>Did you have that in mind when you began directing, that you could stir
things up? <o:p>
</o:p>

</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>KL:
</i></b>Yeah, not in the way that other people might mean it. To me, <i>Eve's
Bayou</i> is very edgy and radical and had never been done, a bold frontier. But
you could easily look at it and say, &quot;Oh, it's a quirky little film.&quot;
It was very important that it was one-hundred percent African American, because
these are the people of Eve's life. People asked me to put in white characters,
and I would say, &quot;Well, there aren't any. It's my bayou.&quot; To me that
had its own power and stirred things up, but not in the way that <i>The
Caveman's Valentine</i> might. That was an opportunity in so many ways -- I
designed the photographs: S&amp;M, me? It was a great playground. At the same
time, I knew I was pushing a lot of buttons and I tried to be a little classy
about it, I didn't want to drive people screaming from theaters. But at the same
time it was a great opportunity to explore life. <o:p>

<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CF:
</i></b>Were you expecting controversy? <o:p>
</o:p>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>KL:
</i></b>Sure. There haven't been as many as I expected. Early on I decided that
the only way to do this was to have a lot of heart. I thought, &quot;If you're
going to go direct <i>The Caveman's Valentine</i>, you've gotta go for it.&quot;
At this point, I haven't seen anything that surprised me. Sundance is a
wonderful place to show a movie like this, because you get a mixed audience,
film buffs and film people and also people from the area, which is very Mormon.
So I was pleasantly surprised at that reaction. It did well. <o:p>

scared. But I've had great experiences, you meet people you wouldn't normally.
At Telluride, when we took <i>Eve's Bayou</i>, there I was, walking around with
John Sayles. And I went to Sundance, and Joan Chen became my pal, and Darren
Aronofsky. It's cool. You get to talk about film with people you admire. <o:p>

</i></b>Yes. But you never know. Some people might say that <i>Caveman's
Valentine</i> is already too slick, you know what I mean? It has a polishedness
that I like in my filmmaking. I tend to keep doing movies that are challenging
stories and have a certain degree of not-your-average-movieness, because that's
my taste. <o:p>

<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CF:
</i></b>Part of the challenge is how you represent what's real and what's not,
or how these blend together, for individuals. This film gave you a chance to
focus closely on that slippage. Can you talk about the ways you decided to
represent that, across varying visual registers? <o:p>
</o:p>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>KL:
</i></b>Yes, that's a big part of the fun. I get a certain idea when I'm going
through the script and doing my director's version, so I put it in then, which
is in black and white and whatever else. And that organizes the material
visually. And then my DP [Amelia Vincent, with whom Lemmons also worked on <i>Eve's
Bayou</i>] and I go through and refine that. So, at one point in the script, Rom
refers to the Z-ray as being a &quot;pernicious shade of green,&quot; and we had
to decide what was pernicious enough. The most fun and the most challenging and
the most heartache that I got in all of that was in Rom's skull. You know it's
dark in there, it's spooky and like a basilica, it says in the book, but you
have to figure out what it feels like. That was fun and painful, on our budget,
and my production designer [Robin Standefer] pulled it out of her hat. It was a
saga, of the wings and the space. It was an opportunity, because you don't often
see black angels, but it was also new territory -- I decided the seraphs were
sort of Rom's ancestors and his furies. The black and white, we used that for
his flashes of instinct and insight, and Amelia came up with this stock that's
very high contrast and difficult to work with, ASA 6, because you have to use
such bright lights to make it work. The actors were literally squinting under
those lights. But it has a beautiful and shocking look. Amelia and I get far
into it -- like, &quot;What does instinct feel like? What does it look
like?&quot; -- and then, we come back from it. We're so far into the visual
thing, analyze it, storyboard it, know it thoroughly, and then, we think,
&quot;The actors are coming!&quot; And then we can work with the actors. <o:p>

</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>KL:
</i></b>You never know. That's filmmaking. You've got to be a little light on
your feet, or you'll die. A good example in this film is, we were introducing
Sheila on the street -- Tom's looking at the poster wall and she comes up behind
him. We were going to have her walk out of a background at the wrong speed, so
the background would go into slow motion, and she'd come towards him in
twenty-four [fps, normal speed]. We'd have to bluescreen it, it was complicated,
but we knew what we were doing, we were all set up. Well, there's a blizzard.
And we can't bring Sheila in a blizzard. She's Sheila Fabulous and she's a
vision, she can't have her hair a mess and snow in her eyes. So we had to think
fast. We walked her down a ladder in the library. It would have been great to
have her on the street, but there you have to adjust. It's the whole
adrenalin-jumping-off-a-cliff thing. </font><o:p>
