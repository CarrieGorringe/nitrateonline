            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>,  26 October
            2001</i></font><p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">At the beginning 
            of <i>The Last Castle</i>, Rod Lurie's latest abuse-of-power drama, 
            Robert Redford tells us that the military prison where his character 
            is being sent for incarceration is a castle much like any other from 
            olden times, only this one isn't built to keep people out, but to 
            keep people in. Then it's really not a castle, I responded, but 
            never mind. The movie has already whooshed us along to the next 
            scene.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We're in the office of the prison 
            commandant, Col. Winter (James Gandolfini), whom we are supposed to 
            instantly dislike because he's listening to the wrong classical 
            music (Antonio Salieri), asks Redford's character, former General 
            Irwin, if he'd like a glass of lemonade, then hits on him for an 
            autograph. When Winter overhears Irwin saying that the colonel is 
            collecting war memorabilia in order to compensate for a lack of 
            experience in real combat, that's it:&nbsp; the war of wills has begun.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The prisoner population is 
            immediately identified as a rabbling, scabrous lot who are not only 
            prone to, but encouraged to commit, acts of violence amongst each 
            other, but the dignified, reflective Irwin quickly wins over allies, 
            including a soft-spoken doctor (Frank Military), a sneak (Mark 
            Ruffalo), a hulk (Brian Goodwin), and a rubber-faced ex-Marine 
            (Clifton Collins, Jr.) who also has a stutter and is bound to be 
            doomed by the end of the picture. Irwin not only restores the 
            imprisoned servicemen's morale and discipline: they muster and, at 
            one point, spontaneously sing the Marine Corps Hymn. They salute the 
            decommissioned Irwin without breaking the prison policy against 
            prisoners saluting other prisoners. (This &quot;secret salute&quot; consists 
            of a hand-passing-over-one's-hair motion that looks like something 
            George Raft would do while performing the bolero with Carole 
            Lombard.) Winter's response to all this is to, of course, do 
            everything he could possibly do to rile up the men even more than 
            they already are. By the time another general, Wheeler (Delroy Lindo), 
            shows up to pay a visit to his old friend Irwin (the guy who put &quot;a 
            star&quot; on Wheeler's dress uniform shoulder), then wags his finger at 
            Winter and says that if one more, just one more prisoner dies under 
            his command at the facility....</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I could go on. Suffice to say that 
            everything you think will happen does, only much later than the film 
            telegraphs us as to when it will actually occur. Why is Redford's 
            character incarcerated at a maximum-security prison for violent 
            inmates? For a while, it looks like we'll never find out, but we do, 
            an hour and a half in -- even though it's anticlimactic, the movie's 
            gotta hold out on something in order to keep us in some sort of 
            state of anticipation. What Irwin did does not change our opinion of 
            his being an exemplifier of virtue, nor does it add any complexity 
            or dimension to his character. This is the type of movie where he 
            wins the respect of others completely by toting rocks across the 
            prison yard. (And, fear not, Redford did do some body toning before 
            appearing in the film.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mark Ruffalo, who was a knockout in
            <i>You Can Count on Me</i>, is given little to do until almost the 
            end of the picture (although he does the best he can with what 
            little he's got). As Col. Winter, James Gandolfini, who gave one of 
            the best performances of the year in the otherwise tremendously 
            disappointing <i>The Mexican</i>, proves once again that all that 
            talk about his work in <i>The Sopranos</i> was not bunk. He refuses 
            to play the commandant as either an easily contemptible effete or 
            brute; he refuses to allow us to have any pat reactions to his 
            character, but turns him into something more tantalizing, troubling, 
            fatalistic, and dangerous than if he has simply settled back upon 
            playing him as a stock type. Gandolfini generates interest in his 
            character right up to the very end, by which time the rest of the 
            picture, which ostensibly started coming apart at the seams five 
            minutes in, has completely unraveled. The performance may be better 
            than the picture, but the picture would be utterly sunk without it.</font></td>
