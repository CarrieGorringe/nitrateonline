            review by <a href="../kj.html" target="_top">KJ Doughton</a>, 20 July
            2001</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>While watching <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Jurassic
            Park 3</i>, I noticed that the theater smelled like a zoo. This
            appropriate olfactory touch lent itself to the latest of summer’s
            perfunctory, not bad but not-great blockbusters. I should have
            thanked the gamy guy next to me for not washing his pits, and adding
            a third dimension to this predictably professional showcase of
            velociraptors, T-rexes, pterodactyls, and some new beastie that
            looks like something the Crocodile Hunter might attempt to wrestle
            on his Animal Planet television series.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">First, the good news. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Jurassic
            Park 3</i>’s<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"> </i>script has
            certainly done an admirable job of rationalizing why noted
            paleontologist Dr.Alan Grant (Sam Neill) would go anywhere near the
            vicious prehistoric beasts that nearly swallowed him whole in the
            first film of the series. The notion of distressed parents
            concocting a scheme to lure him into Costa Rica and help track down
            their missing son is an interesting twist. The film’s writers have
            also injected some humor into the mix, which puts color into this
            rather bland, familiar formula. When a fan of Grant’s tells him
            that he enjoys Grant’s two scholarly books on dinosaur science,
            the fossil-savvy expert explains why the second was less
            affectionate towards his subjects. “When I wrote the first
            book,” he points out bluntly, “the dinosaurs hadn’t tried to
            eat me yet!”</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The bad news is that a tired
            franchise remains a tired franchise, with or without the biting wit
            provided by screen scribes Peter Buchman, Alexander Payne, and Jim
            Taylor. The dinosaur encounters aren’t nearly as frightening this
            time around, despite superb renderings of such marvelous, extinct
            giants by Industrial Light and Magic. Meanwhile, does anyone even
            remember the humdrum plot behind <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Jurassic
            Park: The Lost World?</i> Part of the fun behind viewing a movie
            like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Jurassic Park 3</i>
            involves observing the various ways in which a studio can justify
            resurrecting a series that has already exhausted all of its
            possibilities. Remember <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Lethal Weapon 4</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Godfather
            III, Alien 3 </i>and<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"> Alien
            Resurrection</i> (the ludicrous fourth installment), and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Ghostbusters 2</i>? I didn’t think so. Typically, even with the best
            and brightest script chefs on hand to cook up a new spin, the batter
            is already so lumpy and thin that it all comes out bland and
            flavorless.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As far as leftovers go, however, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Jurassic Park 3</i> is fairly tasty fare. As the movie begins, we find
            ourselves above the oceans of Cost Rica, watching a tour boat zip
            across the water’s surface near the island of Isla Sorna. Amidst
            the whitecaps, a thrill seeking forty-something and the young boy
            accompanying him have convinced a gullible skipper to steer them
            alongside this notorious piece of land. Years earlier, dinosaurs
            were cloned there from DNA by would-be theme park entrepreneur John
            Hammond until his top attractions started eating staff and patrons.
            The Costa Rican government has since deemed this dangerous area
            “no man’s land” and forbidden its exploration by gawkers and
            curious dino-seekers. On this day, however, pre-teen Eric Kirby
            (Trevor Morgan, who antagonized Haley Joel Osment as the wannabe
            child actor from <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Sixth
            Sense</i>) and a guardian with incredibly poor judgment use a
            hang-glider rigged off the boat to elevate them over the
            emerald-green island. They’re hoping to get a more impressive view
            of its unique occupants from the air. Needless to say, this ends in
            disaster, with all but Eric ending up as dino delicacies.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This sets the film’s bare-bones
            plot in motion, as the boy’s separated parents attempt to put
            their differences aside and retrieve their son from Isla Sorna. They
            convince a trio of dim soldiers of fortune to provide some brawn and
            weaponry, and eventually lure the reluctant Grant to join the ride
            with the help of a hefty blank check. Archeological digs don’t
            come cheap, and Grant can use the dough. En route to the island via
            plane, it’s worth a chuckle when Grant asks one of the
            tough-looking mercenaries how they came to know Paul Kirby (William
            H. Macy) and his ex-wife, Amanda (Tea Leoni). “We met through our
            church,” is the roughneck’s response.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Predictably, the travelers are
            stranded on Isla Sorna, and the rest of the film is a solid
            thrill-ride of narrow escapes, frenetic chases, and close encounters
            – all played with a sarcastic edge. Surrounded by salivating
            velociraptors, Grant orders the other expedition members not to move
            a muscle, only to turn around and find that they’ve already bailed
            out on him. In another clever scene, a toothy predator’s presence
            is detected by a ringing cell phone, swallowed by the hungry
            carnivore and sounding off from the dark recesses of his stomach.
            Later on, our heroes hear the same distinctive ring emanating from
            mound of dinosaur dung, and shovel through the poop to retrieve the
            phone, after the device has made its way through the host’s
            digestive tract. Meanwhile, there are swooping pteranodons,
            club-tailed ankylosauruses, and a fifty-foot long meat-eater called
            a spinosaurus. This bruiser’s scrap to the death with a swaggering
            T-rex is an impressive duel of the titans.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">O.K., so maybe <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Jurassic
            Park 3</i> isn’t going to change the world. Even so, I admire the
            craftsmanship behind this movie more than the manipulative,
            insulting method behind <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Pearl
            Harbor</i>, another much-ballyhooed summer “event” film that
            draped itself in historical tragedy and failed to deliver as an
            action flick. Director Joe Johnston has streamlined his sequel to a
            lean ninety-four minutes, and emphasized the prehistoric mayhem and
            ghastly behemoths that we have come to see. Throw in some
            refreshingly self-deprecating humor, and you have a recipe for a
            familiar meal served up with just enough seasoning to keep it
            interesting.</font>
