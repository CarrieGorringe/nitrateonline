            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Hollywood really misses the
            Nazis. They made perfect and most satisfying villains; unambiguously
            evil, white and Christian, they could always be safely sinister
            without upsetting a vocal ethnic group or alienating someone's
            politics. No wonder Mr. Spielberg keeps trotting them out for <i>Raiders
            of the Lost Ark</i> or <i>Schindler's List.</i> It's gotten
            tiresome, though. Movies need a new reliable bad guy.<i> </i>In <i>Behind
            Enemy Lines</i>, a film that bravely uses the Bosnian conflict as
            its backdrop, you can almost hear the director's sigh of relief,
            secretly thanking heaven for the shameless brutality of the Serbs.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While witnessing their <i>Einsatzgruppen</i>-like<i>
            </i>tactics, hotshot navigator Navy Lieutenant Chris Burnett (<i>Zoolander'</i>s
            Owen Wilson) gets into trouble while on a routine reconnaissance
            mission, when a Serbian unit determined to cover up their ethnic
            massacre shoots Burnett's F/A-18 Superhornet jet down and murders
            his wounded pilot. With a master tracker on his heels, Burnett has
            to scramble to reach a safe pickup point.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">His commander, Admiral Reigart
            (Gene Hackman) struggles with his NATO superiors to allow a rescue,
            at the risk of scuttling a fragile peace agreement. It doesn't help
            Reigart's judgment any that he had just given the impish Burnett a
            firm dressing down for his poor soldier's attitude, and assigned him
            the Christmas day mission as a punishment.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Although never explicitly
            acknowledged, Burnett's plight is loosely based on Air Force Captain
            Scott F. O'Grady, the pilot from Spokane, Washington who heroically
            survived his own crash in hostile Bosnia. As always, there is life
            and then there's the movies. Burnett is no clean-cut stoic, but a
            complainer who, prior to his travails, is sick of &quot;watching not
            fighting&quot; and frustrated enough with peacekeeping to consider
            leaving the Navy. He hides under corpses, and his pursuers search
            for him among the murdered instead of just riddling the entire pile
            with bullets. He races through the center of a series of trip wires,
            yet manages to outrun the columns of explosions he sets off. Burnett
            never chews on bark to survive; in fact, he never seems to eat at
            all, except for quenching his thirst with a product-placed Coca Cola
            (which, with its sugar and caffeine, is probably the last thing a
            dehydrated soldier should drink).</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The flash-paced action by
            first-feature director John Moore excites initially (especially the
            first sequence in which the Stackhouse tries to evade the attacking
            SAMs), but the piling on of devices, such as the freeze-frame, slow
            motion and use of hand-held camera shots to ratchet up the tension
            rapidly become irritating. One is not surprised to learn, given his
            lack of finesse, that Moore's main accomplishment before this film
            was creating a SEGA video game commercial. He uses a familiar blue
            tint on his film stock –<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>familiar,
            that is, to those who regularly watch <i>National Geographic</i>
            specials --to depict winter in a godless land.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>It's the same visual look perfected by photographers in any
            spread on Cold-War Eastern Europe, where, it seems, the sun deems
            the people unworthy.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">By all measures of filmmaking, <i>Lines</i>
            is a mess, but it will probably do well, just as so many pictures
            that offer good fireball explosions do. It's not that the audience
            for this kind of movie doesn't know any better or care, but they are
            willing to suspend their skepticism for material that entertains
            while supporting their point of view – that peacekeeping is
            fruitless, or that the military is always sold out by politicians or
            (as here) durned foreigners. To be candid, <i>Behind Enemy Lines</i>
            is just how I feel while watching most combat-action flicks, with
            their muscle-bound jingoism, xenophobia and devotion to mil-tech and
            jargon. Yet these very qualities are what will draw and satisfy its
            viewers.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Which is why I am grateful that <i>Lines</i>
            at least manages to address the tragedy of Bosnia with at least
            moderate intelligence and sympathy for its victims. Tackling the
            issue at all deserves some admiration; the Balkan wars are a subject
            so numbingly complex that writing about them is nearly as much of a
            quagmire as negotiating their peace settlement. While it would be
            far too grandiose to say that <i>Lines</i> transcends its genre, it
            does lightly hover above the well-worn trench of its conventions.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I would not recommend <i>Lines</i>
            to anyone: I would push them to see <i>Welcome to Sarajevo </i>or
            Ademir Kenovic's <i>The Perfect Circle </i>instead. But if <i>Behind
            Enemy Lines, </i>which illustrates that peacekeeping is a worthy, if
            frustrating effort, gets someone thinking, then that might be worth
            the price of a ticket after all.</font></td>
