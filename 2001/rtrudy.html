            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 9 March
            2001</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If the title, <i>When Brendan Met
            Sally</i>, sounds familiar, it's supposed to. Brendan (Peter
            McDonald) -- who stares dreamily, distractedly out the window of the
            Dublin classroom where he teaches (he seems to have given up on
            making any<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>sort of
            impact on the students, and the students feel likewise) -- has two
            abiding passions in his life: singing (he sings baritone in the
            church choir, and listens to recordings of the great Irish singer
            John McCormack), and the movies. Watching John Wayne sweep Maureen
            O'Hara into his arms in <i>The Quiet Man</i>, Brendan wonders aloud,
            &quot;How does he do it?&quot; (Well, because John Ford told him to,
            but that's not the point.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Into his life comes Trudy (Flora
            Montgomery), who flashes her eyes at him, makes some acerbic remarks
            (&quot;I'd say you were a forceps birth, Were ya?&quot;), and sweeps
            him into a whirlwind romance. Trudy is the type of free-spirited,
            forthright, and shrewd girl who lives in the moment and does as she
            pleases (even if that means standing Brendan up for a date because,
            she later reveals, she simply &quot;felt&quot; like it). She also
            mysteriously disappears for hours in the middle of the night, going
            off to do -- something. But it's the element of ambiguity (and, it
            must be said, dread) that keeps Brendan intrigued, leading him to
            get involved with protest clashes with the police, and to sing Iggy
            Pop's <i>The Passenger</i> in front of his class room students to
            show that &quot;there is nothing 'un-cool' about a formally-trained
            voice&quot;. (&quot;He's beginning to scare me, now,&quot; whispers
            one of the boys in class after this demonstration.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The picture, directed by Kieron J.
            Walsh and written by Roddy Doyle (his first original screenplay),
            is, as you may have gathered, pleasantly-enough done, and it's well
            acted (along with the two leads, there is also a wonderfully funny
            one-scene bit by Barry Cassin, as the headmaster who calls Brendan
            into his office at one point), but it also seems to just barely hang
            together. There are loads of film references (some of them to
            fictional films), especially to Jean-Luc Godard's <i>Breathless</i>:
            at one point, Brendan and Trudy even turn <b><i>into</i></b>
            Belmondo and Jean Seberg in the film, and go on a spree. But while
            Trudy falls, rather touchingly, in love with Brendan when she first
            hears him sing, and Brendan, in turn, loses much of his shyness and
            becomes more of his own person after being around Trudy, there
            really doesn't seem to be any reason for these two people to be
            together. Trudy breaks-up with Brendan over reasons which are
            capricious but are also petty, and she agrees to take Brendan back
            only after he does something pretty decrepit. Brendan's sudden
            concern over the welfare of his students, regarding some new
            computers which are to be installed at the school where he works,
            seems to come out of nowhere, particularly after the open scorn
            which they have shown towards him. And the final part of the story,
            which ends up with Trudy taking the fall for something concocted by
            Brendan (it's the ending of <i>Breathless</i> in reverse), just
            doesn't seem convincing. (Unless Trudy is awfully more
            self-sacrificing than we were lead to believe.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There's a very good scene in the
            film in which Brendan, walking out of a cinema with Trudy, talks
            about what he thought about the film they just saw by talking about
            how it was put together: he doesn't say what he felt towards the
            film while watching it. Audiences may find this picture to be
            pleasing enough, even if it still doesn't add up in the end.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"></o:p>
