is a wreck, but it’s an honorable one, because you can see places where the
filmmakers achieved something in a way that could only have been done through
having a deep understanding of the material—from the use of landscapes
(stunningly photographed by Barry Markowitz), to the evocation of a bygone
gentlemen's code of honor (which propels part of the story), to many of the
performances: most of Matt Damon's, all of the ones by Henry Thomas and Lucas
Black, and supporting appearances by Ruben Blades, Miriam Colon, Julio Oscar
Mechiso (as a rural Mexican police captain), and, near the end, Bruce Dern.
There may have even been a film, here, that actually had horses as its central
metaphor, but all that's been sliced and diced from the film, along with the
relationship between Damon's character and a troublemaking girl played by
Penelope Cruz, which is supposed to trigger the events in the other half of the
film but is now without emotional weight or resonance. Billy Bob Thornton
directed the picture from a screenplay adapted by Ted Tally from the Cormac
McCarthy novel: this was his second feature film following the success of <i>Sling
Blade</i>, and it was held up for over a year by its studio, Miramax, which is
also sitting on another film directed by Thornton, <i>Daddy and Them</i>,
completed before <i>All the Pretty Horses </i>went into production.<o:p>

Bardem, in one of the very best screen performances of last year, stars in
Before Night Falls as Reinaldo Arenas, the openly-gay Cuban writer and poet who
was born into poverty as a &quot;guajiro,&quot; garnered attention for his
writing in the '60s, during the first years of Castro's government, then was
imprisoned (&quot;You're under arrest.&quot; &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;Because I
said so.&quot;), released, went to the U.S. during the Mariel boat launch of
1980, and wakes up in New York City with night sweats and swollen glands—the
first signs of H.I.V. The picture is far from being a grim account of an
artist's rise and fall, though: artist Julian Schnabel, who directed the film
and co-wrote the screenplay (and who earlier floundered with his film about
Jean-Michel Basquiat), uses a filmmaking style which is as uncompromising and
earnest as his subject. Bardem is not a conventionally handsome actor—his
profile looks as if it were whacked by a brick—but his way of moving and
expressing himself in the film has a natural, graceful sensuality, which makes
Arenas' eventual trials, and endurance, all the more affecting. The supporting
cast includes appearances by actors Sean Penn, Michael Wincott, and Johnny Depp,
and directors Jerzy Skolimowski and Hector Babenco, while French actor Olivier
Martinez puts in an effective performance as Lazaro, Arenas' friend and, later,
companion in the U.S. Keep an eye on the footage used behind the closing
credits: it's from a rare film about Cuban nightlife made in 1961, and
subsequently banned by the Cuban government. The Warner Home Video DVD includes
three short documentaries featuring an interview with the real Reinaldo Arenas.</span></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">From the gang that brought you <i>This is
Spinal Tap</i> and <i>Waiting for Guffman</i> comes <i>Best in Show</i>, which
combines the satire of the former and the idiosyncratic parade of American
individuals on display in the latter. This time, the action revolves around
various dog owners and their efforts to win the title accolade at the important
Mayflower Dog Show (the film was shot in Vancouver and Los Angeles). Director
Christopher Guest (Nigel Tufnel in <i>Tap</i>) co-wrote the screenplay with
Eugene Levy (&quot;SCTV,&quot; <i>American Pie</i>), and each appears in a large
cast that includes Jennifer Coolidge, John Michael Higgins, Michael Hitchcock,
Jane Lynch, Michael McKean, Catherine O’Hara, Parker Posey and Bob Balaban.
Veteran funnyman Fred Willard (&quot;Fernwood 2Night&quot;) steals the show as
effusive yet clueless event commentator Buck Laughlin. Guest has worked on and
off for years with many of these collaborators, and that comfort shows in the
effortless way in which the various characters riff off each other (Ed Begley,
Jr. is particularly good as a long-suffering hotel manager). If the film has a
flaw it’s in the structure, as each scene begins conventionally and spins off
into straight-faced absurdity; this rhythm would be cumulatively constricting if
not for the numerous belly laughs sprinkled throughout. Both English and
Spanish-subtitled VHS tapes are priced to rent, and Warner’s DVD pressing
includes Guest’s commentary track, a generous selection of outtakes (it must
have been hard to pare the footage down to the final cut) and a &quot;K9
Corner&quot; feature that extends the characters’ commitment to their pets.<o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It boggles the mind. Several pairs of
characters—that’s right, &quot;duets&quot;—criss-cross the country as they
inexorably make their way to Omaha: a well-meaning young cabdriver (Steven
Speedman) gets commandeered, along with his vehicle, by a wild and crazy girl
(Maria Bello); a businessman (Paul Giamatti), ignored by his wife and kids,
takes off to have the good time he's been missing all these years, and gives a
lift to a man (Andre Braugher) who is an ex-convict and happens to be carrying a
gun, as well; and a karaoke bar hustler (Huey Lewis) is forcibly reunited with
the daughter (Gwyneth Paltrow) whom he hasn't seen in years. It turns out that
they are all either part of, or about to become members of, the great fraternal
community of karaoke enthusiasts, and Omaha is where a big competition is to be
held with a big prize attached, as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Along
the way, all the characters learn little lessons and truths: Paltrow tells
Lewis, at one point, &quot;I'm not asking you for the moon. I'm asking you for a
hand, to reach out.&quot; There is also talk about finding &quot;the real path
to the real meaning to the real truth.&quot; It's hard to believe that no one
had any idea how this stuff was looking like while they were making it, but they
follow it through to the very end. Bruce Paltrow (Gwyneth's dad) directed, from
an original screenplay by John Byrum, and, with the exception of Braugher, all
the cast members do their own singing, although potential viewers are advised to
steady themselves in advance prior to hearing Gwyneth Paltrow's rendition of
&quot;Bette Davis Eyes.&quot; The Walt Disney Home Video DVD includes
&quot;additional&quot; scenes, commentary with Bruce Paltrow and producer Kevin
Jones, and a multi-angle music video.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>The Emperor’s New Groove</i> is the
snappiest, wittiest, and most enjoyable animated film from the Disney studios in
years.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Tell me where the
talking llama is,&quot; says the villainous Yzma (voiced, splendidly, by Eartha
Kitt), &quot;or I'll burn your house to the ground!&quot; &quot;Well, which is
it? It seems like a pretty cruel conjunction,&quot; replies one of the film's
little urchins with deceptive Keene-like eyes. The llama is the emperor Kuzco
(David Spade), transformed by a magic potion, and who must rely upon the help of
Pacha (John Goodman) to get back to his palace and regain his throne, even
though Pacha already knows that Kuzco is planning on displacing him, his family,
and all their next-door peasant neighbors by building a summer palace on top of
where they live. Will Kuzco experience a change of heart? The fast-paced story,
humor, and riotous settings inspired by ancient Peruvian and Inca designs keep
us well occupied before the answer is provided. Probably the best bit in the
film: the scene set in a High Andes version of a Big Boy restaurant. The film is
available in both VHS and DVD, with a two-disc special edition featuring a
soup-to-nuts documentation of the production history for the true fan.—Gregory

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">On the mean streets of New York City, a
sixteen-year-old basketball player (Rob Brown) with untapped intellectual
potential befriends a reclusive writer (Sean Connery) who hasn’t left his
apartment or published anything since the rapturous reception of his first
novel. Though wary, each gives the other support and encouragement. Unabashedly
sentimental yet undeniably provocative, <i>Finding Forrester </i>continues the
unlikely commercialization of director Gus van Sant, who has slowly but steadily
wedded the overtly independent aesthetics of his early films (<i>Mala Noche</i>,
<i>Drugstore Cowboy</i>, <i>My Own Private Idaho</i>) to the template of
established Hollywood melodrama (<i>To Die For</i>, <i>Good Will Hunting</i>)—with
occasional forays into the rewardingly weird (<i>Even Cowgirls Get the Blues</i>,
his what-the-hell-was-<i>that</i>? remake of <i>Psycho</i>). Connery, who’s
listed as a co-producer, is nicely understated, but it is Brown’s untutored
charisma that anchors the film. As in all his best films, an ethereal soundscape
is an essential element of van Sant’s strategy. Simply put, <i>Finding
Forrester</i> is one of the best and most misunderstood films of it’s year—a
description which may be suitable for most of van Sant’s films, as long as
he’s working in this unique vein. The Columbia TriStar Home Video VHS edition
is priced to rent, and the DVD pressing has no extras.<o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;That's the difference. A girl must, a man
if he chooses.…&quot; Terence Davies' film version of the Edith Wharton novel <i>The
House of Mirth</i> features Gillian Anderson as Lily Bart, who, in early
twentieth-century New York, goes through increasingly desperate attempts to make
a match between her and the man whom she thinks would make the right husband for
her—Lawrence Selden (Eric Stoltz), who likes Lily but has money and isn't
about to be tied down by a marriage to anybody—while casting off two other men
who would make perfectly fine husbands for her in the process. Davies' metered,
carefully cadenced direction puts most of the emphasis on evocative visuals and
moods to deliver the story's dramatic punch. And Anderson's performance is
remarkable: she keeps an animate life going behind Lily's carapace of speech and
manner, but, as things progress, you can see how the weight of events begins to
erode her from within, until, finally, appearance is all. Of the considerable
supporting cast, Laura Linney makes the greatest impression as a beautiful,
smiling predator of a human being—she can walk into a room and immediately
command everything she surveys, whether that &quot;everything&quot; likes it or
not. It's a very good performance, and couldn't be further from the (equally
good) one she gave—and was Oscar nominated for—in Kenneth Lonergan’s <i>You
Can Count on Me</i>. The Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment DVD edition
features a commentary track from the erudite Davies, deleted scenes (also with
director commentary) and production notes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sandra Bullock as a tough FBI agent who tries
to prevent a bomb from going off at a nationally-televised beauty pageant by
going undercover as one of the contestants, and must therefore take a crash
course in how to comport herself like one. Nobody would mistake Sandra Bullock
for being &quot;painful and grotesque,&quot; but she does do some of her best
and most comedic screen work in years. The rest of the film is, however, handled
in a sloppy, clumsy, and at times tiresome manner: the FBI guys are all depicted
as being puerile and sexist, while the girls in the beauty pageant are treated
as bubbleheads, then revealed as being human after all, then treated like
bubbleheads again. Candice Bergen's scenes, as the pageant organizer, all seem
like they've been stepped on, while there doesn't seem to be enough of William
Shatner, who plays the pageant's aging, longtime avuncular host. But Michael
Caine, as a glamour and poised consultant, is both funny and contributes a
deftness and presence the rest of the movie could use. The Warner Home Video DVD
includes multiple commentaries (including tracks from Bullock and director
Donald Petrie) and two production featurettes.</font></p>

Pearl Jam lead singer Eddie Vedder in the liner notes for this three-hour
assemblage of performances from the band’s 2000 American and European tours,
and that’s good advice: on a good system, Brett Eliason’s<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>thunderous sound mix is the next best thing to having been there.
Initially reluctant to enter the music video fray, Pearl Jam has followed the
1998 45-minute &quot;Single Video Theory&quot; with this vivid and abundant
diary of their adventures on the road, supplementing the tour footage (shot by
three crew members) with nearly an hour of behind-the-scenes shenanigans, a trio
of &quot;Binaural&quot;-era instrumentals, videos for &quot;Do the
Evolution&quot; and &quot;Oceans&quot; (the latter unreleases stateside ‘til
now) and a special &quot;Matt-cam&quot;—an unbroken side shot of Matt
Cameron’s drumming on a number of songs (including what may be their single
best tune, the propulsive &quot;Even Flow&quot;). Although Pearl Jam has always
appeared a bit holier-than-thou to the world at large, there’s something to be
said for their consistency of sound and image. Seen in that light the disc is
nothing less than a global celebration of survival, a valentine to the fans from
a band that matters in an era where few do.<o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Geoffrey Rush gives a fairly terrific
performance in Philip Kaufman's <i>Quills</i>, which Doug Wright adapted from
his stage play depicting the Marquis de Sade's internment in the Charenton
asylum in early 19th century France, during which time he was producing an
assiduous amount of writing, including his anti-romantic parable
&quot;Justine.&quot; The film comes rather close to portraying de Sade as an
out-and-out martyr for free expression or a just-plain victim (there were
several good reasons why he was thrown into jail, then placed in Charenton), and
it takes a hard turn away from the facts towards the end (in real life, de Sade
was eventually freed, only to die penniless, spending much of his final years in
charity wards), but Rush gets much of what the film would need for a portrayal
of de Sade right: conflicted, unrecalcitrant, pitying and pitiless, driven and
corrupt but a very human beast not undeserving of pity himself. With fine
performances by Joaquin Phoenix as the Abbé who runs Charenton and believes in
using kind methods to cure patients; Kate Winslet as a maid who sees nothing
wrong with de Sade's writing, gladly helps him smuggle his manuscripts out, yet
can take care of herself very well, thank you; and Michael Caine, as a new
administrator sent to oversee the asylum and who puts his faith in curative
methods such as a dunking chair which is used to administer a primitive form of
shock treatment. The Fox Home Entertainment DVD edition features a commentary
track with Wright and three production featurettes.<o:p>

Darren Aronofsky’s second feature, <i>Requiem for a Dream</i>, tells of the
twin addictions of lonely Coney Island widow Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn,
who’d have won the Oscar if not for <i>Erin Brockovich</i>) and her son Harry
(Jared Leto), and the effects of the drug use and despair on the latter’s
girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) and pal Tyrone (Marlon Wayans). One of the
best -- and certainly the most visionary -- films of 2000, <i>Requiem for a
Dream</i> arrives on video and DVD courtesy of Artisan Home Entertainment in one
of the most lavish and eye-catching packages in recent memory. The tape is
priced to rent, and the numerous extras on the sharp DVD pressing include a
clever interactive menu scheme that looks like an infomercial (Christopher
McDonald is a hoot as motivational speaker Tappy Tibbons); a lavish brochure
with an essay by <i>Ain’t it cool news</i> founder Harry Knowles (&quot;this
film should be REQUIRED VIEWING by every friggin' High-School kid in the
country,&quot; he gushes); commentary tracks from Aranofsky and cinematographer
Matthew Libatique; an off-the-cuff thirty-three-minute production documentary
narrated by Aranofsky; nine deleted scenes with optional commentary; an episode
of the Sundance Channel’s &quot;Anatomy of a Scene,&quot; featuring Aranofsky
explaining the movie’s &quot;hip-hop montages&quot;; and Burstyn interviewing
Selby in a twenty-minute segment called &quot;Memories Dreams &amp;
Addictions&quot;. Caveat emptor: apparently, the theatrical cut of the film is
now called the &quot;unrated edition&quot; tape and the &quot;director’s
cut&quot; DVD, with an edited version (reports give it an &quot;R&quot; rating)
going out to rental chains and the like.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In contemporary Taipei, an initially joyous
wedding proves to generate an emotional ripple effect in an extended family,
with repercussions in relationships, business and life itself. One of the
leading lights of the Taiwanese cinema, Edward Yang has been making these kinds
of familial melodramas for nearly two decades. Favoring extended takes and
glimpses through windows and across apartments, his style combines minimalism
with modern bustle to create a unique world at once serene and urgent.
Screenwriter and talkshow host Wu Nienjen gives a masterfully understated
performance as NJ Jian, whose liaison with a former girlfriend mirrors the
restless nature of his wife and two children, each of whom is searching for
something beyond the empty comforts of family life. <i>Yi Yi</i> was showered
with awards in 2000; Yang won the Best Director prize at the Cannes festival,
and the movie itself won citations from critics’ groups in Boston, Los Angeles
and New York (as well as the Best Film award from the National Society of Film
Critics). Winstar’s DVD is crisp with unobtrusive subtitles under the Mandarin
dialogue, and the principal extra is an absorbing commentary track from Yang,
who begins by saying &quot;this is the first time I do this&quot; but settles
into an economical and illuminating study of a film that will stay with you far

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">About twenty minutes into <i>What Women Want</i>,
Mel Gibson does a surprisingly suave little dance number to a recording of
Sinatra singing &quot;I Won't Dance.&quot; After that, you can check to see
what's going on at the W.W.F., because the rest of the film is a leaden bore
(and it runs over two hours.) Gibson plays a womanizing ad executive who
suddenly develops the ability to hear what women think. Unfortunately, what the
filmmakers have him listen to is unremittingly banal. Helen Hunt, miscast but
trying to make her role work, plays a new, tough-as-nails executive whom Gibson
tries to romance; Valerie Perrine and Delta Burke play Gibson's office
assistants (or are they secretaries? Anyway, the movie makes a very sour joke at
their expense -- it turns out they don't have any thoughts for Gibson to listen
to); and Ashley Johnson plays the teenage daughter with whom Gibson tries to
patch things up after years of boorish behavior. Nancy Meyers directed, in a way
that suggests she hasn't moved beyond the dull 1980s comedies, like <i>Baby Boom</i>,
that she turned out with Charles Shyer. The Paramount Home Video DVD edition
includes a commentary track with Meyers and production designer Jon Hutman,
interviews with cast and crew, and a behind-the-scenes featurette.&nbsp;</font></p>

Jack Elliott's life, until very recently, was that of an individual unfortunate
enough to be sandwiched, chronologically speaking, between two legends.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>Elliott was the protégé of folk legend Woody Guthrie and the mentor of
Bob Dylan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp; </span>During
a stint in 1950s London, Elliott cut several albums that served to influence the
nascent, folk-themed skiffle movement (from which sprang, most notably, Lennon
and McCartney and Mick Jagger, who admired the way in which Elliott could bury
chords within the bass line).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>More importantly, however, was Elliott's influence on the psychology of
those in the London folk scene. As one producer, then a folk singer, observed
with retrospective awe, Elliott presented the possibility of transcending a
future predetermined by a rigid class structure; even within that type of social
system, you could hope to be and possibly achieve whatever you wanted by your
own efforts, and Elliott was living proof. The son of a Brooklyn doctor, Elliott
Adnopoz had remade himself into the epitome of the American cowboy. By the time
he returned to Greenwich Village in the early 1960s, and its emerging folk
scene, Elliott was already a legend, with a young Dylan hanging onto (and
copying) his every movement and chord. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">However,
by the mid 1970s, a combination of bad judgment, lack of focus and (although he
would never admit this) bitterness over Dylan's rise led him into a series of
broken marriages (four in total), drug use and, eventually, a self-imposed exile
from the music industry that lasted nearly twenty years. It is his daughter,
director Aiyana Elliott, who tries to pick up the threads of his life after he
has finally won acceptance from the music industry (in the form of a Grammy for
Best Traditional Folk Album), and the threads of her own life that resulted from
the side effects of having a part-time father who lived the life of a Romantic
artist in the best and worst senses of the term. She interviews everyone who
knows and knew him, from Kris Kristofferson to Arlo Guthrie (Dylan makes a brief
appearance in a black-and-white clip from the mid-1960s, acknowledging Elliott's
influences in a brief, almost indifferent, aside), and it is Guthrie who gives
her the clearest and most obvious, if perhaps the most unsatisfactory and
perplexing, answer to the questions about her father:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;
</span>maybe she will never know everything. Winner of a Special Jury Award for
Artistic Achievement at the 2000 Sundance Festival, <i>Ramblin' Jack</i> is a
bittersweet story that will inspire meditations on the real price of practicing
art on the fringes, a lifestyle which is at once more mundane and miserable than
any Hollywood riches-to-rags-to-riches story. Winstar’s DVD pressing features
Elliott’s commentary track, clips from the short film &quot;Ramblin’ Jack in
Texas&quot; and a theatrical trailer.<o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">On the bank of the river Swartkops in South
Africa, the title characters (Danny Glover, Angela Bassett) speak of their
suffering under apartheid. Athol Fugard’s play, originally presented in South
Africa in 1969, is now realized as a film by expatriate American director John
Berry (Claudine), who died of pleurisy in Paris as he was finishing it.
Fundamentally about the loss of identity that comes from being the victim of
social injustice and homelessness, the film showcases powerful performances by
Glover (uncharacteristically distasteful) and Bassett (disturbed yet dignified).
The play was adapted once before, with Fugard in the lead, but Berry, whose
career embraces a close working relationship with Orson Welles as well as the
McCarthy-era blacklist that forced him abroad, has made a version of it that
reflects a life spent working to spotlight the very human toll of prejudice and
hatred. Kino on Video brings Boesman &amp; Lena to market in both the
priced-to-rent VHS and DVD formats; the latter includes interviews with Glover,
Bassett, Berry and Fugard, as well as both letterboxed and pan-and-scan
presentations of the film itself</font><span style="font-family:Verdana"><o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the landmark feature-length documentary <i>The
Celluloid Closet</i> -- adapted from Vito Russo’s groundbreaking 1981 book --
directors Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman (who won Oscars for their two
previous works, <i>The Times of Harvey Milk</i> and <i>Common Threads: Stories
from the Quilt</i>) enlist the aid of a roster of Hollywood writers and stars to
explore the history of gay and lesbian indicators in dozens of Hollywood films,
from Thomas Edison’s 1895 short <i>The Gay Brothers </i>to <i>Philadelphia </i>(1993).
Along the way clips from <i>Morocco</i>, <i>The Gay Divorcee</i>, <i>Rebecca</i>,
<i>The Maltese Falcon</i>, <i>Rope</i>, <i>Victim</i>, <i>Rebel Without a Cause</i>,
<i>Spartacus</i>, <i>The Children’s Hour</i>, <i>Advise and Consent</i>, <i>The
Boys in the Band</i>, <i>Sunday, Bloody Sunday</i>, <i>Cabaret</i>, <i>Cruising</i>,
<i>Making Love</i>, <i>The Color Purple</i>, <i>Thelma and Louise</i>, <i>Fried
Green Tomatoes</i> and others are used to illustrate the sometimes subversive
ways in which filmmakers signaled the presence of gay characters and/or themes.
The accompanying booklet amplifies one of the film’s highlights by reprinting
the newpaper war between Gore Vidal and a clueless Charlton Heston over the
former’s deliberately placed subtext of <i>Ben-Hur</i> and the latter’s
stoic denial of it. The most revelatory feature of the Columbia TriStar Home
Entertainment DVD edition is some 55 minutes of unused interview footage; turns
out scenes with Gus van Sant, Rita Mae Brown, Gregg Araki, Chris Sarandon and
scholar Robin Wood never made it to the final cut (and Tony Curtis’ outtake
where he dishes on backstage shenanigans from the recently re-released <i>Some
Like it Hot</i> is worth the price of the disc alone). The booklet also includes
a brief yet illuminating history of the project, and commentary tracks from
Epstein, Friedman, narrator Lily Tomlin, producer Howard Rosenman, editor Arnold
Glassman and Russo are available. Although the full frame film is preceded by
the dreaded green screen of reformatted death, proper aspect ratios of clips
seem to be generally faithful and their quality is reasonably good.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Marcello Mastroianni is Snàporaz, a hapless
Lothario whisked from one feminist enclave to another by train, powerless to
control his libido yet defenseless against the onslaught of indiscriminate
desire. Among the better late-career Fellini films, <i>City of Women</i> is a
fine example of Federico Fellini’s lifelong penchant for turning his neuroses
into art. With Mastroianni once again onboard as what one critic called the
director’s &quot;alter egoist&quot; (&quot;Snàporaz&quot; being the actor’s
nickname for Fellini during the production of <i>8½</i>) <i>City of Women</i>
is long, confrontational, self-parodying, provocative, dazzling and, finally,
loads of fun. Though slow to move into the DVD arena, New Yorker Video is more
than making up for it with detailed booklets and fine extras (which bodes well
for the imprint, given their huge catalogue of titles). <i>City of Women</i> is
available as a letterboxed tape (a long-time hallmark of New Yorker releases) or
on a DVD that includes a printed 1980 Fellini interview; promotional short; the
20-minute production featurette/analysis &quot;Travelling with Fellini Through
the <i>City of Women</i>&quot; (with film historian Peter Brunette, director
Paul Mazursky and critic Emanuel Levy); profiles of the director and star; and
what look to be new and much clearer English subtitles. <o:p>

intelligence makes benevolent contact with a shaky alliance of the military and
professional UFO-seekers, as well as a random sampling of the citizenry
mysteriously drawn to Wyoming’s Devils Tower. As time goes on, <i>Close
Encounters of the Third Kind</i> looks more and more like Spielberg’s most
complete and thus best film, a canny yet sincere work in which the enthusiasm of
a still-young filmmaker and the wisdom of an older man coexist side by side and
enhance and already novel storyline. He’s clearly dazzled by the sheer pulpy
power of the movies in a way unequaled in many of his more revered titles (i.e.,
the soulless <i>Jurassic Park</i>), and his take on childhood and the cluttered
trappings of the suburban home had not yet become a movie cliché (that would
come later, after the huge success of <i>E.T.</i>). And Richard Dreyfuss, who at
this writing is about to work in series television for the first time, gives
among his best performances as the shabbily noble everyman Roy Neary, whose
dogged determination places him at the forefront of the contact. Columbia

comprises no less than the sixth separate version of the film, Spielberg’s
1999 &quot;definitive directors’ edition&quot; (it’s a long story) on disc
one (sans commentary track); and, on disc two, the 1977 featurette
&quot;Watching the Skies&quot;; eleven revelatory and unfortunately-deleted
scenes (incorporating unseen footage and some cut from the very first theatrical
version, including Dreyfuss’ anticlimactic ascension to the Mothership); and
Laurent Bouzereau’s 1997, 101-minute production documentary with even more
unused footage (including very funny test footage of various rejected alien
concepts and interview segments with visionary visual effects supervisor Douglas
Trumbull). If in fact <i>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</i> is finally and
forever finished, the cumulative effect of this definitive 137-minute cut is one
of wonder and naïve enthusiasm, as yet undiluted by the saccharine manipulation
that mars so much of his later work. <o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Abelardo (Dario Grandinetti), who has a long,
thin, curling mustache and a bit of the strutting &quot;gadjo&quot; quality that
Edward James Olmos had in <i>Blade Runner</i>, rolls into the peaceful Bolivian
town of Villaserena in the mid-to-late 1950s, and announces that he is going to
set up a local radio station, for &quot;cultural enlightenment.&quot; Since
nobody in town has electricity, the &quot;radio&quot; station broadcasts are
nothing more than something sent through a loudspeaker system, hooked together
with wiring. Along with playing music, local residents can transmit greetings,
for a small fee, or insults and castigations, for a larger fee, and as if the
intrusion of mass media didn't have enough of an effect on the town, the tempers
and emotions that begin to flare up among the citizenry certainly do. And that's
before Abelardo even gets around to playing Elvis Presley's recording of
&quot;Jailhouse Rock&quot; for the first time. There is also Celeste (Maria
Laura Garvia), a beautiful young girl who is kept locked up behind the walls of
her father's house and yard. Abelardo sees her, and she instantly strikes him as
something lovely and pure -- way beyond anything like a meer physical
attraction. Celeste's confinement has to do with something that occurred several
years earlier when the town received another visit, this time by a troop of
traveling players named &quot;Los Chicos de Cresper&quot; (&quot;Cresper&quot;
being a derivation of Shakespeare). Director Paolo Agazzi's film has just the
right, relaxed pacing to it, and once you ease into the film it can be quite
agreeable. An attempt to inject some magical realism into the proceedings by way
of the character of Don Oscar (Gustavo Angarita), a writer who lives just
outside the town and from whom, it is suggested, the characters and action have
been loosed from his head and are even directed by him through his writing,
seems extraneous -- you have the feeling that the characters would have acted
this way anyhow even if the film didn't keep cutting-back to Don Oscar to
suggest otherwise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>And you haven't
lived 'till you've heard Dario Grandinetti's way of saying that Elvis is
&quot;le Rey de rock and roll,&quot; with rolling &quot;r's.&quot; The First Run

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">When fidgety and frustrated young piano student
Bart Collins (Tommy Rettig) falls asleep at the ivories, his resulting dream
presents a surreal adventure starring his widowed mother Heloise (Mary Healy),
plumber August Zabladowski (Peter Lind Hayes), and the &quot;Happy Fingers
Method&quot; of tyrannical piano teacher Dr. Terwilliker (Hans Conried) that
involves 500 little boys banging away on a huge piano. The first live action
film written by Dr. Seuss, <i>The 5,000 Fingers of Dr. T.</i> puts last year’s
overcaffeinated, barely recognizable yet hugely successful <i>Grinch</i> to
shame with its beguiling mix of odd production design, sentimental storyline and
clever songs (best bit: the pugilistic ballet/concert in the &quot;non-piano
players dungeon&quot;). Rettig went on to star in the original
&quot;Lassie&quot; TV show, endure multiple busts for drug possession and play a
key role in software development before dying of natural causes in 1996.
Baltimore native Conried went on to play Uncle Tonoose in the Danny Thomas TV
series &quot;Make Room for Daddy,&quot; Professor Pomfritt in &quot;The Dobie
Gillis Show,&quot; voice Snidely Whiplash in &quot;The Bullwinkle Show&quot; and
&quot;The Dudley Do-Right Show&quot; and returned throughout his prolific career
to narrate and/or voice characters in various Seuss shows and specials. The
Columbia TriStar Home Video DVD release preserves the gaudy color design of the
film but exhibits mild bouts of spotting on the picture throughout. Almost worth
the disc’s price is the Gerald McBoing-Boing cartoon included as a very
special feature.&nbsp;</font></p>

font-family:Verdana">A documentary on the writer Philip K. Dick is certainly
overdue. In 1973, someone handed this writer a copy of the author's novel, <i>The
Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldrich</i>, about how Earth colonists on Mars can only
keep their wits about them by taking simulated &quot;vacations&quot; where every
day is Saturday, with no work, no worries and no obligations -- and it seems
like people have been ripping off the novel ever since. In some cases, people
seem to have ripped ideas off from the novel before it was published, fitting in
nicely with the writer's recurring preoccupation with &quot;multiple
realities.&quot; And, certainly, nothing in the film <i>Total Recall </i>can
match the guess-again twist ending of <i>I Can Remember It For You Wholesale</i>,
the short story on which it was (loosely) based. Mark Steensland and Andy
Massagi's documentary, which was produced on video and which received a brief
theatrical showing this year, touches upon some of the possibly very real
paranoia and suspicion which engendered the author's works: When PDK (as his
friends and associates called him) contacted the Marin County police (housed in
the same building later used as a central setting in the film <i>Gattaca</i>)
after a safe in his home had been blasted and burgled in 1972, the police's
response was, well, maybe he did it himself. And rather than angrily respond to
their impudence, PDK instead (according to writer Paul Williams, who profiled
him for a 1975 issue of <i>Rolling Stone</i>) surmised, &quot;Well, is it
possible I did it myself, and I'd forgotten, y'know...?&quot; PDK may have
suffered from clinical psychological problems, and he stopped writing
commercially for many years while he turned out an 8,000 page
&quot;exegesis&quot; based on a series of visions which he began to experience
shortly after the burglary break-in, and while the documentary offers some
interesting anecdotes on the writer's last 12 years up to his death in 1982
(only a few months before the premiere of <i>Blade Runner</i>, which was based
on one of his novels), it seriously lacks background material and perspective
which could have given its subject more detail. There's nothing on where PDK was
born, how he was raised, what drew him to writing in general and to the
science-fiction genre in particular, or how he gravitated out to settle in the
San Francisco bay area. One of the &quot;visions&quot; PDK experienced provided
information that enabled him to save the life of his son, but the son, and where
he came from, is never spoken of. Is this because of PDK's predilection towards
secrecy (we hear him from time to time in the film, accompanied by some rather
charmingly primitive animated renderings), or not? And as to his not
experiencing a widespread readership and fame until after his death, much of
that has to do with how his works fell out of print rather quickly during his
lifetime, in contrast to the constant drumbeats of publicity which accompanied
the publishing of new works and collections by contemporaries such as Asimov,
Bradbury, and Arthur C. Clarke. The First Run Features Home Video release is
available in both the VHS and DVD formats. -- Gregory Avery<o:p>

in a harrowing journey to safety aided only by a bumbling pair of peasants in
Akira Kurosawa’s adventure classic <i>The Hidden Fortress</i>, the film that
inspired George Lucas’ plot framework for <i>Star Wars</i>. Kurosawa’s first
widescreen production (in Japan it was called Tohoscope) is given a luminous and
stunning 16x9-ready transfer, with nary an artifact blemishing the picture after
the high-definition Sony Vialta datacine was hosed with the MTI Digital
Restoration System. Other than a an optional Dolby Digital 3.0 soundtrack
preserving the original Perspect-A-Sound simulated stereo and pungent new
subtitles, the disc boasts only only two extras, but they’re extra special:
the nearly four-minute, original Japanese trailer looks almost as good as the
picture element, and Lucas himself gives an eight-minute video interview --
filmed in January 2001 exclusively for this release -- on the film’s influence
on his own style (<i>The Hidden Fortress</i> is &quot;not at the very top of my
list, but I liked it,&quot; he confesses in typically understated style,
admitting that <i>Seven Samurai</i> remains his personal favorite). Kudos for
the package as well, a green-tinted cover scheme that gives way to a purple
tinted six-panel fold-out brochure with Armond White’s cogent essay on the
film and it’s impact. Once again, the Criterion Collection has produced a disc
that belongs on the shelf of any serious collector and student of film. <o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Before and after a lunar eclipse in the remote
village of Nomen Tuum, surrounded by waving eucalyptus trees and strange
shadows, recovering soldier Marc (William Shatner) is wooed by succubus Kia
(Allyson Ames) -- only to be saved by his unwavering love from the title
man-beast (Milos Milos). Viewers of a certain age can be forgiven for mistaking
the long-lost horror oddity <i>Incubus</i> for an episode of the original <i>Outer
Limits</i>, as it was directed by series creator Leslie Stevens and scored by
Dominic Frontiere, who composed the lush, nervous and ultimately unforgettable
music for the show. Shot in genuinely creepy black and white by Oscar-winning
cinematographer Conrad Hall (<i>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</i>, <i>American
Beauty</i>), Incubus is performed entirely in Esperanto, which gives it a
uniquely exotic and disjointed feel, at once familiar and disconcertingly
foreign. <i>Incubus</i> was thought lost for nearly thirty years, until producer
Tony Taylor was made aware of a print in Paris -- with French subtitles
(that’s why the English subtitles appear in an opaque box). Winstar’s fine
new DVD pressing exhibits less wear and tear than one might imagine for a film
with this kind of storage saga, and the package includes a commentary track with
Shatner as well as a track and interview with Taylor, Hall and assistant
photographer William A. Fraker (himself an Oscar winner). The name of the town
translates as &quot;an unknown time,&quot; and the modest but affecting
achievement of <i>Incubus</i> is that to this day it looks, sounds and feels
unlike any other fantasy title out there.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Here’s a satisfying discovery for the
discerning moviegoer who hasn’t seen a good crime drama since <i>The Usual
Suspects</i>: while sitting alone in his sparsely furnished apartment one
morning, Eddie Fleming (Hugo Weaving, known to genre fans as Agent Smith in <i>The
Matrix</i>) is violently apprehended by Detective Sergeant John Steele (Tony
Martin) and Detective Senior Constable Wayne Prior (Aaron Jeffrey). The charge?
They initially question him about a stolen car (that baroque police station
actually exists), but as the movie progresses it becomes quite clear that the
cops think he’s committed a series of murders. For his part, Fleming
vehemently maintains his innocence. So, did he, or didn’t he? Built entirely
upon a bravura performance by Weaving, this ironically titled chamber thriller
doesn’t give away anything until the final shot (nor will this review). As
co-written and directed by Craig Monahan, this Australian import is the kind of
movie during which you’ll hold your breath, convinced they can’t keep the
conceit alive another minute. Yet they do, for the almost two hours it takes to
conduct <i>The Interview</i>. <i>The Interview</i> is another New Yorker Video
release; the VHS tape is priced to rent, while the DVD includes Monahan’s
commentary track and an alternate ending with optional commentary.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In a career full of little-seen but formidable
masterpieces, Jacques Rivette (who will debut a new film at the 2001 Cannes
festival) has built a magnificent body of work known as much for its length as
its leisurely yet incisive probing into human affairs. At twelve minutes shy of
four hours, the 1997 historical epic <i>Joan the Maid</i> followed the American
art-house success of <i>La Belle Noiseuse</i> yet failed to capture much of an
audience. Now, seventeen months after releasing Joan the Maid in a VHS boxed
set, Facets Video unveils a two-disc DVD pressing that adds filmographies and a
historical timeline to the package. Distilled from its original six hours, the
two films which comprise <i>Joan the Maid</i> tell in meticulous detail the
journey of Joan from rural maid to reluctant martyr by focusing on the spaces
between the familiar events of the story (viewers wanting to see the trial, for
instance, are subtly directed to Carl Theodor Dreyer’s <i>The Passion of Joan
of Arc</i> [available from the Criterion Collection]: Rivette purposefully skips
the proceedings). Thus, this Joan, played with solemn dignity by Sandrine
Bonnaire, is vulnerable, human, headstrong and, finally, empathetic in a way,
say, Otto Preminger’s never was (and let’s not talk about Luc Besson’s <i>The
Messenger</i>). Movie lovers fascinated by Rivette’s approach to the art form
will want to seek out 1974’s <i>Celine and Julie Go Boating</i> from New
Yorker Video and Cinema Parallel’s tape set of <i>Up/Down/Fragile</i> (1995);
let’s hope the future brings more of his serenely unique films to the American
market.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When successful advertising executive Nelly
(Isabelle Huppert) leaves her boyfriend of three years (Guy Marchand) for the
thuggish drifter Loulou (Gérard Depardieu), their subsequent relationship
struggles to bridge huge gaps of class and temperament. An affecting time
capsule of French prosperity in the late 1970s, <i>Loulou</i> caused a stir at
the 1980 Cannes film festival for an implied criticism of this proto-yuppie
tendency when balanced against a simpler and earthier way of life (movies like <i>Rosetta</i>
and Humanite are greeted the same way today). Writer-director Maurice Pialat
calls it a &quot;modern melodrama whose mood is also very free and easy,&quot;
and among the film’s often elusive pleasures are the younger Depardieu and
Huppert, then perhaps the most prominent and exciting new French actors. <i>Loulou</i>
is available on VHS tape and DVD from New Yorker Video, with the disc featuring
a fine transfer supplemented by a printed discussion by Pialat that reads very
much like a commentary track.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">French comic icon Jacques Tati (1908-1982)
learned his craft as an actor and music hall mime in the 1930s, later developing
over three decades and some half-dozen painstakingly constructed post-World War
II features an onscreen persona of raincoat, umbrella, hat and pipe that was as
identifiable in his era as the physical accoutrements of the everyman performers
that inspired him, Charlie Chaplin, Max Linder and, especially, Buster Keaton.
His sublimely funny body of work, which escalates into increasing visual
complexity from film to film, is an extended commentary on the modernization
(read: Americanization) of French cultural traditions, a societal tendency that
remains controversial there even today -- more than thirty years after the
visionary <i>Playtime</i>. Fiercely independent in the French film industry,
Tati raised his own money and spent a lot of time on preproduction, which
explains why he only completed six films. Remedying the dearth of decent prints
currently available to the home video enthusiast (the fullframe video treatment
afforded the astonishing widescreen romp <i>Playtime </i>is particularly
hideous), The Criterion Collection’s much-anticipated and stylishly designed
new DVD releases serve to introduce Tati’s peculiar and distinctive genius to
a new generation of moviegoers. The director’s onscreen alter ego, Monsieur
Hulot, is introduced in the luminously black and white <i>M. Hulot’s Holiday</i>,
which riffs on the myriad pitfalls of leisure time and is among the very few
comedies to have ever won the Cannes festival’s <b><i>Palme d’Or</i></b>
grand prize. Moving into the color palette, <i>Mon Oncle</i> refines M.
Hulot’s ongoing battle with technology as the dexterously befuddled gentleman
does battle with the house of the future, 1958 style. <i>Playtime</i>,
originally shot and presented in 70mm to the thunderous disinterest of critics
and befuddlement of French audiences, is a dense and visually deep masterpiece,
a lament for a Paris given over to modernist architecture and westernized bustle
in which M. Hulot wanders like a child discovering how to cross the street but
not yet grasping the &quot;why&quot; of the endeavor. All three discs are
beautiful digital transfers with new and greatly improved subtitles, with each
film including an enthusiastic video introduction by former Monty Python trouper
Terry Jones (who lovingly proclaims Hulot &quot;a beautiful character&quot;).
The <i>M. Hulot’s Holiday</i> disc features René Clément’s twelve-minute
1936 Tati-starring boxing spoof short <i>Soigne ton gauche</i> (<i>Watch Your
Left</i>) and a printed essay by veteran film critic David Ehrenstein. <i>Mon
Oncle</i>’s package includes the filmmaker’s own marvelously physical
directorial debut, the fifteen-minute 1947 short <i>L’ecole des facteurs </i>(<i>The
School for Postmen</i>) -- featuring bits later swiped by such disparate comic
performers as Jackie Chan and Paul Reubens -- as well as critic Matt Zoller
Seitz’ printed essay. The <i>Playtime</i> set encompasses Tati’s
twenty-eight-minute 1967 short on the art and education of physical comedy,
&quot;Cours du soir&quot;, as well as a printed essay by critic Kent Jones. Each
feature will also see a May 22 VHS release, sans extras. In a modern visual
world dominated by mindless camera movements and frenzied, manipulative editing,
this trio of sublime comic gems is a reminder that comedy need not be frenetic
to enthrall.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Actually a collection of six features and two
shorts available on seven separate tapes, Facets Video’s collection of films
by and about prolific Iranian filmmaker Mohsen Makhmalbaf has the umbrella title
&quot;Film Revolutionary&quot; -- a fitting description of an Iranian enfant
terrible who once said &quot;cinema cultivates man&quot; and has nearly 20
features to his credit since being freed from prison during the 1979 Islamic
Revolution (his new work, <i>Safar e Ghandehar</i>, is set to debut at the 2001
Cannes festival). Abbas Kiarostami may be more well-known to American audiences
and that’s fine, yet where his work is relatively serene, Makhmalbaf’s is
more confrontational. And both men share a fascination with the process and
artifice of filmmaking, as evidenced by Makhmalbaf’s period comedy <i>Once
Upon a Time, Cinema</i> (<i>Ruzi ruzegari, Cinema</i>, 1992), in which a
cinematographer introduces film to the Persian court; and <i>The Actor</i> (<i>Honarpisheh</i>,
1993), which finds a commercial actor sacrificing his family life in the pursuit
of more &quot;serious&quot; roles. How committed is Makhmalbaf to the cinema?
His 21-year-old daughter Samira has already directed two well-received features,
<i>The Apple</i> (<i>Sib</i>, 1998) and <i>Blackboards </i>(<i>Tahkte sia</i>,
2000), while his wife Marziyeh Meshkini helmed the current U.S. arthouse hit <i>The
Day I Became a Woman</i> (<i>Roozi khe zan shodam</i>, 2000). Perhaps the place
to start here is with Houshang Gomakani’s documentary <i>Stardust Stricken --
Mohsen Makhmalbaf: A Portrait</i> (<i>Gong-e Khab-Dideh, Zendegi, Asar va
Andishehaye Mohsen Makhmalbaf</i>, 1996), a 70-minute portrait on the filmmaker.
The director’s fourth feature, <i>Boycott</i> (<i>Baycot</i>, 1985), is the
semi-autobiographical story of a leftist who has a change of heart while in a
pre-Revolution prison. <i>The Peddler</i> (<i>Dastforush</i>, 1986), is a
portmanteau film encompassing three distinct stories set among Tehran’s poor,
and his follow-up film, <i>The Cyclist</i> (<i>Bicyleran</i>, 1989), amplifies
that theme with its story of an Afghan refugee reluctantly coerced to enter a
grueling bicycle marathon to pay his wife’s doctor bills. Makhmalbaf
reportedly considers his best film to date to be <i>Marriage of the Blessed</i>
(<i>Arusi-ye khuban</i>, 1989), in which a veteran of the Iran-Iraq war can no
longer accept the contrast between patriotic martyrdom and the poverty he
documents as a photojournalist in Tehran. Two of the director’s short films,
one dramatic and one impressionistic, are also available under the title <i>Images
from the Qajar Dynasty</i>/<i>The School Blown Away By the Wind</i>. Audiences
already familiar with Makhmalbaf’s more high-profile films (1996’s <i>Gabbeh</i>
and 1998’s <i>The Silence</i>, both available from New Yorker Films) will want
to seek out these uncompromising inquiries into contemporary Iranian life.&nbsp;</font></p>

35mm interpositive print is evocative of the utilitarian visual scheme, and the
sole extra from the disc is a literate and revealing 1996 commentary track from
Jordan -- who sounds like he’s in conversation with you -- in which he
explores his early impulses, likes and dislikes and the genesis of the film
(Hoskins is occasionally intercut with background on his character and the
collaboration with Tyson). <o:p>

font-family:Verdana">When hunky young law student Martin Bork (Nikolaj Coster
Waldau) takes the job of <i>Nightwatch</i> at the local morgue, he thinks
he’ll spend his shifts studying and listening to music. But there’s a killer
prowling the town preying on prostitutes, and sinister events soon involve not
only the young student but his best mate Jens (Kim Bodnia), Kalinka (Sofie Gråbøl,
terrific at wide-eyed terror) and cop Peter Wörmer (Ulf Pilgaard, looking like
a Mort Drucker drawing come to life) as well. Writer-director Ole Bornedal
reenergized Danish film with this slick, mischievous thriller, although fans
seeking supernatural horror should look elsewhere as the emphasis here is on
more base instincts. Anchor Bay’s DVD pressing includes the director’s
commentary track and an English subtitle track. Beware of Bornedal’s inferior
1998 remake for theatrical distributor Miramax (starring Nick Nolte and Ewen
McGregor), which has only the dependably weird Brad Dourif in a small but
pivotal role to recommend it.&nbsp;</span></p>

font-family:Verdana">The not-quite-so-dark side of Apollo 13’s eventful voyage
to the moon, <i>Out of the</i> <i>Present</i> is the found footage chronicle of
the ten-month odyssey of cosmonaut Sergei Krikalev, who left the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics under the control of Mikhail Gorbachev in 1991 for the
orbiting Mir space station, only to be stranded there by political machinations
below, returning to find one Boris Yeltsin in charge of a significantly smaller
and vastly different country called Russia. In the interim, director Andrei
Ujica documents the failed putsch in Moscow as well as the Mir crew changes and
other administrative challenges, utilizing TV footage, amateur video, archival
material and original 35mm footage shot on board the craft by former Andrei
Tarkovsky cinematographer Vadim Yusov. Ujica even throws in brief, sly
references to Tarkovsky’s <i>Solaris</i>, as well as Stanley Kubrick’s <i>2001:
A Space Odyssey</i>. Still, <i>Out of the Present</i> isn’t as much about the
changes in Russian society as it is a film and video paean to the transfixing
beauty of space and the intricate, rickety and altogether mesmerizing machines
earthlings construct to get there and stay there as long as possible. Now that
Mir has plopped harmlessly into the Pacific Ocean, Facets Video offers a
crystalline DVD of <i>Out of the Present</i>, with no extras but a splendidly
evocative sound mix that highlights the odd mix of tunes (Sinatra, Malcolm
McLaren, Zarah Leander, Bass-O-Matic) onboard the space station that is no
more.&nbsp;</span></p>

festival and the Best Foreign Film Academy Award, <i>Pelle the Conqueror</i>
stars Max von Sydow as a humble Swedish widower who, along with his son Pelle
(Pelle Hvenegaard), endures all manner of injustice in their fight for simple
dignity. After working as a cinematographer and making children’s films for
the previous decade, director Bille August reached an international audience
with this stately yet moving human saga. In the years since he’s stayed in the
arena of big budgets and large casts, although he’s struggled with
well-meaning but hopelessly muddled misfires, many adapted from respected novels
(<i>The House of the Spirits</i>, <i>Smilla’s Sense of Snow</i>). His best
film, the ambitious family epic The Best Intentions (1992), is from a script by
Ingmar Bergman and available on VHS only. Anchor Bay Entertainment’s new DVD
pressing of <i>Pelle the Conqueror </i>is pristine, with cinematographer Jorgen
Persson’s lovely images barely disturbed by the clean subtitles. The disc is
enhanced for 16x9 televisions and includes a theatrical trailer.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Consumptive ex-con Tony (Jean Servais) joins
with three of his Parisian mates to rob a jewelry store, only to find the plan
go awry after they’ve gotten the loot. The prototypical caper picture, the
visceral and brutal <i>Rififi</i> was directed by blacklisted Hollywood
filmmaker Jules Dassin (who also appears under the alias Perlo Vita as
safecracker César) after years of introversion following in France following
the inquiries of the House Un-American Activities Committee. Of course, with
such films as <i>Naked City</i> and <i>Brute Force</i>, the director had already
proven his mettle with expressionistic film noir, yet for years there’d been
nagging rumors that the success was due more to producer Mark Hellinger than
Dassin. <i>Rififi</i> proved otherwise, becoming a huge success in Europe,
winning Dassin the <b><i>Palme d’Or</i></b> in Cannes and supposedly inspiring
a number of real-life robberies. Like John Huston’s <i>The Asphalt</i> <i>Jungle</i>
(1950) and Stanley Kubrick’s <i>The Killing</i> (also 1956), <i>Rififi</i> is
the template for nearly a half century’s worth of heist movies. The Criterion
Collection DVD presents a luminous digital transfer of the film (fullframe,
matching its original aspect ratio), supplemented with a twenty-nine-minute
Dassin interview (&quot;I think I’m a crook at heart,&quot; he says smoothly
during the summer 2000 chat with New York-based programmer and film historian
Bruce Goldstein); Alexandre Trauner’s production drawings and set stills;
production notes; a theatrical trailer (compare the vastly improved print
quality), and even the option of an English dubbed soundtrack -- which isn’t
recommended. Everything else in the package is; <i>Rififi</i> is an eye-opening
genre triumph.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In a remote Texas town, sheriff John T. Chance
(John Wayne) has only drunken deputy Dude (Dean Martin), crippled jailer Stumpy
(Walter Brennan) and ambitious young singing gunfighter Colorado (Ricky Nelson)
to help him fend off the Burdette gang as they try to free their brother Joe
(Claude Akins) from the town jail. The second of four westerns Wayne made with
director Howard Hawks and the first following the pivotal <i>Red River</i>
(1948), <i>Rio Bravo</i> is a perfectly modulated, defiantly stately exploration
of many of Hawks’ most important themes, including friendship under stress,
generational responsibility and the awkwardness of frontier men around women (a
young Angie Dickinson diverts the Duke for a spell). These ideas may seem quaint
today, but other than his long collaboration with John Ford, Wayne has never
been more masculine and formidable than in the movies he made with Hawks. Martin
too is revealing in one of his most interesting and multileveled performances,
although seen today Nelson’s pale imitation of Elvis Presley doesn’t really
come off as envisioned. The Warner Bros. DVD presents a fine if unspectacular
transfer, but sadly there are no revealing extras beyond the boilerplate cast
and filmmaker profiles, supplemented by a trailer. Moviegoers new to the
Hawks/Ford canon will probably want to see these movies chronologically,
beginning with <i>Red River</i>, then <i>Rio Bravo</i>, and the mellow mischief
of <i>El Dorado</i> (1967) and <i>Rio Lobo</i> (1970).&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As an historic cinematic sucker punch, <i>Rocky</i>
is hard to beat. An unknown quantity when he wrote this triumphantly clichéd
story of a down-on-his luck Philadelphia boxer who gets one memorable shot at
the big time, the fearfully broke Sylvester Stallone turned down a lucrative
payday for his script and insisted on playing the starring role. It was a gamble
then and a legend now, a sentimental knockout punch of a movie preserved in the
same kind of meticulous DVD package in which MGM showcased their James Bond
franchise. Available either as a single purchase or part of a much pricier box
set bundled with the subsequent sequels (none of which are as fresh and
beguiling as the original), the <i>Rocky</i> disc includes a fine letterboxed
transfer of the film; a fact-packed four-page booklet; audio commentary from
director John G. Avildsen, producers Irwin Winkler &amp; Robert Chartoff, Talia
Shire and Burt Young; a video commentary from Stallone, three different
production featurettes; and the usual raft of trailers, advertising material and
the like. An underdog of a film from concept to execution, <i>Rocky</i> is among
the most genuinely surprising Best Picture Oscar upset stories in AMPAS history
and a film that, against all odds, remains perennially fresh in spite of its
shameless genre plundering.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">At
first Antonio (Carmelo Gomez) seems like just another quiet photographer moving
through Madrid, but a complex relationship with overripe junkie Charo (Ruth
Gabriel) and her gaggle of drug-addicted friends (including <i>Before Night
Falls</i>’ Javier Bardem) reveals Antonio to be a Basque terrorist intent on
blowing up a police station. A sexy Spanish thriller with acres of skin and a
low-key, nasty attitude, <i>Running Out of Time</i> swept the 1995 Goya awards
(the Spanish version of the Oscar), winning for Best Film, director, editing,
screenplay, special effects and acting prizes for Gomez, Gabriel and Bardem. The
movie takes awhile to build a head of steam, yet producer-turned-director Imanol
Uribe seems tuned to authentic street style highlighted by a pace that masks a
drug-fuelled energy beneath a laconic exterior. New Yorker Video distributes the
Tanelorn Films release, and while the letterboxed VHS transfer is priced to
rent, the DVD has no additional features. <o:p>

mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Verdana"> follows the education and rise
of Catherine the Great (Marlene Dietrich), and is told with the expressionistic
visuals and &quot;relentless excursion into style&quot; typical of director
Josef von Sternberg. &quot;I don’t value authenticity,&quot; he told
interviewer Kevin Brownlow in the twenty-minute 1967 BBC interview included in
the disc’s extras (just the kind of obscure gem for which the Criterion
Collection is justly revered), and his penultimate film with Dietrich baffled
critics and repelled audiences. Yet seen today it’s a deliriously extravagant
spectacle, at once an <b><i>hommage</i></b> to epic filmmaking and an exuberant
spoof of the form itself (note that most of the plot comes courtesy of
intertitles, leaving more time for sets, costumes and melodramatic intrigue).
Although possessed of a slight grain, the transfer is as clean as the
picture’s looked in years, and the eye-catching twelve-page accordion-style
brochure includes an illuminating and apparently original essay by Robin Wood,
as well as the 1963 tribute by late avant-garde filmmaker Jack Smith (originally
published in <i>Film Culture</i>). With a work like <i>The Scarlet Empress</i>,
context is everything (particularly to those just discovering the von
Sternberg-Dietrich collaboration), so chalk up another service to film heritage
courtesy of The Criterion Collection.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Abducted By Aliens as a Child, He Returns
to Earth an Outer-Space Killing Machine!&quot; As cheesy as its tag line
promises, <i>Spaceman</i>, the first feature from &quot;the prime comedic
force&quot; behind The Onion, Scott Dikkers, is cheap and proud of it. David
Ghilardi stars as the titular traveler, whose adventures working in a grocery
store and as a hitman (!!!) while searching for his mother lead to love with his
stringy-haired neighbor (Deborah King) and a confrontation with an FBI agent
(Brian Stack) keen to literally dissect anyone involved with, uh, Spaceman. But
don’t get your hopes up for an Onion-ish romp through sci-fi genre
conventions. Spaceman is well-written but leadenly paced, and surprisingly
conventional for the apparent brainchild of the online satire magazine
(&quot;Microsoft Patents Ones, Zeroes&quot;). Still, it has its moments,
including Edward Pearsall’s terrific orchestral score and the final martial
arts showdown on a suburban lawn (the film was shot on location in Chicago and
Wisconsin). And it did win the Audience Award at the Austin Film Festival… The
Palm Pictures DVD includes the option of 5.1 surround or 2.0 stereo, some
outtakes, and a booklet essay and commentary track from Dikkers (who, it says
here, dropped out of &quot;the prestigious USC Film School after realizing he
couldn’t afford to go there&quot;).&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In ancient Rome, a slave revolt led by the
defiant Spartacus (Kirk Douglas) has a ripple effect in the highest corridors of
power. The least personal of director Stanley Kubrick’s projects, <i>Spartacus</i>
was the brainchild of Douglas, who yearned to make an intelligent
sword’n’sandal epic and replaced original director Anthony Mann with his <i>Paths
of Glory</i> helmer Kubrick partway through production. Unlike most of the
movies in the genre, <i>Spartacus</i> remains to this day an absorbing political
chess match punctuated by thrilling action and leavened with smart, literate and
cynical humor courtesy of blacklisted writer Dalton Trumbo -- a period epic for
people who think they don’t much care for period epics. And the supporting
cast is superb, featuring notable work from Charles Laughton, Laurence Olivier,
Peter Ustinov, Tony Curtis, Jean Simmons, and John Ford regular Woody Strode as
Spartacus’ first nemesis. The Criterion Collection 2-DVD set is breathtaking
in its scope, offering a 16x9 transfer of the 1991 Super Technirama restoration
(by Robert A. Harris and James C. Katz), supplemented by a restoration
demonstration; commentary from no less than six principals in front of and
behind the camera (excluding Kubrick), deleted scenes; newsreel footage; Kubrick
production sketches; the 1960 blacklist documentary <i>The Hollywood Ten</i>;
and a handful of interviews, prominent among which is a 1992 twenty-four-minute
chat with Ustinov (who does terrific impressions of Laughton and Olivier).
&quot;I don’t know what to say to people who tell me ‘Boy, I really loved <i>Spartacus</i>,’&quot;
confesses Ustinov. Tell ‘em thanks, and be grateful that so many people took
so much time to get this release right; <i>Spartacus</i> belongs on the wish
list of anyone serious about movies and DVD. <o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In 1954 Belgrade, ten-year-old Zoran (Dimitrije
Vojnov) develops dual fixations on charismatic leader Marshal Tito and
twelve-year-old schoolmate Jasna (Milena Vukosav), obsessions that distract him
from his comically cramped living conditions with his artist parents (regional
mainstays Predrag Manoilovic, Anica Dobra) and lead to a walking tour of
Tito’s homeland with tyrannical leader Comrade Raja (Lazar Ristovski) that
teaches the boy hard truths about the real world. Prominent Belgrade-born
writer-director Goran Markovic’s splendid social comedy isn’t without its
political jabs, yet the focus is always on the wide-eyed Zoran, a pudgy, wise
presence whose undemanding adoration of Tito (seen in voluminous newsreel
footage and played as a grinning popinjay by Voja Brajovic) and subsequent
disillusionment can in itself be read as a political statement. Yet even without
specific knowledge of these nuances, <i>Tito and Me</i> can stand proudly
alongside such similar-themed films as <i>Small Change</i>, <i>My Life as a Dog</i>,
<i>When Father Was Away on</i> <i>Business</i> and <i>Kolya</i> for its
compassionate exploration of the peculiar regional stresses of childhood. <i>Tito
and Me</i> is available exclusively as a clean yet unadorned DVD from Winstar;
note that the transfer appears to be in the 1:66 letterboxed format (not the
fullframe 1:33 ratio listed on the case), and once again they’ve failed to put
the year of release in the printed cre</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">dits (note to Winstar and other companies who
follow this practice: proper documentation is crucial, particularly since anyone
predisposed to buy this or any of your foreign-language DVD’s probably already
know a film’s vintage).&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Before he made a name for himself directing the
over-the-top American genre-bending exercises <i>Robocop</i>, <i>Total Recall</i>,
<i>Basic Instinct</i>, <i>Showgirls</i>, <i>Starship Troopers</i> and <i>The
Hollow Man</i>, Amsterdam-born Paul Verhoeven was directing over-the-top
genre-bending movies in his native Dutch. His second feature and one of the most
popular films ever released in the Netherlands, the sexually frank <i>Turkish
Delight</i> stars a young Rutger Hauer as a Dutch sculptor whose passionate and
freewheeling affair with Olga (Monique van de Ven) ends poorly. <i>Soldier of
Orange</i> is one of his best films, an epic story of a half-dozen Dutch men and
their fates during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands (note the similarity
to martial themes and documentary flourishes later featured in <i>Starship
Troopers</i>). His last and most notorious Dutch film before heading to
Hollywood, the baroque Fourth Man anticipates <i>Basic Instinct</i> with Renée
Soutendijk’s sexual manipulation of Catholic bisexual novelist Jeroen Krabbé
(another Verhoeven regular now working in American films). Heavy-handed in the
most enjoyable sense of the phrase, Verhoeven combines blunt stories and lusty
performances with undeniable technical craft (both of his cinematographers
during this period, Jan de Bont and Jost Vacano, have gone on to successful
Hollywood careers -- the former as director of <i>Speed</i> and <i>Twister</i>,
the latter as Verhoeven’s consistent collaborator). All three titles -- which
are sold separately -- are given fine, director-approved transfers via Anchor
Bay, with the excitable Verhoeven providing thickly accented commentary tracks
on each. <o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Here's a new one: two young men (James Layton
and Lee Williams) are persecuted by the residents of a modern-day village in the
British countryside, not because they are gay but because they are wolves (with
long tails sticking out from underneath the backs of their outerwear coats). <i>The
Wolves of Kromer</i> tries to draw a parallel between the sometimes mindless
antipathy demonstrated by human towards wolves with the often mindless antipathy
displayed by people towards homosexuals; the local cleric points out &quot;there
were no wolves in the Garden of Eden&quot; (The &quot;g&quot; and the
&quot;h&quot; words are never used in the film). And the &quot;wolves&quot; in
the film aren't vicious in the least -- all they want to do is hang out in the
woods, smooch, and have parties on the beach. The central conceit isn't really
developed enough to sustain an entire movie, and our attention keeps getting
yanked away to a parallel plotline where two wicked old ladies are poisoning a
third in order to get hold of her property (the reason for this is not made
clear until almost the very end of the film). But the picture is so far out
there that it's worth having a look at. Both Layton and Williams give very good
performances (the film was made on a small budget, and the locations look like
they were cold), suggesting that the director, Will Gould, may have some good
pictures up his sleeve in the future; the narration, by Boy George, is delivered
very, very early on in the proceedings. The First Run Features VHS is priced to
rent, and the DVD pressing has no extra features.<o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Back
in Moscow in 1936 after the emotionally exhausting collapse of the <i>Qué Viva
México!</i> project (Kino on Video’s new DVD of the reconstructed film was
reviewed in the April column), director Sergei Eisenstein suffered further
indignities when his first sound film, <i>Bezhin Meadow</i> (1935-1937) --
indeed, his first work since 1929’s <i>The Old and the New</i> -- was derailed
by the director’s illness and a perceived violation of the Socialist Realism
party line. By the time his assignment to the historical epic <i>Alexander
Nevsky</i> rolled around, Eisenstein was in dire need of the Russian version of
a box office hit. Operatic in scale and vivid in its thrity-minute ice battle, <i>Nevsky
</i>delivered with its &quot;symphonic structure&quot; of the thirteenth century
hero’s repelling of a German invasion, set to a stirring score by long-time
collaborator Sergei Prokofiev. Sailing into his final film on the wave of that
success, Eisenstein once again became bogged down by health problems and
official censorship in a mammoth, three-part biography of sixteenth century
Russian unifier Czar Ivan IV. <i>Ivan the Terrible: Part I</i> was a great
popular success, part two was rushed and disliked by Stalin, and part three was
never finished; Eisenstein died of a heart attack on February 11, 1948 --
nineteen days after his fiftieth birthday. Remedying the availability of
numerous inferior video and DVD copies over the years, The Criterion Collection
has finally delivered its long-promised &quot;Eisenstein: The Sound Years&quot;
three-disc boxed set, and it was worth the wait. Both transfers were created on
a high-definition Spirit Datacine from new 35mm composite fine-grain master
positives struck expressly for the imprint by Mosfilm, and each enclosed
brochure is built around an essay by critic J. Hoberman. The <i>Nevsky</i> disc
features a first-rate commentary by film scholar David Bordwell, a restoration
demonstration, the reconstructed <i>Bezhin Meadow</i> and more. The <i>Ivan the
Terrible</i> discs include deleted scenes, two multimedia essays by noted
scholars and an electronic portfolio of production stills and drawings. A
building block in the collection of any serious cineaste, &quot;Eisenstein: The
Sound Years&quot; is a DVD set to watch, learn from and live with. Note to
Criterion completists: as per their catalogue, the boxed set itself is #86 in
the series, Alexander Nevsky is #87 and the two-disc Ivan the Terrible set is
#88.</span></font></p>
