            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b>The
            blissful friendship of Method Man and Redman is the stuff of legend.
            Though they started their careers as members of different groups --
            Meth in the redoubtable Wutang Clan and Redman, briefly, in EPMD's
            Hit Squad -- their coming together has since seemed like some weird
            kind of destiny. These adorable scamps are always making hilarious
            fun of someone or something, always puffing on some huge blunt,
            always reveling in the privilege that comes with stardom and
            adulation. They like who they are and what they do, at least on
            camera. Who can forget Meth's confession in the documentary <i>Backstage</i>,
            that he that likes to put peanuts in his nose and blow them back out
            into the bag so some unsuspecting soul will eat the nose-gooed
            morsels? Or in the same film, Redman's invitation to the interviewer
            to lean in close, in order to hear his &quot;nuts talk&quot;? <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">But
            even amid all this good fun, thirty-year-old Method Man and
            twenty-nine-year-old Redman have been forging a solid career as a
            performing duo. They tour, they clown (and have been compared to
            Laurel &amp; Hardy or Abbott &amp; Costello), they recorded a CD (<i>Blackout!</i>).
            And now, they've made a movie, directed by Jesse Dylan, other son of
            Bob, and titled <i>How High</i> (after one of Redman's popular
            singles) and plainly modeled on the Cheech and Chong aesthetic. The
            film opens -- so very appropriately -- with Cypress Hill's &quot;Hit
            from the Bong&quot; (&quot;I love you maryjane!&quot;) as you meet
            Silas (Method Man), an exceptionally well-organized dope dealer. He
            keeps his apartment stocked with weed for every occasion --
            aphrodisiacs, painkillers, cures for limp dicks and blue balls --
            and is clearly one of the most popular fellows on his block. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Still,
            Silas might do better for himself, or at least that's the idea put
            in his head by his best friend Ivory (Chuck Davis), right before the
            poor kid lights himself on fire and falls out the window, only to be
            smooshed by a bus. When Silas sprinkles dead Ivory's ashes into a
            pot plant (in respectful commemoration, of course), Ivory returns as
            a ghost, ready to help Silas be smarter than he ever thought he
            could be. Before Silas takes his college entrance exams, he smokes a
            pep-up joint out in the parking lot. And wouldn't you know? Up
            drives Jamal (Redman), who happens to be taking those same exams.
            It's clear from first toke that he and Silas are meant for each
            other. After such inspiration, their exams are brilliant, so much so
            that soon, every college around is recruiting them. For the sake of
            argument, assume that Harvard is a reasonable choice, and there you
            have the film's premise -- two fun-loving, self-confident,
            completely charming potheads go to Harvard. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">This
            point of departure is not so different from the summer's surprise
            hit, <i>Legally Blonde</i>, in which Reese Witherspoon goes to law
            school despite all odds against her femme personality and love of
            fashion, where she teaches her snotty classmates and profs a few
            things about common sense and courtesy. (That film was, by the way,
            a surprise hit, and everyone thought it cute and inoffensive.) In
            the case of Redman and Method Man, however, plot is decidedly
            unimportant, and morality even less so. There are no lessons here,
            just cutting up and messing around. Yes, the two interlopers shake
            up the status quo, but only because said quo wants to be shook.
            Thus, the crew coach (Hector Elizondo) is looking for a way to
            upstage his obnoxious, bigheaded charges. Jamal's request to join
            the team is just what he's been hoping for. Within minutes, coach is
            wearing his baseball cap backwards and his sweatpants with one leg
            rolled up, happily chowing down on chips when called on the carpet
            by Dean Cain (Obba Babatunde). A few scenes later, the uptight dean
            is getting rather down himself, after unknowingly downing a batch of
            pot-laced brownies. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Silas
            and Jamal's fellow students are, for the most part, thrilled to have
            them around, including the silent I Need Money (<i>Hits From the
            Street</i>'s Al Shearer) and the U.S. Vice President's daughter,
            Jamie (Essence Atkins): the film never explains how the VP (Jeffrey
            Jones) is white and she's black, but it clearly doesn't matter to
            anyone on screen. Silas, of course, also finds a girl, the
            straight-A student Lauren (Lark Voorhies), who happens to be
            involved with the perpetually tense and hypercompetitive crew
            captain Bart (Chris Elwood). Naturally, she's more than happy to
            kick it with the superbly laid back Silas. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Meth
            is, as always, an exceedingly charismatic presence, and his partner
            an able comic foil. In their joint MTV <i>Diary,</i> Meth describes
            their ineffable chemistry: &quot;I got chocolate, he got peanut
            butter, and we crash into each other.&quot; The guy has mad skills,
            plainly. So what if the film is straight-up ridiculous, with stupid
            pimp and hoochie jokes, right alongside the commendable observations
            that class hierarchies are unpleasant and unfair, and meritocracies
            (especially traditional ones, like the structure at Harvard) tend to
            be based on subjective and system-sustaining evaluations. <o:p>

            High</span></font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">
            doesn't spend much time making these points. It's more concerned
            with the good times rolling. During the same <i>Diary</i> episode,
            Redman complains about having to answer repeated questions
            concerning the movie's &quot;message.&quot; You can understand his
            frustration. It's not like anyone involved has ever pretended that <i>How
            High</i> is about anything other than what it is, a raucous pothead
            movie. And that's frankly more fun and less strained than most any
            portion of <i>Not Another Teen Movie</i>. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>

            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">But
            it might also get you wondering about just where and how revolution
            -- in class organizations, social value judgments, or academic
            insularities -- might occur. If a movie like <i>How High</i> appears
            to re-present the &quot;problems&quot; that outsiders (those who
            won't see the film) imagine in what might be called, for lack of a
            better term, weed culture, then how might outsiders be educated to
            accept difference? By the same token, if the movie grants some
            riotous, carnivalesque upending of tiresome conventions and
            expectations, allowing insiders (those who will see the film) some
            pleasure at the expense of those they perceive as outsiders, then
            how might there ever be a meeting of minds across inside and
            outside? It could be, of course, that such a meeting is impossible,
            that the combined generational, classed, and cultural differences at
            stake are too entrenched to warrant anyone's effort to bridge them. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><i><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">How
            High</span></font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">
            isn't even the film that needs to answer any of these questions, of
            course. But it's worth interrogating the &quot;ghettoization&quot;
            process, that is, how films are conceived, marketed, and categorized
            so that niche audiences find what they want and others look
            elsewhere. It's completely likely that Meth, at least, and probably
            Redman too, will have acting careers if they want them (not unlike
            Snoop, Ice Cube, or Ice T before them). Meth, for example, has a
            seductive presence and ease on screen that will allow him to cross
            over wherever he wants. That he's so far remaining so close to his
            roots, so overtly fond of his friends, and so faithful to his fans'
            expectations, suggests that it may not be too much to hope that
            someday, the industry will adjust to the talents and interests of
            its players, rather than vice versa. <o:p>
