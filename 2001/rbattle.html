            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 5 October
            2001</i></font>
            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">At the beginning of &quot;Battle 
            Royale&quot;, we see a group of Japanese schoolchildren, numbering just 
            over forty, ranging in age from eleven to fourteen, on a bus that is 
            taking them on a class outing. The students, in their crisp gray and 
            white school uniforms, talk amongst themselves, joke, take 
            snapshots, and share a bag of cookies that one of them has brought 
            along for the trip.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The trip is evidently taking longer 
            than expected, because when we next see them, they are asleep in 
            their seats on the bus. Then, they awaken in what looks like their 
            old school room back in the city, only there are armed soldiers 
            about. The lights come on, and their schoolteacher, Kitano, appears, 
            and in no uncertain terms he underscores the gravity of the 
            situation they're in and what is to be expected of them. Their class 
            has been chosen, at random, to participate in the 
            government-mandated &quot;Millennium Education Reform Program&quot;, created 
            in response to the massive unemployment and rampant boycotting of 
            schools that has occurred in the wake of the collapse of the 
            Japanese government. The students are on an isolated, deserted 
            island, and over the next three days, they will have to kill each 
            other off, until only one of them is left alive. If more than two 
            are alive, they will be killed anyway. The electronic collars 
            fastened on their necks will keep track of their every movement, 
            and, if they try to leave the island or step into one of the 
            constantly-shifting &quot;danger zones&quot;, they will explode. Whether the 
            students are unhappy with what is being done to them is of no 
            consequence: when a female student is caught whispering while Kitano 
            is speaking, he silences her with a knife planted in her forehead. 
            One down, forty to go. Each of the students is then given a kit bag 
            containing such essentials as a map, compass, and a weapon (a 
            &quot;lucky&quot; weapon, chosen completely at random), and sent outdoors. 
            Kitano ends up with the bag of cookies.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The schoolteacher Kitano is played 
            by the (possibly great) comedian-turned-action hero-turned-actor and 
            filmmaker Takeshi &quot;Beat&quot; Kitano, who has turned the act of getting 
            back up on his feet after taking a beating, literally or otherwise, 
            into an art. He is the pivot around which the action in <i>Battle 
            Royale</i> turns, observing the progress of the &quot;game&quot; as it 
            unfolds, issuing regular reports over a loudspeaker system on the 
            number of students that have been eliminated, and, when necessary, 
            urging them to do better. (The film is not without its share of 
            mordant humor.) <i>Battle Royale</i> has been compared to <i>Lord of 
            the Flies</i>, which showed what would happen if a group of young 
            boys were left to their own devices without the presence of adults, 
            but it's actually closer to Peter Watkins' 1971 film, <i>Punishment 
            Park</i>, in which counterculture youths were dumped in a closed-off 
            area of the southwestern U.S. and forced to defend themselves 
            against their will.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In <i>Battle Royale</i> we see the 
            students, after overcoming their initial shock and dismay, trying to 
            participate in &quot;the game&quot; as best they can (with varying results); 
            opting out of it altogether (sometimes to a desperate degree); 
            fighting back only in order to protect themselves; or taking to 
            playing &quot;the game&quot; all too readily, both proving themselves to their 
            classmates while seeking to win in the same intensely competitive 
            way as if they were taking an important examination or applying to a 
            university (which has caused some to see the film as a commentary on 
            Japan's demanding academic system). But there are also acts of 
            nobility and courage. Friends try to stick together, form new 
            alliances, and retain some bits of humanity against a situation that 
            is trying all too vigorously to remove it from them.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The director of <i>Battle Royale</i> 
            is Kinji Fukasaku, who is not one of the new <b><i>furyo</i></b> 
            school of young Japanese filmmakers but has been working in films 
            for forty years, making everything from a series of yakuza films set 
            in postwar Japan, to the psychedelic crime drama <i>Black Lizard</i> 
            and the wonderfully campy (in the very best sense) science-fiction 
            thriller <i>The Green Slime</i> (Fukasaku also took over directing 
            the sequences depicting the Japanese military in the lumbering <i>
            Tora! Tora! Tora!</i>, after 20th Century-Fox fired the initial 
            director, Akira Kurosawa.) Fukasaku was no older that the youths in
            <i>Battle Royale</i> when, in real life, he was assigned to work in 
            an armaments factory that was continually bombed during the Second 
            World War, and I suspect he was mostly&nbsp; responsible for keeping the 
            focus of <i>Battle Royale</i> on recognizably&nbsp; human aspects, thus 
            enabling us to become more emotionally involved with the picture 
            than we ever would have expected. And if you're looking for gruesome 
            kicks, forget it: the outbursts of violence in the film are made 
            terrifying right from the start, without throwing us completely out 
            of the film, while further underscoring the palpable sense of&nbsp; 
            disruption of normality. The violent acts carry&nbsp; full weight and 
            consequence. But one of the most haunting aspects of the film (and 
            one that probably hooked many audience members when the film became 
            a success in Japan) is an almost paean-like strain of melancholy and 
            loss that weaves through the action and carries well on into the 
            closing credits. That the filmmakers chose to go with a determinedly 
            optimistic ending which doesn't quite seem to work---an exhortation 
            to do better, to do right, and to be strong to your beliefs---is 
            nonetheless understandable.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Battle Royale</i> became a huge 
            success when it premiered on its home ground in December, 1999 
            (where it also generated a huge amount of controversy), and has 
            since gone on to open in the U.K. (where it was, predictably, 
            condemned by conservative film critics); it will open in October in 
            France. Except for a few North American festival showings, it has 
            yet to acquire distribution in the U.S., which is unfortunate, 
            because <i>Battle Royale</i> is one of the most fervently 
            anti-violence films to come along in years. Recent events have 
            probably made seeing the film in theaters in the U.S. even more 
            unlikely, although it would very well serve the purposes of the 
            so-called &quot;new civility&quot; that has come into being. The &quot;game&quot; in <i>
            Battle Royale</i> could be any situation where young people are 
            called upon to test their mettle and prove their worth, and the film 
            asks its audience to consider what their own responses to forced 
            aggression and violence would be, and what triggers such violence, 
            whether it be ideological, political, or something as objectively 
            simple but emotionally tangible as being casually hurt by a 
            thoughtless act committed by some schoolmates.</font></td>
