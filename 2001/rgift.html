            maven Sam Raimi's directorial flair and Christopher Young's
            fiddle-flecked score aren't enough to prop up this supernatural
            Confederate corpse that comes up short in script and satisfaction.
            It's a stale Southern-fried Agatha Christie/Perry Mason-Dixon
            cross-breed -- the kind where just about everyone masquerades with a
            guilty face. In this case, it's the writers, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Slingblade'</i>s
            Billy Bob Thornton and his erstwhile partner Tom Epperson, who paint
            their gothic mystery drama with broad stereotypes and a horrifyingly
            predictable ending. I see dead box office.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Raimi
            struck out with his last effort, the baseball-themed <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">For the Love of the Game</i> featuring Kevin Costner, although he won
            over non-traditional fans with 1998's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">A
            Simple Plan</i>, a wintry mood piece with small town, slow-witted
            similarities to his current fare. I'm one of the small group that
            liked his western <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Quick
            and the Dead</i> (especially that one incredible shot when sunlight
            beams through a bullet hole in Gene Hackman's body), which broke him
            away from his <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Darkman/Army of
            Darkness/Evil Dead</i> cult schlock genre works. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Gift</i> is technically taut but thematically narrow-minded, its
            cast stuck in one-dimensional characters culled from a dime-novel.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At
            least the talented Ms. Cate Blanchett commands your attention as the
            clear-eyed, sweetly simple psychic in the bayou backwater town of
            Brixton (i.e., Savannah, Georgia). She's aglow with the same regal
            radiance that crowned <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Elizabeth</i>.
            More recently you probably didn't recognize her as she dropped her
            native Australian accent for New York nasal in the guise of the Long
            Island wife of John Cusack in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Pushing
            Tin</i>. The subtleties of the South and three fatherless boys offer
            her this latest challenge, and even if the film fails to inspire,
            Blanchett provides suitable eye candy over its darkened landscape.
            As single mom Annie Wilson, she's not in the mood for trouble, but
            that's just what she's dealing, in the form of cards affixed with
            six-pointed stars, squares, circles, and three wavy lines. The young
            widow's innocent inability to present the proper poker face makes
            for a parade of nasty encounters among the local bottom-dwellers.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Such
            numb-skulled, paper-thin denizens include Donnie and Valerie
            Barksdale (Keanu Reeves and Hilary Swank). Reeves' wife-beating and
            wife-cheating redneck bully treads on the rotten ground he
            previously explored in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Watcher</i>, while Swank, in the first appearance on the big screen
            since her Academy Award winning role in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Boys
            Don't Cry</i>, suffers his abuses as the white-trash spouse, a
            pseudo-deceitful bitch whose skin-tight pants and high heels beg for
            his misguided attention. Down the road apiece, on the other side of
            the tracks, is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Dawson Creek</i>'s Katie Holmes as trampish socialite Jessica King.
            Daddy's a big wig at the country club, unaware that his sweet young
            daughter's busy screwing around with most of the town's menfolk,
            despite an impending marriage to school principal Wayne Collins
            (Greg Kinnear), a mild-mannered heartthrob. As for the friendly
            neighborhood auto mechanic, Giovanni Ribisi is Hollywood's surefire
            answer to casting calls for the mentally disoriented and borderline
            psychotic. His sunken-eyed Buddy Cole fits the bill for did he or
            didn't he when one of the locals getting plucked and plundered. Then
            there is David Duncan (Gary Cole), the district attorney who charges
            into a media-grabbing murder case with his own secret. And Sheriff
            Pearl Johnson (J.K. Simmons) comes off as the local law authority
            more concerned with missing pastries than bodies. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            it's debilitating when the audience has to suffer through trite
            dialogue, enduring such satanic banter as &quot;Messing with the
            devil's gonna get you burned&quot; or the omniscient &quot;Look's
            like there's a storm a'comin'.&quot; When the screenplay's too busy
            pointing fingers or guns -- the few spectators watching with me
            erupting in unintended laughter when Donnie and Buddy square off in
            a roadside tussle -- Raimi stirs up the cinematic gumbo with aural
            and visual effects, exhorting clouds to swirl by in darkened frenzy,
            lightning to pierce the damp night, and frogs and crickets to scream
            out in unified delirium.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            for the painful visions that haunt Annie as she tries to piece
            together this cryptic whodunit jigsaw puzzle, it seems that their
            selective nature enables the filmmakers to stretch out the story to
            two long hours. As the town's sounding board, she gets to play
            unlicensed psychiatrist to all who ask her otherworldly advice. And
            since you've read this far, I'll play counselor, too. The cheap
            thrills that wrap <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Gift</i>
            are best left unopened. There are no substantial presents under this
            post-holiday tree.<o:p>
