            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Early
            in <i>Dr. Dolittle 2</i>, the good doctor (Eddie Murphy) appears on
            tv. Apparently, after the first movie, where he was outed as a freak
            who can talk to animals, he's now capitalizing on his newfound
            celebrity by guesting on the Crocodile Hunter's show. In this brief
            scene, John Dolittle is leaning in toward the ground-level camera
            along side the ever-self-impressed Steve Irwin, the latter
            whispering in his usual stage-whispering way about an alligator he's
            about to &quot;surprise.&quot; John, meanwhile, overhears the
            alligator himself mumbling to himself about how he's not even a
            little bit surprised and that he's gonna take out that pipsqueaky
            hunter fella. Dutifully alarmed, John tries to warn Steve, but alas,
            the great khaki-shorts-wearing hunter will have none of it, and so,
            when he turns... chomp! <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            is a jolly good laugh, because Steve Irwin is so relentlessly and
            self-consciously annoying, but also because John -- or more
            precisely, Eddie Murphy -- is in on the joke, rolling his eyes and
            looking mock-horrified, much like you might if you were in his
            shoes. And this is the small genius of the moment, that it allows
            you to feel in league with Eddie Murphy, who seems wholly aware of
            the silliness of what he's doing, not only as an on-camera partner
            to the notorious Irwin, but also as the franchise creation Dr.
            Dolittle. Once upon a time, the very idea that Eddie Murphy would
            make a living by talking to digital-lipped animals would have seemed
            strange indeed. How times change. Nowadays, he's the go-to guy for
            kids' movies. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            <i>Dr. Dolittle 2</i>, Murphy is again the poor sap at whom animals
            are blabbing all their beefs. That is, he's the straight man, not
            exactly the best use of his talents. The primary gag in the second
            film, as in the first (which made some ungodly amount of money,
            i.e., $290.2 million) is that though John's very good at managing
            the affairs of assorted critters, he can't quite keep his own
            household in order. Here again, his longsuffering wife Lisa (Kristen
            Wilson) and daughters Maya (Kyla Pratt) and Charisse (Raven-Symone),
            are feeling neglected because dad's so preoccupied with looking
            after the animals' physical and psychological ailments. Inevitably,
            they find themselves losing patience and putting up with his
            shenanigans at the same time, and then forgiving him for being an
            inept father and husband, because he has such good intentions. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">John
            has his own lesson to learn, of course. Again, as in the first film,
            he comes to appreciate family -- the idea and the particulars in his
            own case -- after getting his own way and servicing the animals in
            such dire need of his assistance (in case you've forgotten, this is
            the same lesson they all learned in the first movie). The minor
            difference here is that where the first film focused on John's
            efforts to make things right with younger daughter Maya, here he's
            dealing with the supposedly more complex issues pertaining to
            adolescent daughter Charisse. She's rebelling in her own way
            (wearing her walkman in the house seems to be the most aggressive
            thing she does) and one aspect of this involves her interest in a
            too-cute-to-be-true pizza delivery boyfriend named Eric (Lil' Zane,
            the requisite rapper-on-the-cast-list). But if the
            family-coming-together idea isn't quite original, the route to
            enlightenment is just a little awkward, and that's what makes the
            film worth thinking about at all.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            plot gets rolling when the doc is approached by a godfatherish
            beaver (1973's <i>The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing</i> director Richard
            C. Sarafian) and his raccoon goombah (Michael Rapaport), to protect
            the furry forest inhabitants from indiscriminate loggers (trucks
            driven by anonymous, big-armed lugheads), led by a couple of
            money-grubbing corporate types (Jeffrey Jones and Kevin Pollak).
            Though he's promised his family a trip to Europe, John just can't
            refuse the animal mafia, and so he hauls everyone (including the
            helpfully narrating dog Lucky, voiced again by Norm Macdonald) out
            to the woods. Here John attempts to hook up a circus bear named
            Archie (played by a real bear named Tank and animatronic doubles,
            and voiced by Steve Zahn) with a wild bear named Ava (Lisa Kudrow).
            The reasoning is that a pair of procreating bears makes a case for
            &quot;endangered&quot; species, as opposed to the single Ava, who is
            merely &quot;extinction&quot; waiting to happen. (As you might
            anticipate, this anxiety about extinction leads to yet another
            supposed-to-be-funny movie rendition of &quot;I Will Survive,&quot;
            but it's mercifully brief.)<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            woods being the semi-magical place where everyone might be
            transformed, John and Archie soon find themselves in dreamy montages
            where they're teaching one another to be more assertive, observant,
            and sexual -- in a word, more masculine. This involves catching
            fish, tangling with honey bees, and building up endurance by jogging
            down tree-lined paths, not to mention farting and commenting on
            farting. Male mammal-bonding: it sure is idyllic, but it's not so
            conducive to narrative coherence. Indeed, as spread around by writer
            Larry Levin and director Steve Carr, none of the film's events have
            much to do with each other. But who cares? In the end, John gets
            wisdom, the bad guys get theirs, and the animals get to go home. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still,
            this happy ending doesn't make me feel any better about Eddie
            Murphy. I know he's well-paid, and that he has kids of his own who
            may actually enjoy watching dad stuck in a bathroom with a huge
            digitally-effected bear passing gas on a toilet, but there's
            something a little dismal about it too. He and Zahn's voice make a
            decent comic partnership, but decency was never what Murphy did
            best. Here he's reduced to a bizarre flatness, and it's not just
            because most of his performance has been cobbled together with
            nonexistent acting partners in post-production. It's also because of
            the dumbfounding effects of formula. There's not a surprise or
            insight within miles of this picture. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">All
            this comes back -- in a roundabout way -- to Eddie Murphy as a
            cultural force. Not so long ago, his <i>SNL</i> barbs were taking
            public aim at racism and other social injustices; that these are now
            traded off for warm and cuddly aphorisms about how to be a good
            daddy (or even a good advisor to lovelorn bears) surely has to do
            with the artist's changed personal stakes, but sadly, don't reflect
            an evolved cultural climate. This is not to overlook the homophobia
            or misogyny that was also part of his earlier work, but to note the
            costs of his mainstreaming -- not to mention that of someone like
            Chris Rock, whose <i>Pootie Tang</i> is opening the week after <i>Dolittle</i>,
            to all-but-certain disaster, or Dave Chapelle, who's making really
            dumb commercials. You have to wonder what makes this kind of
            mainstreaming a goal for anyone. <o:p>
