            screen success has always been just around the corner for Jeff and
            fellow guerrilla filmmaker John Heyn (by day, a producer of training
            videos for the Department of Veterans Affairs). Their no-budget
            underground film and video antics have been below Hollywood's radar
            screens for years, but with the above ground resurrection of their
            epic 16-minute seminal documentary <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Heavy Metal Parking Lot</i>, encased in a multi-title, hour-and-a-half
            package (graced with some dynamite <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">2001
            </i>animation titles by Brad Dismukes), perhaps fortune and fame
            will follow. Actually they are both getting a well deserved fifteen
            minutes in the July issue of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">GQ</i>,
            so perhaps some studio exec has an eye on the middle-aged pair by
            now, depending on where's he's sitting on the throne.<o:p>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For
            the uninitiated, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Heavy Metal
            Parking Lot</i> was an unrehearsed, ungizmoed adventure on the
            periphery of the Capital Centre, an arena built by local sports
            legend Abe Pollin as a haven for sporting events and music concerts.
            As dusk settles one late May 1986 afternoon prior to a Judas Priest
            concert, they tool the parking lot circling the building, their
            camera shooting from the open window of a 1978 Bonneville. It tracks
            past legions of drunken, drugged-out, head-banging fans, meandering
            in search of kindred and alcoholic spirits, or at least a cold beer.
            As an excursion into the land of candid camera, without the candid,
            the filmmakers capture a wild group of whacked out fans, generally
            under-educated and often bare-chested (the men, of course), with
            Prince George County's cops keeping a wary eye from their saddles
            nearby. One crazed dude after another, blasted on acid or related
            drug of choice, put on their party faces and giddily dumb down for
            the camera, much like the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Jaywalking</i>
            segment on the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tonight Show</i>.
            There are portions of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Go</i>
            (1999) that contain the same stereotypes in a similar setting, but
            without the brave, unpolished aura that Jeff and John have captured.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Imitation
            being the sincerest form of flattery, the program also includes
            numerous sequels (authorized and otherwise) and absurdist spawn that
            honor the public citizen anxious to speak to the camera. From their
            own corral, Krulik and Heyn offer <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Neil
            Diamond Parking Lot</i> (1996), the official sequel with an
            obviously different cast. Covering the same concrete skirting the
            re-christened USAir Arena, the filmmakers take on a decided older
            Diet Coke crowd, a geriatric brood of card carrying (AARP) genteel
            folk, grannies, and gramps. The brash trailer trash youth, the bad
            teeth, and the late '70s Camaros are replaced with sedate,
            well-groomed Republican sentimentalities, bulging midriffs, and
            rented limos. Yet it is just as amusing as its predecessor in
            capturing the outrageously normal lifestyles of America's
            not-so-rich and never-famous. John Heyn co-produced (with Seth
            Morris), the short &quot;unfinished and unreleased&quot; <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Monster
            Truck Parking Lot</i>, showcasing another divergent crowd. There's
            also the long-rumored outtakes <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Heavy
            Metal Parking Lot: The Lost Footage</i>, a collection of video clips
            painstakingly recovered from John Heyn's waterlogged basement. The
            most recent addition is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Harry
            Potter Parking Lot</i> (2000) wherein Krulik follows the mania
            surrounding the release of one of the acclaimed JK Rowling books at
            a suburban book store.<o:p>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            rest of the feature is made up of several television stories about
            the filmmakers and a handful of tributes inspired by <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">HMPL</i>
            (but never as wonderful). Robbie Socks' <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Heavy
            Metal Sidewalk</i> is a narrow glance of aging rockers peppering the
            front of the Warfield in San Francisco, as they enter for a February
            28, 1998 Judas Priest show. There is less stupidity, less beer, less
            drugs, less originality. From late 1998 there is Clare Carey's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Girl
            Power Parking Lot</i>, which actually is filming in the streets
            outside Mann's Chinese at the premiere of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Spice
            World</i>, with hundreds of semi-extremist Spice Girls fans
            screaming behind barricades as the bosomy quintet of their
            affections arrives for a personal appearance. For all the glitter
            and glamour surrounding the event, there's a sadly poignant moment
            when an unfortunate soul, suffering from a dreadful case of acne and
            with heavy metal braces that would set off alarms at any airport,
            offers the filmmaker a glimpse at a personal scrapbook honoring the
            music phenomenon. There's the grainy, sweaty homage <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Raver
            Bathroom</i> by Toronto indie filmmakers Doug DiPasquale and Prem
            Sooriyakumar. Never being a rave fan (well, I wasn't into heavy
            metal either, now that I think about it), I couldn't say I was
            enthralled by this urinal <b><i>verité</i></b> confessional where
            the dialogue is barely audible (there are a inconsistent spattering
            of subtitles) and a nearly unanimous use of drugs. I'm too old to
            understand why half the crowd was sucking on baby pacifiers.
            Finally, there's a short music video (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Flavor
            of the Week</i>) for the band American Hi-Fi is another rip-off
            produced by A Band Apart, Quentin Tarantino's production company.
            Perhaps Jeff and John should check with their lawyers about getting
            a nice royalty check for the last item. Hey boys, exploit this for
            everything you can!<o:p>

            Cinema/Bistro/Lounge, that haven of independent thinking in a
            metropolitan area overrun with mega-multiplexes, is graciously
            allowing the local lads its first commercial week-long exposure of
            this compilation effort, a great treat for Washingtonians—dulled
            to death on <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Fast and the
            Furious</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tomb Raider</i>,
            and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Swordfish</i>—following
            a presentation at the Experience Music Project in Seattle last
            February and a few festival dates. The original short, long a
            bootleg and Nirvana favorite, premiered at DC Space back in 1986,
            with occasional unreelings around town (particularly at The American
            Film Institute theater at the Kennedy Center). Although the
            filmmakers said the tape was withdrawn back in 1990, it has had an
            amazing shelf life, with Jeff and John ultimately realizing that
            their ode to heavy metal maniacs should be viewed by a wider
            audience. The film's website (<a href="http://www.heavymetalparkinglot.net/" target="_top">www.heavymetalparkinglot.net</a>)
            lists the upcoming dates (including L.A. at the end of July), so
            surf over and check out the schedule.<o:p>

            a Q+A sessions following the inaugural D.C. screening, the audience
            was curious what lay ahead for the now digital videomakers. Boy Band
            Parking Lot was screaming from a back row seat. &quot;We'll do
            it…if someone wants to pay us,&quot; Jeff honestly replied. The
            ninety-minute program gelled when the directors of the rave and
            Spice Girls videos sent Jeff and John their tapes. They had no idea
            how <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">HMPL</i> has inspired so
            many, or bastardized a few. One fan paralleled the American Hi-Fi
            &quot;remake&quot; to Gus Van Sant's unsuccessful attempt to redo

            website). There's probably going to be a reunion, too. They've
            identified at least ten subjects from the 1986 film, including Zebra
            Boy. One survivor is Jay Hughen, a music executive with Atomic Pop.<o:p>
