            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 13 April 2001</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In <i>Joe Dirt</i>, David Spade
            plays the titular character, a scrappy little guy who's never had
            much in life but who makes the best of what he has. Joe has an
            unusual hairstyle that looks like it was done that way on-purpose
            but is actually the result of a childhood mishap. Things did not go
            well for Joe after that: abandoned by his family, he goes through
            the route of foster homes and juvenile facilities before hitting the
            road, as an adult, to find out what happened to his family -- his
            real last name isn't &quot;Dirt&quot;, but something else entirely
            -- and who they really are.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Joe's quest leads him to encounters
            with a number of people, including Brandy (Brittany Daniel), the
            personification of the lyric from the Looking Glass song,
            &quot;Brandy, you're a fine girl....&quot; They become true friends,
            but when later asked if they became anything more than that, Joe
            almost jumps out of his skin. &quot;No!&quot; he exclaims.
            &quot;She's beautiful!&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Joe likes cars, and he's very
            particular about what kind of music he listens to: AC/DC, Lynard
            Skynard, Def Leppard, and &quot;Van Halen, not 'Van Hagar'&quot;.
            The movie may use this as proof that Joe is nothing more than a hick
            and a nincompoop, but that's not the way David Spade plays him.
            However he may appear on the outside, Joe is essentially
            good-spirited and well-meaning, and when somebody really lays into
            him, his chin drops and he seems at a loss for a comeback, and well
            knows it. In these instances, Spade gives Joe genuine emotion, while
            also depicting him with a resiliency and upbeat tenacity that is not
            only admirable but even ends up lending Joe a certain amount of
            dignity and respect.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Joe needs that, because the movie
            itself is content to keep throwing gravel in his face and then
            standing back to laugh -- at one point, the movie, literally, craps
            on Joe's head. The story is framed by his landing in the
            broadcasting booth of a snide Los Angeles radio personality, played
            by Dennis Miller, who gets Joe to talking because he thinks he's a
            joke. Miller's stubbly face elasticizes into a broad smile as he
            leans close to say, &quot;You are exquisitely pathetic!&quot;, and
            then pauses to savor the effect. All of L.A. is shown stopping to
            listen to Joe's story, first to scoff and sneer, then to turn all
            sympathetic and to weep. The movie wants us to react in the same
            manipulative way, too, to chortle mockingly as Joe is put into one
            situation after another where he is made to look foolish and
            ridiculous, then to feel genuine caring towards Joe's quixotic
            attempt to find his family, depending on whichever way the movie
            cares to go at the time. Joe does eventually find a family -- two,
            in fact -- but even this happy resolution does not escape from
            having a certain acid tinge to it that's disagreeable. (The fact
            that Joe needs, or ought to, be taken seriously as a person may have
            been the point all along -- Spade co-wrote the screenplay, and it's
            a quality that comes through in his performance without his having
            to hard-sell it -- but, somewhere along the way, the wires got
            crossed.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Spade satirizes (without drubbing)
            Joe in a sequence that parodies Zalman King's <i>Two Moon Junction</i>
            (with Joe as the carnival roustabout), and the film also includes
            parodies the Jame Gumb sequences in <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i>
            (with Brian Thompson, the alien bounty hunter from <i>The X Files</i>!)
            and the movie version of <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>. There are also
            some oddball cameos, some uncredited and some endearing, by Joe Don
            Baker (his character loses a limb, but hobbles back to blame it all
            on Joe), Kevin Nealon (as a junkyard mechanic who seems to have been
            around so much oil, grease and gasoline for so long, his teeth have
            become discolored from the inside out), Rosanna Arquette (as the
            proprietor of a gator farm), Catherine O'Hara (fleetingly, as a T.V.
            journalist), and, wonderfully, Christopher Walken, who tutors Joe in
            the finer aspects of being a school janitor, and tap dances (with
            that great flare for dancing that Walken shows all too infrequently)
            while sweeping the halls and having a conversation with a fire
            extinguisher.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Joe Dirt</i> -- which was
            originally called <i>The Adventures of Joe Dirt</i> but, for
            whatever reason, was retitled, with a re-dub on the soundtrack that
            refers to the protagonist's story as <i>The Legend of Dirty Joey</i>
            -- will be dismissed by most (and not without cause) as being merely
            mean-spirited and crude. My reaction was that I hope David Spade
            isn't going to fritter away his talents on lousy films which don't
            deserve them, the way John Candy did: for every <i>Splash </i>or <i>Uncle
            Buck</i> or <i>J.F.K</i>., there were two or three real stinkers in
            between. Candy chose his career trajectory; David Spade still has
            the chance to decide which way his will go.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><u></o:p>
