            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>O Brother is a dazzling and
            brilliant mélange of historical reinterpretation, biting satire and
            a marvelous sense of adventure. 2001: A Southern <i>Odyssey</i>?</b></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That's not the subtitle of Joel and
            Ethan Coen's latest film, but it might as well be. <i>O Brother,
            Where Art Thou?</i> is arguably the most peculiar film that's yet
            come from a duo renowned for making peculiar films, and that's not
            intended as a criticism. The Coen Brothers, the creators of such
            eccentric cinematic delights as <i>Fargo</i> and <i>Raising Arizona</i>,
            have made quirky off-beat characters their personal trademark, and
            their latest offering continues their formula of placing bizarrely
            likeable people in hysterical (and often hopeless) circumstances.
            This time around the brothers find inspiration in one of
            literature's greatest works, and their daring reinterpretation of a
            classic story has resulted in a fiercely entertaining -- and often
            visionary -- comedy.</font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ostensibly a retelling of Homer's <i>The
            Odyssey</i>, <i>O Brother</i> draws much of its inspiration from the
            poem's premise, rather than the narrative itself. Set during the
            Great Depression, the film chronicles the adventures of three
            Southern fugitives and their search for a cache of buried treasure
            stashed away by their leader, Ulysses (a magnificent George Clooney),
            shortly before his incarceration. Along the way, the trio will
            vanquish a fearsome cyclops (in the form of John Goodman, who turns
            in an entertaining performance as a one-eyed lawman), succumb to the
            charm of three beautiful sirens (three Southern belles, who croon
            while washing their laundry in the river), and attempt to stop
            Ulysses's wife, Penelope (Holly Hunter), from marrying another man.
            It's a staggeringly fresh twist on one of the world's oldest
            stories, and the resulting film has a great deal to recommend it. By
            taking a much-beloved literary classic and imbuing it with their own
            unique style, the Coens have created a spirited, lively
            adventure/comedy that will delight audiences, regardless of their
            knowledge of Homer's poem.</font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like the best travel stories, <i>O
            Brother</i>'s structure is episodic in nature, meaning that the film
            is comprised of a chain of cinematic short stories, each complete in
            itself. Each incident flows smoothly into the next, with the
            proceedings getting steadily more bizarre with each passing moment.
            During one amusing subplot, for instance, the trio passes itself off
            as a band of traveling musicians. When pressed to perform live at a
            local radio station, the non-musicians reluctantly agree... and
            their tune immediately becomes a monster hit. This type of satire is
            very common of <i>O Brother</i>, and reveals the lengths that the
            Coens, who collaborated on the screenplay, will go to in order to
            get a reaction from their audience.</font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Much has been written of George
            Clooney's performance here, and justly so; it's hard to believe that
            this is the same man who left TV's <i>ER</i> because he no longer
            found it &quot;dignified enough.&quot; As Ulysses Everett McGill,
            Clooney loses himself in a Southern persona outrageous enough to
            suit the story's equally outrageous sense of the South--you <i>Simpsons</i>
            fans might prefer to think of Clooney's Ulysses as a real-life
            version of Cletus the Slack-Jawed Yokel--but the caricature contains
            no malice. Although Ulysses's Southern roots are wildly exaggerated
            (I'm from the South, y'all, and we don't really talk like that), the
            performance is quite appropriate to the movie. It's all in good fun,
            and sensitive Southern viewers will do well to place their tongues
            firmly in cheek before entering the theater.</font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>O Brother, Where Art Thou?</i>,
            is, if not the funniest film to emerge in the past twelve months,
            certainly one of the most inventive. A dazzling and hysterical
            reinterpretation of one of the world's most famous tales, the movie
            succeeds on multiple levels, losing itself in biting satire and,
            perhaps most impressively, its own marvelous sense of adventure.
            It's a significant film for the Coens, re-establishing them as two
            of America's most insightful observers of human nature, and once
            again proving their complete mastery of filmmaking to the world at
            large; indeed, only the Coen Brothers could &quot;update&quot; <i>The
            Odyssey</i> by setting it eighty years in America's past.</font>
