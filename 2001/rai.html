            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 13 July
            2001</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In <i>A.I.</i>, Haley Joel
            Osment plays David, who first appears with a trusting, open,
            somewhat unnerving quality about him. He doesn't seem menacing, but
            as if something about him was not completely formed yet, and it's
            this uncertainty that throws the two people into whose home David
            enters.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">David is an advanced robot, a
            prototype, bestowed upon a youngish couple, the Swintons, Monica
            (Frances O'Connor) and Henry (Sam Robards), whose own son lies in a
            state of unconsciousness. David has the ability to become familially
            bonded with the Swintons once a particular sequence of words is
            spoken to him. (&quot;Don't imprint until you're entirely
            sure,&quot; Henry warns Monica, who, as the wife and mother of the
            family, is left with this responsibility.) Gradually, David begins
            to lose more and more of the sculpted, artificial quality about him,
            and takes on more the look of something living. The film gradually
            gets us to start thinking about whether any animate creature --
            biological or manufactured -- has the right to exist.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Then, the Swintons' own son, Martin
            (Jake Thomas), awakens and is brought home, and as he regains his
            health he begins to pull the type of malicious (but normal) mischief
            that is meant to land David in trouble. Martin is busily trying to
            make David's place in the home untenable, and David cannot fathom
            why. It is as if the cuckoo who displaces a chick from the nest were
            itself trying to be pushed out, to land on the ground far, far
            below, by one of the chicks already there.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Steven Spielberg directed and wrote
            the screenplay for <i>A.I.</i> from a screen treatment Ian Watson
            wrote, for the late director Stanley Kubrick, based on the short
            story <i>Super-Toys Last All Summer Long</i> by the science-fiction
            author Brian Aldiss. It is the kind of movie that I don't want to
            talk too much about, because most of the enjoyment I had from it
            came from seeing what was going to happen next. I can say that David
            goes on an odyssey much similar to and inspired by the story of
            Pinocchio, which had been told to him earlier by Monica, and that he
            meets up with a fox-like character (Brendan Gleeson, in a
            wide-brimmed hat, and who rides lord-fully over the nighttime
            landscape in a device shaped like the moon); that he is accompanied
            by two companions, one an automated teddy bear (à la one of Aldiss'
            &quot;Super-Toys&quot;) that has a right, properly burly-bear
            quality to him, the other a robot escort, Gigolo Joe (Jude Law,
            whose spiky, metallic looks finally serve him best, here), who
            sticks with David because of his own directive to be of assistance
            to anyone in need; and that there is a search for a maternal,
            angelic Blue Fairy, who seems to be always further on and whom David
            seeks to make a singular, empirical request of.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There will be much talk,
            nitpicking, and general hot-air-blowing over what in <i>A.I.</i> has
            borrowed from where and from whom and to what purpose, so on and so
            forth. Big deal. One thing that cannot be disputed is the
            performance given in the film by Haley Joel Osment, who retains a
            certain amount of David's preternatural quality, which, it turns
            out, is not simply a product of his character being an oddity of
            science. That quality turns out to be the growing manifestation of
            one of the most intense depictions of a yearning to belong and to
            receive a pure emotional fulfillment that has been seen in any film
            in recent memory. This is not an easy role for a young actor, and
            the kid is not repeating himself, here. The picture itself also
            makes a fantastic, audacious, ambitious jump in its final act -- one
            that makes David's persistence all the more heartrending (and Haley
            Joel Osment's performance all the more heartrending) -- but there is
            a gentle, calming resolution, beautifully rendered, and the
            realization that the film has become more than a story about simple
            wish-fulfillment and asking for the impossible. David's refusal to
            give up becomes less about wishing, and more about faith, which is
            quite another, more dramatically meaningful and moving thing
            altogether.</font>
