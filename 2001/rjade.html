Still, if you can find a way to settle into the film, it turns out to be mostly agreeable.">

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In his new picture, <i>The Curse
            of the Jade Scorpion</i>, Allen plays C.W. Briggs, an investigator
            for an insurance company in New York City in 1940, and in the
            opening scenes he's seen striding, or rather stomping, down the hall
            of the company offices to confront the newly-hired efficiency
            expert, who is commonly addressed as Fitzgerald (Helen Hunt), to
            tell her that he wants his files put back where they were
            &quot;RIGHT NOW.&quot; The way Allen's character says the word
            &quot;right,&quot; it comes out with a swoop of emphasis, as if this
            were the kind of guy who puts things down and expects them to be
            there, no matter where he set them, when he wanted to pick them up
            again, and he's not about to change his habits, now. For her part,
            Helen Hunt's tall, unflappable Fitzgerald looks imperiously down at
            Briggs and tells him, no, the office files are being consolidated to
            make things easier and less costly in the long run, and, after all,
            this is 1940, a new age, and if he doesn't like it, try not stepping
            off the curb in front of a bus and getting mangled beyond all
            recognition. Upon which, Allen's Briggs is reduced to blustering his
            way back out the door to her office, and you know that the two of
            them are going to end up together, somehow, by the time the end
            credits roll.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As you may have gathered, Allen's
            new film turns out to be an essentially sweet-spirited homage and
            evocation of the old-style comedy mystery, ones like the 1943 <i>A
            Night to Remember</i>, where Brian Aherne and Loretta Young traded
            affectionate wisecracks while poking around their Greenwich Village
            apartment house; and with a dash of the sexual sparring of films
            like <i>His Girl Friday</i>, where the barbs only went to further
            reveal how much the leading man and lady really and truly loved each
            other. Whenever they have a set-to, Briggs resorts to telling
            Fitzgerald that the only other person he possibly dislikes more than
            her is &quot;that little German chancellor with the mustache,&quot;
            while she invariably categorizes him as something like &quot;a slimy
            little inchworm&quot;; when he goes to sit on her couch, she jumps
            and tells him not to or else she'll have to have it
            &quot;fumigated.&quot; So, of course, it is these two who end up
            participating in a nightclub act -- performed, no less, on the floor
            of the Rainbow Room, in Rockefeller Center -- by a stage magician
            (David Ogden Stiers, who's perfect in the film): he puts them under
            a trance and has them make like they're madly in love with each
            other, but he's also setting them up for something far more
            nefarious. Upon the utterance of a key word, either of them can fall
            immediately into a trance, after which they follow his instructions
            on how and where to carry out a burglary, under the cover of night,
            and then wake up the next morning with no recollection of what
            they've done. &quot;The Jade Scorpion so commands!&quot; says the
            magician to his hapless lackeys, just like in the old radio mystery
            programs.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There's even a femme fatale: Laura
            Kensington, who looks like both of General Sternwood's daughters in <i>The
            Big Sleep</i> rolled into one. She's played by Charlize Theron, with
            a cascade of blond hair down one side of her face and a wiggle in
            her chassis, and Theron is wonderful, making her character into a
            voluptuously tempting Pandora's Box wrapped up in chenille and furs
            and tied with a bow (Theron previously played the fashion model in
            Allen's <i>Celebrity</i>, who took to the runway, both legs pumping,
            like a steam engine). She's only in a couple of scenes, albeit
            important ones, but she's gangbusters and pretty much steals most of
            the movie in the process.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Allen's C.W. Briggs is initially
            presented as being a swaggering braggart who's a womanizer (at one
            point, he explains that all women &quot;look the same
            upside-down&quot;) and flirts with all the pretty office girls (one
            of whom is played by Elizabeth Berkley, who looks great as a
            brunette, by the way). This is the type of character you would not
            expect to see Allen playing in a movie, and in fact is the sort that
            he used to ruthlessly parody in his earlier films. By chance, he
            learns that Fitzgerald is having an affair with the boss (Dan
            Aykroyd) of the insurance company, who keeps stringing her along
            with the promise that he'll be getting a divorce from his wife
            (shades of Billy Wilder's <i>The Apartment</i>). Briggs then tries
            to help Fitzgerald: shouldn't a smart, strong woman like her know
            better than to get mixed up with a guy like this? And that's when
            the comically nervous, scrambling little guy whom Allen usually
            plays starts coming through and takes control. For her part,
            however, Helen Hunt comes across as frankly intimidated, by the part
            and by playing opposite Woody Allen (In fact, she admitted as much
            in the press, recently). In many scenes, she seems sullen, spiky,
            and dispirited, but she gives it a good try, even though when she
            does work up some steam in her comic exchanges with Allen, her
            delivery sounds, surprisingly, like Diane Keaton in the films Keaton
            made with Allen, with the exception that Keaton knew how to hold her
            own onscreen while not letting it affect her comic timing or the
            freshness of her performance.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Allen may have written <i>Curse of
            the Jade Scorpion</i> after the manner of the crackling,
            fast-exchange movie comedies that were being made at the time this
            movie is set, but he directs it more like a reverie of <b><i>temps
            perdu</i></b>, so the movie has a disparity that affects everyone
            and everything in it, although, if you can find a way to settle into
            it, it turns out to be mostly agreeable, the dialogue is pretty
            good, and there is some impeccable casting, from Theron, Aykroyd and
            Stiers on to Brian Markinson, who does an outstanding job playing
            Briggs' pal and co-worker Al, and, as a street-corner con artist,
            the veteran Dadaist comedian Irwin Corey. Hunt does a little better,
            too, in the closing scenes, when her character stops trying to be
            Rosalind Russell or Jean Arthur and takes on a more romantic
            persona, which is what the movie really turns out to be. Aside from
            being a period piece -- filmed by cinematographer Zhao Fei in a
            golden glow, and with production design by Santo Loquasto that is a
            knockout -- <i>The Curse of the Jade Scorpion</i> is about how the
            &quot;real&quot; person exists under their outward, everyday
            persona. C.W. Briggs turns out to be really more respectful towards
            women than he lets on, while Fitzgerald turns out to be not nearly
            as acerbic as we think she is. But, the film adds quietly, near the
            end, you gotta make concessions. While it has neither the crippling
            ennui that afflicted <i>Celebrity</i>, nor the vaulting qualities
            that lift up and distinguish Allen's best films, <i>The Curse of the
            Jade Scorpion</i> is a film that can be enjoyed, as long as you can
            make some concessions to it, as well.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
