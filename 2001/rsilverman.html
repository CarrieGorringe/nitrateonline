            <p><i><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Saving Silverman</font></b></i><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
            starts out as a proudly vulgar, irreverent comedy about two friends
            trying to save a third from a disastrous marriage, but, by the time
            it reaches the end, it has become something else entirely --
            annoying, immensely boring, and, as if it were possible, more.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">J.D. (the brilliant comedian Jack
            Black) and Wayne (Steve Zahn, shaggy and scruffy but without the
            real dopiness that was beginning to turn him into the modern day
            equivalent of Gabby Hayes) see their friend Darren (Jason Biggs)
            being completely and totally subjugated by his fiance Judith (Amanda
            Peet). She changes his style, his clothes, his taste, his friends --
            and Darren seems to be enjoying obeying her every whim. J.D. and
            Wayne then decide, before he gets married to this attractive gorgon,
            to abduct her, hold her captive (à la John Fowles' <i>The Collector</i>)
            in the basement of their house, and then tell Darren that Judith has
            gone on to a better world before steering him towards going out with
            Sandy (Amanda Detmer), who reveals herself to be the perfect match
            for Darren when, out of the blue, she starts crooning some of the
            lyrics to a song by Darren's (and J.D. and Wayne's) all-time
            favorite recording artist, Neil Diamond.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In retrospect, the picture should
            have been a lot more appealing than it is. But the filmmakers --
            including director Dennis Dugan, whose previous comedy, <i>Big Daddy</i>,
            was about the joys of urinating in public -- cop-out and try and
            create humor by dumping on everyone and everything. Nothing is
            off-limits -- there are jokes about kids spitting up milk in the
            school cafeteria, raccoons, old people with no trousers on, people
            who look funny, amateur magicians, and that's just in the first
            five-to-ten minutes alone. But the filmmakers also hold up the
            characters whom we are supposed to be sympathizing with in order to
            humiliate them and score an easy laugh. People are sent crashing
            down staircases, falling out of windows, and flung with such<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>force against various forms of pavement that it makes one
            wince, and we're supposed to be laughing our heads off over all
            this. It's not humor, it's insensitivity (and bad filmmaking, since
            you need a Geiger counter to find out where the plot is), and by the
            time the characters start being repeatedly tortured by electric
            shock devices, you may simply decide (as I did) that you've had
            enough. Since the filmmakers don't care about the characters, why
            should we?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Amanda Peet is stuck playing a
            character that has absolutely no saving graces: she's strictly
            defined as being cruel, conniving, deceitful, distrustful -- a
            misogynist's dream. Yet she is also presented in a series of outfits
            that are designed to not only inform us that she is not wearing an
            undergarment, but which give us a chance to look at more than just a
            share of cleavage. This style of peek-a-boo filmmaking is, in a
            word, sleazy, and when the filmmakers start pulling it on Amanda
            Detmer's character, one wonders if the filmmakers are revealing a
            little more about how their own fears and regard towards women than
            they had intended.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Except for a quick joke at the
            beginning of the film, there doesn't seem to be any real reason why
            the three protagonists, J.D., Wayne and Darren (who also put on
            black wigs and sequined shirts to play in a makeshift band, <i>Diamonds
            in the Rough</i>, during their off hours) should idolize Neil
            Diamond -- for all it matters, they might as well be worshiping
            Lionel Ritchie or Matt Monro -- unless it's ironic, since the film
            makes clear that none of the guys have any sort of romantic or sex
            life, and Diamond's recordings, of course, have been prime make-out
            music for years. It does give an excuse for Diamond himself -- with
            less hair, now, but otherwise none the worse for wear -- to stick
            his head into the film, once at the beginning and once at the end,
            looking<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>like someone
            who has just realized he has been given directions that have led him
            to the wrong street address.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
            has.</font>
