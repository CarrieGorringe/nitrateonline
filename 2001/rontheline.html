            review by <a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 26 October
            2001</i></font><p><font face="Verdana" size="5">Digits </font></p>
            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kevin Gibbons (NSync-er and 
            executive producer Lance Bass) can't catch a break. When <i>On the 
            Line</i> begins, he's the lead singer in his high school band, on 
            stage in 1994. As he's explaining, in voiceover, the extent of their 
            commitment -- &quot;We were all about the rock!&quot; -- Kev's hoping that 
            tonight will be the night that he makes his move, makes clear his 
            affection for the cutest girl in his class. But as she smiles at him 
            from the floor, Kev loses his nerve: he can't sing, he can't move. 
            The tension builds; the camera cuts from the girl beaming to Kev 
            sweating to his bandmates looking on in horror. Suddenly, we're 
            inside his nightmare: Kev stands naked on the stage, the crowd 
            laughing in that horrible, floaty, echo-ey way that crowds do in 
            such situations. He faints. </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Cut to &quot;Seven years later,&quot; and Kev 
            is hanging with his roommates, including former bandmate and still 
            best friend Rod (NSync-er Joey Fatone), who observes, so sagely, 
            that Kevin lacks self-confidence, that he chokes, that that he can't 
            &quot;seal the deal,&quot; when it comes to girls. This from a guy whose idea 
            of a solid rock show is pouring beer down his throat, just before he 
            kicks over his amp (he's also a major fan of some aging, leather-pantsed 
            rock-guy called &quot;The Mick,&quot; played by very good sport Richie Sambora). 
            Still, Rod has a point: Kev is bland as can be, an unfortunate 
            condition for a romantic lead. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Not having a girlfriend can seem 
            dire to a pretty young man. Still, there are worse things, for 
            example, rooming with Rod (who farts repeatedly, apparently a source 
            of great humor, as the members of NSync reported on <i>The Tonight 
            Show</i> some weeks ago), along with two other perpetual 
            adolescents, singularly unimpressive wannabe rapper Eric (Gregory 
            Qaiyum, or, as he's listed in the credits... GQ) and lackluster 
            Randy (James Bulliard). For some reason, the roommates are invested 
            in Kev's love life, so they are loudly disappointed in him when he 
            meets the girl of his dreams on the train but doesn’t get her 
            digits, or even her name. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The rest of the film follows Kev's 
            increasingly elaborate efforts to locate this awesome girl, whose 
            name, incidentally, is Abbey (Emmanuelle Chriqui, of <i>Snow Day</i> 
            and <i>Cruel Intentions 2</i>). Though Kev can't know this, you 
            learn that Abbey doesn't actually live in Chi-town, yet (she's 
            moving there soon). And so, when he papers the streets with flyers 
            recounting their shared love of Al Green and ability to list the 
            U.S. Presidents in order, and asking her to call him, she never sees 
            the effort, but only pines for this &quot;perfect guy&quot; she met on the 
            train. The film pretends to complicate matters with Abbey's 
            engagement to someone else, a career-obsessed cell-phone junkie. But 
            he's so obviously a bad match that even when he appeases her with Al 
            Green tickets, you can't be impressed. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And you're right -- almost as soon 
            as she says yes, yes, yes to the date, this totally lame fiancé is 
            blowing her off for a &quot;meeting,&quot; leaving her to watch Green all by 
            her lonesome. Worse, Kev is at the same show with his boy Eric, 
            whose tickets turn out to be bogus, so the two are bounced out of 
            the club just before Abbey enters the room. Still worse (!), the 
            Green show itself is a spectacularly badly synced performance; I 
            can't remember the last time I saw someone sing on screen with so 
            little relationship to the soundtrack. By the time Green shows up 
            again under the closing credits to sing &quot;Let's Stay Together,&quot; 
            you're long past the point of wondering why he's affiliated with 
            this silly business, but you just might be appalled to see GQ drop 
            his wretched &quot;rap&quot; on top of Green's performance.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Before that, however, you have to 
            get through the rest of the plot, which is skimpy, to say the least. 
            Since you know that Kev and Abbey must hook up (in the very last 
            scene, of course), Eric Aronson and Paul Stanton's script comes up 
            with still more filler nonsense. Some of this has to do with Kev's 
            campaign zooming out of control after the <i>Chicago Daily News</i> 
            runs a &quot;human interest story&quot; on it. Hundreds of girls think the 
            saga is so &quot;romantic&quot; that they respond to what amounts to a 
            personals ad, even though they aren't &quot;The Train Girl,&quot; and Kev's 
            roommates decide to set up a system whereby they all get &quot;dates,&quot; 
            pretending to be him. This exceedingly tedious process is alleviated 
            only by a thirty-second scene showing the beginning of Rod's date 
            with Chyna, surely frightening enough in concept that you don't need 
            to see details. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Another bit of diversion is 
            provided by Kev's job, which has zilch to do with his romance. The 
            once aspiring rock star has grown up to be a worker bee: Kevin is 
            now toiling, Darren Stevens-like, at a Chicago advertising agency, 
            where his boss is the supremely self-confident Higgins (Dave Foley), 
            who likes to blend his wheat-grass drink in the office, then offer 
            the green goo to whatever employee he's lording over at the time. To 
            showcase Kev's haplessness, his latest assignment is to help his 
            extremely competitive colleague Jackie (Tamala Jones) on the 
            all-important Reebok account. On some in-jokey level this makes 
            sense: who better than Lance Bass to pitch product to tweens? But in 
            terms of straight plot, it mostly just makes Kev look like the 
            morally chaste sweetheart and Jackie the proverbial bitch-on-wheels, 
            unable to contain her hostility toward the completely innocuous Kev. 
            If this were another movie, I'd say some office politics or history 
            had been left out. But in <i>On the Line</i>, her anger just seems 
            mean: bad Jackie! Thank goodness that Kev is encouraged by mailroom 
            clerk/spunky heart attack victim/diehard Cubbies fan Nathan (Jerry 
            Stiller).&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The most obvious point of <i>On the 
            Line</i> is that it's good to put yourself &quot;on the line,&quot; to commit 
            to something even when facing possible disappointment or failure. 
            You could make a case that the film itself is following a similar 
            trajectory, as Lance is pursuing his own dream, to produce and star 
            in movies (his company is Freelance Entertainment), a pursuit that 
            will no doubt prove useful once the NSync phenom runs its course. 
            Still, given that the currently all-powerful NSync machine is behind 
            this first effort -- with a soundtrack CD featuring tracks by NSync, 
            Britney Spears, Vitamin C, and lo! Freelance Entertainment's 
            Meredith Edwards -- you might also make the case that the film 
            should be more energetic and enjoyable than it is. </font></td>
