            (Guy Pearce) lives in the present tense. Unable to create new
            memories after suffering a head injury, he's left with fading images
            of his life before that point in time, and scrambles to make sense
            of events as they happen to him, moment by moment. Because he can't
            keep an idea in his head for more than a couple of minutes, Leonard
            writes notes to himself everywhere -- on scraps of paper, on the
            backs of the Polaroids he takes incessantly, and on his body as
            tattoos -- in hopes that when he looks at them, he'll know what he
            was telling himself. Trouble is, he tends not to remember what all
            these notes mean.</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            relationship between meaning and memory is a complex one that most
            of us take for granted -- when you remember something, like a face
            or an event, you also have for it a context and a sense of how it
            connects to other faces and events in your past experience. But what
            if you didn't have that context? How would you know which face is
            relevant to you? Which event has consequences? Christopher Nolan's <i>Memento</i>
            examines these questions and, in lieu of answers, poses still more
            questions. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Imagine
            that, like Leonard, you find yourself in mid-run, with a
            scary-looking guy with a gun running nearby, and you have to figure
            out who's chasing whom. In practical terms, it only takes a second
            to realize that he's chasing you, because he fires his gun at you
            and heads your way. But that instant of not knowing is terrifying,
            unhinging, and not a little absurd. <i>Memento</i> offers versions
            of this instant again and again, situating you alongside Leonard,
            who can't ever know, for sure, what any given instant means for him.
            The film launches you repeatedly into Leonard's moment-to-moment
            existence by beginning again and again, as if it hasn't begun
            before. In this way, the movie, a post-nearly-neo-noir written and
            directed by Nolan and based on a short story by his brother
            Jonathan, emulates Leonard's own struggle to make sense of what's
            happening to and around him. To complicate matters further, and to
            make your experience even more like Leonard's, <i>Memento</i> works
            its narrative backwards -- it opens with the last scene in the film,
            focused on a photo of a dead man whom Leonard has just shot, and
            leads you step by dicey step through the fragmented mess that has
            been his recent experience. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For
            starters, you learn a series of facts. Or maybe they're only facts
            according to Leonard. Fact one: he used to be an insurance
            investigator, a good one. In flashbacks to this time (recalled by
            Leonard, so consider your source), he's flinty and sure of himself,
            you know, like Fred McMurray's Walter Neff, in <i>Double Indemnity</i>.
            Fact two: he was injured while trying to defend his wife, who was
            raped and murdered in their bathroom. Fact three: now he wants
            revenge against the man (or men) who killed his wife and ruined his
            life, but he doesn't know who or where they are. Actually, he
            doesn't even know if they exist, or if his memory of the assault is
            accurate. But Leonard proceeds as if he does know, as if he has a
            sure motivation and a rational plan. And that is what makes him much
            like you. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><i><font size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Memento</span></font></span></font></i><font size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">'s
            genius lies in just such solicitations to recognize and sympathize
            with Leonard, to think that maybe his dire designs have a rationale.
            At once disturbing and titillating, <i>Memento</i> is quite unlike
            the usual filmic experience, leading you to the conclusion you've
            already seen -- the image of the bloody dead guy, whose name, you
            discover, is Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) -- but never fully explaining
            each step along the way. Slowly, you start to follow the bizarre
            logic that drives Leonard, but that doesn't make it any easier to
            like him or even to think he's got grounds for what he's doing. For
            a long while, you're struggling as much as Leonard does, to create a
            coherent narrative out of all the pieces you confront. On Teddy's
            photo, Leonard has scrawled, &quot;Don't believe his lies.&quot;
            Okay. That seems clear enough. But then, you find out that Leonard
            got this idea that Teddy tells lies from a bartender, Natalie
            (Carrie-Anne Moss), who has befriended him for no apparent reason.
            He has written on the back of her photo, &quot;She will help you out
            of pity,&quot; because she has also &quot;lost someone,&quot; but as
            the pieces of her story come together, she looks increasingly
            suspicious as well -- and you see some things that Leonard doesn't
            see. Or more accurately, you can remember things that Leonard can't,
            from scene to scene. And so, you might think that she's using
            Leonard for her own vengeance scheme. Then again, you're passing
            judgment based on incomplete and not entirely trustworthy
            information, aren't you? <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></span></font></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            most unnerving effect of <i>Memento</i>'s fragmentations and
            dislocations is this sense of doubt. At first, you're putting the
            narrative together, much as you would for any film that's slightly
            offbeat. But then you realize that you can't trust your own
            assumptions or reading abilities any more than Leonard can trust
            his. This is a man who writes his information on his body -- brief,
            numbered maybe-facts on his wrists and thighs (the killer's driver's
            license number) and full, more certain sentences across his chest
            and torso (&quot;John G. raped and murdered my wife&quot;). The more
            of these scraps of ideas you see, the more you're apt to doubt them,
            because they don't really fit together.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            one note that comes back again and again is the instruction, inked
            on Leonard's hand, to &quot;Remember Sammy Jankis,&quot; a man at
            the center of an insurance case Leonard once investigated. Sammy
            (played in flashbacks by glassy-eyed Stephen Tobolowski) also lost
            his short-term memory and now, in Leonard's present-tense
            recollection of his story, stands as the model for what not to do.
            Or maybe he's the model of what <i>to</i> do. Leonard can remember
            Sammy's story because he knew it before his &quot;accident,&quot;
            but really, he cannot fathom what it means. That's up to you.
            Likewise, you're left with the pieces of this poor guy's woeful
            tale, intercut with Leonard's own, and wonder what either has to do
            with what you're doing here and now, watching all this confusion and
            retaliation -- against what? well, that's an open question. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><i><font size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Memento</span></font></span></font></i><font size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
            isn't about character development or change -- Leonard is incapable
            of either. Losing meaning is a frightening experience, because
            you're so used to thinking you have it, that your identity remains
            constant from moment to moment, that your memory is who you are. If
            you have no memory, then who are you? Such questions may ultimately
            be more tedious than profound: you need to put on your pants and get
            out the door each day, whether or not you're sure of how one moment
            connects to the next. But the most important connection here is not
            between moments, between plot turns or characters. It's between you
            and Leonard. By the time he says, at film's end (or is it the
            beginning?), that he is &quot;no different&quot; from you, it's more
            than a little chilling to recognize even the bit of truth he's
            speaking.</span></font></span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"></o:p>
