            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>
            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 16 March 2001</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In a working-class
            Italian-American household in Philadelphia, the four daughters of
            the Amati family assemble to cook and serve dinner to their various
            spouses, children, and relatives, after which, over dessert, Aunt
            Loretta (Edith Fields) and Aunt Splendora (Lee Grant) launch into
            vicious, but pointless, arguments over who's best: Sinatra or Tony
            Bennett.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The daughters, however, are
            concerned with other matters. Grace (Mercedes Ruehl), who always
            seems to be involved in doing several things at once, is the sturdy
            one, the touchstone, the one who holds everything and everyone
            together, even though her husband (Paul Sorvino) treats her like a
            servant. Among the many things occupying Grace's time is complying
            with a request from her mother (Cloris Leachman), recently widowed
            but on all other accounts still very much alive, to hand-sew the
            dress that she wants to buried in, and to accompany her on trips to
            pick out a casket that has the right color-coordination.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Christine (Sean Young) has
            separated from her husband (Jamey Sheridan), who can never find time
            away from his job to attend to the needs of the couple's two
            daughters. (There is a hint that he may not be simply busy but
            afraid to make a commitment that he would then not be able to follow
            through on.) Denise (Dinah Manoff) wants to be a professional singer
            although she can't sing, lands a job with a touring company of <i>Fiddler
            on the Roof</i> (&quot;<i>Fiddler on the Roof</i> is a
            CLASSIC!!&quot; she gushes), and can't decide whether to get married
            or not to Lawrence (Mark Harmon), who has the patience of a saint.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Dolores (Lily Knight) suffers under
            some sort of unspecified birth defect, the result of when her
            mother, during pregnancy, fell while chasing after one of the other
            girls. Dolores must now take pills and receive constant supervision.
            But, having become an adult, she wants to wear makeup and have a
            boyfriend, whom she finds in sweet -- and, while unstated, also
            apparently handicapped -- Armand (Danny Spinuzza), who shyly
            exchanges glances with her for the first time over bingo cards in
            the local church's rec hall. Later, they will go on a date to see <i>Lady
            and the Tramp</i>, and pay for their tickets with pocket change.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As written and directed by Anne
            DeSalvo, the picture can't take two steps without providing
            something that's wise, insightful, and reassuring. In keeping with
            the opening statement that &quot;nobody loves you like a
            sister&quot;, the daughters always seem to have time for each other,
            no matter what hour or time of the day. When Christine announces
            that she's seeking a divorce (&quot;'For better, for worse'! It
            should be a promise, not a sentence!&quot;), Mama Amati replies,
            &quot;Try harder!&quot; One character admonishes that, in the face
            of adversity, &quot;When your heart's right, the rest follows.&quot;
            When Dolores expresses doubts about whether she'll ever find a
            boyfriend, Grace tells her, &quot;There's a top to every pot.&quot;
            However, when Dolores does get a guy, she's immediately told that
            she can't have one after all: &quot;Not all pots have tops.&quot;
            (Of course, Dolores then wails, &quot;I want a top!&quot;)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The picture moves in the punishing,
            pre-programmed manner of the most synthetic T.V. programs, complete
            with accompanying music that gets more and more swampier as things
            go along. The only thing more offensive than the condescending
            attitude towards Dolores (or the unpardonable way in which Cloris
            Leachman is photographed, unflatteringly, in most of her scenes) is
            the last-minute surprise plot turn that allows the filmmakers to
            spend several more minutes dragging us through the mud of bathos.
            (After receiving a tiny theatrical release in February, the film is
            now being shown on the Fox Family channel, which is probably the
            best place for it: it's best taken ten minutes at a time, with
            breaks.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mark Harmon's appearance -- even
            with an unflattering thatch of prematurely-grey hair and, in one
            scene, a beret -- reminds one of the pleasantly surprised reaction
            one had to his remarkable performance in Nicolas Roeg's 1992 film <i>Cold
            Heaven</i>, meaning that he can be a pretty good actor on occasion.
            Mercedes Ruehl presents a remarkably confident and fully-realized
            portrayal of Grace, especially considering that all her character's
            big scenes apparently did not make it into the final cut, if they
            were there to begin with.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And it's probably about time that
            someone gave Sean Young one more crack at a big leading role in a
            motion picture. After spending years almost completely out-of-sight
            in the hinterlands of direct-to-video, she has emerged as a
            performer with range. Listening to Manoff's character attempting to
            sing <i>Kiss of Fire</i> in public, Young gives such a wonderfully
            convoluted<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>reaction,
            without uttering a word, that it just about primes one for a more
            unpredictable, and richer, family drama than the one that emerges.<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"></o:p>
