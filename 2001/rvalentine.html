            turns out to be, of all things, an attempt to return to the
            un-ironic scares of the slasher movie genre, after they have been
            monotonized to death by the <i>Friday the 13th</i> films, glibbed to
            death by the Freddy Krueger films, mocked to death by the <i>Scream</i>
            films, and joked to death by <i>Scary Movie</i>.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Poor Jason (hmmm, that has a
            familiar ring to it) was so traumatized and humiliated at the
            sixth-grade school dance that, thirteen years later (that sounds
            familiar, too), he tracks down all the girls who gave him the
            brush-off<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>when he asked
            them to dance. They all happen to be living in San Francisco
            (although the film never gives us a single shot of either of the Bay
            bridges or even a cable car): they include the popular one (Marley
            Shelton, who just sent-up this type of role in <i>Sugar and Spice</i>),
            the babalicious one (Denise Richards, and, yes, she is, rather), the
            brainy one (Katherine Heigl), the artistically-inclined one (Jessica
            Cauffiel, whose character lives in an apartment that looks like a
            downtown gallery), and the formerly &quot;fat&quot; girl who is now
            thin and wealthy (Jessica Capshaw, who seems to spend all her time
            on-screen either flinching or talking through gritted teeth). The
            deranged one sends them all macabre valentine cards, then starts
            picking them off, one by one, while wearing a Cupid's mask. Who
            could it be? Do you really care?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And what does Denise Richards think
            she's doing here? As if she hasn't already received enough flak over
            her appearances in <i>Wild Things</i> (warranted) and <i>The World
            is Not Enough</i> (unwarranted), here she does a scene with an actor
            who promises that he has a &quot;surprise&quot; for her, then
            promptly drops his trousers to show her his propensities. He then
            delivers a memorable line of dialogue which, unfortunately, cannot
            be repeated here. Richards responds with an even more memorable line
            of dialogue which, unfortunately, also cannot be repeated here. The
            whole thing ends up with her tying him up hand and foot, putting a
            blindfold over his eyes...and then dripping hot candle wax onto his
            body. Was this scene already in the script when she received it, or
            did she ask for it to be included?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">David Boreanaz, of the TV series <i>Angel</i>,
            bumps in and out of the movie as a guy who's a sports journalist, an
            alcoholic, and who drives a vintage Mustang convertible. He's also a
            former boyfriend of one of the female characters, but his primary
            function is to wear a figurative sign around his neck that tells the
            audience &quot;I AM A RED HERRING.&quot; (To his credit, Boreanaz
            does just about the best job possible playing such a thankless
            part.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Otherwise, the film is of primary
            interest for seeing, if you can still remember them when the slasher
            movies first came out, twenty-year-old formula clichés transplanted
            into modern settings (with cell phones, rave music, et al.). At
            least two of the murder scenes are direct lifts from earlier, and
            better, films by the Italian &quot;giallo-maestro&quot; Dario
            Argento. And the filmmakers even resurrect that most hoariest, and
            disdainful, of slasher movie clichés, in which all the characters
            who are killed are the ones who have had sex sometime earlier in the
            story, leaving as the one survivor the girl who has held-out and
            retained her virtue. The identity of the killer, here, is tipped off
            quite early on with an unbelievably relentless, self-referential
            piece of dialogue. But, while the scary parts in the film aren't
            scary, the funny parts aren't funny, and the serious parts turn out
            to be unintentionally funny, the picture ends up, except for a brief
            moment at the very end, being mostly dismal, the reason being that
            things have simply changed and this type of movie has been passed
            by. The time when we could still experience something other than
            contempt or disgust while looking at glowering shots of a female
            character simpering and quivering helplessly in the dark while a
            hulking brute pursues her and music stings dither and whine on the
            soundtrack is over.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
