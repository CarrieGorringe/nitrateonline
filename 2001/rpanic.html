The score by Brian Tyler is dead on and Jeffrey Jur's deliberate camerawork extremely well defined and calculated, shaded with steely blues and shadows that deepen the film's effectiveness. [Director Henry] Bromell hails the conquered hero with a absurdist wit and darkly delicious humor.">

            around the stark, suburban landscape of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Panic</i>
            -- melancholically stuck somewhere between <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Seven-Year Itch</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Affliction</i>,
            and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">American Beauty</i> -- is
            Alex, the modern amalgam of the harried, married American male. He
            suffers from a multiple mid-life crisis disorder, no longer
            attracted to his wife or the family business. &quot;I'm in a
            rut,&quot; he tosses off to a stranger, eager to listen. His
            mild-mannered appearance, split-level home life, and the late model
            American sedan in the garage suggest he's, perhaps, a moderately
            successful insurance salesman, not a nerve-wracked double wage
            earner. The missus acknowledges he sells mail-order lawn ornaments
            and sexual aids, but she's totally in the dark about his other
            career, as a hit man. For dad. And mom. Yup, you read that right.
            And, yeah, this is one of those offbeat dramatic films that come out
            of left field. Oh, boy, does it ever.<o:p>

            get the feeling you're dead?&quot; Alex rhetorically asks his
            psychologist, underscoring the depth of his depression.
            Director-writer Henry Bromell's dark vision of one man's attempt to
            take one job and shove it often transcends its literal timeline as
            it delves into family secrets that we are more likely to see on
            HBO's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Sopranos</i>.
            William H. Macy further aspires to greatness (actually, I'm sure
            he's there already) with his sad and confused Alex, a hired gun and
            son of a killer-for-hire. The flustered director in David Mamet's
            witty <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">State and Main</i>, the
            skittish car salesman in the Coen brothers' mysteriously great <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Fargo</i>,
            the wayward Quiz Kid Donnie Smith in the exhilarating <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Magnolia</i>,
            Macy embellishes his current role with the obvious dejection and wry
            humor of a man defeated. He does it SO well. As if often the case,
            his nuanced contribution makes this small ensemble piece soar.<o:p>

            feature director Henry Bromell brings more a decade or two of
            experience to this theatrical blue-plate special: a ton-load of
            stellar television producer-writer experience (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Homicide:
            Life on the Street</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Northern

            award-winning short stories, and a handful of unproduced scripts
            (dust 'em off, let's take a look!). Bromell casts a suffocating cowl
            over his pussy-whipped Alex, layering him in ever-darkening levels
            of oxygen-depleting panic. His marriage to Martha (Tracey Ullman) is
            sexless as he sees it, although he's eternally proud of their
            six-year-old son Sammy (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Bounce</i>'s
            David Dorfman), a child in body, but wise in ways much beyond his
            size. Dorfman is a born natural and those question-filled bedtime
            moments he has with Macy (&quot;What's infinity?&quot;, &quot;Are
            You gonna die?,&quot; &quot;Are you ok?&quot;) glow with a realism
            that competes with Haley Joel Osment.<o:p>

            is a competent businessman in a like-father, like-son mold, yet he
            is desperately trying to break away from mom and dad (Donald
            Sutherland and Barbara Bain). They are introduced as
            quintessentially plain folk, the kind -- like a former boss I once
            had -- that give a great first impression, before striking back in
            dysfunctional anger. Especially when their grandson inadvertently
            tosses gift wrapping from a birthday present on their
            don't-you-ever-EVER-ruin-the-order-of-our-lives floor. The poor lad
            then has the innocent audacity to squirt glue on their dust-free
            furniture. Beware the ides of granny and gramps.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Alex's
            tormented past is bared in numerous soul-searching sessions with his
            therapist, the dark-suited Dr. Parks (John Ritter behind a ton of
            facial hair). Among these peel-away recollections, Alex remembers,
            as a child and then teenager, the rudimentary rules of the trade his
            father impressed on him. It's in the germ of those memories that
            Alex must come to grips with family and how it will affect the
            relationship he has with his counselor. Meanwhile, in the doctor's
            waiting room he meets twenty-three-year-old toothpick-munching
            hairstylist Sarah Cassidy (Neve Campbell), a troubled, seductive
            bisexual who attracts his extra-curricular, odd-couple attention.
            Their independently chaotic natures ripen a need to share some
            future intimacy.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I
            suspect the brilliant script's origins flowed from the Bromell's
            father's secretive career with the government (&quot;Henry, hang up
            the phone, now!&quot;), and it's fitting that the East Coast
            theatrical premiere of the film (the San Francisco-based distributor
            having already showcased it there and Sacramento) is here at
            (Washington) DC Visions Cinema. Aside from his family connections to
            the area, Bromell's long association producing <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Homicide</i>,
            filmed up the road in Baltimore (where he wrote the script and
            screened the film last summer at the Maryland Film Festival), allows
            for Bromell to personally publicize the film and reconnoiter with
            family and friends from his former Fells Point neighborhood.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">FYI,
            the film debuted at Sundance a year ago and was thereafter sold to
            Artisan Entertainment. You would think that after paying more than
            $2 million to distribute the film, Artisan would handle the film
            with the same aplomb that worked so well for their previous,
            profitable releases (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Blair Witch Project</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Pi</i>).
            In a case of bone-headedness rare for this distributor, it instead
            licensed the film directly to cable (where it premiered on Cinemax
            last August 27th), and angered the creative talent expecting more
            than small screen exposure. This exceedingly dumb move was the
            subject of an extensive piece by <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Washington
            Post</i> critic Stephen Hunter on June 15<sup>th</sup> where he
            proclaimed it &quot;the best movie you may never see this
            year.&quot; Hunter is now, thankfully, half right. Roxie Releasing's
            Rick Norris mentioned that Bill Banning (Roxie's owner) had seen the
            film at Sundance and six months later watched nationally renown
            critic Roger Ebert proclaim it &quot;a sharp-edged and wicked
            comedy.&quot; Although the small company felt it couldn't match the
            pick-up cost for the film after it's first festival presentation, in
            the aftermath of Artisan's apparent decision to no longer profile
            small indie efforts like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Panic</i>
            (apparently with a test screening before a statistically misguided
            audience), Roxie approached Bromell and rescued the film from
            theatrical oblivion. Oddly enough, it was shown in theaters last
            summer -- in France! American audiences now are about to discover a
            film that had flown below Artisan's commercial radar screen (it
            still controls video rights) and surely would have been an Oscar
            contender had it been handled correctly. Analyze this, Artisan!<o:p>

            with a absurdist wit and darkly delicious humor, despite a
            predictable conclusion (well one of them at least). As a Republican
            administration moves into the White House, it's fitting that a film
            such as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Panic</i> is playing within walking distance of George W.'s future
            residence. It's his party's family-values movie: guns don't kill
