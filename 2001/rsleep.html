            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Jack (Marc Palmieri), the
            protagonist of David Maquiling's film, <i>Too Much Sleep</i>, has
            the lanky build of a high school basketball star but with
            beleaguered eyes that are almost heart-rendingly melancholy. Coming
            home on a city bus one morning from his job as a night security
            guard, he loses a paper bag that contained a gun that had originally
            belonged to his father, and, convinced that it was stolen by one of
            the people riding with him on the bus, Jack ends up going to see
            Eddie (Pasquale Gaeta), a boisterous little Italian who knows
            everyone and everything (&quot;Jack, this cheese is really gonna
            speak t'ya!...&quot; he says as he fresh-grates some onto Jack's
            plate of pasta), and Eddie sends Jack pinballing from one place to
            another<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"> -- </i></b>from a Chinese
            restaurant to a male strip club, where he is pounded into submission
            by courteous bouncers in the parking lot<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">
            -- </i></b>in search of his lost property.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film, which Maquiling wrote and
            directed and filmed in the suburbs of New Jersey,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>tries very hard to be ingratiating without compromising
            itself. It tacks out its own points on the compass from the start
            and sticks by them. Jack shows a dogged determination in the early
            scenes that's very appealing (he spends one whole day following a
            woman whom he suspects is the thief around town, until she ends up
            offering him a beer for his effort).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>But, like the search for the lost girl in <i>L'Avventura</i>,
            the search for the gun proves to be irrelevant. Jack is in danger of
            being totally cut out of the loop of human interaction, and the
            journey reintroduces him to the virtues of contact with others, but
            it's a point (a good one) that's so quietly made that you almost
            miss it.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Maquiling and the film's
            cinematographer, Robert Mowen, use a visual scheme that alternates
            between desaturating the colours out of scenes, or filling them with
            enough sunlight that it looks as if the light is hanging,
            permeating, in the air<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">
            -- </i></b>how the world would look to someone who makes a living
            working nights but has never entirely adjusted to the change. The
            look gives, in retrospect, a wonderfully floating, shimmering
            quality to the film, like a dream or a story that you recollect from
            memory.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's nice<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">
            -- </i></b>terrific, in fact<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal"> -- </i></b>to see a new film comedy that exercises a light touch
            instead of lobbing bricks at us. And there were several times in <i>Too
            Much Sleep</i> where I laughed, heartily, out loud. For the most
            part, the film comes off like a pleasant doodle in the air, but it
            also leaves you with a bit of a letdown<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal"> -- </i></b>it drifts off the screen when it's over, but you still have
            a nagging feeling that you want to get something more out of it.<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"></o:p>
