            the quintessential French social farce <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">La

            <p><span style="color:black"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Veber's
            films often center on all variety of the human sad-sack tale -- in
            the closet and out -- with American audiences often getting a double
            dose of his ironic underpinnings when remade in Americanized (i.e.,
            Disney-fied) versions. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

            varying success. More recently his<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">

            stateside last year, is being refashioned as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Dinner

            despite Veber having lived in the United States for the last fifteen
            years, he still maintains a decidedly cosmopolitan flair -- and is
            uniquely funny. Disney may be awash in red ink from its latest
            animated disaster <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Long-time
            accountant Francois Pignon's (Daniel Auteuil) dull, old-fashioned,
            boring speck of colorless presence contrasts sharply with the bright
            blue, ultra-modernist (matching the obvious iMac computers) style of
            the condom factory where he is entrenched. If he's noticed at all by
            his co-workers, it's with an exaggerated yawn or hushed,
            back-stabbing defacement. Being elbowed out of the company's annual
            photo segues into his being pushed out of his office under a
            generalized &quot;staff reduction,&quot; two years after this
            nebbish was cast off from his ice queen wife Christine (Alexandra
            Vanderhoot), for whom he still pines, and their teenage son Franck
            (Stanislas Crevillén), both of whom make concerted efforts not to
            answer his dreary telephone calls or dine on his homemade tomato and
            basil pasta. The radio blares out bad news, too. Ferry disasters.
            Mass kidnappings. And the toast pops out of his toaster…and out
            the window!<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">His
            transparent wallpaper existence peels away with the arrival of a new
            neighbor in his apartment building. Belone (Michel Aumont), a
            retired corporate psychologist, is worried that Francois' leanings
            over his balcony might make for a more desperate agenda. Their
            friendship quickly cemented over an adorable kitten, they hatch an
            absurd plan to send to Francois' employers anonymous photographs of
            him doctored to reveal a nonexistent homosexual slant. This forces
            Kopel (Jean Rochefort), the company director, to reverse course on
            the recent dismissal for fear of a potential lawsuit and loss of the
            gay market for his disposable latex product. From thence on the
            mis-firings begin, keyed off the brutish Felix Santini, a
            middle-management type played with befuddled gay-bashing desperation
            by the heavy set Gérard Depardieu. Felix, himself the brunt of
            corporate tricksters (including Thierry Lhermitte as the p.r. flack
            Guillaume), is forced to wine and dine Francois rather than appear
            homophobic. Played with Ralph Kramden gusto, Felix expects his home
            life to be fully catered -- dropping daily into his favorite lounge
            chair and having his wife firmly placed a beer can in his
            outstretched hand. When she misconstrues his flamboyant purchases of
            a pink cashmere sweater and expensive chocolates as fodder for a
            mistress, rather than as the intended gifts to ward off legal
            difficulties from Francois, all hell breaks loose.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">While
            Felix is temporarily shipped off for R&amp;R at a local sanitarium,
            the fashionable Mlle. Bertrand (Michèle Laroque), who has shared an
            office with Francois -- now widely perceived as the company's token
            homosexual by not admitting to be anything different -- for six
            years without a hint of gay pride from him, gets into some
            lightheaded social/sexual misunderstandings trying to uncover the
            ever-widening plot. Social/sexual intercourse follows in one of the
            funniest set-ups for an audience of Japanese clients visiting the
            plant.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Of
            course, this odd-man-out story ends up a happy-ever-after fairy
            tale. Aside from Veber's breezy story, quick pace, and visual flair,
            the entire cast reads like a Who's Who in French Cinema. Auteuil,
            well known for his dramatic performances (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Girl
            on the Bridge</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Widow of St. Pierre</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Manon
            of the Spring</i>) which have earned him an incredible nine <b><i>César</i></b>
            Award nominations, has heretofore been unseen in a Veber farce. He
            endears his role with wonderfully simple charm and pathos -- hard to
            do within the limitations of such a relatively shy, discrete
            persona. Popping up in an occasional English-language title (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Green
            Card</i> being the first that comes to mind), Depardieu's
            dunderheaded Felix is a remarkable smug character with stuffed-shirt
            mentality fits well in his trenchcoat wardrobe.<o:p>
