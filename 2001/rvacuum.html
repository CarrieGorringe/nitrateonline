            review by <a href="../carrie.html" target="_top">Carrie Gorringe</a>, 21 September
            2001</i></font><p><font size="5"><span style="font-family: Verdana">26th

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>&quot;You know
            what it's like to go to work in a place where people hate you?
            Exhilarating!&quot; wheezes a corpulent vacuum-cleaner salesman
            named Tommy (Timothy Spall) to his feckless trainee in <i>Vacuuming
            Completely Nude In Paradise</i>. <i>Vacuuming</i> is one of two
            short films from director Danny Boyle (one-half of the team
            responsible for <i>Trainspotting</i>). Smoking too much and breaking
            too many traffic laws to count, Tommy is desperate to meet his quota
            so that he can win JAC Vacuum Company's &quot;Salesman of the
            Year&quot; award. Tommy's life is his work, with an apartment that's
            little more than a closet holding the latest suit and a shower, and
            a taste for entertainment which doesn't extend beyond the endless
            braying of his self-created motivational tapes during the dash from
            one sales call to the next. More than his apartment is dirty; he'll
            foist vacuums upon mothers on the dole who can barely afford to make
            ends meet, and even pretend to be in love with a woman in order to
            get her to sign a sales contract. His fellow employees hate him as
            much for his sleazy demeanor as for his sales totals; in their
            opinion, his comeuppance should have arrived by yesterday.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yet, as he bashfully admits to the
            trainee, he has a spiritual side: he envisions paradise as a place
            in which one can vacuum uninhibited by worldly demands (hence the
            film's title). The trainee, for his part, is there only to please
            the demands of his girlfriend, who is tired of having to support
            this dreamer of a boyfriend by working as a stripper. Tommy attempts
            to oblige the trainee to sink to his own repulsive level, but the
            trainee has another idea about his future employment, one which, in
            the first of many ironies that punctuate <i>Vacuuming</i>, stands a
            chance of being realized. In certain respects, the film's ending
            seems too pat and inevitable, and full of symbolism applied with all
            the restraint of someone working with an overflowing trowel, but the
            performances are dead-on. Spall's Tommy charges through the film
            like a bull in a china shop, as a man whose bluster barely conceals
            his inner distress and desperate need to have his hard work
            validated by society; Tommy, however, is racing toward a success
            that seems to get further and further beyond his reach. He becomes
            the illustrative example of why success is not a goal, but a
            progress.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Likewise with <i>Strumpet</i>, with
            its rags-to-riches storyline involving a brilliant, but emotionally
            unhinged, street poet and an abused girl who rise and fall in the
            land of corporate rock. Boyle's examination of how performers are
            packaged in what Joni Mitchell referred to as the &quot;star-making
            machinery behind a popular song&quot; is mercilessly funny; the
            scene in which the two newcomers are in negotiations with the music
            company, in league with a manager more amateurish than they, is
            laced with enough mordant wit to make you cringe and laugh
            simultaneously. You can see the three of them heading straight for
            the meat grinder fifteen minutes into the film. The question is,
            however, just what choices they will, or can, make as the machinery
            threatens to consume their dreams. Despite the harshness of satire
            that permeates <i>Strumpet</i>, it also contains exquisitely-drawn
            characterizations, played with such precision, that even in the
            midst of whatever madness is unfolding on screen, you never lose
            sight of the band members' need for acceptance, no matter how much
            they may deny it. Both <i>Vacuuming</i> and <i>Strumpet</i> are
            inspired examples of how a talented filmmaker can make films that
            provide a multifaceted picture of humanity without requiring three
            hours of running time.</font>&nbsp;<o:p>
