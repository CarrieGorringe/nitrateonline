            review by <a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 5 October
            2001</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="5">Tell me a story</font></p>
            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The video for Nelly's rambunctious 
            &quot;#1,&quot; the first single off the <i>Training Day</i> soundtrack, 
            features the rapper playing two characters -- a tough-looking 
            criminal and the tougher-looking cop who takes him down. Nelly says 
            that his doubled performance was inspired by Denzel Washington's turn in the 
            film as LA police sergeant Alonzo Harris. No matter what anyone else 
            thinks of this cat, Nelly enthused in an interview with MTV News, 
            Alonzo believes he's number one and &quot;nobody's gonna take that away 
            from him.&quot; </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Indeed. In <i>Training Day</i>, 
            Denzel Washington, best known for playing big-hearted, heroic 
            characters, brings the brutal and charismatic Alonzo to alarming 
            life, but repellent as he is, you can't take your eyes off him. 
            While many critics have already observed that this change-up 
            performance -- &quot;the performance of his career&quot; -- is <i>the</i> 
            reason to see the movie, that's only half of it. Alonzo is certainly 
            a welcome stretch for Denzel, and the actor makes the most of the 
            opportunity; mean and self-absorbed, snarling and seductive, the 
            character would be cartoonish if not for Washington's remarkable 
            control of every moment he's on screen. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At the same time, though, Alonzo is 
            more than just a bad cop to beat all bad cops. For one thing, he's a 
            disturbing reminder of all kinds of well-known scandals, from OJ and 
            Rodney King to the Biggie Smalls murder case and the Rampart 
            anti-gang squad. For another, he takes the combination of police 
            corruption, racism, and male-bully culture to a whole other 
            metaphorical level. Alonzo's self-delusory sense of power is a 
            function not only of his own massive ego or rage (which would make 
            him a standard movie villain), but also of his uncanny insight into 
            his world, the very world that has created him. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And so, for all Alonzo's hunky 
            bravado and street-smart philosophizing, he is also deep, far beyond 
            the fiction he inhabits. As a character, his threat is obvious: he 
            commits violence because he knows this is how he can get what he 
            wants, but mostly he commits violence because he can. He understands 
            how the system works, whom he needs to keep satisfied, and how he 
            can get around the law. He abuses a local dealer in a wheelchair 
            (Snoop Dogg); keeps his hot-mama &quot;old lady&quot; Sara (Eva Mendes) 
            available for afternoon sex; keeps trunks of money stashed with an 
            old drinking buddy (Scott Glenn); harasses another dealer's wife 
            (Macy Gray, who is entirely convincing as a mad-as-hell junkie-mom), 
            and maintains his own crack beat-down squad (including a detective 
            played by Dr. Dre, on his way to Ice-T-dom, perhaps?), all because 
            he can. But even aside from these plot points (which the film 
            exploits to aptly unnerving effects), Alonzo poses another threat, 
            and this one, <i>Training Day</i> does not engage. This threat lies 
            in his embodiment of a cultural moment, an anxiety and ethos, his 
            representativeness rather than his deviance. Contrary to standard 
            mythology, where the scary black man is &quot;merely&quot; depraved or 
            symptomatic, unable to help his dysfunction, Alonzo knows who he is 
            and how he came to be. He is the consummate street product. </font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is in this capacity that Alonzo 
            is reduced to cliché, so that he can be contained and punished, his 
            insights and broader significance rejected. That is, he is turned 
            into a straight-up movie outlaw, checked so that order can be 
            restored and viewers can go home feeling reassured: good wins out, 
            after all. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sadly, in its effort to restore 
            this order, Antoine Fuqua's film, written by David Ayer, resorts to 
            the corniest of contrivances and excesses. Chief among these is 
            Alonzo's newbie partner, Jake (Ethan Hawke). A nice-kid husband and 
            new-father-to-be, Jake is scruffy and sweet; he might be the 
            younger, dumber brother of Brad Pitt's character in <i>Seven</i>. 
            It's an impossible part. Jake is so well-meaning and righteous that 
            he turns down suitcases full of cash in front of some very scary 
            looking would-be partners, so naive that he's shocked to see Alonzo 
            murder an ostensible friend in cold blood, and so slow on the uptake 
            that he ends up alone in a room full of card-playing Latino thugs 
            who hate his self-confident, badge-brandishing guts. The role is so 
            silly -- tilting from blatant fear to tentative admiration to 
            awesome gallantry in the name of bland good-guyness -- that I kind 
            of feel sorry for Hawke, who does his best to keep up with 
            Washington, but, honestly, he stands no chance: Jake spends a third 
            of the movie f*cked up on a PCP-laced joint that Alonzo has forced 
            him to smoke, while trying not to be shocked by Alonzo's 
            outrageousness and trying to do the right thing in a city where it 
            just doesn't seem to matter. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The problem is that <i>Training Day</i> 
            is supposed to be Jake's story, and so his compulsion to do the 
            right thing is treated as rational and even admirable. Jake is 
            pre-jaded; Alonzo is way-jaded. You first see Alonzo from his naive 
            perspective, so he looks menacing and enigmatic, seated in a diner 
            booth, his gold chains heavy on his neck, his black skully marking 
            his profound distance from Jake's experience. (The film that might 
            be made from Alonzo's point of view is, of course, far too dicey and 
            discomforting, a version of police corruption and thug-life as the 
            norm instead of the aberration.) Jake is so nervous about making a 
            good impression that he can't shut up during Alonzo's breakfast. 
            Annoyed, Alonzo tells the kid, &quot;Tell me a story.&quot; Jake searches his 
            memory files, comes up with some amusing cop-mishap-tale, but all 
            Alonzo hears is Jake's lack of nerve, sexual aggression, and 
            self-aggrandizement. Jake's story is emphatically not Alonzo's 
            story. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The only time Jake sees Alonzo even 
            vaguely unsettled is during one of those dark-shadowed 
            posh-restaurant meetings with a group of suits (among them, Tom 
            Berenger, Raymond J. Barry, and Harris Yulin, rating 10, 7, and 4 on 
            the smarm scale, respectively) that always happen in corrupt cop 
            movies. These guys imagine themselves as untouchable as Alonzo 
            imagines himself, though of course, they don't carry large weapons 
            or wear fat gold chains. They just have money and connections (their 
            interest in Alonzo has to do with a crime he may have committed 
            while in Vegas, just one of the film's overt references to the 
            Rampart scandal). Looking grim, they warn their &quot;go-to boy&quot; to get 
            whatever mess he's in under &quot;control,&quot; and he smiles and shuffles, 
            just a bit. In this scene, the film gestures toward a larger picture 
            that it otherwise resists considering. But seeing as it's staged for 
            Jake's benefit, the scene also plays as one of those predictable 
            moments where the bad guy's vulnerabilities are revealed. </font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">More troubling than the film's 
            point of view is <i>Training Day</i>'s central conceit, that the 
            many events that so shock Jake all take place in one day. Alonzo 
            uses that long day to introduce Jake to all kinds of secrets: 
            down-low drug busts, big guns, cash stashes, even his own 
            neighborhood and home (this seems a particularly strange instance of 
            self-exposure: I suppose it could illustrate his self-assurance, but 
            mostly, it just seems idiotic). Jake is so obviously a device that 
            you're not inclined to accompany him -- much less identify with him 
            -- on this ride, especially when an unconvincing coincidence prompts 
            an extremely hardcore homeboy to spare his life, and when, in a 
            moment of crisis, Alonzo's own child chooses the strange white man 
            over poppy. Most revealing of the film's inability to follow through 
            on its own systemic critique (of the system that has produced 
            Alonzo), comes when the black and Latino community throws in with 
            Jake against Alonzo. While it's understandable that they despise 
            Alonzo, since he's been exploiting and abusing them for years, their 
            instant faith in and support of a white cop is absolutely 
            implausible. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Plausibility is plainly not <i>
            Training Day</i>'s concern. It's more interested in images and ideas 
            than practicalities. Fair enough. Still, the white-guy heroics are 
            even more too bad than usual here, because they come off as a 
            last-minute band-aid for all sorts of social and political damage. 
            Alonzo is in love with himself and mean to everyone else, that much 
            is clear and compelling. But his emotional and political mechanics 
            are well worth exploring, and the movie is so impressed with its own 
            gorgeous visuals (all urban-grainy imagery and jumpy editing) and 
            mundane themes that it doesn't attend to its greatest asset -- the 
            complications of this huge and ferocious character. </font></td>
