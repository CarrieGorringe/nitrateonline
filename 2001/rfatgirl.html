            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Either French director and 
            writer Catherine Breillat is a psychological sorceress or she has 
            primed some primordial sewage pump of memory for her film, <i>À Ma 
            Soeur</i> - or <i>Fat Girl</i> - as the English title claims. I 
            think the French title, which translates <i>For My Sister</i> fits 
            better because this thinly disguised cinematic violation seems 
            personal and elemental in its purging of childhood demons. Its 
            Psychology 101 primal rage and fury run deeper than a mere clinical 
            observer could muster. There simply must be more to the story.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Shot in a blinding and disquieting 
            yellow light for the first reel, &quot;Fat Girl&quot; is disturbing, yes, and 
            compellingly repulsive; like watching a murder, a rape or a child's 
            molestation, it plays to the worst of our insecurities as it 
            registers each component of the attraction-repulsion principle. But 
            while there is something self-righteous and unbalanced about the 
            film, we can't help but wonder which part Breillat must have played 
            in its dysfunctional family order and upon which sister she has 
            spread her Id.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Fat Girl</i> is about two 
            teenage sisters; one, Elena (Roxanne Mesquida), a sullen vixen who 
            believes herself a player of men but whose budding body surpasses 
            her brain's ability to accurately read them. The younger, Anaïs (Anais 
            Reboux), from whose eyes we view this miasma of familial misery and 
            hormonal hatred, is also sullen but her antisocial behavior stems 
            from being an overweight thirteen-year-old symbolically rubbed out 
            by the shadow of a far more-desired sibling.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film begins in summer's 
            blinding light with Elena seductively bossing Anaïs into submission 
            when they meet a handsome young man at a cafe near their annual 
            vacation spot. Fernando (Libero De Rienzo) is a medical student and 
            he is attracted to the carefree and permissive manner that Elena 
            exudes. Anaïs only peers digusted, like a mole, accustomed to the 
            dark and suddenly thrust into daylight, at their immediate 
            dalliance.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Even at family breakfast Anaïs 
            pouts, while mom (Arsinée Khanjian) frets and dad lives preoccupied 
            in his world of business. Though he is surrounded by females, he 
            cannot clearly see them and this role model of a relationship that 
            acts as a paradigm of future marriage for the girls is fraught with 
            fragile cracks and shaky tremors. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Elena struggles with Fernando's 
            insistant pleas for sex, and the girl finally reluctantly relents, 
            in a harrowing, ugly, devastating scene - no hazy vaseline on the 
            lens which turns getting screwed into orgasmic, divine epiphany - in 
            which the young man cajoles and taunts her for her wavering and, 
            finally getting his wish, does so with Anaïs in the next bed, 
            feigning sleep but frighteningly aware of what is happening.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This act marks a shift in how we 
            perceive the film. There is a moment of touching revelation between 
            the girls, and then a betrayal - suddenly the holiday is over, as is 
            any whiff of innocence that lingered in their upset, competitive 
            lives. Ultimately Anaïs' liberation and knowledge come at an 
            unexpected, terrible price. <i>Fat Girl</i> contains a triple dose 
            of psychological inferences and jealousy erupts into one of the most 
            queasy and disturbing manifestations of sublimated desire, hatred 
            and envy to hit the screen.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Certainly Breillat courts 
            controversy - her 1999 film, <i>Romance</i>, divided critics and 
            audiences and she never shied away from holding up a mirror of stark 
            reality as far back as <b><i>36 fillette</i></b>. But here, even 
            Breillat may have lost her objectivity. It's important to remember 
            that Breillat was born in 1948 - a key time that straddles two 
            schools of thought -the 1950's housewife morality and the 1960's 
            feminist movement. In between were few role models for young women - 
            maybe Jeanne Moreau, Jane Fonda or Vanessa Redgrave - but we all 
            know how the media excoriated them for their liberated ways and 
            outspokenness. <i>Fat Girl</i> is post-feminist, for sure, but all 
            it ultimately does, in its obviousness and shameless glee in lurid 
            leering at its pubescent girls and their fading mother, is taunt 
            that women are obliquely responsible for their own subjugation and 
            that women directors are just as willing to exploit other women as 
            their male counterparts.</font><br>
