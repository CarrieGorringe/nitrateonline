            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">James Mangold's first excursion 
            into romantic comedy, following his gritty, and critically 
            successful, dramas <i>Girl, Interrupted</i> and <i>Cop Land</i>, is 
            a semi-sweet, time-traveling, yuletide log. It may sit well on the 
            fire for two hours, but its love-struck ashes aren't anything to 
            keep up on the mantle, especially if you decide to dissect the 
            pot-holed script by Mangold and co-writer Steven Rogers (<i>Hope 
            Floats</i>). Meg Ryan is the cute, adorable, spunky-fresh woman that 
            she's gift-wrapped for audiences over the last decade. Formerly 
            opposite the likes of Billy Crystal (as Sally Albright in <i>When 
            Harry Met Sally</i>), Tom Hanks (Annie Reed in <i>Sleepless in 
            Seattle</i> and Kathleen Kelly in <i>You've Got Mail</i>), Tim 
            Robbins (Catherine Boyd in <i>I.Q.</i>), and Kevin Kline (Kate in <i>
            French Kiss</i>), she's basically back as the same blond-haired, 
            blue-eyed modern miss, again as a captivating Kiss Me Kate (of the 
            McKays of Massapequa). This time her foil is swoon-worthy Aussie 
            Hugh Jackman (the rugged Wolverine in <i>X-Men</i> and second-fiddle 
            Stanley Jobson in <i>Swordfish</i>), who's shed his body hair for a 
            more refined Victorian waistcoat and a graceful sense of 
            bewilderment and humor.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Much like the Empire State Building 
            was a cornerstone of <i>Sleepless in Seattle</i>, New York City's 
            Brooklyn Bridge lays the foundation in <i>Kate &amp; Leopold</i>, as the 
            film commences with a sepia-tinted August 28, 1876 ceremony 
            commemorating that structure's erection, a word that elicits a 
            nervous sexual giggle from Stuart Besser (Liev Schreiber), a time 
            traveler from 125 years hence. His period garb does nothing to hide 
            the inappropriate miniature camera, ballpoint pen, and swimmer's 
            goggles, all of which arouse the curiosity of Leopold (Jackman), the 
            third Duke of Albany and a budding inventor. A scale model prototype 
            of the present-day elevator indicates his scientific bent, and the 
            fact that Leopold's manservant is named Otis suggests a comic 
            now-you-know-who-I-named-it-after wink from the writers. This 
            thirty-something hunk, royally ashamed of his privileged life, is 
            also an ultra-eligible bachelor. His snooty uncle Millard (Paxton 
            Whitehead), anxious to restore the family's drained fortune, has 
            demanded his nephew announce his marital plans at midnight, 
            following a damsel-bedecked birthday ball showcasing the dour female 
            (yet abundantly wealthy) prospects available for the Duke's picking. 
            Hmmm, sounds like it's time for the nineteenth-century K-Mart Blue 
            Light special.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Which brings me to my first point 
            of distraction: why does this particular time traveling drama crunch 
            down its decisive moments to the chiming of the midnight bells? It 
            happens twice in <i>Kate &amp; Leopold</i>. Why is it that the stroke of 
            a new day is necessary for the temporal transportation process to 
            work? Personally I'd opt for the more believable 5:51 A.M., which 
            happens to be the moment that Kevin Spacey's Prot makes his own 
            intergalactic excursion in <i>K-PAX</i>.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Anyway, Stuart pops up at Uncle 
            Millard's downtown soirée and Leopold chases him our the door, up 
            the rain-drenched street, and off the bridge into the twenty-first s 
            century, whereupon the time-traipsing differences, and the 
            lonely-heart antics kick in. Stuart, who has unearthed a door to the 
            past &quot;by modern theories of weather prediction,&quot; is Kate's former 
            boyfriend, living upstairs in their apartment building. Miss McKay 
            is a savvy marketing exec with a lecherous boss (<span style="color:#333333">Bradley 
            Whitford)</span> and she's more than a little intrigued by the 
            suave, chivalrous, and out-of-his-element guest, left to fend for 
            himself in contemporary Manhattan when the city's elevators 
            mysteriously start to malfunction and Stuart is laid up for medical 
            and psychiatric reasons at a local hospital. One of Leopold's early 
            dilemmas involves the Big Apple's pooper-scooper laws.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Second bone to pick. As another in 
            a string of television series and films that highlight Macintosh 
            computers -- I've been a Apple user for over a decade, so I tend to 
            notice this phenomenon more than those of you using Windoze. -- it's 
            extremely depressing when the film glorifies or sports inside jokes 
            about these CPUs, while the script screws up the facts. Kate is 
            exasperated in her office when her G5 isn't working properly, except 
            that this next-generation chip hasn't yet been announced for any of 
            Apple's product line (although I'll bet it's forthcoming at Steve 
            Jobs' January 7 -- that's <b><i>2002</i></b> -- keynote at MacWorld. 
            As the film's release was pushed up from February 8th, that might 
            explains the G5 conundrum. Had the distributor stuck to its original 
            timetable, the G5 might be in Apple Stores by now, assuming I was 
            writing this in February, not December. Isn't time travel 
            confusing?).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Anyway, the film ambles along with 
            fish-out-of-water comic fanfare, and it's played lightly enough to 
            breeze along. Director Mangold clipped a few of the more ludicrous 
            plot elements just before the film's release, especially one about 
            Leopold's lineage. Two historical goofs that did make the final cut 
            involve crystal clear recollections/recitations by Leopold of <i>La 
            Boheme</i> and <i>The Pirates of Penzance</i>, caught just before he 
            journeyed through time. Puccini's opera was first performed in Turin 
            on February 1, <b><i>1896</i></b>, while Gilbert and Sullivan's 
            operetta opened London's <b><i>Opéra Comique</i></b> on April 3, <b>
            <i>1880</i></b>. Obviously, the trip to twenty-first-century 
            Manhattan had two local stops with ample time to memorize a few 
            lyrics and plot lines.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Eventually, the Duke lands a 
            temporary job selling Fat Free Farmer's Bounty, a diet margarine, 
            for Kate's firm. His truthfulness makes him a marvelous 
            spokesperson…until he tastes the stuff and likens it to saddle soap. 
            And while he and Kate fall madly for each other, he's got a return 
            ticket to the 1870s and a time tunnel to catch. Along for the 
            fantastic voyage is a fine supporting cast, especially some fine 
            comic moments from <i>Rat Race</i>'s Breckin Meyer as Kate's brother 
            Charlie. Spalding Gray, fresh from a brief appearance in <i>How High</i>, 
            does a brilliant bit as a psychiatrist.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Kate &amp; Leopold</i> won't win any 
            Academy Awards, although I'll bet that Sting's love song <i>Until…</i> 
            gets an Oscar nomination. The tune has already received a Golden 
            Globe nod, as well as Jackman's performance in a comedy or musical. 
            Ryan's beguiling charm and romantic vulnerabilities play well 
            against Jackman's Prince Charming. There you have it, it's only a 
            fairy tale.</font></td>
