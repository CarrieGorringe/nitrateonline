            2001</i></font>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Michael
            Cristofer's <i>Original Sin</i> begins with that cheapest of
            scene-setting devices, the antique map. Appearing under the opening
            credits and accompanied by sultry guitar strums, the map lets you
            know that the action will take place in a faraway time and place,
            that is, Cuba<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(actually,
            the film was shot in Mexico) circa 1880, when women wore long white
            dresses and men rode horses. So now you know: you're in for some
            bodice-ripping. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            map also introduces the journey undertaken by protagonist and
            narrator Julia Russell (played by Angelina Jolie -- and if I hear
            one more film reviewer refer to her luscious-pouty-full-seductive
            lips, I'll jump out a window; please, gentlemen, take note: <b><i>many</i></b>
            non-Caucasian women have similar lips, and have had them for
            centuries). Like most journeys in movies that begin with antique
            maps under the credits, Julia's is both internal (from bad to good,
            or at least somewhat redeemed) and external (from Delaware to Cuba).
            She tells -- or rather, confesses, to a priest (Mario Ivan Martinez)
            -- her story, remembering in breathy detail how she came to be
            inside a gloomy prison cell. Alas and alack. It's not long before
            you learn that pale-and-still-lovely Julia is about to be executed,
            because she's done something really, really... really terrible. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;This
            is not a love story,&quot; she informs the rapt priest,
            dead-seriously. &quot;But it is a story about love... You cannot
            walk away from love.&quot; It appears that this particular line is
            included so as to provide rationale for Gloria Estefan's
            soundtrack-enhancing single, &quot;You Can't Walk Away From
            Love,&quot; but it's lame just the same. Julia massages such mawkish
            language with an intermittent accent (sort of Euro-Brit, by way of
            Madonna during her Girlie Show days), the story she tells is as
            tawdry and silly as they come. The film doesn't actually flash back
            to her woeful, parentless childhood (developing a co-dependency with
            an evil little boy, a fellow &quot;foundling&quot;), but she makes a
            few vague references to abuses and tragedies, while looking daintily
            pained. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            flashbacks proper begin with Julia's arrival in Cuba, as a
            mail-order bride ordered by a coffee baron named Luis Vargas
            (Antonio Banderas). Immediately, she must explain why she doesn't
            look a thing like the photo she sent along with her application
            letter. She says she didn't want him to want her just because she
            &quot;has a pretty face.&quot; Luis not only <b><i>believes</i></b>
            her, but marries her half a day later and then tells her that it's
            okay if she doesn't want to have sex with him, open the big trunk
            she brought with her from America, or explain why she breaks the
            neck of the little tweety-bird in a cage that she's brought all the
            way from Delaware. That Luis, he's just so sensitive-male. And
            stupid. Incredibly stupid. And so, I say, he deserves everything he
            gets from this moment forward. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">What
            he gets is lots of grief, along with splendiferous sex shot from
            overhead so you can see both beautiful movie star bodies interlocked
            in various poses, and then from artful closer angles, so you can see
            their exquisite body parts -- worked-out chest and sun-tanned
            thighs, delicate profile and heaving breasts, etc. -- in all their
            luminously perspiring perfection. &quot;And it's not just the
            imagery that's campy. Check out the dialogue: &quot;I am someone
            else with you,&quot; declares the valiant Luis. &quot;Someone more
            like myself.&quot; Beat. She responds in her voice over, &quot;And
            there in his arms, I became someone else,&quot; getting her
            confessor increasingly hot and bothered. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Well,
            yes, you know where this is going. Luis appears to have one friend
            in Cuba, his business partner Alan (Australian actor Jack Thompson
            doing a broadly U.S. Suthuhn accent), who warns him that he's
            becoming obsessed with the wife (Alan also lays out one of those
            preposterous bad-movie aphorisms, this one concerning the difference
            between love and lust: for the first, you want to give all, for the
            second, you want to take all). Then, when Julia inevitably turns out
            not to be who she said she was and runs off with all his money, Luis
            is comforted by wise black servant-lady, Sara (Joan Pringle), who
            asserts, in appropriately foreboding tone, &quot;You were married to
            a dream, a dream that stole your soul!&quot; Um, cue timpani drum
            roll. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Indeed,
            Luis decides he must avenge himself against this dream, a point he
            makes while waving a pistol, after a few days spent screwing and
            drinking himself into a stubbly-faced stupor at the local brothel
            (where all the women look like supermodels). Lucky for Luis, he's
            assisted in this endeavor by an obviously skeezy private
            investigator from the States, Walter Downs (Thomas Jane). Luis, ever
            the dupe, enlists Walter's help to track Julia (real name Bonny) to
            Havana, where, inevitably, the scene is infused with
            &quot;Carnival&quot; decadence, translated visually as hallucinatory
            dissolves and doubled images. Luis finds Bonny, they struggle for a
            second, then fall into bed. The problem from here on, according to
            Julia/Bonny's narration, is that she neither can compromise enough
            to survive in the other's world -- his too moralistic and
            privileged, hers too greedy and distrustful. He's a respected
            businessman and she is, as one of her former associates points out,
            so very dramatically, &quot;a whore!&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            rest of the film -- which goes on for far too long -- explains how
            this inability to compromise leads to Julia/Bonny's stint on death
            row. Based on <i>Waltz Into Darkness</i>, the same Cornell Woolrich
            novel that Francois Truffaut used as inspiration for his infinitely
            more fun <i>Mississippi Mermaid</i> (1969), Cristofer's script is
            inept in most every way. Initially slated for release last November,
            <i>Original Sin</i> has been shelved for months, as MGM pondered
            what to do with it. It's a good bet that they figured the stars of <i>Lara
            Croft</i> and <i>Spy Kids</i> might be help recoup costs. But if
            it's easy to see what's wrong in <i>Original Sin</i> -- from the
            florid dialogue and disconnected narrative to the unsympathetic
            characters and lavish settings -- it's more difficult to decipher
            why Jolie and Banderas are shilling it on talk shows (like Letterman
            and Larry King), pretending that it's a serious movie. I'm kidding:
            everyone knows it's their job to do this. But really, the gig is up.
            <i>Original Sin</i> is expensive, trashy melodrama. And everyone
            knows it.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
