            review by <a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>, 12 October

            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Opposites attract, sometimes 
            making for interesting movies. In the old-versus-young-odd-couple 
            sub-genre, social and cultural beliefs, embellished by good 
            direction, writing, and acting, can make such a film (or any film) 
            rise or fall. <i>Ghost World</i>, still playing after great critical 
            response and well-deserved positive word of mouth, is the cinematic 
            torch bearer in this year's generational battlefield. One of my 
            favorites in this category is 1972's <i>Harold and Maude</i>, a 
            black comedy involving an offbeat relationship between two people 
            (Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon) separated by sixty years. <i>My First 
            Mister</i>, distinguished actress Christine Lahti's feature 
            directorial debut (she won an Oscar five years ago for her short 
            film <i>Lieberman in Love</i>) starts off with similar hope, not to 
            mention a titular nod to <i>My Fair Lady</i>, one of the most 
            beloved cross-generational movies of the 1960s, but suffers from a 
            touch too much structure and a script (by Jill Franklyn, co-writer 
            of the &quot;Yada Yada&quot; episode of <i>Seinfeld</i>) that pedals a tad too 
            hard on sentimentality. The direction is determined, straight 
            forward and occasionally fanciful, but not especially ambitious or 
            daring. On its surface, <i>Mister</i>'s life-affirming story bears a 
            strikingly similarity to the forthcoming <i>Life as a House</i>, as 
            it deals with the fatal struggle between an lonesome adult and a 
            nihilistic child. Both are tear-jerking weepers (<i>House</i> 
            demanding a few more hankies), defying you to hold back the tears.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The most surprising revelation of 
            the film is a breakthrough performance by Leelee Sobieski. Her 
            china-doll features and blonde locks are matted down behind a grim, 
            goth appearance of dark clothing, purple-tinged black hair, metal 
            piercings impregnating her face, and heavy black makeup clouding her 
            eyes. Is this the same Leelee concurrently starring in <i>Joy Ride</i> 
            and <i>The Glass House</i>? Well, yes, but here she's nearly 
            unrecognizable on the surface. And just below her character's 
            exterior lurks an aggravating case of low self-esteem and deathly 
            obsession, so obvious from the black cat, graveyard visits, Anne 
            Rice books, and bloody/skeletal images that haunt her household 
            prison. Jennifer Anna Wilson is some teenagers' dream and every 
            parent's nightmare.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;J&quot; lives a lonesome, stultifying 
            existence with her ditsy, Partridge-Family mom (Carol Kane) and her 
            toupee-bedecked dullard stepfather (Michael McKean). Lacking other 
            alternatives, she occasionally crushes lit cigarettes on her arms. 
            Having just graduated high school, she's in need a job to escape the 
            dreary home life that exacerbates her delicate position, but a 
            haunting appearance and gruff bedside manner make her job hunting 
            quest a predictable experience. Until she finds an unlikely kindred, 
            lonesome spirit at Rutherfords, an upscale menswear store at the 
            Century City mall. There, paunchy forty-nine-year-old sad sack 
            Randall (&quot;R&quot;) is encased in his own invisible armor of loveless, 
            day-to-day drudgery. Albert Brooks offers his usual, droll wit in 
            this role, dishing off sarcastic comments with a refined glee at the 
            newly hired clerk. His young assistant battles back with barbs of 
            her own, &quot;happy is f*cking over-rated,&quot; and a newly-found dedicated 
            work ethic that will push her out of the stockroom and into her 
            boss's heart. A peculiar friendship is thus born and the two 
            mismatched comrades in depression find solace flossing away the 
            plaque-filled enamel covering their distraught souls. &quot;J&quot; cleans up 
            her outer shell to a single nose pin (the &quot;removal&quot; sequence shown 
            in excruciating closeup), while &quot;R&quot; starts reading <i>Seventeen</i>, 
            volunteers to get a (small) tattoo, and lets the youngster help him 
            break down his phobic defenses.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ultimately, Randall's big secret is 
            outed (I won't spill the beans) and Jennifer becomes preoccupied in 
            doing the right thing, including finding redemption and reassurance 
            in those that had tried to be close to her and some (including her 
            pot-smoking, long-haired hippie father, played by John Goodman, and 
            Mary Kay Place as a nurse with a heart of gold) who have not. The 
            last third of the film is as manipulative as the screenplay demands 
            it to be, although the humor and its often deadpan delivery helps to 
            stem the flow of tears.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The heroic pairing of Brooks and 
            Sobieski is a magical monument to Lahti's tender care in handling 
            actors; the sappy excesses of the script dooms this indie effort 
            from Paramount Classics to art house curiosity item.</font></td>
