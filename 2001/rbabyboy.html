            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>John
            Singleton's new movie begins with a bang. But it's not the sort of
            bang you'd expect from the guy whose first film was the earnest <i>Boyz
            N the Hood</i> (1991), or whose last, the explosive <i>Shaft</i>
            (2000), had its Armani clad protagonist declaring, &quot;It's
            Giuliani time!&quot; as he stalked off to blow away a few bad cops.
            The first bang in <i>Baby Boy</i> inverts such machismo. A narrator
            lays out the theory that African American males are infantalized,
            oppressed by racism, overprotected by their mamas, never encouraged
            to take on adult responsibilities, but instead to be angry about
            what they don't have. Seemingly content to stay back, they call
            their friends their &quot;boys&quot; and their homes their
            &quot;cribs.&quot; The film's initial image graphically backs up the
            claim: 20 year old protagonist Jody (singer-model-vj-first
            time-actor Tyrese Gibson) is inside a womb, where he's imagining
            himself curled up and fetal. But instead of feeling protected, he's
            about to be aborted. You hear the blood pumping, medical machines
            beeping, and then a woman crying, &quot;I don't want to kill my
            baby.&quot;</b> <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Bang.
            The scene cuts to Jody, eating candy and waiting on the sidewalk
            outside a clinic. His girlfriend Yvette (Taraji P. Henson) emerges,
            distraught after her abortion. She's grieving, he's frustrated, and
            both are feeling hurt and inarticulate. And so Jody<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </span>who already has one child with Yvette, a son named Joe Joe<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>slams out the door to visit his second babymama,
            Peanut (Tamara Bass), still living at home with her Mercedes driving
            mother, who helps look after her and Jody's daughter. When this
            encounter with his little boo is less than comforting, Jody heads
            home at last, where he finds his mother Juanita (A. J. Johnson) hard
            at work in her garden to be, planning where she'll put her collards,
            cabbage, and sage, and her awning from Home Depot, and not paying
            nearly enough attention to her baby boy. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">You
            see how it is. Jody's a stereotypical manchild, a neighborhood kid
            who never went anywhere, but instead hangs out, selling weed for
            spending money, clubbing on the weekends. Surrounded by women, he
            dotes on his mama and dogs his lovers, unable to make a commitment
            or keep a job, but fronting as if he's got it all together. This I'm
            a man performance is shaken to the core when Juanita's new boyfriend
            Melvin (Ving Rhames) shows up: introduced by a slow camera just
            inching along his well muscled, tattooed arm, Melvin is a serious
            force to be reckoned with. A former gangsta, Melvin now owns his own
            landscaping business; he treats Juanita right and wonders aloud at
            Jody's lack of ambition. Immediately, Jody's afraid, and starts
            pestering Juanita: is she gonna kick him out like she did his
            brother (who wound up dead by gang violence)? Can't she get over her
            infatuation with Melvin and find herself &quot;one of them L7
            boyfriends&quot;? Or better, can't she get back to doing what she's
            always done, look after little Jody? <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Of
            course, Jody's fears are real enough -- he lives in a dangerous
            world (he has repeated visions of himself dead by gunfire), he lacks
            skills and direction, and he can't compete with Melvin when it comes
            to pleasing his young and good-looking mama (she had Jody when she
            was 16, and so she is, as she puts it, eager to start living her
            &quot;own life&quot; now). Jody's youth manifests itself in his
            inability to make decisions and ability to distract himself. &quot;I
            fuck other females from time to time. I don't know why, I just do
            it,&quot; he whines to Yvette during an argument. But, he adds,
            &quot;Because I love your ass, I lie to you. Because I care about
            you.&quot; He's surprised that she doesn't get this reasoning.
            Tooling around the hood in Yvette's car because he doesn't have one,
            he spends his days flitting from one girlfriend's house to another,
            picking up Yvette from work, playing with Joe-Joe (&quot;You a
            future shot-caller!&quot;), repairing bicycles for a few local kids
            (all much younger than he is), building model cars in his bedroom,
            and hanging out with his jobless buddy Sweet Pea (Cuba's brother,
            Omar Gooding). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still,
            Jody has a vague sense that something's not quite right. Hanging
            with Sweet Pea in a liquor store parking lot, he looks out on the
            traffic passing him by and spreads his arms wide. &quot;Today I
            begin a new life,&quot; he says. &quot;Everybody moving is making
            money.&quot; It's all about commerce, and if the world is divided
            between buyers and sellers, he declares, &quot;I'm gonna be a
            seller.&quot; Seeing that selling low level street drugs is not the
            most effective means to improving his situation, Jody takes up
            selling stolen dresses. Seeking advice from Juanita and her
            girlfriend (Queen of Comedy Mo'Nique Imes-Jackson), he learns that
            even this business can be fraught with compromises and difficulties,
            as the women offer different suggestions concerning the
            &quot;average&quot; dress size (somewhere between 6 and 16). Scenes
            like this one -- small, warm, seemingly inconsequential -- appear
            throughout <i>Baby Boy</i>, underlining that the process of becoming
            a man has everything to do with respecting women. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">To
            this end, Yvette, whose introduction at the clinic is anything but
            cursory, develops into an increasingly complicated and engaging
            character. This despite the fact that on the surface, she resembles
            just about every movie &quot;girl in the hood,&quot; and the movie
            initially makes fun of her strutting and head-rolling. Her
            relationship with Jody is passionate and intricate, and not only
            because she's an alternately independent and uncertain woman tangled
            up with an alternately big-hearted and selfish player. Their
            complexity as a couple is aided immeasurably by the performances by
            Tyrese and Henson, both charismatic, selfless actors who bring
            unexpected nuances to Jody and Yvette's dreads and desires. During
            one make-up sex scene (after a particularly painful fight), their
            exchange is believably fraught with trepidation -- he of losing her,
            she of staying with him. The film cuts to images of their joint
            fears, of marriage and Jody's death, a montage that comes so quickly
            that it's hard to parse exactly who's afraid of what. She's fearful
            that her man, so violent and unthinking, will come to a bad end;
            he's afraid that if he doesn't act the part of being violent and
            unthinking, that he will indeed come to precisely that same bad end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At
            the same time, both Yvette and Jody are afraid of commitment -- it
            requires sincerity, self-knowledge, and above all, maturity. While
            it's clear that she's a little farther along than he is on this
            road, both have reasons to resist actually coming to terms with
            themselves and one another. This fear of commitment (perhaps another
            word for adulthood) is exacerbated by the arrival of Yvette's ex, a
            convict named Rodney (Snoop Dogg, in a smooth performance that's
            part comic and part ominous). When he's released from prison, Rodney
            immediately parks himself on her sofa, and begins to conduct homeboy
            business as usual, expecting that she will capitulate to his sexual
            entreaties. Though Yvette resists, Rodney too is a baby boy who's
            used to getting what he wants. Jody's unable to read the situation
            through his own jealous haze, which leads to a crisis and the
            necessity of Jody taking action he's ill-prepared to take. At times
            like this, the plot is plainly lurching. Still, it comes up with
            images that are consistently involving, provocative, and insightful.
            Singleton has developed a mostly-acute sense of how to use the
            camera to conjure emotional situations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>&nbsp;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">He
            has also lightened up -- the comedic scenes in <i>Baby Boy</i> are
            subtle and ironic, as when Jody attempts to cheat on Yvette with one
            of her coworkers and can't bring himself to do it. The coworker --
            named Pandora (Tawny Dahl), of all things -- comes on strong, with
            aroma therapy candles and skimpy lingerie at her apartment (point
            being: he's managed to get himself there, no matter how
            &quot;good&quot; he thinks he is). Jody stammers and fumbles.
            Finally pushing past her at the door, he offers a standard
            &quot;girl's&quot; excuse, &quot;I can't do this.&quot; He surprises
            himself, at last. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jody's
            other turning points also have to do with man-making rituals that
            don't turn out the way he expects. When Yvette takes back her car
            and he's reduced to riding around town on his elaborately
            tricked-out bicycle, he learns a few hard lessons having to do with
            maturity, property, and respect. One of his little kid pals steals
            the bike and he can only get revenge by bringing Sweet Pea around,
            who gladly acts the psycho-fool to scare all the whimpering
            14-year-olds. When this obviously unfair beat-down doesn't satisfy,
            Jody realizes that has to rethink what he's doing; he has to make a
            change. Alternately overbearing and deft, somber and funny, <i>Baby
            Boy</i> is, in the end, all about that realization.
