            filmmaker Doris Dörrie has had a checkered past with American
            audiences. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Men (Männer)</i>
            clicked with the art house circuit when New Yorker Films released it
            back in the mid-'80s, but her English-language <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Me
            and Him</i> in 1987 was as flaccid as the talking penis that starred
            in it opposite (or under) Griffin Dunne. Unless you've caught her
            films at a festival or such, finding one of her dozen or so titles
            at your local or not-so-local cineplex has been a challenging
            affair. Directing from her own scripts, her comedies border the dark
            side and her latest effort, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Enlightenment
            Guaranteed (Erleuchtung Garantuert)</i>, fits in her quirky mode,
            blending social commentary, midlife crises, road movies, and Zen
            concepts. Think of it as a Buddhist <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Sullivan's
            Travels</i> featuring a couple of German fish in Japanese waters.
            It's subtly amusing and an amusingly upbeat exploration of
            relationships, in this case two brothers with disparate personal
            failures in search of spiritual cleansing. All familiar territory
            found in this filmmaker's cupboard. The road to that peaceful end is
            cluttered with misplaced signposts in a city far from home.<o:p>

            Goldberg's Capitol Entertainment, the only remaining theatrical
            distributor in the Washington, D.C., area, has released the film
            here (it also handles <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Autumn
            Sun</i>, a heartwarming Spanish/Argentinian gem now available on VHS
            and DVD) in the States, and the hometown market is the first to
            commercially feast on his latest pickup. Having screened at Filmfest
            DC 2000, the film is now in theatrical release at the popular
            Visions Cinema/Bistro/Lounge, a welcome oasis in a town begging for
            independent and foreign product. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Enlightenment
            Guaranteed</i> is just the sort of off-the-beaten-path entry that
            local audiences should appreciate at that venue.<o:p>

            the movie on digital video gives the independently made film a
            desaturated, documentary look. The cast, many veterans associated
            with the director on her earlier projects, add their own
            professionally realistic touches, helped somewhat by the decision to
            use all their given names as their role names. This is also Dörrie's
            first fiction piece using the new media, which allowed her lowered
            costs (a bare $1 million budget) and a innovative challenge. (&quot;</span>I
            would like to make a film where the crew could all fit into one car,
            or even better, all sit at a dining table together.&quot;) She
            pushes the technical envelope right from the start, opening with a
            late night, outdoor, wintry sequence, lit by ghostly golden lanterns
            dotting the countryside. We're introduced to Uwe, Petra and their
            boys, singing amid the snow drifts. Any illusion of family harmony
            is short lived, dissolving with the morning sun as the hyperactive
            kids wear down their sleep-deprived, overwrought dad. This
            ultra-focused seller of kitchen furnishings escapes for a jog to
            rattle his brain back into shape, his obvious indifference to his
            failing family unit noticed only by the crows circling overhead and
            a certain look in Petra's eyes. Meanwhile Gustav, a balding Zen
            Buddhist immersed as a <b><i>feng shui</i></b> consultant and
            devotee of Eastern disciplines, prepares himself for an extended
            retreat at a Japanese monastery. The two story lines ultimately
            converge when it's revealed the men are brothers, and the wretchedly
            despondent and drunken Uwe, his apartment ransacked by his wife,
            convinces his sibling to take him along at the last minute rather
            than face an empty home.<o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The frantic pace (and editing) of
            Germany relaxes as the men start their bonding sessions upon arrival
            in Tokyo, with a brief stopover in one of the city's hotels. But a
            funny thing happens on the way to the Sojij Monastery, with that
            omnipresent crow hovering nearby, perhaps a secret admirer or a
            hidden symbol. Uwe realizes his bed's too short for his large frame,
            but he doesn't know that will be the least of his worries. The men
            hit the town a-running, using neon billboards as markers to
            presumably later retrace their steps back to their temporary digs.
            They are quickly cast adrift in a land of foreign tongues, as the
            billboards go dark and they soak up more than a few beers that dim
            their bearings. Quintessential strangers in a strange land. One of
            them manages to capture most of their confusion with a video camera,
            focusing on their increasingly desperate nature. They struggle with
            a Hello Kitty ATM machine, call home to Gustav's wife, who's too
            busy having a good time in his absence to give a rat's ass about his
            financial condition. Briefly taken to homelessness, they find
            shelter in cardboard boxes among the rest of the city's dregs, their
            pangs of hunger forcing sad dog looks through glassed-in eateries.
            They steal, they beg, and eventually find the kindness of strangers
            in a blond Teutonic angel, Anica, who recognizes them as lost
            puppies and helps them on their way to the last third of the film
            and the no-frills accommodations at that monastery in Monzen. The
            stark life and rigors of meditation, prayer, mopping, and other
            daily rituals takes it toll on Gustav with his bad feet, while it is<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>surprisingly welcomed by his unbelieving brother. It is a
            slow-paced existence, for the men and for the audience, but broadens
            their tolerance to life's hectic swiftness. No doubt they'll find
            contentment sweeping leaves for many a year to follow.<o:p>

            allow some of us here in America to catch some of Dörrie's earlier,
