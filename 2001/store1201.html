font-family:Verdana">OK, so the three-disc rule is violated right off the bat.
But the array of historically significant musical talent on display in this
remarkable, four-hour PBS special (on two discs) warrants its inclusion. From
the early influences of such pivotal acts as the Carter Family and Thomas Dorsey
through western swing, urban blues, the 1960s folk boom, zydeco and much more,
“American Roots Music” has the same strengths and drawbacks as Ken Burns’
“Jazz”: the program will serve to introduce a whole new generation to the
glorious American musical heritage, but the clips are largely incomplete and the
timeline is by its very nature selective and theme-oriented. Producers Jim Brown
and Sam Pollard may in fact have been inspired by the phenomenal sales of the <i>O
Brother Where Art Thou?</i> soundtrack, but the program swells well beyond that
to demonstrate just how unique the blending of diverse musical styles has become
-- a distinctly American music made up of tangible European and African
influences, tempered by the currents of social change. Without exception, the
mastering job on the clips is superlative, even when the source material is
weak. Each of the two DVDs in the set features three bonus uncut performances
from Bob Wills, Earl Scruggs, Doc Watson, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Steve Riley and
Valerio Longoria. For the more inquisitive, there’s also a book, CD box set
(with 75 complete tracks) and single CD distillation to accompany the series.

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana"><font size="2">Long before his incarnations 
as Mr. Bean or his turn as Father Gerald <i>in Four Weddings and a Funeral</i>, 
Rowan Atkinson shot to stardom as a succession of conniving yet inept Blackadder 
men who bumble their way through British history under the illusion of crafty 
ambition (“I have a cunning plan…” inevitably leads to disaster, or at least 
acute embarrassment). The first series, broadcast on the BBC in 1983, was 
co-written by Atkinson and Richard Curtis (who later wrote -- surprise -- <i>
Four Weddings and a Funeral</i>); Ben Elton was brought in to spell Atkinson for 
the subsequent seasons. The program was so popular that the original six 
episodes were followed two years later by a half-dozen more set in Elizabethan 
England. “Blackadder the Third” was made in 1987 and set in the late 18<sup>th</sup> 
Century, while 1989’s clutch of six, “Blackadder Goes Forth,” took place in the 
trenches of World War One. Available in the United States for years on a 
seemingly endless series of videocassettes, the sturdy and stylish new BBC DVD 
collection, distributed by Warner Bros., collects all twenty-four half-hour 
episodes on five discs (do the math). The generous supplements include all three 
separate TV specials created through the years, the rare fifteen-minute Oliver 
Cromwell-era episode, the 1999 time-travel reunion “Blackadder Back and Forth” 
and its seventeen-minute production featurette. Additionally, there’s an 
invaluable reference work called “Historical Footnotes,” a half-hour interview 
with Curtis, a singalong to the catchy title song, and a who’s who of the cast 
and writers narrated by the one and only Tony Robinson, who played Blackadder’s 
long-suffering servant Baldrick. Technically, the video transfer is just OK, but 
it’s the content that counts here.&nbsp; Incredibly, the region one “Black Adder” 
boxed set precedes the British edition by a good four or five months, with the 
region 2 set not due until November. Consumers willing to take the economic 
plunge are urged to invest in the boxed set over the individual seasons, thereby 
saving a chunk of change. Although it sure helps, you don’t need to know your 
English history to appreciate “Black Adder”, along with the now-available “Monty 
Python’s Flying Circus” and the hotly-anticipated “Fawlty </font></span>

font-family:Verdana">By 1933, the stellar career of 38-year-old comedian Joseph
Frank “Buster” Keaton was for all practical purposes over, the genius of
such groundbreaking and beloved silent triumphs as <i>Sherlock Jr.,</i> <i>Seven
Chances</i> and the immortal <i>The General</i> eclipsed by poor business
decisions, drink and the advent of sound. This sad historical fact is the
inspiration behind “Keaton Plus,” an eye-opening new bonus disc available
exclusively with the purchase of the essential 11-volume Kino on Video box set.
The box itself has been available for a couple of years now, and collects
Keaton’s 11 features and a selection of 19 short subjects in one place.
“Keaton Plus” charts the Great Stone Face’s determination to work,
presenting him in such varied material as short films (including the
newly-discovered 1921 gem <i>Hard Luck</i>), “This is Your Life,” home
movies, short-lived television vehicles, educational short films and commercials
(“Simon Pure -- The Happier, Hoppier Beer”). Orson Welles cites “the
extraordinary beauty of Keaton’s face” in a series of 1970s-era
introductions filmed by the likes of Gloria Swanson and Lillian Gish for TV
revivals of his work. Alas, neither the Samuel Beckett-authored 22-minute 1965
comeback vehicle <i>Film </i>or Keaton’s various big-screen cameos (<i>A Funny
Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum</i>, <i>Beach Blanket Bingo</i>) made the
cut -- rights challenges, undoubtedly -- but a 32-minute fragment of the
never-completed 1962 musical <i>Ten Girls Ago</i> is here, along with Keaton’s
first dramatic role for television (“The Awakening,” from 1954). At nearly
four hours, “Keaton Plus” is a goldmine, and the box itself is not only
essential viewing but a cornerstone of any comprehensive DVD collection.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">The central conceit of 
the <i>Die Hard</i> franchise is that New York detective John McLane (Bruce 
Willis) is a magnet for trouble, from a bunch of thieves masquerading as 
well-dressed terrorists to a Christmas holiday airport crisis and a criminal 
mastermind out for revenge. By the time Willis made the first installment of 
this groundbreaking big-budget Hollywood action series -- easily as important to 
moviegoers’ box office preferences in the 1980s as <i>Jaws</i> had been in the 
1970s -- the star had already made two high-profile missteps in his move from 
television’s popular “Moonlighting” program to the big screen, <i>Blind Date</i> 
and <i>Sunset</i> (both directed by Blake Edwards and both instantly 
forgettable). But with its combination of precision filmmaking, courtesy of 
director John McTiernan, and its almost improvisational approach to the 
high-stakes game of cat-and-mouse played within a Los Angeles skyscraper on 
Christmas Eve, <i>Die Hard</i> was a fast-paced original: a witty, violent riff 
on that Hollywood mainstay, the caper movie, that actually had something new to 
say about greed, pluck and suspense. Renny Harlin’s underrated middle title is a 
bit too long but contains some terrific action set-pieces of its own, while 
McTiernan’s return to the franchise is highlighted by the tense but very funny 
interplay between Willis and Samuel L. Jackson. The eye-catching six-disc box 
set from Twentieth Century Fox Home Entertainment endows each disc with a 
plethora of extras, including director commentary tracks (McTiernan and 
production designer Jackson De Govia compare the original to everything from 
Shakespeare to Stanislavsky), deleted scenes, production featurettes and even 
the ability to re-edit selected sequences. And of course the films themselves 
are restored to the diamond-hard letterboxed crispness of the originals.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Among the psycho 
killers, rogue cops, terrorists and assorted lowlifes in and around San 
Francisco, dedicated but defiant cop “Dirty” Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) 
dispenses justice on his own terms. Usually mentioned in the same breath as such 
pivotal landmarks of screen violence as <i>Bonnie and Clyde</i>, <i>The Wild 
Bunch</i> and <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>, <i>Dirty Harry</i> enters the new 
millennium as a virtual blueprint for the urban cop thriller. The film was 
famously assailed as a “right-wing fantasy” by critic Pauline Kael in 1971, but 
in truth the success of the franchise seemed to tap into a certain helplessness 
and discontent felt during a time of social upheaval. Seen today the series 
parodies itself with defiant wit after the second installment (which was written 
by Michael Cimino and John Milius), as if Eastwood himself grew tired of the 
whole concept but was unwilling or unable to walk away from such a lucrative 
franchise (and why 1984’s dark and provocative <i>Tightrope</i> wasn’t retooled 
as a series entry remains a mystery to this day). Warner Bros. has done a 
remarkable job of restoring each title; Bruce Surtees’ widescreen lensing of the 
original has never looked better, and Lalo Schifrin’s jazzy, concussive score, 
while strongly imitating the composer’s own work for the “Mission: Impossible” 
television program, mixes jazz fusion and what was then called “hard rock” 
elements in inventive ways. Only the first three titles have any extra material, 
and most of that is vintage production reels. But the <i>Dirty Harry</i> disc 
itself features a a very witty half-hour overview of the franchise from director 
Jerry Hogrewe in which Robert Urich (a featured player in <i>Magnum Force</i>) 
postulates on “What it All Means” (“one man and one very large gun,” he says 
almost wistfully) as a parade of participants behind and in front of the camera 
relate their experiences working with Clint (no, Jim Carrey, who plays a 
wigged-out rock star in <i>The Dead Pool</i>, doesn’t make an appearance). 
Scored, for some reason, to Iron Butterfly’s “In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida,” it’s one of 
the freshest and most irreverent tribute docs of its kind. Each film is 
available separately or in this reasonably priced box. Not part of the set but 
worth seeking out is the new Warners release <i>Clint Eastwood: Out of the 
Shadows</i>, filmmaker Bruce Ricker’s American Masters/BBC documentary on the 
actor-director’s long and storied career.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">A key figure in the 
annals of European art cinema, Copenhagen-born filmmaker Carl Theodor Dreyer 
(1889-1968) began writing intertitles and scripts in 1912 and made his first 
movie six years later. From the beginning his films were a unique blend of 
documentary-like realism and an almost palpable spirituality, a synergy perhaps 
most apparent in his monumental 1927 drama <i>The Passion of Joan of Arc</i>. 
Now, courtesy of the visionary DVD distributor The Criterion Collection, three 
of Dreyer’s key films and an insightful posthumous documentary on the filmmaker 
and his methods are available to the consumer. <i>Day of Wrath</i> was filmed 
during the Nazi occupation of Denmark, and its story of fear in the face of 
repression resonates with allegory. Perhaps a delayed reaction to his own 
unhappy childhood, <i>Ordet</i> is generally considered to be Dreyer’s towering 
achievement, a cold, clear look at the eternal conflict between organized 
religion and private beliefs set against the tensions between two rural 
families. <i>Gertrud </i>was Dreyer’s final film, and stars Nina Pens Rode as a 
woman who leaves her husband in search of emotional fulfillment. All of the 
titles look splendid, and the generous extras include detailed essays and a 
thick booklet accompanying the documentary (outtakes from which supplement each 
feature). Available individually or as the set, these are challenging films 
whose rewards become apparent only after contemplation, an important addition to 
any collection of world cinema. Criterion also offers a 1999 pressing of <i>The 
Passion of Joan of Arc</i>, a film with such a troubled history of neglect that 
the current restoration is nothing short of a miracle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Back in Moscow in 1936 
after the emotionally exhausting collapse of the <i>Qué Viva México!</i> project 
(Kino on Video’s new DVD of the reconstructed film was reviewed in the April 
column), director Sergei Eisenstein suffered further indignities when his first 
sound film, <i>Bezhin Meadow</i> (1935-1937) -- indeed, his first work since 
1929’s <i>The Old and the New -- </i>was derailed by the director’s illness and 
a perceived violation of the Socialist Realism party line. By the time his 
assignment to the historical epic <i>Alexander Nevsky</i> rolled around, 
Eisenstein was in dire need of the Russian version of a box office hit. Operatic 
in scale and vivid in its thirty-minute ice battle, <i>Nevsky </i>delivered with 
its “symphonic structure” of the thirteenth-century hero’s repelling of a German 
invasion, set to a stirring score by long-time collaborator Sergei Prokofiev. 
Sailing into his final film on the wave of that success, Eisenstein once again 
became bogged down by health problems and official censorship in a mammoth, 
three-part biography of sixteenth-century Russian unifier Czar Ivan IV. <i>Ivan 
the Terrible: Part I</i> was a great popular success, part two was rushed and 
disliked by Stalin, and part three was never finished; Eisenstein died of a 
heart attack on February 11, 1948-19 days after his fiftieth birthday. Remedying 
the availability of numerous inferior video and DVD copies over the years, The 
Criterion Collection has finally delivered its long-promised “Eisenstein: The 
Sound Years” three-disc boxed set, and it was worth the wait. Both transfers 
were created on a high-definition Spirit Datacine from new 35mm composite 
fine-grain master positives struck expressly for the imprint by Mosfilm, and 
each enclosed brochure is built around an essay by critic J. Hoberman. The <i>
Nevsky</i> disc features a first-rate commentary by film scholar David Bordwell, 
a restoration demonstration, the reconstructed <i>Bezhin Meadow</i> and more. 
The <i>Ivan the Terrible</i> discs include deleted scenes, two multimedia essays 
by noted scholars and an electronic portfolio of production stills and drawings. 
A building block in the collection of any serious cineaste, “Eisenstein: The 
Sound Years” is a DVD set to watch, learn from and live with. Note to Criterion 
completists: as per their catalogue, the boxed set itself is #86 in the series, 
Alexander Nevsky is #87 and the two-disc Ivan the Terrible set is #88.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">If there exists a more 
laugh-out-loud funny and unrelentingly inventive example of emotional 
dysfunction than John Cleese’s immortal creation, the petty and perpetually 
distressed British innkeeper Basil Fawlty, such a creature has yet to achieve 
the cult status of this much-cherished television series (recently voted by the 
Brits themselves as the best program they’ve ever made). Finally collected on 
three discs, the mere twelve produced episodes of “Fawlty Towers” look better 
than they ever did on whichever public television station you first saw them on 
or their previous incarnation on VHS tape. The Warners/BBC Video set includes 
interviews with series regulars Cleese, Prunella Scales and Andrew Sachs (but 
not, mysteriously, with Cleese’s ex-wife and co-writer Connie Booth); a mere 
ninety seconds of outtakes; a dryly funny documentary explaining the real-life 
inspiration for Basil at an existing hotel in the seaside resort town of Torquay; 
cast info; thematic assemblages of comic highlights (“How to Manage Your Staff” 
is one); and a few directors’ commentary tracks from John Howard Davies and Bob 
Spiers that are funny in their own right but very poorly recorded. Entertainment 
Weekly has called the series “the Sistine Chapel of sitcoms,” an assessment that 
may sound hyperbolic but in fact nails the comedic craft and unfathomable 
influence of “Fawlty Towers.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Gruff cop “Popeye” 
Doyle (Gene Hackman) breaks a French heroin ring after a daring series of 
cat-and-mouse games on the streets of New York City (<i>The French Connection</i>) 
and Marseilles (<i>The French Connection II</i>). The original <i>French 
Connection</i> was director William Friedkin’s first important movie, and it 
stands today as an innovative, propulsive and absorbing police procedural (cum 
groundbreaking car chase) that showcases the feral veracity of Hackman and the 
fluid, gritty camerawork of Owen Roizman (who went on to photograph Friedkin’s
<i>The Exorcist</i> as well as the great 1970s caper movies <i>Taking of Pelham 
One, Two, Three</i> and the more politically-charged <i>Three Days of the Condor</i>). 
When <i>The French Connection</i> conquered some pretty long odds to win the 
Oscar for Best Picture, the victory signaled the arrival of the so-called “New 
Hollywood” movement of non-glossy, visceral stories. Unseen for many years in 
their proper aspect ratios, the films come in a sturdy box set from Twentieth 
Century Fox Home Entertainment. Each feature is on one disc (<i>French 
Connection II</i> is apparently available only as part of the box), with a third 
disc of bonus material highlighting critic Mark Kermode’s terrific BBC 
documentary “Poughkeepsie Shuffle: Tracing The French Connection” as well as 
seven murky but valuable deleted scenes available with or without Friedkin’s 
commentary. The revelation of the set is director John Frankenheimer’s 1975 
sequel, which showcases Hackman’s acting chops (the sequence where he talks 
about baseball while kicking the heroin habit they’ve forced upon him is a 
career highlight) and the director’s own crisp style (Frankenheimer would return 
to that part of the world more than two decades later for the awesome <i>Ronin</i>). 
Each film also has a commentary track from the director, with Hackman and 
producer Robert Rosen present to speak about the sequel.<br>

<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Francis Ford Coppola’s 
mammoth and storied history of the Corleone family is among the most cherished 
film franchises of the last half of the twentieth century. <i>The Godfather</i> 
made stars of Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall on its way to a Best 
Picture Oscar and a statue for Marlon Brando; the second installment earned 
Coppola Oscars for Best Picture, Director and adapted screenplay; and the third 
chapter remains his most ambitious and misunderstood work. Paramount’s sturdy 
five-disc box set doesn’t have a separate booklet, but each of the three films (<i>Part 
II</i> is on two discs) has a feature-length commentary from Coppola. Disc five 
contains over three hours of supplementary bonus material, including a Corleone 
family tree, historical timeline, storyboards, a documentary on the trilogy’s 
production, and additional scenes and outtakes comprised of select bits of 
connective tissue used over the years for various theatrical and television 
versions of the saga. While these last scenes are arranged chronologically, it’s 
a pity they can’t be integrated somehow into the films themselves. Then again, 
it wouldn’t be much of a surprise to see the complete Godfather saga make its 
way to DVD eventually, continuing the shifting history of this great American 
epic. If a copy can be located, Peter Biskind’s 1990 “Godfather Companion” book 
is an excellent reference source, more readily available but less penetrating in 
its analysis is Harlan Lebo’s 1997 tome “The Godfather Legacy.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">“It’s more important 
than baseball,” “Take Five” composer Dave Brubeck enthuses about jazz and its 
impact on society, and from the context it isn’t entirely clear whether he’s 
referring to America’s national pastime and indigenous music or Ken Burns’ 
marathon take on each. No matter: at ten episodes with an average running time 
of nearly 107 minutes each (the first is shortest at eighty-six minutes and 
episode eight is the longest at 122 minutes), for a total running time of a 
whopping 1,066 minutes—well over seventeen hours—<i>Jazz</i> the movie is for 
all intents and purposes as important as jazz the music, tracing its New Orleans 
roots in the 1890s all the way up to today’s scene. Along the way there are 
thousands of film and video clips, interviews with various critics, writers and 
and performers (with Wynton Marsalis the most prominent and unabashedly 
enthusiastic) and, of course, the music: excerpts from 497 separate pieces, from 
the 1920s Jazz Age through big band to post-World War II bebop and even 1970s 
fusion. While some are arguing that the series dwells to long on the Swing Era 
of the late 1920s through the war at the expense of the last two decades, while 
others object to the omission of certain artists, the naysayers are missing the 
point: this wealth of detailed information, like democracy itself (to which jazz 
is often referred to as a symbol of), is focused yet messy, inclusive to a fault 
but by its very nature unable to take it all in. As such, the film is an 
invaluable tool not only as a history of the major players, but a way to clear 
up confusion over lesser-known but nonetheless important musicians, the Chick 
Webbs and Charlie Hadens who have either faded from memory or haven’t achieved 
the household-name status of the Duke or Satchmo or Bird or Dizzy. The Public 
Broadcasting Service has partnered with Warner Bros. for this handsome release, 
which comes on ten separate discs in a sturdy cardboard box. The booklet in disc 
one has a brief episode guide and details on the surprise extras, which include 
a sixteen-minute featurette “Making of Jazz” on disc one, Louis Armstrong’s 
complete 1933 Denmark performance of “I Cover the Waterfront” on disc two, Duke 
Ellington’s “C-Jam Blues” performed in a 1942 short called Jam Session, and 
Miles Davis performing the complete “New Rhumba” with Gil Evans conducting on a 
1959 television program (the trumpeter’s earliest filmed appearance). Also worth 
mentioning is the velvety narration of actor Keith David (who may also be seen 
currently in Darren Aronofsky’s <i>Requiem for a Dream</i>), who brings just the 
right tones of urgency and soothing to the material. But the key feature of the 
set, and one that elevates it to must-own status, is the music information mode, 
whereby the viewer can choose to have each piece of music discreetly identified 
in the lower left-hand corner during play. Click on the title, and a screen 
showing detailed information on the song is displayed while the film is running. 
Thus it is possible to develop a pleasing rhythm of clicking on songs as they go 
by, enriching the total experience in true multimedia fashion. On the downside, 
viewers who wish to watch the DVD on their computers must put up with the 
annoying PC Friendly program, which installs itself with barely a warning and is 
apparently the only software under which it will run. Strike your own blow for 
freedom by deleting the program immediately after viewing. In all, this set is 
the sweet lowdown on a vital musical heritage much in need of the spotlight; to 
paraphrase the movie itself, “above all, Jazz swings.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana"><font size="2">Controversial even from 
beyond the grave, director Stanley Kubrick sparked a firestorm shortly after he 
died when a seven-disc collection of his films, from 1962’s <i>Lolita</i> 
through 1987’s <i>Full Metal Jacket</i>, were given the boxed set DVD treatment 
in a package apparently approved by the director but generally considered to be 
technically substandard (mono sound, improper aspect ratios). Nearly two years 
later to the day, this updated package, dubbed the “new” Stanley Kubrick 
collection, rights many of those wrongs and is thus essential for the collector. 
Yet in the process, it raises questions new and old regarding just how the 
consumer should want, or be expected to, duplicate the movie theater experience 
in the private home (not to mention the wishes of the artist). The answers are 
entirely dependant upon individual taste, which means that this nine-disc set 
will for many replace 1999’s collection, but for others it will supplement the 
set. The unqualified good news is that there are two more discs in the box, with 
1999’s <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i> and producer/brother-in-law Jan Harlan’s splendidly 
thorough and exclusive new documentary <i>Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures</i> 
(which is also popping up on cable) joining <i>Lolita</i>, <i>Dr. Strangelove, 
or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb</i> (1964), <i>2001: A 
Space Odyssey</i> (1968), <i>A Clockwork Orange</i> (1971), <i>Barry Lyndon</i> 
(1975), <i>The Shining</i> (1980) and <i>Full Metal Jacket</i>. The picture 
quality is excellent overall, with the greatest improvement apparent in the 
recently-restored <i>2001</i> (now presented in anamorphic widescreen), <i>Barry 
Lyndon</i>, <i>The Shining</i> and<i> Full Metal Jacket</i> (considered to be by 
far the worst-looking trio in the first box). But the audio questions are 
thornier. It’s common knowledge that Kubrick had demandingly high standards for 
theatrical presentation of his films, sending advance teams to check light 
levels and sound system quality in advance of first-run engagements—this is why
<i>2001</i> was the only picture he made in stereo. Now, under the supervision 
of long-time personal assistant and technical advisor Leon Vitali, all features 
save <i>Lolita</i>, <i>Dr. Strangelove</i> (which is otherwise identical to the 
version released earlier this year by Columbia TriStar, extras and all), <i>2001</i> 
and <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i> have been given their first-ever Dolby Digital 5.1 
audio mixes. Sonically, the results are very impressive—but they’re not the mono 
tracks Kubrick created with the films. While not a criticism, consumers should 
be aware that the version of <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>, for instance, they’ll be 
hearing through their home system isn’t the sonic force that Kubrick insisted be 
played to distortion in cinemas to further agitate moviegoers. This is a 
pedantic difference, to be sure, and one that is more than made up for by the 
luminous new picture quality (beefs about the lack of extras on five of the 
eight films are just that, beefs: extras are a privilege, not a right). The 
point is that cost aside, each box has its value in the collection of any 
serious film fan. With the release of Steven Spielberg’s difficult yet important
<i>A.I. Artificial Intelligence </i>sure to thrust the director and his oeuvre 
back into the public eye (Kubrick apparently bequeathed the property to 
Spielberg), Warners&nbsp; picked a very good time to issue a very good and very 
important boxed set.</font></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana"><font size="2">Simply put, how does “The 
Simpsons” get away with its relentless social satire? Now that Twentieth Century 
Fox Home Entertainment has embarked on a program to release each of the ten 
seasons intact on DVD and video, fans and newcomers alike can chart the progress 
of the characters Matt Groening improvised on the spot prior to a pitch session 
with producer James L. Brooks ‘way back in the 1980s. Although still very much a 
work in progress, the inaugural season already features the audacious writing 
that endures to this day as the hallmark of the series. All thirteen episodes 
are included on the set’s three discs, with annotation provided in an eight-page 
brochure. Extras include Groening’s commentary on all episodes; original 
scripts; examples from foreign-language versions of the show (pity they didn’t 
include the very good Czech voicings); the very first Simpsons short aired on 
“The Tracey Ullman Show” and publicity odds and ends. But the two very best 
reasons to own this box set are Albert Brooks’ hysterically funny unused vocal 
session riffs from the “Life on the Fast Lane” episode (as that bowling alley 
Lothario who woos Marge) and an equally loony commentary track for an early, 
very primitive and thankfully unaired version of “Some Enchanted Evening” -- 
during which Brooks walks out of the session in mock (?) disgust. At presstime 
various news sources were reporting that season two will street in May 2002, and 
that Fox now plans to release a new season in box set form every six months or 
so. At that rate fans should be all caught up with television’s best satire by 
2012 or so.</font></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana"><font size="2">The right television program 
at the right time, David Chase’s “The Sopranos” is a near-perfect blend of 
melodrama and contemporary insight, set against the complicated professional 
machinations and volatile home life of a clutch of New Jersey wiseguys. 
Following up and improving on the season one box set, season two introduces Aida 
Turturro as the devious ex-hippie sister of series focus Tony Soprano (James 
Gandolfini) and David Proval as the reptilian made man Richie Aprile. This is 
also the season that featured the tragic story arc of informant Big Pussy 
(Vincent Pastore). Once again, what’s perhaps most noteworthy about the program 
is the cinematic quality of it all: presented in the vastly superior letterboxed 
format, the show looks for all intents and purposes like the best American movie 
of 2000 that never played in a theater. Credit creator Chase with not only a 
narrative vision (the filming of season four was delayed until every episode was 
written to his satisfaction), but having the necessary tenacity to film the show 
on location with superior production values. It’s a series that stands up 
splendidly to repeated viewings. The sturdy HBO Home Video release features all 
thirteen episodes from season two on four DVDs, supplemented with two 
featurettes, weblinks, and one director commentary on discs one, three and four 
from series regulars Tim Van Patten, Henry J. Bronchtein and Allen Coulter.</font></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana"><font size="2">There’s a calm, measured 
mundanity to acclaimed Polish director Krzysztof Zanussi’s “Weekend Stories,” an 
eight-hour Polish television anthology suffused with insight and inevitably 
compared to Krzysztof Kieslowski’s “The Decalogue.” Like the Kieslowski work, 
“Weekend Stories” has an overlapping structure: each of the eight hour-long 
moral dramas is set over a single weekend, some share the same settings and 
music and, tellingly, each begins with a shot through a window. Zanussi was a 
physicist before he became a filmmaker, and he recently told interviewer Ray 
Privett that “physics teaches you some modesty, because you are always in front 
of a huge mystery. All that we can explain is such a tiny fraction of all that 
we cannot explain.” Thus, each episode has an air of unknowable mystery and 
inevitability informed by recent, tumultuous events in Poland: a middle-aged 
woman ponders the path her life might have taken if she hadn’t had her passport 
revoked as a teenager; parents wrestle over the moral questions of their son’s 
possible leukemia; a chauffeur and a businesswoman square off; an aging ballet 
dancer is confronted with difficult memories upon his return to Poland for a 
charity performance (an episode based on Zanussi’s conversations with exiled 
Russian dancer Rudolf Nureyev). Remarkably, Zanussi has survived within the 
Polish film and television community despite being critical of previous, 
repressive regimes. It’s a tribute to his practical wisdom that such deeply 
despairing stories can be so moving, and contain an emotional resonance 
virtually unknown in American television production. Available exclusively in a 
four-tape VHS box set, “Weekend Stories” is a joint release of Polart Video and 
Facets Multimedia.</font></span></p>
