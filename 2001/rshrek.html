            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The
            millennium's first great animated classic has been born. From the
            belly of a jolly, ugly/beautiful green beast bursts forth a bold and
            sassy gem of a comedy aimed at children of all ages. A mean,
            not-so-lean, fightin' machine sent into a fantastical rendered world
            from the Dreamworks factory has invaded the countryside and not a
            fairy-tale creature is left unscathed or unfractured by the wit and
            wisecracking luminescence imbued by the screenwriters (<span style="color:black">Ted
            Elliott &amp; Terry Rossio and Joe Stillman &amp; Roger S. H.
            Schulman</span>) on the children's book of the same name by William
            Steig. Covering this comic nutty center is an eye-popping digital
            world rendered with jaw-dropping, state-of-the-art reality. What a
            delicious treat!<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">A
            rousing road trip that traipses about its freshly drawn clever
            clever land and tosses darts at the heralded conventions of Grimm,
            Perrault, and, (Don't sue me!) Disney, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Shrek</i>
            still manages to browbeat a few moral lessons out of its lifelike
            characters. Vanity: bad. Inner beauty: good. Uncle Walt's small
            world does get some light-hearted drubbing at the mercy of the
            competitive forces across town, with nuanced pokes at a handful of
            those mouse-infested traditional creations and the parking lot that
            surrounds them.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            let's not dwell on the barbed negatives that only a few cinephiles,
            studio execs, and industry insiders might fully understand,
            especially when there's so much positive energy, compressed into a
            briskly paced ninety minutes, on which to radiate -- enough to power
            California to its continuing power crisis for the rest of the
            summer. You brim with feel-good spirit from the lyrical &quot;<span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">Once
            upon a time&quot;</span> opening through the rousing end-credit
            celebration where the entire cast (with an assist from Smash Mouth)
            belts out Neil Diamond's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">I'm a
            Believer</i>. The film gleefully borrows recent cinematic
            conventions (those slo-mo shots from <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Matrix</i> among them) and dialogue (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Babe</i>'s
            &quot;That'll do, pig. That'll do.&quot;), and skewers tag team
            wrestling (complete with the standard folding-chair bashing) for WWF
            fans. Nothing is sacred in this make believe world, but there's an
            abundant slyness within the deserved PG rating. By necessity there
            are jokes that only an aging baby boomer—i.e., those of us who
            remember <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Dating Game</i>—might
            appreciate in their intended context. Youngsters weaned on the
            Rugrats and other topical television-then-feature inventions will
            find more than enough humor to fill a year's worth of Happy Meals.<o:p>

            <span style="color:black">Andrew Adamson and Vicky Jenson handle
            every aspect of the production with such determined yet riotous
            conviction, you wouldn't believe this is the first feature either of
            them has helmed. It immediately rises to the level of both <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Toy
            Story</i> films and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">A Bug's
            Life</i> as best-of-the-best prototypical CGI entertainment. They
            and their hundreds of accomplished artists and technicians have
            created such a realistically fantastic world that you can feel the
            sun on the character's faces, marvel as the landscape bristles in a
            light breeze, melt from the red-hot heat of a lava-filled moat, and
            truly believe every computer generated facial expression. And just
            to show off how much fun they had putting this masterpiece together,
            they add lens glare as the &quot;camera&quot; pans up into the
            daylight. There is genius at work here.<o:p>

            don't you dare belittle the contribution of the vocal talent! Mike
            Myers strikes post-<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Austin
            Powers</i> gold with his Scottish lilt as the eponymous fearless
            ogre with repressed yearnings for Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), an
            enlightened damsel in distress, a nighttime secret, and a voice that
            will strike fear into any bluebird (in a bit that had a dozen
            critics rolling in the aisles at an early press screening). A
            high-spirited Eddie Murphy (back next month in the flesh as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Dr.
            Dolittle 2</i>) as the loquacious Donkey sidekick embroiders his
            ingratiate-me-PLEEZ bravado that animated the character of Mushu the
            Dragon in Disney's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Mulan</i>.
            And television's favorite alien John Lithgow may be heading back to
            his home planet after six seasons, but he puts in a shamefully
            self-depreciating spin as the pint-sized Prince Farquaad, whose
            standing is the focus of a handful of zingers (&quot;Men of his
            stature are in short supply.&quot;)<o:p>

            the selfish villain, he'll obviously meet his match with the wily
            Shrek, but an early torture sequence of The Gingerbread Man—framed
            with a mock Marine's flinty sensibilities—shows off the ruler's
            natural shortsightedness. The cookie character's legs lay crumbled,
            but his resolve strengthened. &quot;Eat me!&quot; he screams at his
            persecutors, before segueing into a &quot;Do you know the Muffin

            Shrek treasures his solitude deep in the CGI rendered woods. Whether
            cheerfully reading in his out house, squeezing out a flatulent
            bubble or two during a contented-as-a-pig mud shower, or plucking
            out a candleful of ear wax to adorn his dining-room table, here is
            someone who capriciously deals with any form of interruption in
            routine with a belly laugh of bad breath, an imposing presence,
            dim-witted naïveté, and low-level scare tactics. When his swamp
            yard becomes the camping ground for hundreds of displaced magical
            fairyland characters, Shrek and Donkey pace off for the
            vertically-constrained prince's oversized, souvenir-ensconced Castle
            Duloc and get bamboozled into fetching a suitable wife for
            Farquaad's own dastardly needs. On the road again (as Donkey prances
            about with frisky indifference to the danger ahead), all sort of
            comic misadventure welcomes the pair and then threesome after they
            rescue the fair Fiona from the penthouse suite of her dragon-guarded
            castle. The return trip finds them ambushed by Robin Hood and his
            band of all-singing, all-dancing merry man. To further enhance the
            sideshow-like atmosphere of the whole undertaking, a wayward frog
            and snake become circus balloons, floating up in disconcerted
            amusement.<o:p>
