            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Quiet.
            This might be the most accurate word to describe the elegant,
            perfectly composed surface of Wong Kar-Wai's <i>In the Mood for Love</i>.
            Set in Hong Kong, 1962, this achingly beautiful film follows the
            gradually evolving relationship between two neighbors in the same
            building, Chow Mo-Wan (Tony Leung, who won last year's Best Actor
            prize at Cannes for this role) and Mrs. Chan (Maggie Cheung). Both
            have spouses who travel frequently on business, which means that
            more often than not, they're left alone, working at their small
            offices during the days (he's a journalist, she's a clerk at a
            shipping company) and eating solo dinners at a noodle shop down the
            street from the building where they rent rooms. </b><o:p>

            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">They
            meet, they speak oh so briefly, they yearn. Like I say, the film is
            quiet. It's also ravishing, a superbly nuanced meditation on love
            and loss. Mostly unscripted, yet tightly choreographed and designed
            (by long-time Wong collaborator William Chang, working here on
            production design, costume, and editing), <i>In the Mood For Love</i>
            considers repressed romance and longing, but watching it is an
            acutely emotional and grandly romantic experience. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Scenes
            and emotions move slowly in this film, the camera paying careful
            attention to details -- a wide white clock face marking time between
            their meetings, the tap-tap of Mrs. Chow's heels in the tiled
            hallway, the sensuous curve of her neck in her high-collared
            cheongsam dresses, the fragile curl of Mr. Chan's cigarette smoke.
            Eventually, the two notice one another, passing so closely on the
            way to their apartment doors, or as they go up and down the stairway
            to the congee (noodle) stand. These instants of almost touching
            start to make a rhythm, the tension between them builds. Mr. Chan
            glances at Mrs. Chow, she looks away, shyly, then back again until
            their gazes meet. Eventually, they start to converse and discover
            that they share an affection for martial arts serials as well as
            noodles. They also discover that their spouses are having an affair.
            Though this is obviously upsetting, at first it seems nearly right
            -- their awkward non-encounters have a context and now, they have a
            reason to meet, on purpose. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            still, they're stymied, unable to say what they mean, or even to
            think it. Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan are as uptight as any wannabe
            lovers could be -- wanting so desperately to touch but also wanting,
            as they put it to one another, to not be &quot;like them,&quot;
            their deceitful partners. And so, they come up with other stuff to
            do. They agree to write a martial arts story together, then they
            begin play-acting scenarios starring their spouses, in an effort to
            figure out how the affair might have started. But there's no
            knowing, only yearning and wondering. The film never fully reveals
            the spouses; they're only seen from the back, through narrow
            doorways, so that they remain elusive and strange, much like they
            appear to Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan at this point in their lives. <o:p>

            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            film's seeming stillness is something of a departure for the
            forty-two-year-old Wong, best known in the States for his brilliant
            fever-dreamy love stories, <i>Ashes of Time</i>, <i>Chungking
            Express</i>, <i>Fallen Angels</i>, and <i>Happy Together</i>. But if
            the pitch and pace of <i>In the Mood for Love</i> are comparatively
            subdued, the erotic and emotional tensions run high as ever. Shot by
            two cinematographers, Christopher Doyle (who worked with Wong on <i>Days
            of Being Wild</i>, <i>Ashes of Time</i>, <i>Fallen Angels</i>) and
            Mark Li Ping-bin (<i>Flowers of Shanghai</i>), the film's
            indirection is as taut as any of the director's more frenetic work.
            Whether the characters lean into one another in the back of a cab
            (street lights fluttering over their faces), or stand apart in the
            room Mr. Chow has rented as their &quot;writing&quot; space (gauzy
            red draperies waving in a barely-there breeze), the very colors and
            textures that serve to contain them visually, also reveal their
            unspoken disquiet and desire. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Repeatedly,
            the film speaks for them, indirectly, but also poignantly. Nat King
            Cole's Spanish version of &quot;Perhaps, Perhaps, Perhaps,&quot;
            delicate and haunting, comes on the soundtrack again and again, at
            moments of just missed opportunity or drenched with passionate
            possibility. The song also hints at the ways that Hong Kong was,
            even in the '60s, a kind of transnational and pop cultural
            way-station, teeming with imported products and non-natives (both
            Mr. Chow and Mrs. Chan are from Shanghai) and humming with
            commercial and social activities. Famous for its political and
            ethnic mixing, the city is here also caught (and remembered) between
            eras, the '60s of Wong's childhood and the coming decades that would
            be fraught with questions of national identity (British or Chinese,
            traditional or modern). <o:p>

            doesn't display these tensions overtly; there's none of the usual
            &quot;crowded streets of Hong Kong&quot; shots. It's laced through
            with other, subtler evocations of difficult everydayness. Mr. Chow
            is utterly proper, hoping against hope that change will come to him;
            Mrs. Chan would never think of saying what's on her mind, instead
            losing herself in solitary trips to the movies, her job (which
            includes making arrangements for her boss' adulterous trysts), or
            occasional letters from her absent husband. Appearing in graceful,
            silhouetted long shots, the characters are at once too deeply
            immersed in their daily identities -- their reputations, their
            appearances -- and sadly anonymous, feeling displaced and uncertain.
            At film's end, Mr. Chow travels to Singapore and Cambodia, partly
            reminiscing but also, perhaps, looking for a future that never
            happened. The camera pans slowly over the ruins at Angkor Wat,
            suggesting not only the broadly tragic ravages of time and war, but
            also those smaller, less visible devastations that so many people
            find hard to discuss or even admit. <o:p>
