            serf's up in Heath Ledger's would-be-princely charming tale of the
            medieval jousting circuit, a fledgling European precursor to the
            WWF's next great debacle, the XJL. Barbing at knights in armor with
            long wooden toothpicks, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">A
            Knight's Tale</i> may be a smidgen (the medieval equivalent of
            thirty minutes) too long, but it has an oversized heart and a
            roguish camaraderie that should appeal to any non-discriminating
            viewer, helped, no doubt, by several pre-production weeks of hard
            drinking &quot;rehearsals.&quot; Heath Ledger (Mel Gibson's brave
            son in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Patriot</i>) moves
            further up the celebrity teen-o-meter as he backsteps further in
            time for this historical romantic comedy. As William Thatcher he is
            a rumpled blond peasant squire to Sir Ector (Nick Brimble), an
            over-the-hill competitor now unfortunately deceased (&quot;his
            spirit is gone, but his stench remains&quot; signals the throw-away
            lines that splinter the film). The impetuous lad's survival instinct
            kicks him. He strips down and armors up, setting about to become a <i>faux</i>
            noble lance-a-lot. His cohorts in deception (aware that if they
            succeed, there's a lot of money to spread around) are Roland (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Full Monty</i>'s Mark
            Addy), a sturdy Friar Tuck type, and the impulsive, red-headed
            bumpkin Wat, filled by Alan Tudyk, who carved a similar comic notch
            into his role as Gerhardt, the comic German cocaine addict in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            best lines arrive from the mouth of the fourteenth century's best
            selling author Geoffrey Chaucer, oddly described as 5'-11&quot; at
            the film's website, but embodied by the towering 6'-3&quot; frame of
            Paul Bettany, a London born and classically trained actor now
            filming his first American feature, Ron Howard's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">A
            Beautiful Mind</i>, opposite Russell Crowe. As seen here (often
            without his clothes), he's a struggling writer and compulsive
            gambler, yet astute Barnumesque ballyhoo artist/press agent. He
            shines when embellishing in Vince McMahon fashion the make believe
            legerdemain of William's royal alter ego, Sir Ulrich von
            Lichtenstein of Gelderland. &quot;Geoff&quot; loves spellbinding the
            boisterous crowds (two deleted flamboyant scenes will hopefully be
            found on the DVD version) with pretentious bravado. &quot;Thank
            you,&quot; he responds to the applause. &quot;I'll be here all
            week.&quot;<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">On
            the opposite side of the gender is Shannyn Sossamon as Jocelyn, the
            beautiful noblewoman with wildly out of date (for the 1300s)
            feminist leanings. The barely believable romance between her and
            Ulrich/William is too damn cute, and she's more of a fashion
            statement than a romantic icon, with a ton of weird hair, hat, and
            costume days (Move over. Cher!). I was more taken by the pluck of
            Kate (Laura Fraser), a sultry blacksmith's widow oddly attached to
            the men. She offers up one of the more amusing product placements in
            recent memory, with a double Nike emblem on a battle suit she
            hammers together for the young jouster.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Rufus
            Sewell sneers his way about the screen as Count Adhemar, a standard
            villain's role. He pillages, he pouts, he connives, he jousts dirty,
            and he gets his just desserts.<o:p>

            Brian Helgeland has an affinity for head bashing (as screenwriter
            for <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">L.A. Confidential</i> and
            director of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Payback</i>), but
            instead of a fist or a gun, the damage here comes at the end of a
            long stick. Helgeland certainly lightens the dramatic load with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">A
            Knight's Tale</i>, even if he uses a hand-held battering ram to make
            his point. In a bit of anachronistic befuddlery (and with some
            amusing similarities to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Shrek</i>
            and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Moulin Rouge</i>), the filmmaker interweaves the rock score within the
            600+year-old time frame. Hence the first jousting match has the
            peasants energetically singing and swinging to Queen's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">We Will Rock You</i>. Such exuberant interplay of contemporary/medieval
            culture doesn't work as well with the other cross-epochal scenes.
            Bachman Turner Overdrive's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Takin'
            Care of Business</i> overlays a deep-in-the woods secret training
            exercise for the aspiring champion and his band of merry men. David
            Bowie's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Golden Years</i> sparks the young lover's first anxiety-filled waltz
            steps at a victory ball before the entire dance floor starts
            agitating to Stuart Hopps energetic choreography. Prolific composer
            Carter Burwell (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Gods and
            Monsters</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

            does a top-notch effort in blending the musical styles of two
            distinct centuries, but it's the top ten tunes that will sell the
            soundtrack.<o:p>

            rag-tag team follows the jousting circuit before the extreme
            championship climax in London. After offering a perspective
            flashback that explains how the cards were unfortunately stacked
            against the young William, the script offers a paternal reunion and
            tear-stacked memories of a fearful son tritely instructed to
            &quot;just follow your feet.&quot; Aside from such thinly baked
            writing and the false romantic moments, the film's action-packed
            twenty-seven matches are generally fleet of foot and fast of pace,
            even if it easily could have been trimmed a half-dozen
            nerve-wracking contests.<o:p>
