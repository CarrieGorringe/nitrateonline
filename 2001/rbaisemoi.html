            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 8 June 2001</i></font>
            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">During one of the early scenes
            in the French film <i>Baise-moi</i>, two women are ambushed by some
            men who then take them to an underground parking garage, where they
            are physically, and sexually, attacked. The incident is horrific,
            depicted in a very straightforward fashion, but it is not
            exploitative or prurient: the focus, and sympathies, of the scene
            are entirely on the anguish of the victims. Afterwards, one of the
            women (Lisa Marshall), who is (rightfully) indignant and outraged,
            asks the other (Raffaëla Anderson) -- who sullenly submitted to the
            ordeal without trying to fight back or even crying out -- why she
            let the men do what they did to her. &quot;It could have been
            worse,&quot; the other woman, Manu, replies. &quot;We're still
            alive, right?&quot; She adds that, as with a valuable car that is
            left parked on the street in the wrong neighborhood, &quot;I leave
            nothing precious in [my anatomy] for those jerks.&quot;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is the expression of someone who
            has been robbed of a part of their humanity, but the fact that she
            is still alive does not mitigate the fact that she has had something
            taken away from her that should not have been taken away, and that
            it is something that nobody has the right to take away from anyone.
            Manu's response can be interpreted as defiant -- she won't even give
            her attackers the satisfaction of making her upset -- but it is also
            a sign that she has some wounds that have yet to heal.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is also a response that I can't
            imagine any male filmmaker would have made. <i>Baise-moi</i> --
            which can be translated as either &quot;Rape Me&quot; or &quot;(A
            rude four-letter word describing sexual intimacy) Me&quot; -- was
            written and directed by two women, Virginie Despentes and Coralie
            Trinh Thi, and adapted from a novel by Despentes. They have made the
            film in a deliberately confrontation manner, particularly in regards
            to its depiction of sex: the scenes are staged realistically, and
            the men's physiological responses are not faked. None of that nice,
            clean, tidy, burnished stuff that you see in movies shown on Cinemax
            after 11 p.m. The encounters here are seamy, unglamorous, clumsy, a
            matter of parts and placement, but important in terms of how they
            affect the attitudes and emotional responses of the main characters.
            (All I will say is that, from this seat in the house, I've seen
            worse.) Nonetheless, when the film opened in France during the first
            part of 2000, an obscure civil law was invoked which resulted in the
            film being banned from French cinemas. The film was approved to be
            shown in the U.K. with only a few of its shots excised; in Canada,
            the film was initially barred from being shown in Ontario, then
            approved after a few seconds of footage was cut, while in Quebec and
            British Columbia the film was shown uncut. (The film will also be
            shown in the U.S. uncut.)<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The main part of the film's story
            is set into motion by two incidents which occur during the heat of
            anger and push the two main characters over the line. One involves
            Nadine (Karen Bach), whose roommate (Delphine McCarty) nags away at
            her over how she keeps drinking all the whisky in the place and
            smoking all of their pot while languishing on the front room sofa,
            watching porno, when she isn't out turning tricks for an occasional
            client (No wonder the roommate's so cranky). At the same time,
            Manu's brother (Hacéne Beddrouh), discovering that she's been
            assaulted, picks up his gun to go out and fix whoever did this to
            her, but not before making a thoughtless remark about how, with the
            kinds of people that she hangs out with and the way she scores drugs
            off of them, she was bound to have this coming. The brother's gun
            falls into Manu's hands; she and Nadine have a glancing encounter
            when they walk past each other at the entrance to a subway station
            at night, after the last train has left. They both want to get out
            of town, and Nadine has a car. Their fates thus become interlocked
            together.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Once they hit the road --
            ostensibly to make a rendezvous with Noëlle, a &quot;cool&quot;
            chick who is a friend of Nadine's friend Francis (Patrick Eudeline,
            who bears a striking resemblance to the late, legendary French
            filmmaker Jean Eustache) -- the story takes the form of a journey
            where the two protagonists rob, deceive, and kill. When the bodies
            start piling up, they figure they might as well go on a tear, for
            what it's worth. Both Manu and Nadine turn out to be excellent
            shots. They get the eerie feeling that they are able to do whatever
            they want, and nobody's barging in to stop them. Anyone can become a
            potential target (or not), depending on whatever Manu and Nadine
            feel like they want or need to do at the time. Their victims and
            dupes include people from all walks of life, male and female. They
            pick up guys, take their pleasure from them, and then brush them
            off, just the way men (from their perspective) do to women. But they
            also lure someone who appears to be a perfectly decent guy into a
            hotel room, then turn on him when he wants to use a condom (and
            then, he goes flaccid). No wonder people in France became concerned:
            this not only looks exactly like the kind of movie that people think
            would put the wrong kinds of ideas into people's heads, but it also
            appears to be condoning wanton behavior. Gunshots could start
            ringing and stiletto-heeled shoes start lethally swinging throughout
            hotels and convenience stores all over the country. After a while,
            one realizes that most of the dramatic tension in the story is
            coming from what will happen to the next unsuspecting person that
            crosses Nadine and Manu's paths, and whether they'll be alive later
            on or not.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;The more you [have
            sex],&quot; Manu says at one point, &quot;the less you think, and
            the better you sleep.&quot; And, indeed, the picture shows the two
            women enjoying themselves more and more than they had been before
            the further along they go. But two questions arise. First, aside
            from adrenals and endorphins, what do Manu and Nadine get out of
            their crime spree? Are they exacting a feminine revenge (as happened
            in &quot;Thelma and Louise&quot;, a film to which this will
            inevitably, inexorably be compared), or are they simply running
            wild? If it's the latter, then the characters are behaving
            irresponsibly and at other people's expense, which affects our
            ability to sympathize or identify with them and damages their
            credibility.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The other question concerns how we
            are supposed to regard the two main characters overall. Are they
            victims or victors? Are we supposed to feel for them, or bemoan what
            they've become? Despentes and Trinh Thi seem to keep things
            ambiguous on this point: let the audience make up their own minds
            about the characters and what happens. But it is evident, in some
            respects, in the film that we are supposed to respond positively to
            what Manu and Nadine do. This is most troubling in one of the scenes
            near the end, where Nadine stumbles into the back room of a club and
            finds some men being serviced by prostitutes. She opens fire on
            them, men and women alike, and one's reaction is, what did they do
            to her? Surely she should know that the men are pretty much there
            only for a quick thrill; the women probably are there not out of
            choice.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Both Karen Bach and Raffaëla
            Anderson give unexpected depth and dimension to their characters --
            Bach, in particular, does some moving, and haunting, work in the
            concluding scenes. But there is also something remote and unknowable
            about Manu and Nadine -- like survivors of a terrible war, something
            remains closed-off in them, and it limits our ability to fully
            understand them and make sense of their actions. <i>Baise-moi</i>
            will undoubtedly be talked about, argued about, and that's not a bad
            thing. The film has power, and some legitimate dramatic points to
            make, but in the end it comes awfully close to appearing to be only
            about how women can be as cruel, brutal, and heartless as men --
            turning into, and becoming no better than, what they despise.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
