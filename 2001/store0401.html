<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When prissy Continental Broadcasting System
flunkie Pierre Delacroix (Damon Wayans) is put under pressure by his boorish
boss Dunwitty (Michael Rappaport) to deliver a hit show to the upstart network <i>or
else</i>, he comes up with the dubious idea of teaming up with assistant Sloan
Hopkins (Jada Pinkett) to hire street dancer Manray (Savion Glover) and his
buddy Womack (Tommy Davidson) to star in the intentionally offensive “The New
Millennium Minstrel Show.” It’ll be so bad, he reasons (“black actors with
blacker faces”), that he’ll get fired—preserving both his perks and his
dignity. Unfortunately, the show is a big hit, provoking all manner of outrage
and controversy. Spike Lee has never been a subtle filmmaker, yet in the wake of
such misbegotten real-life TV projects as “The Secret Diary of Desmond
Pfeiffer” and “the PJs” the subject of marginalization and stereotyping on
TV is ripe for lambasting. Yet the problem with the fatally ambitious <i>Bamboozled</i>
(which cheerfully steals the plot of Mel Brooks’ <i>The Producers</i>) isn’t
that the satire is too sharp, the problem is that the film as a whole just
isn’t very good. Lee’s chosen the currently trendy digital video format, but
doesn’t seem to know what to do with it, and as a result the picture runs 15
minutes over two hours—when it fact it would’ve run long at an hour and a
half. In the course of that time he drops plenty of hot-button slang terms and
program names (including, inevitably, the old “Amos’N’Andy” show), and
the roster of quasi-celebrities appearing as themselves include Al Sharpton,
Mira Sorvino, Johnnie Cochran and Matthew Modine. Still, this feels more like
exploitation than satire; Lee’s come a long way since <i>Do the Right Thing</i>
(newly available on DVD from the Criterion Collection), but <i>Bamboozled </i>doesn’t
come close to that film’s corrosive social criticism. Warner Home Video’s
DVD release includes a commentary track from Lee, deleted scenes, music videos
and a production featurette.<o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In a 1984 British coalmining town tense over a
violent strike, young Billy Elliot (Jamie Bell) decides to be a dancer, with the
support of his acerbic teacher Mrs. Wilkinson (Julie Walters) and despite the
resultant anger and resentment of his father (Gary Lewis). Every year there are
one or two films whose groundswell of popular support and positive word of mouth
turn out to be more about studio publicity manipulation than honest, grassroots
popularity. <i>Billy Elliot</i> is one of those movies, a strident and
simplistic feel-good fable during which its characters change their emotional
stripes to suit the mood of any given scene. And some of the characters,
especially Billy’s cross-dressing transvestite friend Michael (Stuart Wells),
seem more a sentimental fantasy of screenwriter Lee Hall than a credible,
flesh-and-blood person. Still, debuting director Stephen Daldry brings a lot of
energy to the proceedings, even if the movie never feels any more real than one
of the stage productions on which he cut his teeth. Universal’s DVD includes
production notes and a featurette on the film’s making</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Writer/director Don Roos' first film since his
stunning 1998 <i>The Opposite of Sex</i> has Ben Affleck playing a high-rolling
ad executive who, out of kindness, hands his airplane ticket to a man trying to
get home quickly to his wife and family. The airplane Affleck almost boarded
crashes, killing everyone onboard, and the ad exec falls apart: trying to
resolve his guilt, he looks up the deceased man's wife (Gwyneth Paltrow, with
(unflattering dark hair), who has not remarried, and the two of them start
falling in love before the ad exec ever reveals what caused them to meet in the
first place. Roos still shows that he has directoral talent and a way with
turning out good dialogue, but parts of this film drag inexplicably, and Affleck
and Paltrow just don't seem to fit the parts they're playing—during moments
when we're supposed to be experiencing high emotion, we're instead wondering who
could have done a better job in the roles. The whole film's off-kilter—it’s
not terrible, it just doesn't work. There are very good performances from the
two young actors (Alex D. Linz and David Dorfman) who play the wife's sons,
sometimes director Tony Goldwyn, Natasha Henstridge, and Johnny Galecki as the
ad exec's openly gay and unflappable office assistant, who's also been through
substance abuse rehab and can see right through his boss' equivocations in a
snap. Buena Vista Home Video’s VHS edition is priced to rent, while the DVD
features a commentary track with Roos and producer Bobby Cohen; a scene-specific
commentary track with Roos, Affleck and Paltrow; deleted footage with commentary
(this feature is a high point of Roos’ <i>Opposite of Sex</i> DVD); a
“making of” featurette; gag reel; Leigh Nash’s “Need to Be Next to
You” music video; and something called “Ben and Gwyneth Go Behind the
Scenes.<o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Not hard to see why this was such a hit last
fall: the very first moments provide perfect escapism, even if there wasn't a
Presidential election fiasco going on. The movie's fast, it's fun, it's
watchable, it's disposable, well, maybe not <i>that</i> disposable, but, still,
I dunno.... As you may have heard, Drew Barrymore, Cameron Diaz and Lucy Liu
play the titular trio, out to prevent a technological plan that could create an
invasion of the world's privacy, yet. The only gripes I had with the movie, once
you resigned yourself to the fact that there wasn't going to be much of a story
to worry about, was that, in our post-<i>Matrix</i> world, it looks like we're
now going to be seeing cinematic action sequences and mano-a-mano fights where,
like a DJ at a rave sliding from one music track to the next and then to a
third, the participants will suddenly suspend themselves in mid-air, like
ibises, before providing the resolution to the motion that we're desperately
waiting to see the outcome of. True, this is not visually disagreeable, but with
the evident work that the three female leads put into doing all their fight work
without employing firearms of any sort, the visual manipulation ends up making
whatever physical work they're doing look totally artificial (it doesn't make
any difference if they're doing their own stunts or not -- compare it with
Jackie Chan's work in a movie like <i>Project A, Part 2</i>, and you'll see what
I mean.) The other disquieting aspect is Bill Murray, who plays Bosley to the
new Angels, and, boy, does he look noticeably uncomfortable for some reason.
This turns out to be one of Murray's rare dud performances: he can't seem to get
a grasp of what he's supposed to be doing here or how he's supposed to be
playing it. On the other hand, Diaz gets all the best lines (when Kelly Lynch
maliciously knocks a cell phone out of her hand while she's talking to Luke
Wilson, Diaz takes offense by saying, &quot;Hey, I <i>liked</i> that guy!&quot;
and then really lays into her opponent); and Liu's turn as a corporate
efficiency expert in one scene shows that, if Barrymore's production company is
next supposed to turn two of Jean-Claude Forest's &quot;Barbarella&quot; graphic
novels into a film, maybe they should give Liu a crack at playing Guido Crepax's
&quot;Valentina&quot;. Aside from the Destiny's Child song, the soundtrack mixes
together an amazing array of tunes so that they work splendidly well together
without imposing on the action. Columbia TriStar Home Video’s VHS edition is
priced to rent for now (there’s a Spanish subtitled tape as well), and the DVD
includes a slew of features, commentaries, production featurettes and music
videos.<o:p>

Rodriguez) learns to channel her rage at the local boxing club under the
watchful eye of wry yet wise trainer Hector (Jaime Tirelli), until a
relationship with cocky fighter Adrian (Santiago Douglas) threatens to stall her
progress. More than one critic noticed the fact that the independently-made <i>Girlfight
</i>might well be the flip side of the <i>Billy Elliot</i> coin, yet for all the
latter movie’s obviousness, director Karyn Kusama’s film feels fresh and
unmannered -- in direct contrast to the potential pitfalls presented by its <i>Rocky</i>-ish
story. And Rodriguez is a true find as Diana in a big-screen bow reminiscent of
Juliette Lewis’ memorable debut in Martin Scorsese’s remake of <i>Cape Fear</i>
(let’s hope her career is more varied and less labored). Seldom does a movie
come along as unassuming and modest as <i>Girlfight</i>, which is reason enough
to see it right there. The Columbia TriStar Home Video DVD pressing features
Kusama’s commentary track and a production featurette; the fullframe VHS is

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The latest Adam Sandler comedy did not go over
well with audiences, who were probably expecting more of the heedlessly cruel
comedy of <i>Happy Gilmore</i>. Instead, this picture turns out to be a story
about a son trying to save his father -- Nicky (played by Sandler), who prefers
playing air-guitar in his room more than anything else, must rush to halt a
series of events which is causing his father, Lucifer (Harvey Keitel, in a
not-ineffective performance), to literally crumble away to nothing. This
requires Nicky making a trip to Earth for the first time, and seeking help from
a charming girl played by Patricia Arquette. Lots of superficial low humor, but
oddly ingratiating underneath, and with a host of appearances from, among
others, Rodney Dangerfield (as Grandpappy Lucifer), Reese Witherspoon, and, as a
blind street preacher who appears to be patterned after John Carradine in <i>The
Sentinel</i>, Quentin Tarantino. New Line’s so-called “Platinum Series”
edition DVD is a typically lavish affair for the imprint, featuring a commentary
from director Steven Brill and the cast; the behind-the-scenes documentary
“Adam Sandler Goes to Hell”; the heavy metal documentary “Satan’s Top
40”; deleted scenes; and the music video for P.O.D.’s “School of Hard
Knocks.”&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Based
on the true story of Carl Brashear, the African-American son of Kentucky
sharecroppers, who joins the U.S. Navy in the 1950s and sets his sights on
becoming a member of the service's elite deep-sea diving and recovery team, then
achieving the rank of Master Chief, the highest rank that can be attained in
that division. Brashear not only undergoes demanding physical training, but
learns, despite his having a 7th-grade education, the scientific knowledge
needed to succeed in his duties. Brashear's story is a good one -- Truman had
ordered the armed forces to become desegregated, and many officers complied not
only because it was an order but because they thought it was right, as
commanders and as human beings, but racist nonsense still continued on the sly
in many places for years to come. The movie recounts Brashear's story, though,
in ways that are simplistic, clichéd, erratic, and, most of all, predictable.
In making the movie &quot;inspirational,” the filmmakers have also
more-or-less dumbed-down the material (doing it a great injustice in the
process). Cuba Gooding, Jr. does some fine individual work and gives a
fully-rounded portrayal of Brashear. As Billy Sunday (no relation to the
evangelist), the Master Chief who trains Brashear and then goes into a career
slide while Brashear's climbs, Robert De Niro seems hamstrung by the way the
movie has been worked out: the filmmakers decided they didn't want to give the
audience a portrayal of someone who harbors full-blown racism, but Sunday has to
have some sort of conflict with Brashear for the sake of the story, so Sunday's
motivations remain murky and difficult to pinpoint (often from one scene to the
next). The real villain of the piece turns out to be an officer (David Conrad)
who is officious and speaks about the &quot;new Navy,” causing the film to
lurch in its final segments into a contest between the modern, sterile
&quot;new&quot; and the tried-and-true honor and tradition of the
&quot;old&quot;. The film also cops out on two of the most important points in
the concluding segments: why Brashear resorts to going to such extreme lengths
to remain in his position in the service, and why Sunday should so valiantly
rush to his aid. George Tillman, Jr., who made a name for himself with the
popular 1997 film <i>Soul Food</i>, directed, from a screenplay by Scott
Marshall Smith. The CBS/Fox Home Video DVD has a slew of features highlighted by
no less than 11 deleted scenes.</span></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While it might not be, in star Mel Gibson’s
words, “as boring as a dog’s ass” (what Wim Wenders film could be?), <i>The
Million Dollar Hotel</i> is nobody’s idea of a cinematic triumph, either. The
surreal adventures of the denizens of the titular downtown Los Angeles flophouse
in a slightly askew near future (actually, spring 2001), the story was
originally conceived by U2 lead singer Bono during the band’s “Rattle and
Hum”-era infatuation with lowlife urban Americana. Jeremy Davies (<i>Saving
Private Ryan</i>) stars as Tom Tom, a mentally challenged resident who is most
affected by the arrival of a bizarrely scarred federal agent (Gibson)
investigating the murder of an eccentric artist. A drabbed-down Milla Jovavich
co-stars, and the large, disparate and unwieldy supporting cast includes the
always-dependable Peter Stormare as a burnout who imagines himself the fifth
Beatle, Amanda Plummer, former “NYPD Blue” heartthrob Jimmy Smits (why do
good TV actors leave their secure jobs for wildly erratic movie careers?),
Gloria Stuart, Bud Cort and an uncredited Tim Roth. Wenders is going for dreamy
but achieves murky, with some typically stylized visuals courtesy of D.P. Phedon
Papamichael and a daringly fine soundtrack from in-studio pickup band Bono,
Brian Eno, Jon Hassell, Daniel Lanois and others. The Sterling Home
Entertainment VHS is priced to rent, while the DVD is a bare-bones affair that
cries out for a commentary track from the intellectual and endlessly fascinating
director. So while <i>The Million Dollar Hotel</i> is a heartbreaker, what
we’d all really like to see come to DVD is that legendary five-hour-plus cut
of Wenders’ magnificent 1991 futuristic fable <i>Until the End of the World</i>.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Winner of the Best Documentary Feature award at
the 72<sup>nd</sup> Academy Awards ceremony, <i>One Day in September</i> is the
riveting and entirely true story of the hostage crisis at the 1972 Munich
Olympics in which Palestinian terrorists, calling themselves Black September,
snuck into an athletes’ dormitory and took nearly a dozen Israeli athletes and
coaches hostage. After a 21-hour standoff, the situation detonated into
bloodshed and tragedy. Seen today, the standoff and its botched handling by the
West German authorities was the touchstone for current security levels at
high-profile events. Director Kevin Macdonald counts Errol Morris among his
influences, and the film has the same kind of breathless propulsiveness as many
of Morris’ best films. Hampered by an apparent lack of footage documenting the
climactic airport shootout, the film actually gains impact from Macdonald’s
solution, although the period tunes (including the rare authorized use of a Led
Zeppelin song) are jarring in the context of the tragedy, to say the least.
Nevertheless, as a stand-alone experience or in concert with Simon Reeves’
recent book of the same title, <i>One Day in September</i> is strong stuff. The
Columbia TriStar Home Video VHS edition is priced to rent, and the letterboxed
DVD is said to include production notes, a theatrical trailer and talent
files.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Superfluous sequel to the superfluous 1996
remake of the 1961 animated film, plus it has the distinction of being possibly
the worst-plotted big-budget commercial film to come out in years: the
filmmakers have just a couple of ideas to sustain things for over an hour and a
half, and they just keep throwing those ideas at us, again and again, while we
in the audience recall wistfully the enjoyment that once could be had by
watching a story unfold in a film. Actually, two of the ideas in the film aren't
bad ones: Cruella De Vil (played by Glenn Close, also in the 1996 film)
undergoes behavioral modification while in prison and emerges not only with an
aversion to fur but as an animal advocate. And one of the puppies from the
previous film, Dipstick, has sired a litter of his own which includes Oddball, a
dalmatian without spots. However, the film isn't really about the dogs, it's
about the outrageously caricatured Cruella, who very quickly<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>re-develops her maniacal pursuit of a puppy-skin coat. And she's less a
creation of Glenn Close's acting abilities than those of her costumer (the
excellent Anthony Powell) and hair stylist -- Close’s involvement seems almost
coincidental, although, if she really wants to look like this in a movie, who
are we to stop her? She also suffers one of the biggest travesties of a
comeuppance -- for a performer, at any rate -- since Marlon Brando was sent
skidding at high speed on his backside down a muddy hill in <i>Bedtime Story</i>.
This is also your chance to see Ioan Gruffudd, cable TV’s Horatio Hornblower,
engaged, in his very first scene, in a tug-of-war battle with a dog, both
participants holding onto their end of the rope with their teeth. And there's
more!: Gérard Depardieu (yes, <i>that</i> Gérard Depardieu) appears as a
couturier named Jean-Pierre le Pelt who, in his first scene, appears on a
fashion runway wearing an outfit with a codpiece shaped like a leopard's head.
Since none of the dogs speak -- again -- the anthropomorphic yakking is provided
by a parrot who speaks fluent English and thinks it's a dog. After a while, one
yearns for a hungry cat to turn up, just to shut it up. Walt Disney Home
Video’s DVD is so burdened with bells and whistles that it more than earns the
title of one featurette: “Puppy Action Overload.”&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Clint Eastwood as the leader of a group of
aging former NASA astronauts who gets the chance to reassemble the old team
again and take the ride into space that was denied them decades ago. Eastwood,
who has not been afraid to take a chance with new material in the past, gives
this a good try but seems to have lost his way with the movie. The other former
astronauts are played by Donald Sutherland and James Garner, who seem barely
used in the film, and Tommy Lee Jones, who lays the Texas-boy mannerisms on a
little too thickly. Marcia Gay Harden, ostensibly playing one of the main roles,
seems barely in the film at all. And by the time the action moves into outer
space, the movie has lost the chance to gain momentum. Not really a bad film,
but one that goes out of your head rather quickly after seeing it. Warner’s
DVD includes four production featurettes focusing on location filming, special
effects, that Jay Leno sequence and the work of editor Joel Cox (who won an
Oscar for Eastwood’s crowning achievment, <i>Unforgiven</i>).&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In contemporary Queens, newly-released ex-con
Leo (Mark Wahlberg) just wants to go straight and get a good job, but is sucked
into the corrupt world of the New York City transit system and its
ultra-competitive contractors by cold-eyed pal Willy (Joaquin Phoenix) -- with
dire results. Nothing less than a cross between a 1930s Warner Bros. social
melodrama and Sidney Lumet’s massively influential 1981 real-life police
thriller <i>Prince of the City</i>, director and co-scenarist James Gray’s
second feature (following 1994’s <i>Little Odessa</i>) is admirably restrained
and subtly textured, casting the broodingly intense Wahlberg as a cross between
Paul Muni and <i>Prince</i>’s brave straight-arrow cop Danny Ciello (played by
Treat Williams). Many interpreted the stately pace and downbeat performances as
drawbacks, but in fact the film builds a palpable spell of doom and foreboding
that lingers long after the lights come up. The stellar supporting cast includes
Ellen Burstyn, James Caan, Faye Dunaway, Steve Lawrence (yes, the singer -- sans
Eydie Gorme) and Charlize Theron. The Miramax Home Entertainment VHS is priced
to rent, and the DVD features a commentary track by Gray, original concept art
and a behind-the-scenes production featurette.&nbsp;</font></p>

(Franka Potente, star of <i>Run Lola</i> <i>Run</i> and <i>Blow</i>) discovers a
secret cabal of medicos who perform autopsies on patients still alive in this
sleek, diamond-hard German thriller. As with most movies of this type there are
plot holes you can drive a truck through, but the novelty of a German-language
genre film, combined with Potente’s appeal and Peter von Haller’s
eye-catching cinematography, provide enough entertainment to propel one through
the absurd bits (and it’s sure better than such lame American studio fare as <i>The
Skulls</i>). <i>Anatomy</i> represents a decided change of pace for
Austrian-born director Stefan Ruzowitzky, whose previous film <i>The Inheritors</i>
(1998) showcased his eye for fluid composition but didn’t hint at his relish
for genre. The first fruits of Columbia Pictures’ German branch, <i>Anatomy</i>
actually had a brief commercial run in New York -- via a dubbed print. Luckily,
the distributors’ handsome DVD edition is subtitle optional, and supplements
the feature with Ruzowitzky’s commentary track, storyboard comparisons,
deleted scenes, a music video, a production featurette and peek at the stylishly
bizarre makeup effects. Both dubbed and subtitled VHS versions are priced to
rent.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Roscoe Conkling “Fatty” Arbuckle was a
portly and promising physical comedian from Kansas who moved from vaudeville to
silent films in 1908 and never looked back. By 1917 the incredibly agile and
baby-faced performer was so popular he could create his own production company,
Comique. Over the next three years, Arbuckle and his troupe -- including the
young an still-unknown Buster Keaton -- produced a number of dazzlingly
inventive and howlingly funny comedy shorts, 10 of which are collected on two
discs by Kino on Video (each volume is sold separately). While the quality of
each varies, the impact does not: possessed of an astonishing talent for timing
and tricks (watch him roll a cigarette or flip a butcher knife), Arbuckle was
rightly assessed as the second most popular comedian of the period -- behind, of
course, Charlie Chaplin. So why haven’t you heard of “Fatty” Arbuckle? In
1921 his career was ruined by a scandal involving the bizarre and grisly death
of a young woman after a night of celebration (there’s a so-so 1975 dramatic
version inspired by the events, entitled <i>The Wild Party</i>). After two hung
juries Arbuckle was acquited of manslaughter, although the damage had been done
and today his abbreviated career stands as the pivotal event in the formation of
the Hays Code to battle the perceived amoral bent of Hollywood -- a body that
would later morph into the Motion Picture Association of America. Each of these
shorts has been digitally remastered, with evocative color tinting, restored
intertitles and a new score created specifically for the releases by the Alloy
Orchestra. This is funny, eye-opening stuff. <o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When Terry Southern and Mason Hoffenberg had
the bright idea to recast “Candide” as a satire of pornography story
structure, a film was sure to follow. One of the biggest commercial flops of the
1960s, screenwriter Buck Henry’s adaptation of the book has been out of
circulation for a good two decades (Henry himself co-scripted and can be seen in
Warren Beatty’s upcoming <i>Town &amp; Country</i> -- and in an odd, wordless
cameo as a mental patient here). Seen today, <i>Candy</i> is an uneven treasure
trove of moviemaking do’s and don’t’s. Unknown Ewe Aulin is comely yet
breathily annoying in the lead, but that’s more than made up for with the
cavalcade of male stars who fall under her spell (representing various
professions and temperaments), a virile roster that includes Richard Burton (as
floridly dissolute poet McPhisto), Marlon Brando (as a “reformed mystic” in
the movie’s weirdest and best sustained bit), James Coburn, John Huston,
Walter Matthau (as the spiritual descendant of General Jack D. Ripper in the
Southern-scripted <i>Dr. Strangelove</i>), Sugar Ray Robinson, John Astin
(remember “The Addams Family”?), Ringo Starr as Emmanuel the Hispanic
gardener (dig that Liverpudlian/Spanish accent) and French singer Charles
Aznavour as The Hunchback. The monologues can become tiring, but each actor
seems in a kind of masculine prime (particularly Brando), which gives director
Christian Marquand’s film an air of revelation to those who know of it only
vaguely or not at all. Dave Grusin’s psychedelic score is a pure hoot, and the
unflaggingly imaginative art direction of Dean Tavoularis (who went on to do
Oscar-winning work on Francis Ford Coppla’s <i>Godfather Part II</i>) and
Giuseppe Rotunno’s photography are very evocative of the period. The Byrds
perform the title song, with scattered tunes from Steppenwolf. Anchor Bay’s
pristine DVD has no extras but comes packaged in a bright red slipcase and has
some pretty groovy menus.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In <i>The Color of Pomegranates</i>, the life
of Armenian national poet Sayat Nova is traced via colorful tableaux. <i>The
Legend of Suram Fortress</i> fashions an ancient Georgian legend into a proudly
nationalistic affirmation of warrior resolve and sacrifice. <i>Ashik Kerib</i>
reimagines Lermentov’s wandering minstrel story as an experimental and lushly
romantic ode to traditional art and music. Georgian filmmaker Sergei Paradjanov
ran afoul of Soviet censors throughout his career (his florid style and folk
celebrations were labeled “decadent”), yet managed to conceive some of the
most ravishing and unique films ever made. Mentored by film theoretician Lev
Kuleshov and influenced by Ukranian filmmaker Alexander Dovzhenko (<i>Earth</i>,
available on tape from Kino on Video), his films were praised around the world
even as he served four years for hard labor and was denied domestic access to
foreigners. Under mid-1980s glasnost he was able to resume filmmaking but died
of lung cancer in 1990. As they’ve done with selected other DVD pressings
(Andrei Tarkovsky’s <i>Sacrifice</i>, Guy Maddin’s <i>Careful</i>) Kino has
bundled <i>The Color of Pomegranates</i> with a documentary on the director’s
work, esteemed film critic Ron Holloway’s enlightening 57-minute 1994
German-American co-production <i>Paradjanov: A Requiem</i>. Also featured on the
disc is an early Paradjanov short, <i>Hagop Hovnatanian</i>. Both discs are
technically solid if unspectacular, a symptom far more indicative of poor
original print quality than distributor disinterest. In fact, Paradjanov is an
important enough component in the development of Cold War-era individualism in
Russian cinema that he’s been taught in film classes for over 30 years; thus,
these discs are a key addition to the history-minded film fan’s collection.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In an atmospheric wartime London beset by the
blackout, a Danish sea captain (Conrad Veidt) and his mysterious passenger
(Valerie Hobson) match wits with a nest of Nazi spies operating out of a Soho
basement. The second collaboration between British director Michael Powell and
Hungarian-born scenarist Emeric Pressburger (following 1939’s similar-in-tone <i>The
Spy in Black</i>, also starring Veidt and Hobson), <i>Contraband</i> reveals
itself after some 60 years of obscurity (it was given a perfunctory U.S. release
under the title <i>Blackout</i>) to be a sparkling Hitchockian thriller in the <i>39
Steps </i>mold. Veidt glowers his way mischievously through the role, and
Hobson’s slinky insouciance matches him note for note. Following Criterion’s
recent DVD release of <i>I Know Where I’m Going!</i>, <i>Black Narcissus</i>
and <i>Peeping Tom</i>, <i>Contraband</i> is essential viewing for those
intrigued and beguiled by the most unique and rewarding collaboration of Powell
and Pressburger. Kino on Video’s fine transfer to DVD highlights the
expressionistic photography of the legendary Freddie (“F.A.”) Young (see <i>Lawrence
of Arabia</i>, below) and the atmospheric settings of Alfred Junge, who went on
to design both <i>I Know Where I’m Going!</i> and the essential <i>Black</i> <i>Narcissus</i>.

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">“Madadayo” apparently means “not yet!”
in Japanese, and is the response retired German teacher Hyakken Uchida (Tatsuo
Matsumura) gives to the students and family who throw him a once-a-year-birthday
party, at which they ask, in unison, “Mahda-kai?” (“are you ready?”). To
emphasize his vow to keep living his rewarding life, he quaffs a large glass of
beer as his respectful and adoring students cheer. Unavailable for years in the
United States, Akira Kurosawa’s final film exhibits none of the epic sweep for
which he is known (<i>The Seven Samurai</i>, <i>The Hidden Fortress</i>, <i>Ran</i>),
focusing instead on the ordered satisfaction of a life lived well. That the
multi-decade timeframe of the film includes the messy post-World War II rubble
of Tokyo seems only fitting, as the counterpoint of order and chaos is never far
from the surface. Bereft of booklet, chapter headings or extras, Winstar’s
simple and dignified DVD pressing of <i>Madadayo</i> -- which is based on a true
story -- needs none of those things, as the deliberate, sentimental and placid
film itself provides its own rewards -- in stark counterpoint to much noisier
movies which deliver far less satisfaction.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Referring
to a 1930s experiment in three-strip color that set the pace for the move away
from black and white filmmaking in Hollywood, one critic called Michelangelo
Antonioni’s rarely-seen 1980 experimental melodrama <i>The Mystery of Oberwald</i>
“the <i>Becky Sharp</i> of cinema’s long-promised and long-deferred
electronic era.” In the years since, that brave new world of tape has arrived
with a vengeance, and very little of it resembles the experiments in color and
saturation found in Antonioni’s turgid adaptation of Jean Cocteau’s
historical romance “The Eagle Has Two Heads.” But that’s not to say this
long-unavailable work is without merit: first of all, along with the
director’s subsequent film <i>Identification of a Woman</i> (also recently
released by Facets), <i>The Mystery of Oberwald</i> has remained out of reach
for the home video collector since it’s production (that’s not the same as
being available in poor prints, which is sadly the fate of many of Antonioni’s
most pivotal work, including the trilogy of <i>L’avventura</i>, <i>La notte</i>
and <i>L’eclisse</i>). Secondly, Antonioni himself wrote of “finally using
color as a narrative, poetic means” -- and of his disdain for the material.
Thus, the statically rendered story of a 19<sup>th</sup> century queen
(Antonioni regular Monica Vitti) who falls in love with her assassin serves
principally as a canvas for the director’s experiments with color
manipulation. And although he himself thought the results “banal,” fans of
the director’s rigorously intellectual work will rejoice at the availability
of <i>The Mystery of Oberwald</i> and the serious approach to pushing the
technical bounds of cinema it represents. <o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In 1930s America, young phenom Roy Hobbs
(Robert Redford) rocks the baseball world by materializing seemingly from
nowhere to lead the no-account New York Knights to victory. Just in time for
baseball season, Barry Levinson’s 1984 critical and box office hit <i>The
Natural</i> has been given a dazzling digital makeover by Columbia TriStar Home
Video that enhances Caleb Deschanel’s luminous photography and one of Randy
Newman’s best-ever scores. Although the film itself still plays long and
fragmentary, the pristine transfer elevates what’s good about the movie beyond
these concerns. The uniformly excellent supporting cast includes Robert Duvall,
Glenn Close, Kim Basinger, Wilford Brimley, Barbara Hershey, Robert Prosky,
Richard Farnsworth and an uncredited Darren McGavin. The DVD package includes a
choice of no less than seven languages for the subtitle tracks, the usual
collection of trailers, talent files and production notes, and, most appealing
for fans of the sport, an exclusive documentary featuring Cal Ripken Jr. Play
ball.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To attempt to understand the cinema of French
phenom Leos Carax, start with his name: born Alexander Oscar Dupont in 1961, his
nom de film is an anagram of his first two names, Alex and Oscar. A gesture both
mischievous and mystifying, it perhaps sums up the visually arresting yet
dramatically obscure nature of his four feature films to date (the third,
1991’s <i>Lovers on the Bridge</i>, was released in the United States by
Miramax after a multi-year delay). His debut film, <i>Boy Meets Girl</i>, is an
arrogantly affectionate black and white tribute to the French new wave, with
Denis Lavant (in his first of three films with Carax) playing an aspiring
filmmaker opposite Mirielle Perrier’s Jean Seberg-ish lovelorn waif and a
post-modern musical approach. Working again with Lavant and cinematographer
Jean-Yves Escoffier (who went on to shoot both <i>Good Will Hunting</i> and <i>Nurse
Betty</i>), <i>Mauvais Sang</i> switches to vivid primary colors and tarts a
young Juliette Binoche up to look like Jean-Luc Godard’s muse Anna Karina.
There’s nobody named Pola in <i>Pola X</i>; the title comes from the first
letters of the novel on which it is based, Herman Melville’s disasterous 1852
work “Pierre, ou les Ambiguities” (the X apparently refers to the 10<sup>th</sup>
draft of the screenplay, which was the one shot). Guillaume Depardieu -- Gérard’s
son -- stands in for Lavant as an aspiring writer and self-centered aristocrat
driven to flamboyant distraction by a number of women. As is usual in a Carax
film, there are striking sequences (a nighttime confessional during a trek
through the woods, Catherine Deneuve astride a motorcycle), but the overall
effect is of a beautiful confusion -- a phrase that might well serve as title of
his sure-to-be baffling critical biography. Winstar’s DVDs of the titles
(available separately) offer no accompanying booklet but include various
interviews with the director as well as the usual raft of interactive menus and
filmographies; the latter two titles sport brief outtakes and behind-the-scenes
footage among their extras (the VHS tape editions are priced to rent).

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After pioneering the process and intellectual
ramifications of film editing via such landmarks as <i>Battleship Potemkin</i>
and <i>Strike</i>, Russian director Sergei Eisenstein struck out for Hollywood
in hopes of expanding his work. Unable to interest any of the studios in
collaborative projects, the director ended up in Mexico, where he and
collaborators/traveling companions Grigory Alexandrov (the producer) and
photographer Eduard Tisse began working on a documentary about the land, people
and customs of the country. The limited budget soon ran dry and the film was
abandoned. In 1979, Alexandrov and Nikita Orlov were finally able to edit the
film, using Eisenstein’s notes and storyboards as guideposts. The resulting
85-minute documentary offers tantalizing glimpses of the visual power and
propulsive movement of the director’s best work, with Alexandrov’s
Russian-language narration and historical photos and footage placing the events
in historical context. The Kino on Video DVD (their VHS tape has been on the
market for three years) includes Eisenstein’s first sound film, 1930’s
“cinematographic study” (read: experimental short) <i>Romance Sentimentale</i>,
as well as a 20-minute fragment from the trio’s 1929 health-themed work <i>Misery
and Fortune of Woman</i>, as well as a clippings file of texts pertaining to the
main feature (the accompanying single sheet insert has an anonymous essay on the
supplemental material). Alongside The Criterion Collection’s upcoming 3-disc
Eisenstein set (featuring restored copies of <i>Alexander Nevsky</i> and <i>Ivan
the Terrible Parts 1&amp;2), Qué Viva México!</i> signals a renewal of
interest in one of the founding fathers of cinema.

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The actor Ron Vawter is probably best
remembered to movie fans as FBI agent Paul Krendler in Jonathan Demme’s
Oscar-winning <i>The Silence of the Lambs</i> (it’s the same character bravely
played by Ray Liotta in <i>Hannibal</i>). Shortly after appearing in Demme’s <i>Philadelphia</i>,
Vawter -- who died in 1994 -- performed the well-received one-man show Roy
Cohn/Jack Smith, in which he played both Joe McCarthy prosecutor Cohn and
defiantly gay avant-garde film icon Smith -- wildly different men who had one
thing in common: they both died of AIDS (Vawter himself was infected with the
disease at the time of his death). <i>What’s Underground About Marshmallows?</i>
is a fleshed-out version of the Smith segment of the play, taped in late 1993 --
the actor’s final performance. Both films are co-produced by James Schamus,
co-writer and producer of <i>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</i>. And both films
were directed by Jill Godmilow, an American independent filmmaker of uncommon
vision and endurance, who has been making uncompromising features and
documentaries lodged at the junction of sexual politics and the creative process
for more than 30 years. Other titles in Facets Video’s exclusive, tape-only
release of Godmilow’s work include the Chicago Serbian community documentary <i>The
Popovich Brothers of South Chicago</i> (1978), the Solidarity movement docudrama
<i>Far from Poland</i> (1984), and the provocative drama <i>Waiting for the Moon</i>
(1986), in which Gertrude Stein (Linda Bassett) and Alice B. Toklas (Linda Hunt)
lead an all-star group of expatriates in Paris between the world wars. Valuable
as much for their sociological inquiries as for their visually inventive styles,
these films label Jill Godmilow a key player in the development of independent
cinema over the last three decades. </o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">On his deathbed in 1922, Marcel Proust
(Marcello Mazzarella) recalls the period of his life before and during the first
world war in the drawing rooms and social engagement circuit of Paris. This
impeccably measured film version of the final volume in Proust’s massive
“Remembrance of Things Past” has a cast that will appear all-star to anyone
with an interest in contemporary European cinema: Catherine Deneuve is Odette de
Crecy, Emmanuelle Béart is Gilberte, Vincent Perez is Morel, John Malkovich is
Baron de Charlus, Pascall Greggory is Saint-Loup, Marie-France Pisier is Madame
Verdurin, Christian Vadim is Bloch, Arielle Dombasle is Madame de Farcy, Chiara
Matroianni is Albertine, and Patrice Chereau is heard as Proust’s voice.
Heretofore known as a prolific maker of low-budget international art films,
Chilean-born Raul Ruiz has been slowly and cannily moving into another arena
altogether: his 1992 <i>Dark at Noon</i> and 1995 <i>Three Lives and Only One
Death</i> competed at the Cannes festival, and the 1997 drama <i>Genealogies of
a Crime</i> won the Silver Bear at the 1997 Berlin festival (he’s got a new
film in competition at the upcoming 2001 Cannes event). All these films have in
common an intriguing fluidity of time, suggesting that Ruiz, as most artists
eventually do, is now less intimidated by the passage of time than intrigued by
it. Kino on Video’s fine letterboxed DVD edition features a four-page booklet
in which J. Hoberman’s respectful and adoring “Village Voice” review is
reprinted in its entirety, speaking for a critical community that welcomed <i>Time
Regained</i> as a respectful yet daring approach to Proust’s writing.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">In
1934, Adolph Hitler hired a young actress, dancer and aspiring filmmaker named
Leni Riefenstahl to make a film about the National Socialist German Workers
Party rally in Nuremberg, Germany. The resulting film, <i>Triumph of the Will</i>,
has polarized audiences ever since. At once an exhilaratingly supple technical
tour-de-force of technique and a frightening and distasteful display of
nationalistic megalomania, the movie unfortunately documents Hitler at the
beginning of the doomed 12-year Reich that would result in the most despicable
acts of the 20<sup>th</sup> century. Although the original negative of the film
was apparently destroyed during the waning days of the war and subsequent prints
have suffered from poor quality and truncated subtitles, good prints do exist,
and the tiny genre distributor Synapse Films has procured one from legendary
restorer Robert A. Harris for this sharp transfer. Crisper than other copies in
circulation, the print used displays many of the same blemishes but restores the
minute-plus overture and sports subtitles so detailed and complete you may find
yourself freezing the image to catch up. A commentary track by Virginia-based
scholar and historian Dr. Anthony R. Santoro provides a wealth of information on
Hitler’s inner circle and the politics of the Nazi machine, but very little on
Riefenstahl herself (there’s not even a photo of her on the packaging or
enclosed four-page brochure). Thus, the Kino on Video pressing of Ray Muller’s
1993 documentary <i>The Wonderful, Horrible Life of Leni Riefenstahl</i> is
recommended as a companion piece to this eternally controversial work.</span></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Just as John Boorman’s <i>Hope and Glory </i>recast
the World War II bombing of London as a children’s wonderland of new and
exciting experiences amid death and destruction, debuting filmmaker Ziad
Doueiri’s <i>West Beirut</i> follows the adventures of three young people
during Lebanon’s civil war in the mid-1970s. Centered on genial delinquet
Tarek and his pal Chamas -- Muslims both -- the merry band grows to include
vivacious May, a Christian. Lebanon-born Doueiri has worked as an assistant and
second-unit cinematographer for Quentin Tarantino, which helps explain his
nervous, fluid style -- aided by a score from ex-Police man Stewart Copeland --
and the lean propulsiveness of his autobiographical narrative (“the happy
memories have cancelled the bad ones,” he has said). “Since when has the
West understood the East?” someone asks in West Beirut. The triumph of the
film is Doueiri’s ability to bridge the two worlds through the universality of
adolescent emotion and experiences. New Yorker Video’s VHS-only release is
priced to rent and worth seeking out at better video retailers. <o:p>

font-family:Verdana">On the bleak plains of Greenland, young Norwegian writer
Henrik Larsen (Gard B. Eidsvold) goes toe-to-toe with vulgar sailor Randbaek
(Stelan Skarsgård) during a fur trapping expedition. <i>Zero Kelvin</i> is a
moody, enigmatic existential thriller from Norwegian director Hans Petter
Moland, who understands the suffocating loneliness and rage of men cooped up
together for too long. And for fans of the chameleon-like Skarsgård, the film
offers yet another facet of his tremendously diverse skills: Randbaek is nothing
short of a stringy-haired lunatic, but as he’s done in so many films over the
last few years, the actor imbues the trapper with a chaotic, even touching
dignity. Kino on Video’s DVD pressing and VHS version are letterboxed. Watch
for Molland and Skarsgard’s follow-up collaboration, the emotional family
drama/road movie <i>Aberdeen</i>, coming soon to an art-house theater near you. <o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In 1989, the restoration wizardry of Robert A.
Harris (see <i>Triumph of the Will</i>, above) brought <i>Lawrence of Arabia</i>,
director David Lean’s breathtaking, literate telling of British officer T. E.
Lawrence’s work in the World War I-era Middle East, to a new generation of
moviegoers and sparked the current trend of skillfully refurbishing pivotal
works for big-screen exhibition. On the heels of their well-received <i>Bridge
on the River</i> <i>Kwai</i>, Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment delivers a
two-disc set of Lean’s multi-Oscared epic that will satisfy those new to the
DVD realm but falls short of telling the film’s true and tortured production
history -- or even delivering a commentary track. Worse, Harris not only
wasn’t involved in this project, but isn’t even referenced for his late
1980s labors. On the plus side (and these are big plusses indeed), F.A.
“Freddie” Young’s cinematography and Maurice Jarre’s music are given the
best possible showcase (dig that overture, entr’acte and exit music). In a
word, the movie looks gorgeous. And while many of the extras -- all on disc two
-- seem distracted or even frivolous (what’s the point of Steven Spielberg
popping up to reminisce about the film?), the discs’ DVD-ROM features offer a
wealth of production stills and information -- but be warned: inserting either
disc into your PC summons up the dreaded PC Friendly software, and they won’t
play without installing it on your system (as good as the software may or may
not be, consumers should retain the choice of using it or ignoring it). The
accompanying 12-page booklet includes two essays originally found in the 1962
first-run brochure, and the handful of production documentaries include the
featurette <i>Wind, Sand and Star: The Making of a Classic</i>. Other recent
sword’n’sandal epics for those thematically inclined include <i>Ben-Hur</i>
(1959), <i>The Fall of the Roman</i> <i>Empire</i> (1964), <i>Cleopatra</i>
(1963) and <i>The Greatest Story Ever Told</i> (1965) -- all released, no doubt,
in no small part to capitalize on the success of the most recent Best Picture
Oscar winner, the similarly majestic but digitally tricked-out <i>Gladiator</i>.
But accept no substitutes: despite the sins of omission, <i>Lawrence of Arabia</i>
remains among the most beautiful and stirring of epics, and this two-disc set
does the film itself proud.&nbsp;</font></p>
