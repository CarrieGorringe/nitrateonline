            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>Waking Life</i> begins with 
            two kids (Trevor Jack Brooks and Lorelei Linklater, daughter of the 
            film's director Richard Linklater) playing a paper hand-puzzle game. 
            When the children follow the rules -- count off the letters in a 
            randomly selected color name, then a randomly selected number -- 
            they arrive at the boy's apparent fortune: &quot;Dream is destiny.&quot; At 
            this point, the kids' part is done, and they move on, out of the 
            movie. For you, however, the game is just beginning.</b> </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The game in Linklater's <i>Waking 
            Life</i> is elaborate and engrossing, part dream, part animated 
            jaunt, part narrative shake-up. Set up as the ongoing dream of one 
            unnamed character (played/voiced by Wiley Wiggins, from Linklater's
            <i>Dazed and Confused</i>), the film was shot as live action in 
            Austin, San Antonio, and New York City, with lightweight, handheld 
            video cameras. The footage was digitized and then animated, in a 
            process that art director Bob Sabiston calls &quot;interpolated 
            rotoscoping.&quot; This involved some thirty artists, so that each 
            character has his or her own visual style -- times two, that is, 
            with input from both the actor and the animator. This means that the 
            movie's appearance is quite unlike anything you've seen in feature 
            filmmaking, and it takes some getting used to: the environment 
            shimmers and shakes, as unstable as the characters in it, with 
            floors and windows and sidewalks in constant motion. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Wiley&quot; (as we might as well call 
            him, as Linklater does when talking about the film) is on a quest, 
            though he's not quite sure what he's seeking (since he doesn't know 
            his own name, it's understandable that he's a little confused as to 
            his purpose). He appears a few minutes into the film, riding on a 
            train. At the station, he catches a ride with a guy driving (or is 
            it captaining?) a car-boat, literally a boat on wheels. &quot;Don't miss 
            the boat!&quot; the captain calls out cheerfully, before explaining why 
            this boat is the perfect mode of transport, an extension of his 
            personality: &quot;We should stay in a state of constant departure while 
            always arriving.&quot; His fellow passenger is Linklater himself, or 
            Linklater animated, reprising, sort of, his early appearance in <i>
            Slacker</i>, and holding forth on the nature of experience, time, 
            and identity (&quot;There's only one instant, and it's right now, and 
            it's eternity&quot;), before he instructs the driver exactly where to let 
            off Wiley, so that he might confront his own &quot;eternity.&quot; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At the appointed place, Wiley finds 
            a note in the middle of the street, telling him to &quot;look right.&quot; He 
            does, and he's immediately hit by a car: boom. He wakes up, the 
            dream continues, and he moves on to the next conversation. Some of 
            these chats, however, (which he may or may not be dreaming) don't 
            even include him. Eventually, the film becomes its own thing, 
            without a clear point of view. Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy show up, 
            apparently post-coital, apparently still living inside <i>Before 
            Sunrise</i>, speculating about the relationship between dreams and 
            reincarnation. From this lovely, intimate scene, the film cuts (or 
            more precisely, floats) to a prisoner (Charles Gunning) in his cell, 
            pacing and grumbling about all the &quot;motherf*ckers&quot; on whom he'll 
            have his revenge, with methods ranging from a &quot;hot cigar in your 
            eye&quot; to &quot;molten lead up your ass.&quot; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The juxtaposition of these two 
            scenes may be the most startling moment in the film, as it lurches 
            from movie-star-ish privilege and possibility to harrowing despair. 
            This brief in-your-face ugliness underlines what the rest of the 
            film, so replete with theoretical talk, hints at: if the concept of 
            the &quot;waking life&quot; has to do with coming to clarity and 
            self-consciousness, the most profound conditions for the journey are 
            disturbingly material. The theorists can't quite reach this acute 
            state, but neither can the prisoner see beyond his walls. To survive 
            (in his mind?), he directs his pain outward, but he also consumes 
            himself, confined inside his immediate conditions: walls, bars, 
            rage. Where the Hawke and Delpy scene conjures a lovely, solicitous 
            fantasy, the inmate is upsetting. But his appearance -- startling as 
            it is -- is easily forgotten amid the rush and rattle of all the 
            soaring Big Ideas in <i>Waking Life</i>. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The rest of the film concerns 
            Wiley's rather less disquieting probing around for a range of 
            people's opinions on the interrelations of consciousness, free will, 
            community, the effects of media saturation, and quantum mechanics 
            (these academic chatty Cathys include professors Louis Mackey and 
            Robert Solomon, of the University of Texas). As he wanders through 
            this dream, Wiley becomes increasingly conscious that it is a dream 
            (he can't read the digital clock, a sure sign that you're dreaming, 
            according to one of his encounters), and the movie itself becomes 
            &quot;conscious&quot; of itself as a movie. Or better, a series of movies: 
            Wiley attends one film screening that's projected by a talking 
            chimp, another in which Caveh Zahedi discusses André Bazin's faith 
            in film's capacity to capture, even create, a &quot;holy moment.&quot; In 
            other brief appearances, Steven Soderbergh pipes up about the 
            business of filmmaking, and in New York, Wiley runs into Speed 
            Levitch, beloved protagonist of the 1998 documentary, <i>The Cruise</i>, 
            still cruising. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Above all, the movie asks you to be 
            awake as you watch it, so you are not consuming so much as you are 
            processing, in a very self-conscious way. <i>Waking Life</i> is as 
            interested in itself as it wants you to be, and pushes the point 
            about film's shifty status as entertainment and/or art. Indeed, the 
            website invites you to &quot;read all about it,&quot; listing the famous names 
            dropped in the film, including the usual suspects in philosophy 
            (Sartre, Plato, Nietzsche, et. al.), as well as cultural theorists 
            like Guy Debord, Philip K. Dick, and Benedict Anderson -- whose 
            notion of &quot;imagined communities&quot; might be the very one underlying 
            all filmmaking and film viewing. Going to the movies is an 
            adventure, and the more conscious you are about it, the better.
