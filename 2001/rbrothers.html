            resist commitment and women want it. This would be the reductive
            premise behind any number of popular romances, as well as more than
            a few best-selling self-help books. It's a division of cultural
            labor that tends to reinforce itself. Repeatedly, media images offer
            up the same old same old<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>--
            emotions are little girly stuff and car chases and explosions are
            the province of boys -- and consumers absorb it without thinking
            much about it. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Occasionally,
            questions arise regarding this pop cultural flow, suggesting that
            time-tested conditioning is not all it's cracked up to be, and maybe
            not even so prevalent as it seems. Writer-director Gary Hardwick's
            first feature asks some good questions, and then comes back with
            answers that are part retro and part unexpected. <i>The Brothers</i>
            are four longtime friends -- Jackson (Morris Chestnut), Terry (Shemar
            Moore), Derrick (D.L. Hughley), and Brian (Bill Bellamy) -- who are
            facing the crisis of Terry's upcoming wedding to Ursula (Nadege
            Auguste). While the guys all agree that she's fine (she has a good
            job, great body, and wonderful personality), they're horrified that
            one of their number is choosing to &quot;give up his freedom&quot;
            (this is despite and because of the fact that Derrick is married to
            Sheila [Tamala Jones], who was pregnant at the time of their
            wedding).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So
            far, so familiar. Facing his boys on the basketball court, where
            they go to sweat, score, and hash out their &quot;stuff,&quot; Terry
            argues -- none too convincingly -- that his settling down is a sign
            of his maturity. The others are unconvinced. And so they go on to
            talk about it. A lot. You don't always see men talk about
            relationships in movies, which is one reason why Hardwick himself
            has dubbed his film &quot;Refusing to Exhale,&quot; the anti-Terry
            McMillan version of how &quot;men&quot; interact. It's not so much
            that they're like women, or that they're holding out because they're
            stubborn, but that they're seeking stability and security. They're
            just a little afraid, you know, uncertain and uninformed, even when
            they strut. Usually their deliberations take place on the basketball
            court (so Moore and Chestnut can take off their shirts) or in bars
            (so Hughley and Bellamy can make jokes about folks in their
            vicinity), but they all eventually come down to the same question.
            How<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>can you be a man if
            you're willing to compromise/share with a woman, when the two
            &quot;sides&quot; are so patently opposed?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Brian
            is the most steadfast in his belief that men and women are from
            distant planets. And yet even this confirmed bachelor can't seem to
            shut up about the subject, though his commentary is mostly derisive
            and uninformed, and is obviously motivated by his own apprehension
            over losing his friends, one by one, to heterosexual bliss. Brian's
            primary tack to dis and avoid commitment simultaneously involves
            swearing off of black women, whom he deems &quot;too
            demanding,&quot; and instead sleeping with white women, who are
            willing to do anything and everything.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Granted,
            Brian isn't exactly breaking new ground with such observations and
            booty-chasing behaviors, but just as you think that's all he has
            going on, the film actually goes a next step. The fact that <i>The
            Brothers</i> opens with Jackson discussing his relationship troubles
            with his shrink (Vanessa Bell Calloway), suggests its strategy to
            differentiate itself from its most obvious generic predecessors (<i>The
            Best Man</i> and <i>The Wood</i>), which is to delve into its
            protagonists' personal and familial histories in order to discover
            why they're so afraid of &quot;the C-word,&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>here, &quot;commitment.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It
            won't be giving anything away to reveal that the guys have learned
            their bad behaviors from their parents. And this is something new --
            where hood movies focus attention on political and economic
            structures, this new favorite-black-movie-genre-of-the-minute is
            looking at social and personal motivations for dysfunctional
            behaviors. Here, the parents have made their boys unable to love in
            a number of ways: Brian's stoically unaffectionate mom (Aloma
            Wright) taught him to distrust women; Jackson's philandering dad
            (Clifton Powell) taught him to distrust himself; and Derrick's very
            nice mom (Marla Gibbs) taught him to be a very nice, very trusting,
            very accommodating fellow. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            last sounds like it's a good thing, and it would be except that
            Derrick is impressed by stories his boys throw down, and is thinking
            that he's missing something at home. Specifically, he's missing oral
            sex from Sheila (after several years of marriage and a child, she
            still feels that it's &quot;nasty&quot;). While Derrick is funny and
            obnoxious, he's also struggling with some complex
            &quot;issues.&quot; And Hughley, best known as an incisive stand-up
            comedian (see, for instance, <i>The Original Kings of Comedy</i>)
            and sometimes edgy sitcom star (<i>The Hughleys</i>), gives a
            well-considered and engaging performance, and cuts loose with some
            funny trash-talk as well.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And
            so the film is rife with crises: Terry is getting married, Derrick
            is on the verge of divorce, and Brian is revisiting his childhood
            fears. Yet, <i>The Brothers</i> focuses most closely on Jackson's
            dilemma, which is the least obviously a crisis. He tells his doctor
            that he needs no one, that his needs are easy to line up and
            address, but he is also willing to admit that maybe he doesn't have
            it all figured out (he is <b>seeing</b> a doctor, after all). His
            panic stems from the fact that he's considering
            maybe-possibly-perhaps becoming serious about his new girlfriend,
            Denise (Gabrielle Union). Jackson interacts with several other women
            in the film, including his mom (Jenifer Lewis), sister (Tatyana
            Ali), and doctor, as well as a recurring nightmare figure, a woman
            in a wedding dress who holds a gun on him. All the women appear to
            be pushing him to grow up and &quot;be a man,&quot; and he's still
            trying to decide what that means, for him. The Nightmare Bride looks
            to be one mightily unsubtle embodiment of his fundamental anxiety,
            but by the end, she actually takes the film to another level,
            namely, male melodrama that borders on Ally-McBealism.</font></o:p>
