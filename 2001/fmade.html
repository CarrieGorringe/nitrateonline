you hear the name Jon Favreau, you'll probably remember that he's the guy who
wrote and starred in <i>Swingers</i> (directed by Doug Liman), the movie that,
back in 1996 (was it that long ago already?), made &quot;You're so money&quot; a
commonplace and his friend and co-star Vince Vaughan something of a movie star.
If the above sounds familiar, you probably also know that Favreau and Vaughan
met back in 1992, when they were both knocking around Hollywood, and were both
cast in David Anspaugh's <i>Rudy </i>(1993), then appeared as a hanger-on in
Alan Rudolph's <i>Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle </i>(where he developed an
abiding respect for co-star Jennifer Jason Leigh) and a college student in <i>PCU</i>
(both 1994), an astronaut in Mimi Leder's <i>Deep Impact</i> and hapless
accessory to murder in Peter Berg's <i>Very Bad Things</i> (both 1998), and
Rocky Marciano in a respectable TV biopic (1999). Then, in 2000, Favreau
stretched out still more: he starred opposite Famke Janssen in Valerie Breiman's
indie romantic comedy, <i>Love &amp; Sex</i>, and a psycho football player in

<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If
you're a hardcore Favreau fan, you also know his background, for instance, he
was born in 1966, in Queens, New York. Before heading to La-la-land, he worked
for a Wall Street investment banking firm, spent some time in Chicago doing
improv comedy and theater, and was a cartoonist for, um, money. While writing
scripts to pay rent, family man Favreau is also working the development deal he
earned from <i>Swingers'</i> success, out of which he's determined to make
unusual, intelligent movies. <i>Made</i> is one of those. He wrote the film, his
directorial debut, for himself (as Bobby) and Vaughan (as Ricky), to revisit
their <i>Swingers</i> energy. <o:p>

The <i>Made</i> soundtrack is so varied, from Hawaiian music and Monster Magnet
to De La Soul and Black Eyed Peas: how did you make your choices? <o:p>

On this film and with <i>Swingers</i>, I give a lot of thought to the music as
I'm writing it. In <i>Made</i>, the music has to do with the nightlife, what New
York is really about. I wanted to keep it like a party. And it is an eclectic
mix, which gave a lot of problems commercially. The complexity of the piece
works against you, for the soundtrack. <o:p>

[Laughs] Well, we did not deliver that. We didn't with <i>Swingers</i> either,
which had Dean Martin and country-western, funk, and swing. This new film has
that, too: you have hard rock and rap and Dean Martin, again. <o:p>

That's right. Most of the people I cast for this film are people I feel
comfortable with. I knew Famke [Janssen] from <i>Love &amp; Sex</i>, Faison
[Love] from <i>The Replacements</i>, a couple of people from <i>The Sopranos</i>
[on which Favreau guest-starred as himself], and Jennifer Esposito and Sam
Rockwell. The only people who I got through the more traditional means were
Puffy, Peter Falk, and Mak [Makenzie Vega], the little girl. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><o:p>

Speaking of whom, she gave a very un-movie-kid-like performance. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><o:p>

That was because we did a lot of improv, where we'd just roll the camera. She
wasn't very comfortable with that at first, but her mom was a very good coach.
And a lot of the moments that show Mak in the best light, as a human child, are
when she's just talking about her pets or other things. Me and Vince would
improvise, or I'd just have a conversation with her with the camera rolling and
we'd capture the moment, without those pre-rehearsed movements that a lot of kid
actors use. She's a great actor, but I like having a little more reality. <o:p>
</o:p>

What is appealing to you about improvisation as an approach to making films? <o:p>

We have a script, but sometimes people make choices or say things on their own,
and I encourage that. I shoot a lot of film. Tonally, sometimes things can be
too much if you improvise; there's a lot more cursing than I would have liked.
But I encourage improvisation and everybody felt very comfortable with that. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><o:p>

Had you had that experience with other directors you worked with? <o:p>

Not really. But we sort of knew from <i>Swingers</i> what it would be like with
me and Vince. And everybody's saying the lines, it's not like a Mike Leigh
movie, we're not improvising the plot. But it's more like Spike Lee -- more Lee
than Leigh -- bringing a certain authenticity to it, by paraphrasing. I'm a
pretty good writer, I make a living at that. But I still don't think my writing
is better than something someone would really say. If the little girl talks the
way she talks, it's going to be a lot better than her learning how to talk the
way you think she should. It's all about reality. It's about tricking the
audience into buying into thinking what they're watching is not a movie. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>

<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="2"><font face="Verdana">CF:</font></font></span></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
I know that you didn't want to do a sequel to <i>Swingers</i>. What did you want
to do with this film? <o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><o:p>

We definitely wanted to do a follow-up that would satisfy people who liked <i>Swingers</i>,
but not make them feel like they're paying to see the same movie with us a
little bit older and fatter and more pathetic, still trying to pick up women in
Hollywood [laughs]. But I wanted to build on the chemistry between Vince and me,
so I found aspects of both of our real personas, to exaggerate for comedy. I put
us in a much more higher-stakes, more story-driven situation, and turned the
screws on the characters. I also wanted to build into the movie a set of
circumstances that drew upon our real life experiences since <i>Swingers</i>.
You know, now we get to ride in limos and stay in nice hotel rooms. I wanted to
capture that in this film, and the mob genre really lent itself to that. <o:p>

Mob films let you focus on the guy-guy relationship. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="2"><font face="Verdana">JF:</font></font></span></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
And we turn into this &quot;gay&quot; couple at the end [laughs]. Ricky and
Bobby begin under this veneer of mild racism and homophobia, but that comes out
of their circumstances, but as they get further away from that world, they leave
that behind: they're still cursing, but they look like a young couple trying to
make the best of it. We came up with that last scene as we looked at the movie
cut together, and Vince and I actually kicked in part of our paychecks to
finance it, because I think the movie would have been understood without it.
Just like in <i>Swingers</i>: while we were shooting the movie, I wrote that
last scene where -- remember? -- Vince tries to pick up another girl and gets
smoked, and he says that she's coming on to <b><i>him</i></b>, and my character
just doesn't want to hear it anymore. That scene's important, because if you
don't have it, the film can look like a recipe book for getting laid. But it's a
movie about something else, that the real way to get what you want is to become
comfortable with who you are, and accept it warts and all. It's a <i>Shrek</i>
type of thing! [laughs] That's when Mike [Favreau's character in <i>Swingers</i>]
gets what he wants. And [<i>Made</i>] is not about learning how to wear the
right suit and carry a gun and handle yourself when the shit goes down. That's
not what makes things good at home. Because you're going to get home and find a
woman you don't really know, doing things you don't want to see her doing,
because you were never really honest with yourself. <i>Made</i> is about opening
your heart to people who deserve your love, and not trying to turn other people
into something that they're not, not trying to save people who don't want to be
saved. If you go down that dark path, you're not going to end up doing any good.<o:p>

She is brave, and that's why I wanted her for the film. I like to write roles
for people I know, roles they'd like to play, roles they haven't had the chance
to play. That's how <b><i>I</i></b> pick roles. Jessica is an adorable, seedy,
lower-class character. <o:p>

How were you thinking about setting Ricky and Bobby's &quot;journey&quot; in New

It is this archetypal, Joseph Campbell-type journey, and you want to take your
characters from the ordinary world in which they dwell, and they have to correct
some type of problem by going into this extraordinary other world. Whether
that's Oz in <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>, or the nightlife in <i>Swingers</i>,
that's your second act. In <i>Made</i>, New York is this wondrous place where
they're uncomfortable. It's a key aspect of traditional storytelling. It cost us
a lot of money to actually shoot in New York; they wanted us to shoot in
Toronto, with a couple of exteriors in New York. But we needed to be there. I
wanted you to feel like they were in a whole different world. <o:p>

The boxing is an effective way to set up Bobby and Ricky's particular kind of

I think the boxing is a great way to &quot;show, don't' tell.&quot; It's the
first rule of writing. To have two people beating the piss out of each other and
then cutting to one driving the other one home, really says a lot about their
relationship. After that opening, you always know that there's the possibility
of violence between them. And it's fun also to saddle us with the burden of
wearing these scars throughout the movie, as we're trying to gain credibility.
Everybody assumes we're these rough characters, but really, every bruise on our
faces comes from the other person, which is sort of embarrassing. <o:p>

I used to call him Sean on the set. But I guess you can also call him Puffy. Or
now, you just call him P [laughs]. But he's really great about all this sh*t.

He approached me after reading the script. I was surprised, but I thought, this
could really work, because even if he just comes off like himself, there's an
intrinsic humor built into our making all these <i>faux pas</i> in front of this
guy, about whom the perception is that he's this really dangerous character.
Especially at the time, with the gun charges being brought up against him, so to
the vast American movie-going audience, it's like having John Gotti in the
movie. He was willing to have fun with it, which I thought was really cool. And
I thought it was cool that he wanted to do an independent film, in a small,
supporting role. He worked his ass off. I was really happy with him. <o:p>

And you chose Chris Doyle as your cinematographer: what was your thinking behind
that? <o:p>

Although this is my first time directing, it's really my second filmmaking
experience. And between Chris and I, it was a real division of labor. He ran the
camera and set up the scenes, and I worked with the actors. I knew that I wanted
a really strong right-hand, and I'd seen all the Wong Kar-wai stuff he'd done,
where he had to shoot on a budget, on practical locations, with available light,
and I knew we'd be doing that a lot. I knew that a guy who could bring beauty to
the piece, through his framing and energy, was going to go a lot further for us
than a DP who would bring mood through setting lights and preparation. And he's
a fantastic character as well as a talented cameraman. So, we would be a really
good marriage -- he'd add that grit and realism that people had come to expect
from the way <i>Swingers</i> was shot.<o:p>

So when you're writing -- I know that you were once a cartoonist -- do you think
in terms of visual set-ups? <o:p>

A little bit. I'm usually writing more about mood, for the actors, and for
people who are reading it as a story unfolding, not so much so they'll see my
vision as a director. I find that, no matter who you're dealing with -- a music
composer, an actor, or a cameraman -- you're better off expressing the mood of
what you're trying to say, and they usually have a lot more facility within
their discipline. Instead of giving a line reading to an actor, I'll usually
tell them where the character is coming from, what they're dealing with. Telling
them what line to hit tends to limit people and people feel more empowered when
you give them that freedom. Then, if you don't like the choices they're making,
you can adjust them, but together. Chris Doyle's stuff was a lot more
sophisticated than the stuff I would come up with.<o:p>

Literally! He's a powerful, slim, sinewy guy. He's like an ant. He carries this
Ariflex camera on his shoulder, and what must be a 1000 foot mag [film
magazine]. Since Vince and I are both much taller than he is, [Chris] built
these shoes that look like Spice Girls platforms. He had two different sizes --
Vince-size and like a foot shorter, Jon-size. So he'd run around in these huge
Frankenstein boots with this big camera on his shoulders, and he never fell
once! <o:p>

Were there specific ideas that helped you directing, that came from directors
you've worked with?<o:p>

Yes. David Anspaugh, who was my first director, on <i>Rudy</i>, was all about
empowering the actor, making you feel comfortable and appreciated, allowing you
to keep your dignity, and treating you like a man. Being treated like a grown-up
makes you proud to be involved in a film. Directing isn't getting somebody to do
something. You're not cultivating a performance out of someone, peeling the
onion. That's all bullsh*t. The best you can do is do a lot of preparation,
empower people and allow them to be the best they can be: you stay out of their
way and allay their fears. It's like a conductor of a symphony: waving that
baton isn't getting people to play any better, it's just helping to coordinate
everything. It's all in the preparation, the discussion, the planning, the
synchronization. And then you sort of stand in front of the instruments, wave
your arms, and look like you're running the show.<o:p>

I don't feel like I'm necessarily great at what I do. I feel like I have a
certain understanding of the way it works, and have a long way to go. I'm not in
the league of great directors, by any stretch of the imagination. There's a
certain understanding of filmmaking that people like Scorsese, Woody Allen, even
Tarantino have, or Chris Nolan, who did <i>Memento</i>. They're all more
sophisticated directors than I am, but I'm coming to it from where I come from,
which is the people, the words and the acting. And I try to get the best people
I can to help edit and shoot, so I can communicate the story I want to tell, and
little by little I pick up what they do, and become a richer director. In
Hollywood, it's amazing how many people are running around doing things just
because nobody's telling them they can't. It's not like we're designing computer
components or medical equipment, where there's a necessary level of
understanding. It's all about ideas. And the person who is the most self-assured
is probably going to go the furthest, and it's not necessarily because they have
the best ideas [laughs]. <o:p>

Yes. I step in, but I get disappointed fast. There's nothing I would love to do
more than a big-budget, big-studio movie that everybody will see and that has an
impact on that level. But that's also self-limiting, because when you have to
make it so broadly appealing, you deal with &quot;committee creativity.&quot;
And you get into this whole Ayn Rand watershed, where you're not able to aspire
in any one direction with too much intensity, because it starts to scare people.
So you're forced to make very safe material. I mean, I was in a couple of big
studio movies, in supporting parts. But it's not time-efficient. Though, when I
was working on <i>The Replacements</i>, I wrote <i>Made</i>! It came out of the
frustration of being stuck in a hotel room in Baltimore for three months with
nothing to do [laughs]. So, good things come out of every situation.<o:p>

I think you owe them a certain amount of smarts. The ultimate storyteller is
Shakespeare, who was able to get the &quot;groundlings&quot; to laugh at his
bawdy humor and storylines, but could still be studied by scholars to this day,
for the complexity of his language, meter, and symbolism. That's the real guy. I
don't want to be an art-house movie guy, where people who go to film school can
discuss your work, but people who haven't studied cinema can't appreciate it. By
the same token, I don't want to be the guy who's making this commercial pap that
people lap up, but that disappears the minute you leave the theater. I want to
walk that fine line, and I want to do something <b><i>good</i></b>, I want to <i>do</i>
&quot;good&quot; with it. I want people to learn something that will help them
in their lives, and maybe give them a little bit of hope, ultimately. I think <i>Swingers</i>
really accomplished that. Hopefully, <i>Made</i> will touch people and make them
think in a responsible way, as opposed to so many films, where the irresponsible
is rewarded. Maybe I'm coming off too large, but it is something I aspire to.<o:p>

I'm thinking also of someone like Spike Lee, or even Woody Allen, whom studios

I think Spike puts himself in it enough, but not too much. But he's also a film
school guy, from NYU, and he knows to stay in the background as an actor,
because he has a lot to say with the camera. I'm more of a ham. Though, I'd
still like to direct a movie where I'm not in it and see if I could learn more.
But they don't want me in the top slot. If I had Matt Damon playing Bobby, I
would have had a lot more money to make the film [laughs]. If anything, they're
scared that I'm going to want to star in everything! <o:p>

It's great, I love that. But it also slows you down as an actor, because they
don't know how to label you. When I went into <i>The Replacements</i>, they were
like, &quot;You can do comedy?&quot; And that's sort of what I started out
doing. So you're constantly educating people as to who you are. Look at Jennifer
Jason Leigh, such a fantastic actor, and yet, because she has systematically
pushed her career in every different direction, everybody agrees that she's
wonderful but no one can envision her as a &quot;thing.&quot; Whereas, Tom Hanks
has branded himself. He can operate outside of that, but people know what
they're getting. People want the tried and true. I'm guilty of that too, when I
cast. For me and Vince, I tried to change it up as much as a I could, but I
didn't want to disappoint the people who are fans of <i>Swingers</i>. <o:p>

Actually, from the internet, I have a pretty good idea [laughs]. They're maybe a
little younger than me, in their twenties, or from late teens to us aging
gen-xers. They're computer-literate, have built web pages for me and for Vince,
are smart, and like to laugh, but are also very emotional. People who like <i>Swingers</i>
are keying into the heart of the movie as much as the humor. They're people who
have a positive outlook on life and aren't nihilistic nay-sayers. They have
goals in their lives and like watching characters who are going after what they
want. We have a webpage for <i>Made</i>, www.gettingitmade.com, that we put up
while we were shooting the movie. We put that up because we weren't letting
press on the set. We couldn't; it was too distracting, given the amount of time
we had to shoot. So, we put up photos and reports and when people heard rumors,
they'd post it on the bulletin board and I could answer it. And all that turned
into filling people in on where the movie would preview, and linking to online
reviews, which people are usually scared of. I welcome them. A lot of Hollywood
people only know the internet as a place that puts up their face on someone
else's body, or sells their autographs on E-bay [laughs]. I have that going on
too. But I think online is a way for people with common interests to get in
contact with each other. The fact that there's a <i>PCU</i> fan-page out there
-- for this movie that was dumped by the studio -- indicates that there's a cult
following out there. And that's great. For <i>Made</i>, we previewed at the
Alamo Draft House in Austin, so Harry Knowles [www.aintitcoolnews.com] could see
the film. With a film this small, we need the internet, the grassroots support.
It's like <i>Mr. Smith Goes to Washington</i>: if every boy scout sends in a
nickel, we can get this movie out there! <o:p>
