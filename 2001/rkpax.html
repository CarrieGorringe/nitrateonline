            review by <a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>, 26 October

            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color:black">Click 
            your heels together, Dorothy, you're not in Kansas anymore. Situated 
            somewhere between </span>the cautionary military industrial 
            complexes found in half a dozen 1950s sci-fi flicks (particularly <i>
            The Day the Earth Stood Still</i>) and the mischievous cuckoo's nest 
            of Randle Patrick McMurphy and his delusional partners, the 
            sentimental court of <i>K-PAX </i><span style="color:black">is ruled 
            over by Kevin Spacey as king of subdued comic irony. Herein he's 
            Prot (sounds like &quot;oat&quot;), arriving at Grand Central Station in a 
            beam of dust-specked light (Amtrak could make a fortune if they 
            advertised this route—does my AAA discount apply?) and immediately 
            shuttled off to the second floor of the Psychiatric Institute of 
            Manhattan. It seems that New York's finest confuse his day-old 
            beard, good Samaritan efforts, and lack of carry-on baggage as 
            suspicious enough to lock him up in the dapper loony-jail of Dr. 
            Mark Powell (Jeff Bridges), a clinical psychologist who spends most 
            of the film wondering whether his newest patient is an exceedingly 
            amused brother from another planet and/or a certifiable 
            castle-in-the sky nut case. It doesn't help that Prot turns the 
            table on the good-hearted but emotionally starved doctor, 
            befriending everyone he meets (i.e., fellow lock-ups and their 
            attending staff), who greet his K-PAXian homily-laden home cures as 
            wacky, but somehow successful, group remedies for a string of 
            previously unreachable patients. This latter confederacy includes 
            misophobic Ernie (Saul Williams), bromidrosiphobic Sal (Peter Gerety), 
            formerly a doorman at the Plaza, Garboesque agoraphobic Mrs. Archer 
            (Celia Weston), the obsessive-compulsive Howie (David Patrick 
            Kelly), hiding behind thick eyeglasses while looking for the 
            bluebird of happiness, and the battered, silently reclusive Bess (Melanee 
            Murray). All register in their limited, quirky way.</span></font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color:black">Spacey's 
            performance towers above all others in the fourth feature effort 
            from British director</span> Iain Softley. The helmer of <i>Backbeat</i>,
            <i>Hackers</i>, and <i>The Wings of the Dove</i> paints Charles 
            Leavitt's overly sentimental study of the human condition (based on 
            a book by Gene Brewer) with broad references to <i>The Fisher King</i> 
            (also borrowing that film's co-star Jeff Bridges), another 
            compassionate, humorous glimpse of the thin line between sanity and 
            insanity. Opposite Bridges (who played a genteel alien himself in 
            John Carpenter's <i>Starman</i> some seventeen years ago) is the 
            Oscar-winning star of <i>American Beauty</i> viewing our world 
            mostly through darkly colored glasses (&quot;Your planet is really 
            bright!&quot;), the better to stave off inter-galactic jet lag. Dramamine 
            doesn't work in Prot's case (nor does the anti-psychotic Thorazine 
            for that matter), and any brightness above twilight distorts the 
            visitor's vision, with perceptions aglow in spectral shenanigans and 
            soft focus (as photographed by John Mathieson) and accompanied by 
            twinkly music (composed by Edward Shearmur). Yet, it's a wonder to 
            watch as Spacey's spaceman munches on a banana (yes, a real one, 
            peel and all) or dazzles a group of astrophysicists with 
            dramatically believable astral drawings of his planet and its solar 
            system (at the stunning Rose Center for Earth and Space), a thousand 
            light-years from earth—or the average Big Apple commuter's 
            equivalent of 3,210,764,228 Starbucks outlets.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film is a bittersweet tale of a 
            stranger in a strange land, armed with a return ticket and an always 
            pleasant, if sometimes laughably condescending, demeanor. Director 
            Softley tiptoes about his subject with just too much homespun 
            cuteness until just before the final exit, when he has Powell 
            hightailing it out to the Midwest to uncover a five-year-old 
            mystery. I was hoping <i>K-PAX</i> would delve into somewhat more 
            edgy terrain (instead of its relatively plain wrapper), something 
            Terry Gilliam might have visualized if he had tackled this project.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If Spacey's Prot is the film's 
            comic neural center (is that like the whipped cream you find inside 
            a Hostess cupcake?), Bridges' Dr. Powell is the aloof outsider, the 
            dour straight man to his comically-addled patients or his wanting 
            family, which he tends to shut out of his life in his quest for the 
            perfect diagnosis. He can't see the proverbial forest through the 
            trees, caught up in trying to analyze Prot through extended 
            hypnosis, while refusing to deal with a long-standing dysfunctional 
            relationship with his twenty-one-year-old son from an earlier 
            marriage gone bad.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As the mental ward parties in 
            advance of Prot's announced departure on July 27th at 5:51 A.M. (for 
            those detail-obsessives amongst my reading public), tired viewers 
            (after nearly two hours—a light-year or so too long) may not be in 
            as celebratory a mood after the last cliché has been uttered. 
            Spacey's Prot is adorable though, and provides enough diversion to 
            satisfy all but the most cynical in the crowd.</font></td>
