            knows that Brad Pitt is prodigiously appealing. But even though he's
            <i>always</i> on the cover of <i>People</i> magazine, he's not
            really a conventional movie star. While he's certainly popular, as
            well as talented and very pretty (beautiful, really), Pitt actively
            resists the onus of being a star. While more regular celebrities,
            like Leo DiCaprio and Tom Hanks, are paid a lot of money because
            they can &quot;open&quot; films just by being in them, Pitt has
            adopted an alternate route. He opens movies, but he acts as if he'd
            rather not. Aside from a few high profile bungles (<i>Legends of the
            Fall</i> and <i>Meet Joe Black</i> leap to mind), Pitt has been
            fairly assiduous about choosing films that demonstrate that his
            pretty presence can be -- even should be -- overwhelmed by various
            elements, for instance, grisly dead bodies (<i>Seven</i>), CGI
            elephants and Bruce Willis (<i>12 Monkeys</i>), Mulder pretending to
            be a photographer (<i>Kalifornia</i>), many many mountain vistas (<i>Seven
            Years in Tibet</i>), verbal incoherence (<i>Snatch</i>), or
            commercially successful anti-commercial message-making (<i>Fight
            Club</i> -- although, honestly, in this case, Pitt's frequent bare-chestedness
            tends to reinforce his bodily glory, despite and because of all the
            black eyes and bruises). <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            <i>The Mexican</i>, Gore Verbinski's slow-moving, border-crossing
            road picture, Brad Pitt is at it again. Cast in something
            approximating a romantic comedy (though it's not nearly so zany and
            cute and comical as the trailers might lead you to believe),
            opposite Hollywood's very brightest and best-marketed superstar,
            Julia Roberts, he's also trying (sort of, maybe) to stick to his
            anti-movie-star guns. And so he looks caught between a rock and a
            hard place. Poor guy. As much effort as he puts into not being Brad
            Pitt, there he always is -- Brad Pitt. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">On
            its good-looking surface (being well-composed and carefully lit), <i>The
            Mexican</i> is a love story. More precisely, Jerry (Pitt) and
            Samantha (Roberts) are in love but drive each other crazy. They
            actually aren't together for most of the film (which is a good
            thing, because when these characters are together, they're
            monotonous and sometimes unbearable, her especially -- loud and
            whiny), but the plot nominally concerns the efforts of these
            sparring, sparkless partners to &quot;get it together&quot; and love
            each other unconditionally. Even though this happy ending does not
            actually occur on screen, the film hints heavily that it might,
            sometime later, after the final credits are over. Here's a clever
            bit (not): the movie actually begins with the couple's break-up, and
            then spends the rest of its time getting them back together. Jerry
            is a hapless peon in a standard-issue plot, where a couple of
            ruthless gangsters, Nayman (Bob Balaban) and Margolese (Gene Hackman)
            are both wanting desperately to get their hands on a fabulous,
            antique, hand-crafted pistol called &quot;The Mexican.&quot; Nayman
            dispatches Jerry to Mexico to get said pistol, without telling him
            details -- namely, the thing is priceless and it is cursed. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            curse stems from the gun's mythically weighted history, along the
            lines of the Maltese Falcon. You're subjected to three long-winded
            versions of the legend attached to this gun, each in tinted,
            old-style movie footage, so that the story looks special and corny
            at the same time, you know, like the filmmakers are aware that the
            device is clichéd but are using it anyway. Briefly, it was made by
            a Mexican gunsmith long ago, as a present to a nobleman who was to
            marry the gunsmith's daughter; but she's in love with the gunsmith's
            assistant, and in each of the different versions, she or the
            assistant or someone pay dearly for wanting what he or she can't
            have. And so, this gun is supposed to be all about love rather than
            violence, but it ends up inflicting awful violence anyway, as guns
            tend to do. The awfulness is mitigated by the framing of the story
            -- apparently it's funny to watch to the quaint Mexican villagers
            shoot each other unintentionally or deliberately, again and again. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I
            say this understanding that it's also apparently funny to watch the
            present day characters shooting each other -- in a foot or a throat
            on purpose, in a head by accident -- because that's what they do in
            this relentlessly post-Tarantino universe. But for all the shooting
            and posturing, there's not much action here, mostly repeated (and I
            mean, repeated) shots of cars on lonesome Mexican backroads and
            traffic lights swinging in the dusty wind. The <b><i>pistola</i></b>
            that everyone's so hot to possess is essentially a plot device that
            allows the U.S. characters to spend time in hot desert towns across
            the border. Like other recent films set in Mexico (say, <i>Traffic</i>
            and <i>All the Pretty Horses</i>), this one is enthralled by what it
            presents as Mexico's inherent violence, inscrutable exoticism, and
            sweaty-faced &quot;<b><i>banditos</i></b>,&quot; that is, all that
            too-familiar iconography that's &quot;other&quot; from the
            &quot;American&quot; norm. Such representational jingoism is surely
            tired, and has been variously deflated over the years (John Huston
            was wrangling with it way back in 1948's <i>Treasure of the Sierra
            Madre</i>), but this recent revival is particularly troubling,
            because everyone involved should know better by now. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">To
            be fair, <i>The Mexican</i> does spend much of its time casting
            aspersions on U.S. tackiness, in the form of truck stops and Las
            Vegas hotels. While Jerry is finding, losing, retrieving, and then
            re-losing the gun, Samantha -- they've broken up, remember -- is on
            her way to Vegas, where she plans to become a waitress and then a
            croupier, because, she says, she has &quot;the hands for it.&quot;
            En route, she's kidnapped by a hitman named Leroy (James Gandolfini,
            as yet another charming, confused assassin -- will he ever get to
            play another part?), who has been hired to put pressure on Jerry.
            Leroy first nabs Sam by &quot;saving&quot; her from another hit man
            (played by Sherman Augustus and listed in the credits only as the
            &quot;Well-Dressed Black Man&quot; -- let's just say that he's the <b><i>only</i></b>
            black man in the film, and never appears without his way-cool
            shades; i.e., he's as &quot;other&quot; and unknowable as the
            scruffy Mexicans are). This initial encounter sets up Sam and
            Leroy's relationship for the rest of the film -- they're less
            vicious captor and frightened captee than comrades. It's a little
            too endearing, yes. And this endearing nature is exacerbated when
            Leroy outs himself for Sam; the fact that he's gay ostensibly makes
            him sensitive by definition, especially for a hit man. Sam and Leroy
            bond over this little secret (obviously not a good thing to
            circulate within the hit man &quot;community&quot;), advising each
            other on love, trust, and commitment -- it's <i>Will &amp; Grace</i>
            on the road.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Eventually,
            Jerry and Sam will be reunited, if only so they can scrap some more,
            because that is the point, isn't it? Before this happens, Jerry
            spends a few onscreen minutes with his erstwhile partner Ted (J.K.
            Simmons, <i>Oz's</i> resident neo-Nazi, here toned down and wearing
            a &quot;comb-over&quot; wig and touristy Bermuda shorts). While
            searching for the gun and weathering various abuses by locals, these
            two rather inept gangster-wannabes chat about their chosen
            profession, their capacities to commit, and their changing status as
            white men with guns: in Mexico, their usual privilege is somewhat
            diminished. Both learn the hard way that, as Ted puts it, just
            &quot;doing my portion&quot; is not enough to get by when the rules
            change. Pitt and Simmons are very good and quite unflashy in their
            scenes together, subtly revealing how Jerry and Ted are forced to
            renegotiate who they think they are in relation to their shifting
            contexts. It's a lesson that the rest of <i>The Mexican</i> might
            have taken more to heart. <o:p>
