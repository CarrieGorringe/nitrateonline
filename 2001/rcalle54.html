            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Sometimes it takes a flop to
            lead a filmmaker to something more rewarding. When Spanish director
            Fernando Rodríguez Trueba (<i>Belle Époque</i>) was working on his
            stateside debut, <i>Two Much</i>, he incorporated Latin jazz in the
            soundtrack. Gradually, he sought to do more with the music, and <i>Calle
            54</i> is the frequently happy result.</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">An engaging sampler of Latin jazz
            and its permutations, the film features a variety of well-shot and
            edited live performance clips, all of which were shot and recorded
            in a studio on 54<sup>th</sup> street in New York. For beginners, <i>Calle
            54</i> introduces viewers to several of the prominent names in the
            genre including the late Mambo King Tito Puente and Gato Barbieri,
            who composed the score for <i>Last Tango in Paris</i>. For
            connoisseurs, he offers the rare treat by setting up the first and
            possibly only duet to be played by two of the giants, pianist Bebo
            Valdés and bassist Cachao. Despite their advanced ages and mutual
            fame, the two had never played together before.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The idea of simply watching
            musicians play, without the aid of MTV-like gimmicks may seem like a
            dull idea for some, but Trueba has picked a lineup of players whose
            performance styles are oddly photogenic. Valdés’s son, Chucho, is
            a towering, burly man whose delicate piano playing contrasts his
            hulking size. Trueba’s camera follows Brazilian pianist Eliane Elías
            lovingly and gradually reveals that shoes are not part of her
            elegant attire (she operates the pedals with her bare feet). He also
            includes Chano Domínguez, whose music fuses Flamenco traditions
            with jazz and even brings some of the dancers with him into the
            studio. He also shows signs that making such sweet, funky sounds can
            be strenuous. Trumpeter Jerry Gonzales’s hands, like those of the
            percussionists, are covered in bandages, and a look of immense
            relief comes over his when his segment ends. Trueba’s graceful
            orchestration of the visuals is no small feat. Despite the
            improvisational and therefore unpredictable nature of the music,
            Trueba’s camera is always in the right place and the cutting from
            shot-to-shot moves seamlessly.<o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Comparisons between <i>Calle 54</i>
            and <i>Buena Vista Social Club</i>, Wim Wenders’ look at veteran
            Cuban musicians, are inevitable. Both have great tunes and feature
            performers whose vitality belies their longevity. Shot on film, <i>Calle
            54</i> has more stylish images and more polish. The previous film,
            however, had a stronger narrative. Wenders’s film focused
            exclusively on a group of Cuban players who teamed up with American
            guitarist Ry Cooder and his son, drummer Joachim Cooder, Trueba’s
            movie collects musicians from around the globe. Some players like
            Puente and Gonzalez are Yanks, whereas others fly in from Europe to
            take part in the film. As a result, <i>Calle 54</i> seems a diffuse
            between the performance segments. Wenders allowed a viewer to really
            know the musicians, especially singer Ibrahim Ferrer, and as a
            result their concluding concert in New York becomes poignant because
            we see all the struggles they have made to reach that point.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Trueba’s voiceover, on the other
            hand, is more enthusiastic than enlightening. His gushy comments are
            easy to tolerate because the quality of the sequences he has
            assembled backs them up. Whereas, the previous film gave a fairly
            vivid portrait of the societal forces that helped shape the music,
            Trueba, working with a broader subject matter offers mere hints. To
            be fair, these hints are often intriguing. Puente emphatically
            acknowledges the debt he and other Latin jazz musicians owe to
            beboppers Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie. Both he and Gonzales
            explain how Gillespie’s willingness to play with them helped
            establish their legitimacy. Gonzales also recalls how ethnic
            tensions in the Bronx led him to name his band “Fort Apache.”
            It’s also fun to listen to Barbieri and big bandleader Chico
            O'Farrill briefly recall their careers. An elaboration of any of
            these stories could make a good film in itself. Still, the
            disjointed flow is a worthy price for such a diverse selection of
            fine performances.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
