            deliberate, triumph-of-the-little-guy-over-bleak-odds earnestness
            and unlikeliness of <i>The Full Monty</i> or <i>Billy Elliot</i>
            might have been an omen of inevitable formulaic disaster for Irish
            director Paddy Breathnach's <i>Blow Dry</i>. After all, the film has
            been in the can at least a year, it's written by Simon Beaufoy, who
            also scripted <i>The Full Monty</i>, and its American distributor --
            Miramax -- has released it with nary a whimper. And it follows on
            the very heightened heels of a film with similar -- if campier --
            sensibilities, <i>The Big Tease</i>.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's
            all enough to lead a viewer to believe no one had faith in the
            project. But I'd rather watch <i>Blow Dry</i> -- which was
            originally titled <i>Never Better</i> - any day than the
            over-zealous message of <i>Billy Elliot</i> if only because its cast
            is so damned fine and so capable of taking the predictable pap that
            defines this new wave of English working class comedy/dramas, and
            performing some revisionist miracles through sheer force and the
            charisma of talent and personality.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Transcending
            another predictable storyline, Brits Alan Rickman, Bill Nighy and
            Natasha Richardson, Australia's Rachel Griffiths and up-and-comer
            Yanks Josh Hartnett and Rachael Leigh Cook simmer surprisingly in
            this crockpot unspooling in the small town of Keighley, where the
            British National Hair Championships are about to take place.<o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            championships are a prickly thorn for its residents. Town barber
            Phil Allen (Rickman) has resigned himself to a third-class career
            after his wife, Shelley (Richardson) left him high and dry at a
            competition ten years earlier. Shelley ran off with Phil's hair
            model, Sandra (Griffiths), forsaking their son, Brian (Hartnett),
            marriage and a promising professional profile on the salon circuit.<o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Worse,
            Phil's old nemesis, Ray Roberts (Nighy), has re-emerged in order to
            claim the title and seal his name as champ of champs. Unaware of her
            dad's propensity for cheating and tilting the odds, Ray's daughter
            Christine (Cook) accompanies him on his grand prix appearance. In a
            Romeo-and-Juliet scenario, former childhood pals Brian and Christine
            reunite, replaying not a balcony scene, but a hair-coloring
            flirtation in the town's morgue and upon the recently deceased,
            whose hair &quot;continues to grow&quot; after they've expelled
            their last breath.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's
            this kind of oddball precociousness that relegates the film to the
            grit-your-teeth pile of precious, tired scenes and yet <i>Blow Dry</i>
            plays better than it is because of its cast. Rickman allows us a
            real insight into Phil's shift in thinking and of heart and
            Richardson emits warmth and concern for the distaff family she would
            like to see reunited -- especially in light of a secret she harbors.<o:p>

            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still,
            as in almost every film she makes, it's Rachel Griffiths -- so
            libidinously good in <i>Muriel's Wedding</i> and <i>Jude</i>, and
            heartbreaking in <i>Hilary and Jackie</i> and <i>My Son, the Fanatic</i>
            -- who grabs every scene she's in and wrings the essence out of it.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There's
            a slow build to her emotional graft in this film, and while she
            appears frivolous and flighty in its initial moments, Sandra's
            chrysallis from flake to formidability feels real and grounded in
            her genuine love and affection for Shelley as well as a generosity
            of spirit that has overcome her relegation to the shadows due to the
            nature of her relationship. It could have been just another plot
            machination that grinds the film to a dead halt. And just when the
            temperature floats at a tepid degree, the heat turns up once again.
            In its climactic finale Griffiths ascends, raising the pulse with a
            show stopping turn that is pure theatrical dazzle. Had this cast not
            signed on to <i>Blow Dry</i> it would certainly deserve the
            less-than-stellar push it's been given. But this is an anomoly, the
            rare script that is actually made better because of its actors. The
            theory that even a bad actor can survive a good script works in
            reverse here; a mediocre script shines due to the sheer deftness of
            acting prowess and the outrageous fortune of its design team. Never
            mind that the writer and director are probably the least useful of
            presences on this set.</font></span><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"></o:p>
