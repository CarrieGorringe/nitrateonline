            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 2 November 
            2001</i></font><p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">What exactly is 
            John Travolta protecting his family from in <i>Domestic Disturbance</i>? 
            After the opening half-hour, this becomes more and more unclear, and 
            the characters aren't the only ones in the dark. Some serious 
            fiddling appears to have been done with the film in order to create 
            some basis for concern, but the results are, to say the least, worse 
            than devastating. </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Travolta plays Frank, a divorced 
            father who must decide if his twelve-year-old son Danny (Matt 
            O'Leary) is telling the truth when he says that his new stepfather, 
            Rick (Vince Vaughn), is a menace. Frank is shown as being willing to 
            go a long way towards bridging the gap, or any potential thereof,&nbsp; 
            between himself and Rick for Danny's sake. For his part, Rick seems 
            to be trying to put whatever was in his past behind him and make a 
            clean start, first with his marriage (to Frank's ex-wife, played by 
            the talented Teri Polo), then by becoming a model businessman in the 
            small community where they all live, even taking out a huge contract 
            with Frank's boat-building company (even though you're not entirely 
            too sure how Rick makes a living or where he gets his money from). 
            Then, along comes an old associate of Rick's, who starts hanging 
            about the place and making oblique references to something being 
            owed him. (In case we have any doubts as to his character, Steve 
            Buscemi has been cast in the part.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Rick ends up going so far as to 
            dispose of his old crony altogether, tossing him into a brick kiln.&nbsp; 
            Danny sees the whole thing, but the police dismiss the boy's story 
            because the kid has continually gotten into trouble with local 
            authorities in the past, even before his mother married Rick, thus 
            marring Danny's credibility. Why, then, would Rick suddenly turn his 
            murderous attentions towards Danny and, later, Danny's father? Since 
            the police don't believe a murder was ever committed in the first 
            place, the obvious move would be to play-it-normal and be 
            inconspicuous. Instead, Rick starts torching buildings and chasing 
            after people with a crowbar.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Is Rick tainted by his past, or is 
            he just culpable? If he's got anything further to hide, we never 
            find out about it. After a methodical set-up, parts of the rest of 
            the film feel like they've been dropped, or yanked, from view. 
            There's a cigarette lighter that figures in the second part of the 
            story, but its significance is never explained. In one scene, Frank 
            strikes, and then apologizes to, a character whom we're supposed to 
            know by name but who hasn't been previously introduced into the 
            narrative. The movie loses its plausibility faster than sand running 
            through a sieve: by the time it's over, it's more like a phantom 
            limb, something in place of where a movie used to be.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Poor Vince Vaughn has never 
            entirely recovered from playing a rangy, country-western version of 
            Norman Bates in the 1998 version of <i>Psycho</i>. (It was an 
            interesting approach, but, still....) John Travolta, on the other 
            hand, looks like a million bucks: he may be our last real movie 
            star, but this picture, like the earlier <i>Swordfish</i>, is small 
            potatoes stuff, and he's coasting. Hopefully, we'll once again have 
            a chance to see him in something which will fully engage his 
            abilities as both an actor and a star.</font></td>
