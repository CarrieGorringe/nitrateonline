            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>During the opening moments of <i>Swordfish</i>,
            John Travolta, wearing dark clothing and seated against a dark
            background, begins speaking about the 1975 film <i>Dog Day Afternoon</i>,
            in which Al Pacino played a man who held several people in a bank
            hostage. Was there anything wrong with the film? Watching Travolta
            as he talks, the camera shifts about, moves out of, then in to,
            focus, as if mimicking the twists and turns of his unfolding
            argument. In the film, Travolta says, Pacino would've gotten a lot
            more results, and quicker, if he had started executing hostages
            right away -- not just one, but several. That would've made an
            impression, although what endeared people to the film, at the time,
            was the fact that Al Pacino's character was not an evil person.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Travolta's quick, artful delivery
            of this scene draws us in before we even have a chance to say,
            &quot;Tarantino, anybody?&quot; And then the entire scene jumps
            back, and we find out that we're not in the middle of a one-on-one
            conversation, but in the middle of another hostage crisis, a huge
            one, with bombs planted everywhere, ready to go off. And when one of
            them does, the picture takes a balletic, 180-degree slow turn around
            the occurrence, so that we get a clear look at all of what ensues,
            glass shards, objects in mid-air, billows of fire -- the works. If
            it had stopped there, <i>Swordfish</i> would have been fine.
            Instead, the story skips back to show us what lead up to that event,
            and the movie immediately turns into trash.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hugh Jackman, a computer hacker and
            convicted felon out on parole, is whacking golf balls in the middle
            of the Texas oil plains when Halle Berry shows up, shakes her fanny
            at him, and gets him to fly out with her to meet with her boss
            (Travolta) in L.A., where he makes the hacker an irresistible offer,
            even if it would land him in jail again: create a computer
            &quot;worm&quot; that would infiltrate financial accounts and
            abscond with their holdings. The hacker, desperate for money so he
            can get his young daughter (Camrym Grimes) away from his
            pills-and-booze-soaked ex-wife and her porn-king boyfriend (how
            these two people have managed to retain sole custody of the child is
            never delved into), agrees. Don Cheadle turns up as a police
            inspector who, when the hacker attempts to elude him by, literally,
            throwing himself over a cliff, throws himself over the cliff right
            after him, with the camera following him down, down, down -- a scene
            that will doubtless epitomize how an immensely talented actor can be
            immensely wasted in a movie for years to come.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Then, two-thirds of the way
            through, it turns out that Travolta's bar sinister character and his
            gang are going to bust into a bank to get the dough they're after.
            So the whole computer hacker, infiltrate-from-the-outside plotline
            has been for naught! Why this sudden and complete jettisoning of the
            plotline (and, possibly, the audience)? The director Dominic Sena,
            who last year gave is all those ear-splitting, pea-brained car
            chases and crashes in <i>Gone in 60 Seconds</i>, likes to race
            things around and blow stuff up real good. So, here, we end up with
            a whole lot of car chases, car crashes, explosions, crash-and-burn,
            and, in one of the most idiotic spectacles in years, a bomb-laden
            bus being hoisted, on cables, by helicopter and flown over the
            skyscrapers of Los Angeles.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Well, Hugh Jackman shows,
            particularly in his scenes with young Camryn Grimes, that he is an
            actor just waiting for a good role in a great movie to happen.
            Travolta can still squeeze a little bit more juice out of his
            smiling, debonair devil persona. Don Cheadle is hopefully still in
            one piece so that he can go on to work in movies more deserving of
            his abilities. And, oh, yes, as promised on the recent M.T.V. Movie
            Awards telecast, Halle Berry does show us her bodaceous-ta-tas,
            albeit only for a second or two, and it does nothing to take our
            minds off of the fact that all four lead actors would be better off
            working in some other, any other, movie than this.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            by the way, was the password Groucho had to give Chico in order to
            get into the speakeasy in &quot;Horsefeathers.&quot; Maybe THAT'S
            the movie Travolta, Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry and Don Cheadle
            should've made.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
