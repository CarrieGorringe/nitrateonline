            turns out to be an attempt at an old-fashioned romantic epic, the
            type of thing David Lean used to pull off all the time, sometimes
            with varying success (i.e. <i>Ryan's Daughter</i>, which Penelope
            Gilliatt likened to the Hedy Lamarr movie <i>Ecstasy</i> blown up to
            the proportions of <i>The Fall of the Roman Empire</i>). After
            watching some of this movie, though, I began to wish that Lean were
            still around so he could take charge of this one.</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In a sunny seaside Greek village in
            1940, the daughter (Spanish-born actress Penélope Cruz) of the
            local physician (U.K. actor John Hurt) becomes engaged to one of the
            local boys (U.K./U.S. actor Christian Bale) just as Fascist Italy
            declares war or Greece. The fiancé goes off to fight, disappears,
            comes back, then takes off again to join the partisans (gee, he's no
            fun) just as the Italians roll into town.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Among them is Capt. Antonio Corelli
            (Italian-American actor Nicolas Cage), who signals his good
            intentions right away when he first spots the physician's daughter,
            Pelagia, and order the men in his garrison to salute by saying,
            &quot;'Bella bambina' at two o'clock!&quot; He not only loves opera
            (the men under his command are required to sing in his self-formed
            opera club), soulfully plays the mandolin (which is slung over his
            back, in a sack), and professes never to have fired a gun in his
            life (!), but he's billeted with the physician and Pelagia. After
            organizing a goodwill dance in the village square to winnow down the
            last of the locals' resistance to their occupying forces, Antonio
            and Pelagia finally succumb to each other's charms, after which
            Mussolini's government falls and the Italian Army is ordered to
            disarm and place themselves under the command of the Nazis.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The picture seems to have fallen
            under the same fate that befell <i>All the Pretty Horses</i>,
            another Miramax co-production, in which the powers-that-be, after
            having made the movie, couldn't decide just how they wanted it to
            end, so they simply hammered and pounded away at the footage. How
            much of a movie there was to begin with is debatable, since the
            dialogue includes lines such as, &quot;There's going to be a war.
            Terrible things happen in war&quot;, &quot;There have been many
            massacres. There will be more.... Don't make any plans.&quot;, and
            &quot;I want to lie across the road so you can't leave.&quot; The
            first hour is merely torpid, enlivened by the occasional half-nude
            group frolic on the beach, impromptu outbursts of singing, and
            Corelli heroically taking it upon himself to detonate a floating
            mine the size of a Buick which has washed ashore on the nearby
            beach. The plot keeps the characters played by Cruz and Cage apart
            for an hour, and by the time they finally get together, we don't
            have any time to care about them one way or the other as the picture
            plunges into its calamitous second hour, which is nothing less than
            an abysmal mess: battle sequences where you can't tell who is
            bombing or shooting at whom, a mass murder which has a risible
            dramatic twist to it, more shootings, a lynching, and even an
            earthquake. The movie not only loses track of two of its main
            characters, who vanish without explanation, but it also loses track
            of Corelli's mandolin, which only happens to be the central metaphor
            (civility and beauty amidst chaos and ugliness) for the whole story,
            and there are some glaring historical errors, such as the reporting
            that Mussolini surrendered to Allied authorities. (Mussolini fled
            Italy after being ousted from power by his own government, which
            then quickly tried to organize an Italian republic before the Nazis
            came crashing in. He then briefly returned to Italy, only to be
            strung up on a lamp post by his own countrymen and killed.)</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Penélope Cruz performs well,
            particularly in her scenes opposite the towering Irene Papas (the
            filmmakers at least got one genuine Greek performer to appear in the
            film), but she seems to be withering under the pressure to become a
            Major Hollywood Movie Star. Nicolas Cage plays Corelli with a
            mellifluous <b><i>Italiano</i></b> accent, which takes a little
            getting used to at first. There is nothing phony, though, about the
            way he uses his smile, his gaze, his gestures, and sometimes his
            whole body to express a genuine and fervent appreciation of life and
            beauty. What happens to his character should be a lot more affecting
            in the film than it is (though readers of Louis de Bernières'
            novel, on which the film is based, should be aware that the ending
            in the film is different than the one in the novel), but by the time
            its conclusion arrives the picture has become excruciating.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When David Lean was filming <i>Ryan's
            Daughter</i> on the coast of Britain, the film's studio, MGM,
            changed ownership, and the new president, Jim &quot;Smiling
            Cobra&quot; Aubrey, sent a representative to shut Lean's production
            down. Lean met with the representative, listened to what he had to
            say, nodded, waited until the representative went away -- and then
            went right ahead and made the picture exactly the way he had planned
            to all along. Lean had two Oscar-winning pictures under his belt by
            that time; John Madden, who directed <i>Captain Corelli's Mandolin</i>,
            has one (<i>Shakespeare in Love</i>), and one can only speculate as
            to whether or not he tried to tell people where to get off while he
            was trying to make this picture.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
