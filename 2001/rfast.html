            was surprised as heck when Ja Rule showed up in an early scene in <i>The
            Fast and the Furious</i>. The ads I've seen don't mention him and I
            haven't seen him promoting the film anywhere. But I was glad to see
            him, given that the first several minutes of the movie -- before he
            arrived at a nighttime drag race somewhere in an eerily deserted
            section of Los Angeles -- were looking very familiar. The plot
            involves some bad street racers, led by Dom (Vin Diesel, who most
            definitely is living up to his turbocharged name), who steal
            truckloads of DVD players (they're reeeally bad!), and a good young
            cop, Brian (Paul Walker), assigned to &quot;Donnie Brasco&quot; his
            way inside their organization in order to send them to the slammer.</b>

            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ja
            Rule has nothing to do with any of this. As far as I could tell,
            he's a local racer with a fast car, a smart mouth, and too much free
            time at night. In another movie, Ja Rule (according to the credits,
            his character's name is Edwin !!) would have been somehow implicated
            in the crimes or brought on board by the undercover cop or died a
            flamboyant fiery-car-crash death. If you're going to cast someone as
            charismatic as this currently hot R&amp;B/hip-hop crossover star,
            you should make use of him, you know, integrate him into the plot.
            But in <i>The Fast and the Furious</i> (based on &quot;a magazine
            article by Ken Li&quot;), Ja Rule provides a minute of
            &quot;diversity&quot; -- at the car race, the Latinos, the Asians,
            the black guys, and the white guys all hang with their own
            like-raced crews (excuse me: they call them &quot;teams&quot; in
            this movie). For Ja Rule's part, it appears he's making a career
            move, maybe following the usual hiphop-star-to-movie-star
            trajectory, from posse-member to music videos to supporting roles to
            Will Smithdom. <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            this film, though, the career looks stalled. Ja Rule does nothing
            but lose a car race and then get dissed by a girl. He doesn't go to
            the after-race party at Dom's. He doesn't get chased by the cops
            like Brian and Dom. He doesn't even have to tangle with the
            motorcycle-riding, seriously grudge-holding Chinese guys, Johnny
            Tran (Rick Yune) and Lance (you heard me, Lance, played by Reggie
            Lee), also like Brian and Dom. No, he's just gone from the movie.
            And he should thank his lucky stars. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">That's
            not to say <i>The Fast and the Furious</i> is only terrible or
            ignorant, though it mostly is. It's also vroom-vroomy, delivering
            many pay-off shots of cars flipping, burning, and spinning, the
            usual stuff you see in car movies. And to a point, that's what makes
            the film work out just fine -- it knows what it is -- it's fast and
            yes, it's furious -- and never pretends to be something else. But
            because the driving scenes are so cool, you might be inclined to
            watch the rest of what happens -- say, the tedious expository scenes
            that tell you how Brian's dealing emotionally with being a young and
            pretty cop who may or may not be getting seduced by his beautiful
            surveillance subject Dom -- with a kind of impatience. Really, what
            you want to see is more driving, more screeching and crashing. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Luckily,
            just about everyone in this movie is a driver (save for the
            relatively sedate, old-school cops giving Brian a hard time), all
            jonesing for the best &quot;ten second car&quot; (this means
            something specific: I think it has to do with what you can do with a
            Honda Civic to make it raceworthy). Dom's the best driver, of
            course, Brian's a gutsy one, Johnny Tran is a ferocious one, and
            Edwin, well, yeah, he's not so good, which explains why he's out of
            the picture in five minutes. Even the girls get into the picture:
            when Brian falls for Dom's &quot;kid sister&quot; Mia (Jordana
            Brewster), you could care less if they go to bed after their nice
            restaurant scene. What you really want to know is, how does she <b><i>drive</i></b>?
            (Answer: all right for a girl, though her giggly careening around
            corners looks more show-offy than skillful, whereas when the boys
            drive, it's serious business.) Dom has a solid driver for a
            girlfriend, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez, of <i>Girlfight</i> breakout
            fame -- and she should be doing something better with her time), and
            she does get to race (and defeat) a presumptuous dread-headed guy.
            But her primary function is to look fine in a grease-stained
            wife-beater t-shirt. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Which
            leaves us with the primary drama between Dom and Brian. Director Rob
            Cohen (whose last film was <i>The Skulls</i>, also featuring Walker)
            appears to have an interest in guy-bonding by rituals, but he and
            screenwriters Gary Scott Thompson, Erik Berquist, and David Ayer
            haven't quite figured out how to make these rituals relevant to the
            rest of the planet's population. The &quot;undercover cop being
            seduced by the lifestyle he's investigating&quot; is a potentially
            compelling, if well-worn idea, but <i>The Fast and the Furious</i>
            isn't even as engaging as the movie that it most resembles, Kathryn
            Bigelow's <i>Point Break</i> (a movie whose investigation of
            anxieties shaping homosocial community and competition is actually
            quite shrewd, if you can get past Keanu Reeves' &quot;Hey dude&quot;
            affect and Patrick Swayze's hair). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            <i>The Fast and the Furious</i>, questions about competition and
            brotherhood are given short shrift, and the lack is disguised by
            some corny faux-bonding scenes, in which Dom and Brian exchange
            glances and share heartfelt backstories. Or rather, since Brian is
            lying during most of their relationship, it's Dom who spills his
            guts about his dad's race-car death and his own
            vicious-and-perversely-self-righteous assault on the driver who
            caused the accident; sheesh, Brian almost gets teary over this tale,
            told in a garage where the light filters in through the window just
            so, and Dom's silhouette looks haunted and fragile. (Briefly -- we
            are talking about Vin Diesel here.) Then Brian realizes that,
            despite appearances and the fact that Dom beat that dad-killer
            driver almost to death, Dom is an upstanding citizen. And then,
            Brian realizes that his daddy-cop-superiors, specifically the tough
            but also tender Sergeant Tanner (Ted Levine), can be wrong -- they
            had him convinced that Dom is a psycho-loser. Fortunately, Brian
            sees the light, and comes to understand, as he puts it hisownself,
            that Dom is a &quot;complicated guy,&quot; as well as a visionary
            and a pillar of morality (and compared to the cops and feds in this
            movie, he probably is). <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            authorities and their concerns with law, property, and so-called
            justice aren't really the focus here -- they're just pretext for
            Brian's personal dilemmas (Should he sleep with Mia? Should he tell
            off the creepy guy who's nosing around her? And gee, do you think
            she'll be upset when she finds out he's been lying to her?). These
            dilemmas all come down to the inevitable moment that he must confess
            his deception and beg for forgiveness. (And in case you didn't quite
            get which relationship is primary, the long and drawn out
            horrified-reaction-to-this-news scene is not Mia's but Dom's.) That
            Brian's betrayal gets twisted around into a positive thing is only
            one of several narrative miracles of this movie. Others involve cars
            outrunning trains, characters popping in and out, Brian's ability to
            maintain any deception for any length of time, Mia's inexplicable
            affection for Brian, and the stunning refurbishment of a beater car
            that Brian brings over to the garage, so he and Dom can work on it
            together! <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And
            this is the point, this shared love of doodling around in an engine
            with their arms filthy with oil, their faces smeared with sweat and
            anti-freeze. There's a lot of metal and rubber and sparks and blood
            flying around here (eventually, one of these truck drivers gets
            tired of being ripped off, so he hauls out a shotgun to protect the
            DVD players ... I guess anyone who drives anything in this film
            comes equipped with a testosterone issue). But the movie isn't
            really about breaking laws, being punished, lamenting Ja Rule's
            teeny part, or even learning how to be a man. It's really about
            cars. If that sounds like a metaphor, well, okay. <o:p>
