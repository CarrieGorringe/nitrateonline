            Jane Goodale (Ashley Judd). She just can't get a date in New York.
            She's got a good job booking talent for a popular TV talk show, nice
            enough apartment, great wardrobe, and, of course, a chatty and
            sympathetic best friend, Liz (Marisa Tomei). In other words, Jane is
            a character in a '00s romantic comedy, and so, she will endure some
            ninety minutes worth of joke-worthy heartache and loss before she
            will find the man of her dreams, who has been right under her nose
            all along, only disguised as the opposite of the someone she's
            looking for.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            is, of course, a familiar strategy in romantic comedies, one that
            makes them rather like buddy movies, only without the high-tech
            weaponry and car chases. From <i>Bringing Up Baby</i> to <i>My Man
            Godfrey</i> and <i>Save the Last Dance</i> to <i>The Wedding Planner</i>,
            the emotional trajectory of partners-to-be in this genre is
            predictable, and when you don't follow the rules, as <i>Chasing Amy</i>
            or <i>Forces of Nature</i> were brave enough to do, the consequences
            are usually dire, that is, quick -- and infamous -- box office
            failure. <o:p>

            <p><i><font size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Someone

            is not out to break any rules; in fact, it's more inclined to
            reinvent them. Based on Laura Zigman's best-selling novel, <i>Animal
            Husbandry</i>, the film offers a standard plot, in which Jane's
            inability to find a decent guy is made clear by a preliminary
            disastrous relationship. There are any number of cues that her
            boyfriend Ray is a bad choice, not least being that he's played by
            Greg Kinnear, who's made a bit of a career out of playing exactly
            this self-interested, glib, superficially charming character (even
            in the <i>A Smile Like Yours</i>, where he was the romantic lead, he
            acted glib and self-interested). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></span></font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And,
            even if you grant that Jane has somehow managed never to see a Greg
            Kinnear movie, you'd hope she'd take notice of Ray's corny khakis
            and smirky facial expressions, not to mention his general inability
            to focus on her. But she's so giddy and cute, so happy to be with
            him -- literally blowing dust off her diaphragm for their first
            sexual encounter -- that you almost wish it would work out. But then
            you see the cheesy romantic montagey sequence, where the couple
            spends time in the park and in bed, making googly eyes and giggling
            like the proverbial school-kids, just twenty minutes into the movie,
            and you know that it's all too good to last. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Indeed,
            there's a wrench in the works from the start, and that is that Ray
            has a girlfriend, whose invisibility is mostly fine with Jane.
            Trying to mollify her own sense that something's amiss, Jane spends
            much of this early part of the movie with Liz, which is great
            because Marisa Tomei is so delightful and Liz is slightly less mushy
            a character than Jane -- but then you might start to wish that maybe
            Liz was the protagonist rather than the best friend, or better, that
            Liz and Jane might hook up. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">By
            that time, the movie is galumphing headlong toward Jane's second
            romance, which is hindered briefly by her immediate response to the
            Ray fiasco, which comes when they're supposed to move into a
            fabulous apartment together and he decides to dump her and go back
            to the first girlfriend. In desperate need of a place to live and a
            way to make Ray jealous, Jane moves in -- as roommates only -- with
            another guy from work, the dashingly handsome and relentlessly
            womanizing Eddie (Hugh Jackman, a.k.a. <i>X-Men's</i> Wolverine,
            another fellow whose movie history might give pause). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Once
            ensconced at Eddie's place, she observes his behavior (short
            version: he brings home a different girl every night), correlates it
            with Ray's, reads a few anthropology books, and watches
            &quot;Discovery Channel&quot; documentaries on mammalian mating
            habits. Mixed with her anger and frustration, all this activity
            results in what she calls the &quot;New Cow Theory&quot; (the very
            formulation that structures Zigman's book, and provides the film
            with a book-like frontispiece and some journal-like entries for
            exposition). This is actually a very old theory dressed up in cutesy
            black and white hide -- men sow their seed and women want
            commitment. But it is a theory that, as Jane points out, allows her
            to believe that it's not her fault that she has only met the wrong
            guys, because there simply are no right ones. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            everyday as it is, this idea might pass for okay if the film wasn't
            so hung up on it. For a minute, it looks like <i>Someone Like You</i>
            might take this overripe and silly theory to task, when Jane writes
            it up as a pseudonymous column for the glossy men's magazine where
            Liz is an editor. The column hits a popular nerve and suddenly the
            non-existent author is sought out by talk show hosts, including
            Jane's diva-boss, Diane (Ellen Barkin). You see where this part of
            the movie is going, and unfortunately, it doesn't have time along
            the way to critique the pop-culture industry that makes stars out of
            people who know how to market bad ideas for lots of money. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Instead,
            <i>Someone Like You</i> follows formula, which means that Jane will
            realize her folly and realize that Eddie is really the guy for her
            (this is telegraphed when the pretty couple shares their feelings
            and eats Chinese food while seated on the kitchen counter and
            dressed in their fashionable underwear). For all this business as
            usual, the film features a couple of secondary storyline moments,
            especially having to do with a crisis suffered by Jane's sister and
            brother-in-law, which puts her &quot;ordeal&quot; in perspective.
            Poignant without being too goopy, these moments show that director
            Tony Goldwyn retains the subtle, unsentimental touch that he brought
            to his first film, the terrific <i>A Walk on the Moon</i>. And that
            makes you hope that his next film won't be so constrained by generic
            patterns. <o:p>
