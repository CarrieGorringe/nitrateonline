            is more in Francois Ozon's marvelous mystery which slyly finds
            resolution by not resolving itself. It's a beguiling, interiorized
            and spare piece that's grounded with an extraordinary performance by
            Charlotte Rampling. Rampling, if you recall, is the '60s/'70s
            British screen siren whose svelte presence and cobra eyes graced <i>The
            Night Porter </i>and Woody Allen's best movie, <i>Stardust Memories</i>
            and who, after a long stretch raising children and taking only a few
            small roles - <i>Wings of the Dove</i> for one - has returned to
            movies (she's a marvel in Jonathan Nossiter's <i>Signs &amp; Wonders</i>)
            with a vengeance. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Here
            she's Marie, a fiftyish college professor in Paris, teaching the
            novellas of Virginia Woolf and quoting <i>The Waves</i> to her class
            with prophetic haunting. Marie is relishing the upcoming summer
            holiday and she and her sloth-like, hulking husband, Jean (Bruno
            Cremer), are on their way to Jean's family beach house. The couple
            arrive and ready the house, eat spaghetti, drink an old bottle of
            wine and discuss their plans for their first day of vacation.</font><font size="2" face="Verdana">&nbsp;<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Next
            morning they're on the way to the beach. Jean says he's going for a
            swim. Marie replies she's going to read a paperback. He rubs lotion
            on her back and ambles to the water. She fades into a deep,
            sun-stoked sleep. When she awakes, Jean is nowhere to be found.
            Marie runs up and down the beach, asking a couple if they've seen
            her husband. No one has. She races to the shore police and an
            investigation is begun. But Jean has disappeared. Has he drowned -
            or has he plotted the abandonment and left her? <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="2" face="Verdana">After
            the film returns to Paris, Marie seems at peace with her solitary
            life. But we begin to see that Jean has never left her. She prepares
            meals, talks to her husband, greets him when she returns from dinner
            at a colleague's home and accepts the advances of a businessman who
            is smitten with her. To the world's eyes she is functioning
            perfectly after her loss. But Marie resolutely rejects any one or
            thing that appears final as far as Jean's absence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>And that is the element that propels <i>Under the Sand</i>
            over its kin. This is no sexual-hysteria piece like Roman Polanski's
            <i>Repulsion</i>, in which Catherine Deneuve becomes murderously
            unbalanced. Indeed, the fantasy Marie fuels is preferential, almost
            a life choice to Marie, even if her friends think otherwise and Jean
            is only a manifestation of her denial. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Slowly
            Ozon turns this lean storyline into a complexity of middle-age
            crisis. Marie's reading of Woolf - &quot;What have I lost? I have
            lost my youth&quot; - becomes key to this astute film. More
            amazingly, Ozon, only in his 30's, delves into the corners of a
            middle-age woman's mind, grasping her fear of the future and that
            which is unknown. <o:p>

            has been compared to Alfred Hitchcock's films but I find it more
            elliptical and deft and with a firmer grip on that elusive woman's
            terrain - a place Hitch knew little about. It's to Ozon's credit
            that he can interchange the equations of possibility in his movies
            and make us believe them too. His lean visuals compliment the
            action, giving us only the essential information we need with hardly
            any gloss or peripheral artiness to distract us from Marie's
            prejudiced point of view. By the end, he - and Rampling - conjure up
            a ghost story that haunts because its ghosts lie within the living,
            not the dead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">&nbsp;
