            roaring similar words in the original, 1968 <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Planet
            of the Apes </i>will get a solid belly laugh when this slightly
            revised complaint jumps off the screen during Tim Burton’s
            stylish, darkly beautiful remake.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Jurassic Park 3</i>,
            Burton’s version of Pierre Boulle’s classic sci-fi novel uses
            self-referential humor to pepper his visually gorgeous,
            tightly-wound comic book spin. Unlike that other dinosaur-driven
            blockbuster, however, this film has the stamp of a visionary genius
            etched over every hairy, flea-bitten inch of it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>As with his earlier films, including <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Batman</i>,
            <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Pee Wee’s Big Adventure</i>,
            <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Edward Scissorhands</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Sleepy
            Hollow</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Ed Wood</i>, and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Mars Attacks</i>,
            you can tell that Burton’s not just in it for a paycheck. He
            injects a melancholy, detail-driven sense of imagination into <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Planet of the Apes</i> that makes this ambitious puppy his own.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;<o:p>

            and its colorful palette of shaggy simians. There was the cautious,
            intellectual Cornelius (Roddy McDowall), his bleeding-heart wife
            Zira (Kim Hunter), the battle-hungry, hotheaded gorilla soldiers,
            and brooding, snooty orangutan politicians. Like the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Star
            Wars</i> series that would follow, the Apes cast a magic spell as
            they tormented homo sapiens through five films. Charlton Heston
            dominated the first movie as an astronaut who landed onto a backward
            planet where apes, not humans, were the ruling species.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Meanwhile, men, women, and children were lowly, mute cattle
            to be harvested, caged, and stuffed by simian taxidermists. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Beneath

            Conquest of the Planet of the Apes </i>and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Battle

            progressively more forgettable fashion.<o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And that makeup!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Putty-encrusted actors donning monkey makeup were forgiven
            the fact that their stiff mandibles never seemed to move in time
            with the lines, by a generation weaned on<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">
            Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp</i>. For pre-Industrial Light and Magic
            times, makeup artists John Chambers’ primate alterations were
            still groundbreaking stuff, not to be upstaged until Rick Baker (who
            provides state-of-the-art makeup in this outing, as well) turned
            David Naughton into a growling, snarling Canis lupus in 1981’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">An
            American Werewolf in London</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Growing up in the heyday of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Apes</i>
            fever, I can recall snatching comic books, fanzines, action figures
            and lunch boxes off retail store racks at the speed of a frisky
            gibbon chasing a mate from tree to tree. However, my perception
            changed with adulthood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Upon
            more recent dissection, I found the original <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Apes</i> movie to be overstated and cornball, like a comic book refusing
            to see itself as a comic book. Some saw the film as a metaphor for
            race relations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Others
            perceived it as a cautionary, post-cold war anti-nuke tale.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>I viewed it as a bunch of guys in ape suits taking themselves
            way too seriously.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Burton, the weirdo genius supreme
            who adorned Johnny Depp with Freddy Kruegeresque metallic upper
            extremities in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Edward Scissorhands</i>, was a natural choice to resurrect the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Apes</i>
            legacy. He knows that talking monkeys in uniforms are cool in the
            same way that his other screen heroes, like the caped crusader <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Batman
            </i>and the undead comedian <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Beetlejuice</i>,
            are cool. All the same, however, Burton also sees the outlandishness
            of this premise, and succeeds in ways that the first Apes franchise
            failed by refusing to push for serious social commentary. After all,
            this <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">is</i> all about talking monkeys in uniforms.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Right from the get-go, the
            revisited <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Planet of the Apes </i>charges forth and never gives us time to breathe,
            with Danny Elfman’s forceful, epic score thrusting things into
            overdrive.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Mark
            Wahlberg plays Leo, an astronaut from the future, who is introduced
            from a space research station where he dutifully trains chimps to
            navigate pods on missions where human helming of the vehicles would
            be too risky.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>During a
            frantic electromagnetic storm, Leo’s prized monkey is launched
            from the station by some surly superiors to brave turbulence.
            &quot;He’s the canary,&quot; points out a higher-up to Leo,
            &quot;and there’s the coal mine.&quot;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The stubborn Leo, however, objects
            to the use of chimps for such perilous expeditions. When the
            spacebound guinea-pig ape sets his craft adrift and off-target,
            it’s Leo to the rescue. &quot;Never send a monkey to do a man’s
            job,&quot; he vents to his supervisors before jumping into his own
            pod and launching off to save the chimp and its endangered vessel.
            It’s a doomed mission, however, with Leo soon knocked off course
            and poised for an emergency landing in the swampy depths of a nearby
            planet’s forested bog.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Escaping from his submerged
            spacecraft, Leo finds another particularly troubling monkey on his
            back. There’s a major manhunt in progress, with a grungy,
            half-nude colony of humans being systematically brutalized by the
            barbaric General Thade (Tim Roth). &quot;This one looked at
            me,&quot; the human-hating simian tells Attar (Michael Clarke
            Duncan), a hefty gorilla who acts as the fierce soldier’s right
            hand man and quickly beats Leo for this unforgivable offense.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Sporting a white goatee and a furrowed, judging brow, Thade
            looks like a cross between dapper director Martin Scorsese and some
            satanic high priest. Roth, not one to hide from unsympathetic roles
            (like Liam Neeson’s sword-wielding nemesis in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Rob
            Roy</i>), chews the scenery with psychotic relish.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Like a constipated penguin, Thade throws his weight around
            with a wobbling, hunched gait and dominates his social circle, which
            includes Sen. Sandar (David Warner), a political ally whose daughter
            Ari (Helena Bonham Carter) inflames the soldier’s romantic
            desires.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Unfortunately for Thade,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Ari is sympathetic to humans, so much that when Leo is caged
            up and prepped to be sold by a fast-talking shyster named Limbo (a
            hilarious, scene-stealing Paul Giamatti), the radical ape-babe helps
            him to escape slavery. She also rescues a scruffy family of humans
            along for the ride, including the patriarchal Karubi (Kris
            Kristofferson, looking like an over-the-hill Ted Nugent in long hair
            and loincloth), and his shapely daughter Daena (Estella Warren).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s during this middle section
            that the true genius of Burton comes to the fore. As in his other
            works, Burton loves dabbling in the details.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>As the heroes scramble back and forth to survive the wrath of
            human-hating Thade, the screen offers a visual feast of dazzling,
            demented eye candy. A goofy-eyed orangutan puffs contentedly on an
            opium pipe from one corner, while a reverse-organ grinder appears in
            the background, an ape playing the instrument while a
            &quot;mini-me&quot; sized man collects coins from onlookers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There are also some hilarious lines
            gracing <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Planet of the Apes</i>.
            Selling a young human girl to an enthusiastic ape clan interested in
            buying a &quot;pet&quot;, Limbo offers the eager buyers a word of
            advice: &quot;Get rid of it by puberty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>You don’t want a human teenager in the house!&quot; In
            another scene, a decadent, obese statesman-ape sits down to dinner,
            his gold-digging wife dressed in all the latest jewelry. &quot;We
            just got back from a vacation to the rain forest,&quot; he boasts to
            some associates. &quot;I needed to get away from politics.&quot;<o:p>

            <p><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Planet
            of the Apes</font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2"> culminates in a
            rousing desert battle, where age-old secrets are discovered and
            historical revelations made.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It’s
            here that one spends some time trying to retrace the film’s steps
            and decipher its logic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Good
            luck.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>By the time Leo
            finds a way to launch himself back to earth and into a completely
            ludicrous &quot;twist ending&quot;, Burton has jettisoned any
            attempts at rational sense. You’ll either go with it, or feel
            infuriated by the film’s complete reliance on its visual
            perfection and neglect of its tattered stab at a plot.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There are other howlers in this
            nonsensical slab of simian cinema. Warren, in the bimbo role, has
            absolutely no point other than to shake her bodacious booty. Leo,
            meanwhile, is a humorless, self-absorbed putz.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>It’s a real head-shaker as to why Ari would put herself in
            harm’s way for this rather unsympathetic soul who tells her, after
            she shows Leo a cruel wound inflicted on her by Thade, &quot;You
            better go take care of that.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
