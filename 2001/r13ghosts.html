            review by <a href="../gianni.html" target="_top">Gianni Truzzi</a>, 26 October
            2001</i></font><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Spook 
            shows are an art more often low than high. For every piece of 
            graceful footage in <i>Sixth Sense</i> there are miles of 
            testosterone-driven flicks like <i>Hellraiser</i>, Wes Craven's <i>
            Nightmare on Elm Street</i> series and the countless slasher stories 
            that exploit teen sexual anxiety. No testament to the American love 
            affair with gore speaks louder than the hundreds of 
            straight-to-video vampire and zombie movies made on a shoestring by 
            enterprising hacks. </font>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Cheesiness has always been a part 
            of the genre's appeal. I miss the days when Saturday afternoons 
            guaranteed a really bad Spanish vampire movie or a piece of B-grade 
            hokum like <i>The Tingler </i>on television, regularly hosted by a 
            middle-aged goof in heavy makeup and Count Dracula tux. A prior 
            generation could rely on a cheap weekend matinee, or even a live 
            &quot;ghost show&quot; that would at least startle if not scare, to ensure a 
            successful arm-clinging date. </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i>Thirteen Ghosts</i> is a remake 
            of William Castle's 1960 film of the same name, and although it has 
            a much higher budget, it maintains the original's low ambitions: to 
            make you twitch in your seat and enjoy the experience. Tony Shalhoub 
            (of <i>Big Night</i> and the sitcom <i>Wings</i>) plays a father of 
            two who lost his wife when their house caught fire and now lives in 
            reduced circumstances with his teen daughter, grade-school son and 
            housekeeper. He receives news that his black sheep Uncle Cyrus has 
            died and left him his extravagant home. When they go to claim their 
            remote inheritance (at night, when else?) the house, whose walls are 
            made of glass etched with Latin incantations, soon begins its grim 
            work. It is, they discover, not a house but a machine &quot;designed by 
            the devil and powered by the dead,&quot; and they are trapped inside.
            </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As Cyrus, F. Murray Abraham 
            fulfills his broad caricature, waving the stock prop of evil genius, 
            a silver-handled cane, in the gale. He commands a&nbsp; team that looks 
            like a hazardous materials team crossed with a squad of undertaker 
            commandos, and a smart-mouthed psychic (<i>Summer Catch</i>'s<i> </i>
            Matthew Lillard) to capture the violent ghosts that will fuel his 
            house. When he's cautioned that he's playing god, he answers in an 
            oily drawl, &quot;play is for children.&quot; Later, when he proclaims that 
            the world is shaped by &quot;men who will do anything for greatness,&quot; he 
            reminds you of Salieri without the inconvenience of conscience.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Castle's films were adventures in 
            marketing as much as terror, and set new standards of hucksterism 
            with their wacky stunts. <i>Ghosts' </i>plot gimmick of special 
            glasses that allow the living to see the spirits&nbsp; pays tribute to &quot;IllusionO,&quot; 
            the cardboard, red/blue glasses Castle gave to the audience to 
            (supposedly) allow them to see the ghosts onscreen. In truth, the 
            glasses never really worked -- you could see the ghosts without them 
            -- but what fun. (If you're curious, the DVD release of Castle's 
            version of <i>Ghosts</i> comes with a set of &quot;IllusionO&quot; glasses and 
            an alternate track for using them.) </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">With such tacky roots, don't expect 
            the remake to transcend them.&nbsp; <i>Ghosts</i> uses every stock trick 
            to build up tension, including the old 
            kid-alone-in-the-dark-basement bit.&nbsp; Shalhoub and his family aren't 
            alone in the haunted house; the attorney, the psychic and a PETA-style 
            activist for ghostly freedom (ectoplasm rights, I suppose) are there 
            to aid or thwart the house's purpose to open the &quot;Eye of Hell.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Okay, so it's not <i>Citizen Kane</i>. 
            It's a comic book, and, accordingly, it's heavy on stunning visuals, 
            light on credibility and soft on intellect. In fact, it's an EC 
            comic, the 1950's William Gaines publishing enterprise that 
            scandalized parents with its grisly drawings and amoral but often 
            funny storylines. It shouldn't surprise, then, that the <i>Ghosts</i> 
            is produced by Robert Zemeckis and Joel Silver, who are also 
            responsible for the Gaines-inspired <i>Tales of the Crypt</i> 
            cable-television series. (Gaines also founded <i>Mad</i> Magazine.)
            </font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The credits of first-time director 
            Steve Beck are primarily in the graphic arts, as a visual effects 
            designer for George Lucas' groundbreaking Industrial Light and 
            Magic, so its no surprise that <i>Ghosts</i> strongest feature is 
            its art direction. The house is a masterpiece of glass and steel, 
            and the infernal machinery at its heart has the filigreed look of 
            drawings out of DaVinci's notebooks. Equally fun are the skilled 
            prosthetics that create the twelve ghosts that compose Cyrus' &quot;Black 
            Zodiac,&quot; which seem to be heavily influenced by Tod Browning. Where 
            Beck is weakest is his flash-cut, MTV style edits which don't give 
            sufficient time for understanding, probably a holdover from his work 
            directing commercials, where every fraction of a second is costly. 
            But do watch for a wonderfully seamless (certainly CGI-assisted) 
            rotating pan in the film's opening credits that transitions from 
            past to present.</font></p>
            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">As the Rolling Stones said, it's 
            only rock and roll but I like it. Sure, it's not fine cinema, but if 
            Halloween puts you in the mood for a big-screen diversion that 
            furnishes just the right blend of silliness and fright, <i>Thirteen 
            Ghosts</i> is perfect. See it, enjoy it, and then go out for a 
            burger and chocolate malt. </font></td>
