            begins on 17 January 1961, the day when Patrice Lumumba (Eriq
            Ebouaney) was tortured and murdered. As the camera passes over his
            bruised and bloody body, his voice-over, taken from a letter to his
            wife, ponders the motives and fears of his enemies. He observes that
            the Congolese soldiers who have been assigned to kill him, along
            with two compatriots, will make sure that the corpses are never
            recovered or buried, for a public memorial will only bring upset and
            potentially, outrage. Instead, his former allies will mourn his
            death in public, as if they didn't have a hand in it. And their
            performance will be crucial for their own survival. &quot;Even
            dead,&quot; Lumumba says, &quot;I was still a threat to them.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Indeed,
            details concerning Lumumba's &quot;threat,&quot; the identities of
            those responsible for his death, and the disturbing depth of the
            Congo's political conflicts are still emerging. (It so happens that,
            just as Lumumba opens in some U.S. cities on Friday, ABC's Nightline
            was scheduled to conclude a five-part series on the civil war that
            continues to ravage the country, where 2.5 million people have been
            killed in only three years.) At this point, most analysts agree that
            the assassination involved the Belgian government, the United
            States, and by extension, the United Nations, whose soldiers were
            assigned to protect the recently removed Prime Minister Lumumba, but
            did nothing to stop his murder.<o:p>

            Peck's moving, poignant, and quietly angry film accuses all of these
            participants, but concentrates on Lumumba's emotional,
            interpersonal, and political struggles. After its discomforting
            beginning, the movie jumps back to the earliest stages of his
            career, in Stanleyville in 1957 and '58, where he makes the leap
            from beer salesman to union organizer and member of the nationalist
            political party, the Congolese National Movement (MNC). Here he
            meets the young but already volatile Joseph Mobutu (Alex Descas),
            who will mature into the infamous dictator: &quot;This is not a
            military coup,&quot; he says much later, when Lumumba is removed
            from office and Mobutu and his soldiers take over the government,
            &quot;It is a peaceful revolution.&quot; <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            these two men bond and fight during the lengthy process to free the
            Congo from Belgium's brutal colonial rule (which has been in place
            since 1885), they reveal similarities as much as emphatic
            differences. Both are energetic, self-absorbed, and hotheaded; both
            speak passionately about their dreams of a democratic Congo and are
            fast to argue with their adversaries. But where Mobutu is fierce and
            withdrawn, Lumumba's charismatic brilliance and his skills as a
            public speaker make him more obviously threatening to those looking
            to maintain Belgian interests in the area. When the Congolese
            government is finally formed, Lumumba agrees to serve in a coalition
            government, as Prime Minister for President Joseph Kusa Vubu (Maka
            Kotto), leader of the party opposed to the MNC. However, it is clear
            that the president is not so determined to break from Belgium's
            well-connected officials as Lumumba. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            film argues that none of these characters is faultless, and that
            Mubutu and Kusa Vubu's eventual betrayals of their comrade have more
            to do with their fears and manipulation by others -- including the
            diffident U.S. Ambassador and the smugly racist Belgian bureaucrat
            Ganshof Van der Meersch (Andre Debaar) -- than their personal
            feelings for Lumumba. Still, their increasing jealousy is manifest
            as they watch him move the members of the Congolese Parliament to
            their feet with his rousing speeches. On 30 June 1960, Independence
            Day, against the warnings not to rile the Belgians, Lumumba
            specifies the abuses suffered by black Africans at the hands of the
            Belgians, who are now claiming they actually &quot;led the way&quot;
            to Congolese self-government and awaiting &quot;proof&quot; that
            &quot;trust&quot; in their former subjects is deserved. His speech
            is a turning point -- even beyond the elections that have put
            Lumumba in the position to make it -- for his public sees now that
            he will not compromise with the imperialists. This point is also
            recognized by the Belgians, of course, and essentially seals his
            fate. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Haitian-born
            filmmaker Raoul Peck's interest in Patrice Lumumba began years ago,
            when he was a child and his father, fleeing Duvalier's dictatorship
            in Haiti, worked for the UN in the Congo during the 1960s. Ten years
            ago, Peck made a documentary, <b>Lumumba: la mort du prophete</b>,
            tracing the history and intrigue that he revisits in the feature
            film, which he describes as a &quot;political thriller&quot; rather
            than a biography, capturing Lumumba's speedy rise and fall with deft
            narrative strokes and riveting, beautifully composed scenes, shot by
            Bernard Lutic to create not only a sense of urgency, but also a
            heightened sensitivity to emotional details, light and shadows work
            together in a kind of sublime tension. Lumumba himself is
            perpetually caught between wanting to change everything all at once,
            and wanting to assert his own power and to establish his right to
            it. At one point, Congolese soldiers, still being commanded by white
            Belgian officers, take hostages to protest the racism still
            afflicting their daily lives. When a group of the soldiers storms
            Lumumba's office, interrupting a meeting with his advisors, he takes
            control immediately, challenging their display of weapons and
            obvious rage with his own steely resolve. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">While
            the film outlines the complicated historical circumstances, it is
            more interested in the personalities and the events, so it helps if
            you have some knowledge of the context before you go in. That said,
            the film inspires interest in its subject, following his
            uncompromising lead, painting him as a resilient, righteously angry
            hero. This means that a lot is left out. His personal life is
            reduced to background for the political crises (he decides to give
            up the fight when he's under house arrest and learns that his ailing
            infant daughter has died in Switzerland). And his wife Pauline
            (Mariam Kaba) and preteen daughter appear occasionally, confined to
            domestic moments, but offering commentary by their presence alone,
            as when his daughter walks through their new Prime Minister's
            residence on moving day, and a white worker taunts her with an
            African mask, treating her as if she is the interloper. The shot
            lingers for a moment on her face, as she stands poised in the
            hallway, her eyes unwavering, curious, but also ready. Then the film
            cuts to the man with the mask, making monster-noises. The effect is
            chilling. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            film closes with an equally affecting image: with the camera slowly
            zooming in on the soldiers dismembering and burning Lumumba's body,
            the film suggests that in these flames, dreams may be reborn. Given
            the odds and forces arrayed against the Congolese people -- most set
            in motion by seemingly unstoppable Western nations -- this
            suggestion appears, for an instant, naive. But Peck's film makes a
            powerful case for hope, nonetheless. <o:p>
