            review by <a href="../joe.html" target="_top">Joe Barlow</a>, 19 October
            2001</i></font><p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>From Hell</i>, the remarkable 
            new suspense-thriller from the Brothers Hughes (Albert and Allen, 
            the same duo who brought you <i>Menace II Society</i>), may well 
            take its title from the boundless, unexplored corridors of the human 
            mind, which is surely where they found the building blocks of this 
            riveting tale. Actually, perhaps I should back up a minute to 
            reassess the target of my praise. The film itself, which stars 
            Johnny Depp as a Scotland Yard detective hot on the trail of one 
            Jack the Ripper, takes its inspiration not so much from the actual 
            Whitechapel murders of the late 1880s, but from the renowned graphic 
            novel by Eddie Campbell and Alan Moore, which uses the murders as 
            its backdrop. I haven't read the book in question, but I'm told that 
            it's considered something of a minor classic among genre fans. Based 
            on the fiendish nature of the puzzle at the heart of this cinematic 
            adaptation, I'm willing to believe it. Hell, at this point, I'm 
            willing to believe pretty much whatever they want to tell me. </font>
            </b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">You see, I'm astonished. I don't 
            see as many suspense/thrillers as I used to--not because I have any 
            disdain for the genre, but, as a somewhat new father, my viewing 
            choices these days are limited to more family-friendly fare. 
            However, enjoying a rare night out at the cinema without the kids 
            this week, I witnessed the spectacle of <i>From Hell</i>, and I'm 
            still reeling from the experience. Not because the film was 
            especially visceral (though it has its moments), or because the 
            level of suspense and tension was overwhelming. No, what really 
            knocked my socks off (or would have, if I'd been wearing any), was 
            the incredible sense of cohesion that permeates every frame of this 
            movie. This is a film in which everything gels perfectly, and that 
            in itself is enough to inspire awe and wonderment in this jaded 
            critic, who has grown mightily tired of movies that &quot;almost&quot; get it 
            right. And as a (somewhat) intelligent film-goer, I'm prepared to 
            embrace any flick that doesn't expect--indeed, demand--that I check 
            my brain at the theater door. (Are we getting into a whole weird 
            area if I reveal that I felt satiated upon leaving the theater? We 
            are? Okay, never mind.) </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Nineteenth-century London has 
            always been a fascinating backdrop to me--the glow of gaslights, 
            bravely standing vigil in the fog-shrouded night; the click-clack of 
            a horse-drawn carriage, traipsing lightly over the cobblestone 
            streets; the merry violin of Mr. Sherlock Holmes, celebrating the 
            solution of his latest mind-bending puzzle. In <i>From Hell</i>, the 
            Hughes Brothers make this locale into a terrifying reality as Police 
            Inspector Frederick Abberline (Johnny Depp) and his friend Peter 
            (Robbie Coltrane, who may as well be wearing a sign around his neck 
            reading &quot;Designated Sidekick&quot;) pursue the ever-baffling trail of the 
            shadowy serial killer known as Jack the Ripper. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jack's <i>modus operandi</i> seems 
            to be the butchery of street prostitutes, usually involving the 
            removal of at least one internal organ from the corpses as trophies 
            (a bit of play in which the real Jack the Ripper did, in fact, 
            engage). While investigating the case, Abberline befriends--and, in 
            the film's only tired subplot, eventually becomes romantically 
            linked to--a hooker named Mary Kelly (Heather Graham of <i>Austin 
            Powers</i> and <i>Boogie Nights</i> fame), who fears not only for 
            her own safety, but for the welfare of the other &quot;street girls.&quot;
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While watching <i>From Hell</i>, I 
            tried to think of the last time a setting became such an intrinsic 
            part of a story. <i>Dark City</i>, perhaps? Or <i>The Crow</i>? Or 
            maybe the two <i>Batman</i> outings directed by Tim Burton? The 
            dark, grimy streets of London have never felt more &quot;alive&quot; on the 
            screen--which is perhaps surprising, since the press kit I received 
            for this film informs me that much of it was shot in Prague. All the 
            more reason to offer kudos to the art department and set designers 
            for pulling off a miraculous transplantation of one of the 
            nineteenth century's most important cities. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Much of the atmosphere, however, 
            comes not from the photography but from the genuinely creepy 
            screenplay from Terry Hayes and Rafael Yglesais. Tension comes not 
            just from Abberline's physical nemesis of Jack the Ripper, but from 
            his own struggles with the psychological dragon of opium addiction. 
            Themewise, Depp here is on familiar ground: as in much of his work 
            with Tim Burton, Depp is once again portraying an outcast with more 
            to him than a casual onlooker might initially suspect (see <i>Ed 
            Wood</i>, <i>Edward Scissorhands</i>, and others). But unlike his 
            most recent turn as Ichabod Crane in <i>Sleepy Hollow</i>--a 
            performance in which Depp seemed to be channeling Tim Burton's 
            bizarre eccentricities more than his own character's--Depp here is 
            firmly in his element. In the competent hands of the Hughes 
            Brothers, he is allowed the freedom to explore the depths of 
            Abberline's character, rather than being wasted as an employer of 
            weird gizmos, as seen in Burton's disenchanting <i>Sleepy Hollow</i>.
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>From Hell</i> is one of the best 
            thrillers to hit movie theaters... well, possibly <i>ever</i>, but 
            certainly since Demme's <i>Silence of the Lambs</i> made Hannibal 
            Lecter a household name. See it once just to bask in the macabre 
            visuals, which appear to have been ripped straight from a madman's 
            nightmare. See it again to appreciate the deft touch of the 
            screenplay and the directors' hands, and the way in which Depp 
            effortlessly propels the narrative where it needs to go, all the 
            while making it look easy. Pay particular attention to Depp's body 
            language as his character seeks a vision via his beloved opium. If 
            he were to encounter the owner of such dazed, vacant eyes while 
            walking around London, I suspect even Dr. Lecter himself might cross 
            the street to avoid him.</font><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
