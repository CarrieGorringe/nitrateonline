            Barton (Chris Rock) is a stand-up comedian whose life's ambition is
            to play the Apollo Theater without getting booed off the stage. No
            doubt, this is a mighty ambition -- the Apollo crowd is famously
            unforgiving. In the early moments of <i>Down to Earth</i>, we get a
            look at just how hard they can be, when Lance screws up and the
            crowd responds accordingly. Poor Lance. Everyone backstage,
            including his manager Whitney (Frankie Faison), likes and supports
            him, but no one knows quite how to help him, except to tell him,
            again and again, that eventually his day will come. <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">That
            ends up being true and not true. Minutes later, a truck barrels
            toward Lance on the street, but a helpful angel, Keyes (Eugene
            Levy), takes pity on him, and in order to prevent a horrible splat,
            hauls the young man's soul out of his body an instant before impact.
            Pleased with his good work, Keyes send Lance on up to heaven, which
            is here a night club with a line outside, where only the pretty
            girls are assured entry. The trouble is that it's not actually
            Lance's &quot;time,&quot; and so the Head Angel, Mr. King (Chazz
            Palminteri) has to do some fast rearranging to set things right.
            Specifically, he offers Lance a &quot;loaner&quot; body, belonging
            to someone who has not yet been discovered dead, until the heavenly
            administration can locate a new, permanent body (or at least,
            permanent until it's really his time to die). <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            temp body is that of a wealthy white guy named Wellington, who's
            just been murdered in his tub by his wife (Jennifer Coolidge) and
            her lover/his accountant, Winston (Greg Germann). Complications
            arise when Lance-as-Wellington falls in love with the lovely Sontee
            (Regina King), who is battling him in the press and organizing
            protests over community hospital funding (one of Wellington's many
            lucrative and corrupt investments). To win her heart,
            Lance-as-Wellington becomes a serious philanthropist, while at the
            same time working up his Apollo routine, to the delight of
            Wellington's staff -- his maid Wanda (Wanda Sykes, of <i>The Chris
            Rock Show</i>) and his butler Cisco (Mark Addy, of <i>The Full Monty</i>)
            -- who serve as appreciative practice audience. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            set-up should sound familiar, as it's based on 1978's <i>Heaven Can
            Wait</i>, starring Warren Beatty, and which was in turn based on
            1941's <i>Here Comes Mr. Jordan</i>, with Robert Montgomery.
            Directed by Chris and Paul Weitz (who made the raunchy teen comedy <i>American
            Pie</i> and acted in Miguel Arteta's <i>Chuck and Buck</i>), this
            third remake is calculated to serve as the vehicle for Chris Rock's
            rise to PG-13 stardom. Recently, he's been on the fast track to the
            Big Time, playing supporting roles in well-promoted movies (Richard
            Donner's <i>Lethal Weapon 4</i>, Kevin Smith's <i>Dogma</i>, and
            Neil LaBute's <i>Nurse Betty</i>) and winning prizes and accolades
            for his popular HBO series, <i>The Chris Rock Show</i>. His stand-up
            routines are inclined toward topical, politicized humor,
            demonstrated in his Emmy-winning HBO specials, <i>Bring the Pain</i>
            and <i>Bigger and Blacker</i>, as well as his series, where the
            guests ran quite a gamut, from Marion Barry to Pamela Anderson, Ice
            T to Stanley Crouch. The move to mainstream necessarily involves
            some toning down, but it's clear that Rock and his writing team (Ali
            Le Roi, Lance Crouther, and Louie CK) are determined to keep up the
            zings at the status quo.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And
            so, here comes Mr. Rock, invading the white folks' world with
            something approximating a vengeance. As Lance, he's a basic
            &quot;fish out of water&quot; (like Eddie Murphy's Axel Foley in the
            <i>Beverly Hills Cop </i>series), standing up to an easy-target, the
            upper class. There are rough spots in the film's mix of sweetness
            and attack mode. Rock, with his well-known edgy delivery, isn't the
            most obvious choice for the lead in a romantic comedy, though
            stranger things have happened, namely, David Spade as just such a
            lead, in 1999's dreadful <i>Lost and Found</i>, in which he wooed
            Sophie Marceau, of all people. <o:p>

            recognizes this problem, and so makes the awkwardness of the romance
            its primary -- and oft-repeated -- joke. Sontee is not precisely
            falling in love with Lance, but with Lance-as-Wellington. For most
            of the film, you're watching Chris Rock-as-Lance-as-Wellington
            (wearing an expensive dressing gown, designer suit, or an old-school
            golfing outfit, with knickers, a tam, and clicking cleated shoes),
            but occasionally you catch a glimpse of Wellington from another
            character's point of view, and see the portly white guy acting
            &quot;fly&quot; or getting down to the latest hip hop track on the
            radio. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></span></font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sontee
            holds out for a few minutes of screentime, but according to the
            logic of the romance, she can't help herself and soon falls for the
            suddenly rejuvenated old man who has been so awful to her for so
            long. When Lance-as-Wellington goes to the hospital, he finds his
            stuffy Board of Governors, including Winston, assiduously slashing
            services. Determined to impress Sontee, he gleefully announces that
            he's opening the hospital doors to everyone in need, even those
            without insurance: &quot;If your head is bloody, we're your
            buddy!&quot; The executives sitting around the boardroom table are
            horrified at this idea, but because Lance makes his declaration in
            front of a crowd of ailing folks (on crutches, in wheelchairs) and a
            slew of TV cameras, the topsy-turvy damage is done. And so this
            little section of the planet will be a better place for Lance's
            interventions, as erratic and self-interested as they may be. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's
            this insistent niceness, combined with screwballish illogic, that
            makes <i>Down to Earth</i> a bit cumbersome. It's stuck in between,
            not so saccharine as a Meg Ryan-Tom Hanks movie or so obnoxious as
            today's teen romances (for instance, the Weitz brothers' own
            notorious debut picture), but also not so dead-on target as Rock's
            usual work, the gags ranging from wild to mundane. For all its
            efforts to accommodate romantic comedy conventions, what's most
            striking about the movie is how it reimagines its hero. In both <i>Heaven
            Can Wait</i> and <i>Mr. Jordan</i>, the leads were predictably
            handsome -- and predictably white -- athletes, Beatty a quarterback
            and Montgomery a boxer. That is, the films raised no doubts
            concerning their masculinity, at least according to Hollywood
            standards. Chris Rock, of course, is hardly so conventional an
            emblem of virility, stability, or self-assurance. Skinny, acerbic,
            and righteously angry, Rock is a whole other kind of man.</font></span></p>
