            Aoyama's astonishing new film is all about violence, but it provides
            none of the usual adrenalin kick. Instead, <i>Eureka</i> probes
            effects, the ways that a physically and emotionally traumatic
            experience changes your sense of self and of the world's rhythms.
            Harshly beautiful, the movie is also contrary and strange:
            intertwining subjects as sensational as serial killing and as
            mundane as life on the road in a Winnebago, it never quite takes you
            where you think it will. <i>Eureka</i> introduces its protagonists
            as they are unexpectedly sucked into irrevocably life-changing
            trauma. Kozue (sixteen-year-old Aoi Miyazaki, whose face is one of
            the more exquisitely affecting images I've seen on screen in years)
            and her brother Naoki (Masaru Miyazaki) board a bus and sit in the
            very back seat, facing forward as the bus follows its daily route,
            in a small town in southwest Japan. Suddenly, the scene is changed:
            a hijacker (Go Riju) has boarded the bus, which is now parked in a
            lot. Rather than taking you immediately inside, to the action, with
            acrobatic crane shots, the camera hunkers down at a distance. You
            gaze across the parking lot, over a crumpled dead body, at the bus,
            where the hijacker is barely visible, moving about. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            cut inside reveals that this fellow has no dastardly plan, no plan
            at all. He's fumbling with his cell phone and his gun, messing with
            the cops, for whom the scene is out of control (they pace and point
            their guns, but they're left to watch and wait). Kozue sits
            dead-still, Naoki leans forward, his face glistening with sweat.
            After some tension-making minutes, during which very little happens,
            the bus driver, Makoto (Koji Yakusho), figures a way to give the
            police snipers a shot at their target. The episode ends abruptly and
            horribly, when a lanky young detective shoots the villain dead,
            right in front of the kids. They continue to sit, eyes wide. The
            film cuts again, to a newspaper factory, the new editions spit out
            by machines, the event reduced to headlines: &quot;Tragedy at
            Noon,&quot; &quot;Two Middle School Children, One Bus-driver
            Rescued.&quot; The rest of <i>Eureka's</i> three hours and forty
            minutes follows the unending aftermath of this single event, as the
            three survivors struggle to live, to understand their own sense of
            guilt, fearfulness, and hopelessness. The trick is that Kozue,
            Naoki, and, to a lesser extent, Makoto, are unable to articulate
            their feelings. Utterly alone and visibly undone, they withdraw into
            a kind of functional catatonia, refusing to go to school, watching
            television and playing games with one another. Eventually -- the
            film is unclear when -- they stop speaking, even to one another.
            Their mother abandons the family and their father dies in a car
            wreck. And not one person from town comes to their home to help.
            During this same period, Makoto is undergoing his own
            transformation, most of it offscreen. After the tragedy, he leaves
            town. When he returns two years later -- on a bus -- he's unkempt
            and despondent, but goes home to his brother, sister-in-law, and
            father: they inform him that his wife has left him. He starts work
            at a construction company, where the manual labor and daily ritual
            of washing shovels seem to bring Makoto back to life. Still, he's
            unable to converse with his family. And so, the film turns again:
            Makoto goes to live with Kozue and Naoki, nurturing them, finding
            his own generosity, cleaning up after them, feeding them regular
            meals, hauling them outside for bike riding and shopping
            expeditions, filling in the silences with encouraging chatter.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There
            are any number of scenes in <i>Eureka</i> that articulate this
            threesome's peculiar but somehow necessary relationship, as well as
            their incapacity to make connections with anyone else. Makoto's
            brief reunion with his wife, Yumiko (Sayuri Kokusho), is one of the
            more striking and exemplary, subtly and increasingly uncomfortable,
            as they timidly test what cannot be said and what cannot be ignored.
            Shot as a series of one-shots as they chat in a restaurant,
            surrounded by crisp white tablecloths, the conversation turns taut
            as they stand to leave: at this point, their very different pains
            are almost palpable. His eyes search hers, he wonders whether they
            might try again. She smiles, her eyes too bright, but can hardly
            maintain the charade. She hits him playfully, calls him a
            &quot;monster,&quot; and accuses him -- a little too nicely -- of
            not &quot;taking care of her.&quot; He says he's sorry, as he tells
            most everyone he meets now. But it's too late. And so, the three
            survivors find solace -- and importantly, respect for their separate
            grief -- in each other, as well as the kids' free-spirited cousin
            (Yoichiro Saito), who comes to stay with them. You see very little
            of their interactions, but know they are all better off as a crew,
            at least temporarily. For of course, their idyll is fragile and
            short-lived. When a determined detective (not incidentally, the same
            one who shot the bus-jacker as the kids looked on) becomes convinced
            that Makoto is a serial killer stalking young women in town, the
            foursome hits the road in a camper. Once in motion, they cannot turn
            back, and must learn to communicate -- even if only by tapping on
            the walls between them -- rather than living in devastating
            isolation.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            film reflects this arduous emotional process in detail, but the
            route to redemption, or at least to continued endurance, is
            circuitous. Some of it is even a bit too obvious: as a sign that
            Makoto is coming to terms with his own mortality (an issue all three
            survivors confront daily), he begins coughing, occasionally at
            first, then more often, and more achingly. But even this clunky cue
            doesn't really pan out; the film changes up, offers hope instead of
            death. Always, violence remains inescapable, shaping all of their
            lives -- it's in the air they breathe, as it is, really, for all of
            us, to varying degrees. And yet, despite and because of their
            anguish, they can find and then, against every expectation, struggle
            to save each other. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Perfectly
            composed and shot in elegant black and white by Masaki Tamra, the
            film spends long -- very long -- moments contemplating the emotional
            truths so often unseen but still visible in surfaces, in stark
            interiors and vast landscapes, subtle gestures and revealing
            postures. The film's great strength is its stunning indirection:
            events and characters point in familiar directions, but <i>Eureka</i>
            is rarely familiar. <o:p>
