            first scene is tense. Creepy crawly tense. I mean, it's not like the
            beginning of an action movie, all speedy cuts and craning cameras.
            Instead, it's working a subtler nerve, alternating between extreme
            long shots of a seared-white desertscape and shots of men in trucks
            that are almost unreadably close. Titled &quot;Mexico, 20 miles
            southeast of Tijuana,&quot; this restless opening finally pauses to
            give up a story -- two men wait in their car, then stop and seize a
            truck loaded with drugs. Proud of their work, Javier (Benicio Del
            Toro) and his partner Manolo (Jacob Vargas) head off down the long
            dusty road back to town. But within seconds, they're turning the
            truck over to the local Mr. Big Stuff, one General Arturo Salazar
            (Tomas Milian), who comes equipped with a pack of armed and surly
            soldiers. As it turns out, though Javier and Manolo are themselves
            cops, they have precious little sway when it comes to drug traffic. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            is the grand lesson of Steven Soderbergh's <i>Traffic</i>, which
            widens its focus exponentially following its first
            blazing-lonely-desert scene. As if a force unto themselves, beyond
            all legal, social, moral, or even political powers, drugs cross
            borders, produce wealth, cost lives. Drugs are a system, and they
            never stop moving. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At
            once indignant and sad, epic and detailed, Soderbergh's movie has
            already won critics' prizes and spots on ten-best lists. At first
            glance, it looks to be about as different from his first release of
            this year, <i>Erin Brockovich</i>, as it can be. Where the Julia
            Roberts vehicle drives straight -- and knowingly -- into a carwreck
            of Happy Hollywoodness, the new film is all twisty and turny and
            irritable. The primary makers -- Soderbergh, producer Laura
            Bickford, and writer Stephen Gaghan, all working from a base
            structure borrowed from Simon Moore's 1989 British television
            miniseries, <i>Traffik</i> -- are sure of their intentions. They
            mean to reveal the failures of the U.S. drug wars as systemic, the
            militaristic rhetoric as empty, even cynical promise-making. Their
            hearts are surely in the right place -- if there's a worthier
            project for an aggressively marketed, must-see Movie Event, I don't
            know it. And to this end, the fact that <i>Traffic</i> has already
            won critics' prizes and spots on year-end best lists is probably a
            good thing, even if the movie itself succumbs to a few too many
            clichés and falls somewhat short of its own high-minded goals.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><i><font size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Traffic</span></font></span></font></i><font size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
            is often difficult and upsetting, interweaving three fragmented
            storylines, and raw surveillance-camera stylishness, a large cast,
            and two languages (the Mexican characters speak Spanish, at the
            director's insistence that the movie be &quot;realistic&quot;). At
            times, the movie takes proficient aim (as when you watch Javier and
            Manolo sweat out the General's ambush, or when you watch Senator
            Orrin Hatch act as if he's at a DC mucky-muck party, obviously not
            knowing what kind of raging anti-government tract he's lent his name
            and face to), but at others, it gestures broadly and less
            effectively, attempting to convey the horrific sprawl of the drug
            biz. Where it surely feels pleasant to watch Roberts stick it to a
            clearly villainous Corporate America, <i>Traffic</i> never lets you
            forget that such moral delineations are 1) simplistic, and 2)
            delusional. In <i>Traffic</i>, good news is most always accompanied
            by plenty of bad.</span></font></span></font></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            this doesn't mean that the (relative) good guys don't try like hell
            to set things right. Javier and Manolo see where they stand in the
            scheme of things, but they persist, imagining that they're always
            just a step away from bringing down the big cheese or maybe just the
            asshole dealer on the corner -- they just want to do something.
            Their moral counterparts north of the border (in San Diego, to be
            exact) are DEA Agents Montel (the superb Don Cheadle) and Ray (Luis
            Guzman), introduced undercover. They're setting up a deal with a
            mid-level sleazeball, Eduardo Ruiz (Miguel Ferrer, whose
            under-appreciated gifts have never been better used). When he
            stalls, Ray tells bad jokes, trying to cut tension. But Montel is
            out of patience, or maybe just a little too deep into his
            performance: he blurts out, corny thug-style, &quot;We gonna move
            some weight or what?&quot; Suddenly, the bust is trashed by the
            arrival of the local law. Here agin, the film shows the consequences
            of non-coordination and territorial dick-swinging. Montel and Ray do
            take Ruiz, however, which means that they have a route to their
            next-up target, a dealer who lives the upscale life in La Jolla,
            Carlos Ayala (Steven Bauer). Increment by increment -- it's the only
            way to make a dent, or rather, to imagine that you're making one.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">All
            this compromising underlines the film's most repeated theme, that
            drugs are everywhere responsibility falls nowhere. It's in this
            context that the third narrative strand develops. Ohio Supreme Court
            Judge Robert Wakefield (Michael Douglas) is appointed by the
            President as the new Anti-Drug Czar -- pending Congressional
            approval -- a gig that he takes seriously enough that he undertakes
            to educate himself about the traffic from across the border.
            Wakefield's plot is far and away the film's weakest. You hardly see
            Wakefield at work, in a courtroom, which suggests that the bulk of
            his time -- especially after the nod from the President -- is
            comprised of taking meetings and socializing. His seething,
            resentful wife Barbara (Amy Irving) observes his own addictions --
            to power, to Scotch, to a self-preserving distance from her -- but
            he won't own his culpability in the relationship, much less in his
            daughter Caroline's (Erika Christensen) self-destructive choices.
            Caroline is so miserable, she can't see straight -- the film
            introduces her partying with her Cincinnati Country Day School
            classmates, including her slimy, smart-ass boyfriend Seth (Topher
            Grace), who convinces her to smoke a little crack so he can jump her
            bones. She agrees. She doesn't care.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Of
            course, she has no reason to care. Her distance from the Mexican
            desert and Tijuana streets that open the film is, I suppose, a
            testament to the daunting scope of drug traffic -- look, cocaine
            slips by the border guards in some smalltime asshole's floorboards,
            wends its way to underclass streets and -- omigod -- the
            bourgie-burbs too. But more urgently, the distance between Caroline
            and Manolo is about money. Where she has it to burn, he never has
            enough, but instead, has relentlessly hard choices to make, every
            day. And while Caroline's tragedy is treated in play-by-play,
            soap-operatic detail, Manolo's appears in bits and pieces, mostly
            via Javier's second-hand information-gathering. Granted, the movie
            is first addressing its U.S. audience, and more specifically, that
            audience who appreciates Soderbergh's edgy, pre-<i>Brockovich</i>
            work (in particular, his best film to date, <i>The Limey</i>, or his
            slyest, <i>Out of Sight</i>), which means that its emotional focus
            will be the wealthy, straight-A student, the character who --
            according to Soderbergh -- viewers don't expect to see so f*cked up.
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            still... Caroline is actually less a full-blown character than a
            device to extend her father's education. It's probably useful to
            show that, because this power-player doesn't need to know much about
            street crime and drug trade, he <b><i>won't</i></b>, unless, of
            course, he's forced to. But the fact that forcing takes the form of
            Caroline's crack-and-heroin addiction is not a little cloying. It's
            bad enough to see her looking pale and hollow-eyed under the
            influence, but it's annoying when she goes jonesing over to the
            &quot;bad part of town,&quot; where she solicits the company of
            older men -- notably, a naked black one and a white one in a suit
            (you do the math) -- in order to feed her nasty habit. These scenes
            are yucky, not because they convey the sheer awfulness of the girl's
            situation, but because they're overkill markers of her Descent Into
            Hades via sexual predations. Perhaps worse, the scenes' full
            significance only comes clear when daddy -- suddenly turned all
            vigilante and shit -- shows up and then collapses at the sight of
            his strung out baby girl. This is straight-up drug war propaganda:
            pot-puffing leads this angelic child directly and inevitably to
            junkie-whoredom and with well-muscled black men, no less.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">What's
            most troubling about such fearsome silliness is that it detracts
            from what the film does well, that is, showing nuanced and
            complicated emotional reactions to situations where the moral ground
            is all but impossible to see. The non-resolution to Caroline's
            storyline involves her halting, uncertain confession: &quot;I guess
            I'm angry. I mean, I think I'm really angry about a lot of stuff,
            but I don't know what exactly.&quot; For me, this is <i>Traffic's</i>
            most profound moment of articulation -- or maybe it's inarticulation.
            That this girl can be so unself-conscious about her feelings and her
            responsibilities is a function of her life experience. Like her
            father, Caroline is an uninterested bystander to her own life, until
            she's forced to look, hard. This theme repeats again and again in
            the film, perhaps most compellingly for the busted dealer Carlos's
            wife, Helena (Catherine Zeta-Jones). When he's hauled out of their
            swank white home in handcuffs, she's undone, a single mother
            pregnant with a second child, alone and absolutely horrified that
            her opulent life has been financed by such nefarious means.
            Discovering that she can't turn to her husband's none-too-bright
            lawyer (Dennis Quaid), it's not long before Helena starts making
            some serious decisions, like arranging a contract on the primary
            witness against her husband -- who just happens to be that weaselly
            Ruiz. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And
            this brings us back to Montel and Ray, who, of all the film's many
            characters, have the most hard-earned and acute understanding of
            where they've been and where they're headed -- as U.S. government
            agents, they see the traffic's endless movement. As Montel, Cheadle
            gives an unnerving, brilliant performance, granting access to a guy
            who knows what he thinks is right, but can't even begin to make the
            world resemble that ideal. At one point Montel and Ray are staking
            out Helena's place, hiding across the street in one of those vans
            that stake-out cops always use. For a moment, things look promising,
            and Ray is almost giddy when he suggest that they might get to bust
            some &quot;white people.&quot; It's rendered a joke in the movie,
            but his sentiment is also pretty much the film's point. Javier and
            Manolo, Ray and Montel toil away, day after day, hoping to get a
            handle on how the system works, how the product continues to move
            despite their best efforts. But it's too vast, too distant, and too
            essential to the machinations of national governments and
            international businesses. Traffic keeps moving. <o:p>
