            the middle of director Jan Sverák's film, <i>Dark Blue World</i> (<i>Tmavomodrý
            svet</i>) in the middle of a labor camp in post-World War Two
            Czechoslovakia, a former SS doctor who is now working for the
            Communists attending to sick inmates, states cynically (but
            truthfully) that there's not much difference between the two
            ideologies. This was not supposed to be the way things should have
            turned out; these inmates were former war heroes, trained pilots who
            fled from Czechoslovakia one step ahead of the Nazi invasion and
            fought as Czech patriots as part of the Royal Air Force. After the
            war, they were thrown into camps by the Communist government, which
            was afraid of the possibility that their prestige might persuade
            others to rebel against authority.</b><o:p>

            's storyline alternates between that bleak camp existence and the
            personal dramas that run through a particular Czech squadron as they
            fight the war. While training in Britain, ex-Czech squadron leader
            Franta Slama (Ondrej Vetchy) and his protegé, Karel Vojtisek
            (Krystof Hadek), both fall in love with a widow named Susan (Tara
            Fitzgerald). Predictably enough, this love triangle threatens the
            group's solidarity and, by extension, their ability to survive, both
            as a group and individually. Nevertheless, the film's concentration
            of resources upon historically accurate depictions (the choreography
            of the dogfights is impeccable, as is, more grimly, the recreation
            of the miserable conditions in the labor camp), and the relatively
            restrained passion in the actors' performances, always keep the film
            compelling to watch. The film occasionally threatens to drift into
            complete soap-opera kitsch, but watching a film balance on the edge
            of credibility, and then succeed most of the time, makes things all
            the more intriguing. The postscript informs us that these freedom
            fighters were not given official recognition until 1991, perhaps the
            most bittersweet aspect of all. Sverák (responsible for the 1996
            Oscar-winning foreign film, <b><i>Koyla</i></b>) and his longtime
            screenwriter, his father Zdenek, demonstrate yet again that they are
            able to maintain a balance on that fine line between the uplifting
            and the lachrymose. The film is a tribute to an era in which it
            seemed as if everything of value was threatened, an issue which, in
            the wake of the recent terrorist attacks, has been made all too
            painfully clear.</span></font></o:p>
