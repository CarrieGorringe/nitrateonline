            <font size="2">Rebecca Pidgeon has her work cut out for her. Most of 
            her time on screen these days is spent delivering her husband David 
            Mamet's trademark rat-a-tat dialogue. This is no small feat. It's a 
            rhythmic and performative effort, you know, to make Mamet's taut, 
            insinuating language -- and especially, the repetition, the 
            repetition -- sound like it's coming from a human being's mouth. No 
            doubt, this is the challenge and the delight of doing Mamet, on 
            stage or in movies, to wrestle with his words, to slip into his 
            pauses, to make them all seem like yours. Some critics have called 
            Mamet's language inherently masculine, and it's true that it is male 
            actors who are most definitively identified with his work: Joe 
            Mantegna and William H. Macy come to mind (and both together, in <i>
            Homicide</i> -- what a treat!). But many others, male and female, 
            have down swinging. The man's work is hard. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">And so Pidgeon 
            might be commended for coming back to it again and again. And this 
            time, in <i>Heist</i>, she's considerably less stilted than she has 
            been (in, for instance, <i>The Spanish Prisoner</i>), and even plays 
            sultry, in what seems a perversely perky way. And she has serious 
            reason to have her game on, considering her costars. She plays Fran, 
            married to Joe (Gene Hackman), a sometime boat-builder who supports 
            this rather non-lucrative habit by stealing stuff, really big, 
            expensive stuff, with his partner Bobby (Delroy Lindo) and their 
            utility man, Pinky (Ricky Jay). As the film opens, the four of them 
            are on a job, robbing a jewelry store; things go wrong, in a pretty 
            spectacular way: the scene moves quickly, with considerably less 
            language than you usually hear in a Mamet scene, because everyone is 
            so busy trying to keep the imminent disaster under some control.
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">This blunder 
            means that Joe, who was hoping to retire to an island with his 
            beautiful young wife, is in for one more job (isn't that always the 
            way?), because they owe front money to their fence, Bergman (Danny 
            DeVito). The team -- particularly Joe and Bobby -- are reluctant to 
            go again; they map things out carefully, and the big job that 
            Bergman is pushing them to do is looking shaky. Worse, much worse, 
            he wants them to take along his cocky nephew, the ignominiously 
            labeled Jimmy Silk (Sam Rockwell). Clearly, everything in this Last 
            Job is set up to go wrong. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Like most caper 
            films, this one follows a fairly predictable route. Save for the 
            details of which twists will come when, caper films pretty much do 
            what they do: they're always about plans -- initial plans, foiled 
            plans, and new plans. In <i>Heist</i>, the characters follow suit: 
            they make plans, betray each other, play with gadgets, deal with 
            surprises, make more plans, and in the end, some characters are 
            killed or punished, and one or two get off, because they plan better 
            than everyone else, or maybe just have incredibly good luck that 
            they turn into better plans. To change up the formula just a bit, <i>
            Heist</i> adds some <i>noir</i>ish elements, such that the men have 
            murky motives and limited vision, the <i>femme</i> is mostly <i>
            fatale</i>, and, as Mamet has said, the plot involves both violence 
            and irony. You just can't plan for everything, much as you think you 
            can.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The last big 
            job involves a whole lot of Swiss gold being shipped from an 
            airport, and so there is some amount of security -- technology and 
            armed guards -- to manage. Together, Joe, Bobby, and Pinky are a 
            well-oiled machine, and the addition of Jimmy, no surprise, causes 
            tension: the pros think he's a &quot;f*cking cowboy.&quot; He swaggers, he 
            slouches, he mouths off. And then he spoils one of their early recon 
            excursions, causing Joe to be spotted by a cop: &quot;Now I got my face 
            on a cereal box,&quot; he grumps. When Sam promises, &quot;I'm gonna be as 
            quiet as an ant pissing on cotton,&quot; Joe only snarls, &quot;I want you as 
            quiet as an ant not even thinking about pissing on cotton.&quot; 
            Colorful.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">As this bit of 
            banter demonstrates, <i>Heist</i> revisits Mamet's usual thematic 
            ground -- the ways that men behave with one another, their 
            aggressions and apprehensions, their unself-conscious brutality and 
            hyperconscious posing. The guys Mamet makes are all salesmen in some 
            way, whether they're gamblers or thieves or actual executives. 
            They're selling some idea of themselves, to one another, yes, but 
            also to themselves. That their slick maneuvers and manly contests 
            most often take verbal forms is what makes Mamet so Mamet. It's a 
            good thing, but it is a limited thing. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">And still, 
            there's the girl. Always an issue in Mamet, she's dishonest or 
            naive, she's selfish or less sure of herself than she needs to be. 
            Fran is all of these things at various points in <i>Heist</i>, as 
            well as a prize the men think they're playing for, even as, at the 
            same time, the money is the most important prize, the one they will 
            not walk away from, no matter what. When Bergman asks Jimmy, &quot;As 
            rational men, don't we have to distrust her?&quot;&nbsp; As the snarky little 
            nephew, Jimmy Silk&nbsp; is sure enough of his dick size that he agrees 
            to test her &quot;sincerity,&quot; but only because she's a means to the end. 
            Joe knows she's good on her feet and he's proud: &quot;She could talk her 
            way out of a sunburn.&quot; But she's up against a battalion of guys. Is 
            Jimmy as dumb as he looks? Is Joe as in love as he looks? And is 
            Bobby really as tight with all these untrustworthy white folks as he 
            looks? </font></span></p>
            <p><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Heist</font></span></i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
            revisits a lot of old turf, but does bring the welcome dimension of 
            Hackman, Lindo, and Jay, all supple, magnetic performers, experts at 
            seeming ordinary. You don't see them act. Instead, each seems to 
            inhabit a movie's space and time like an old but still stylish suit; 
            it looks really good, tailored and precise, but worn and 
            comfortable. And so these guys push past the flat, emotionless line 
            deliveries that usually characterize Mamet's direction. His 
            language, severe and spare, actually sounds quite human coming from 
            their mouths.</font></span></td>
