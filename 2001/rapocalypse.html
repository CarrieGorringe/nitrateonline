            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>It’s both
            strange and exhilarating to watch a young, sleek Martin Sheen drunk
            in his skivvies, haunted by his own hollow stare. Few things can
            beat hearing Robert Duvall insist once more that “Charlie don’t
            surf,” marveling at the early talents of a fourteen-year-old
            Laurence Fishburne, or listening to Brando dreamily consider “the
            horror” of war. Those are reasons enough to see this
            twenty-two-year-old movie. But the film’s director, Francis Ford
            Coppola, doesn’t seem to think so, revising it to add forty-nine
            minutes of previously cut footage, bringing the already-long running
            time to a butt-numbing three-and-one-half hours. (Don’t supersize
            that soda pop.)</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><o:p>

            suffered a notoriously difficult production, taking fifteen months
            to shoot instead of the four that had been scheduled. The list of
            obstacles reads like a cautionary lesson of how <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">not</i>
            to make a movie: don’t start with an unfinished script, don’t
            film in a country with an active rebellion, plan well for weather,
            and never, ever use your own money. After a prolonged
            post-production and its premiere at Cannes in 1979, the story of
            Captain Willard’s journey upriver to kill the insane, charismatic
            renegade Colonel Kurtz was hailed as a masterwork, silencing the
            critics that had been asking, “Apocalypse When?” This lush,
            brutal film remains for many the definitive movie about the Vietnam
            War.<o:p>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">So
            why did Coppola feel the need to revisit it? It seems that the
            famously obsessive director feels he never got it right. Even after
            the gruesome difficulties he suffered (and made many others suffer)
            for it, the film still gnaws at him.<o:p>

            it again, one can understand his frustration. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Apocalypse Now</i> always felt like two movies, both brilliant and
            astonishing, but one that succeeds and another that narrowly skirts
            the mark. Despite Coppola’s giant talent, the material still bests
            him.<o:p>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">The
            film’s division derives from its being based on two stories,
            augmented by tales from primary screenwriter John Milius’s veteran
            friends and Coppola’s feverish imagination. The main storyline is
            taken from Joseph Conrad’s 1902 novella <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Heart
            of Darkness, </i>an indictment of Belgian colonialism in which a
            steamship captain chugs upriver into the depths of the Congo.
            Conrad’s Kurtz is a station agent much-admired for his ability to
            deliver ivory, but the jungle and his own zeal have driven him mad.<o:p>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">As
            Captain Willard, Martin Sheen is lost in his own madness, a
            special-operations agent on his second tour, emotionally damaged by
            his first. Coppola sets the hallucinatory tone with Willard’s
            dreams of jungle fire as he gets drunk and wails, anxious for a new
            mission. He is, and yet is not, Conrad’s steamboat captain.
            Willard teeters on the brink of insanity himself, unsure he can live
            with the violence he has wrought, yet craving it, eager to jump back
            into the bush. Strangely, it insulates him from the madness he will
            endure on the journey upriver.<o:p>

            <p class="MsoBodyText" style="line-height:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Once
            Willard receives his assignment, (from a pre-stardom Harrison Ford),
            the story vaults away from Conrad, into a journey upriver that is a
            mixture of the absurd and nightmare. Willard and a green crew of
            four men must rely on a roughneck air cavalry commander to help get
            their boat into the river’s mouth. Kilgore (Robert Duvall) emerges
            from a Huey that proclaims “Death from Above” to distribute
            playing cards on the corpses of freshly killed Viet Cong. He chooses
            the enemy-controlled point of access to the river because it offers
            the best surfing, then attacks to the accompaniment of Wagner. In
            the midst of napalm-scented battle, he laments, “Someday this
            war’s going to end.” But, as Willard cynically observed upon
            meeting Kilgore, the major was the sort who would fight with a manic
            happy-go-lucky, by-the-book spirit to that end, oblivious to the
            costs others would assume on his behalf, because Kilgore knew “he
            wasn't going to get a scratch on him” in the process; he could
            afford to be indulgent.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyText" style="line-height:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">At
            this year's Cannes film festival, Coppola again explained that <i>Apocalypse
            Now</i>, in whatever form, was an exposé of lies: the lies officers
            told to soldiers and the lies that politicians propagate in their
            countries. However, the real heart of darkness in <i>Apocalypse Now</i>
            is cemented in the lies that individuals tell themselves, either to
            justify their behavior or preserve what remnants of sanity remain,
            both in and around them. Kilgore is the most flamboyant, but not the
            only, liar in this film. The officers delude themselves into
            believing that they are fighting a just war, and the grunts delude
            themselves into believing that they all will go home in one piece. <i>Apocalypse</i>
            brutally smashes those illusions.<o:p>

            <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Heart of Darkness</i>, the
            steamship captain’s voyage upriver is not nearly so eventful, so
            the script draws on another great epic, Homer’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Odyssey</i>. Kilgore is the Cyclops and Willard “injures” him
            when they leave by stealing his surfboard. Later, they will find the
            sirens -- a USO show featuring Playboy Playmates – and their
            Scylla and Charybdis is the Do Lung Bridge, a horrific outpost that
            is built each day only to be destroyed each night. By now, the
            audience is primed for the entrance into a Hades of incomprehensible
            madness.<o:p>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Most
            of Coppola’s new material lies within this middle section,
            including a sordidly ironic sequence in which the stranded Playmates
            exchange sex for some fuel. The New Orleans Chef (Frederic Forrest)
            asks his partner to restore herself to her centerfold, complete with
            her wig, while California surfer Lance (Sam Bottoms) undresses the
            sorrowful Playmate of the Year. “Who are you?” she asks the
            young and eager Clean (Laurence Fishburne). “I’m next,
            ma’am,” he says. Coppola also restores the “French plantation
            sequence,” a dreamlike encounter with a group of colonial French
            who refuse to abandon their home. This is, in part, Willard’s
            descent into Hades, to speak with the souls of the dead. The French
            give him quite an earful. “We fight for our homes, our way of
            life,” the patriarch Hubert says. “You Americans fight for the
            biggest nothing in history.” As interesting as this will be for
            film buffs, the sequence adds very little to the story, and comes
            off as pedantic and too full of talk. Coppola was right to cut it in
            the first place; it doesn’t really work. As Roxanne, Aurore
            Clement is spectacularly beautiful in an erotic scene, but her
            introduction as Willard’s Calypso also seems out of place. Her
            only purpose seems to be to tell Willard, “There are two of you .
            . . one that kills and one that loves.” But this is something we
            already know by now.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">At
            last, we come to the troubling end, the return to Conrad that gave
            Coppola so much trouble. John Milius’s original ending was
            warlike, with a final huge battle sequence full of guns and flames,
            emphasizing Kurtz’s love of the kill. But Coppola, who by this
            time was distributing the script revisions on 3x5 cards he had typed
            up late at night, would change this in favor of a more ethereal
            ending.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">It’s
            interesting to note what Coppola retained from Conrad’s novella.
            As in the book, Kurtz’s camp is a pit of barbarism, full of
            severed heads and corpses on display. The role of the fool
            photojournalist (Dennis Hopper) was also taken from there, a
            wandering Russian who Conrad describes as dressed in rag patches,
            like a harlequin. Certain lines of dialogue are lifted, too, such as
            Willard’s response to whether Kurtz’s methods are unsound, “I
            don’t see any method at all.” <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">But
            where the film departs from Conrad is damaging, and it’s not
            entirely Coppola’s fault. When Marlon Brando arrived in the
            Philippines for his limited, three-week engagement to play Kurtz, he
            hadn’t done any of the things he was supposed to do, and had
            threatened to quit several times. He hadn’t lost weight, and was
            much heavier than Coppola had expected. He didn’t fit into any of
            the Green Beret uniforms they had designed for him. He hadn’t even
            read <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Heart of Darkness</i>. By
            this time, Brando’s well-broadcast contempt for his profession was
            at its height, and it seems clear that he didn’t care anymore.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Kurtz
            is the personification of the most extreme and unapologetic cause of
            misery, the ugly, racist outsider that pursues his objectives with
            grisly vigor. He is ourselves magnified by madness. He brings
            success – in Conrad it is ivory, in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Apocalypse
            Now</i> it is victories – but he cannot be accepted. Brando’s
            weary, distant readings of lines like, “I watched a snail crawl
            along the edge of a straight razor,” are mysterious and
            other-worldly. His description of Vietnamese hacking off
            children’s vaccinated arms is chilling. But it isn’t Kurtz.
            There’s too much of a gap between Hopper’s declarations about
            him and what we see before us. This isn’t the man who “you
            don’t talk to him, you listen.” He is more of a guru than a
            madman. When Willard finds Kurtz’s manuscript, the scrawl across a
            page that says “Drop the Bomb!” doesn’t seem to have come from
            the understated giant we’ve been watching.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Coppola’s
            attempt to further save things by restoring a scene in which Kurtz
            reads <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Time</i> magazine
            clippings to Willard is a nice touch, but I suspect it would have
            had more force from another actor. One wonders what the difference
            would have been with an actor of similar age like Gene Hackman, who
            Coppola had recently directed in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Conversation</i>. He certainly would have given Kurtz greater force.
            It’s a tribute to Coppola’s great skill, however, that he was
            able to make such a forceful film out of such a trouble-plagued
            production. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Apocalypse Now</i>
            is, without a doubt, one of the best films ever. It’s worth
            watching again and again. Does “Redux” add enough dimension to
            warrant the greater investment of time? Probably not for the average
            viewer. Its earlier strengths are still strong, and its old
            weaknesses can’t be salvaged, but any opportunity to see Robert
            Duvall smell that napalm and smile on the big screen is well worth
            it.<o:p>
