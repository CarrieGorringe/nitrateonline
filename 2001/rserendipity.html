            <span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><b>John Cusack has 
            something up his sleeve. I just know it. I like to imagine that he's 
            working towards another movie like <i>Grosse Pointe Blank,</i> the 
            smart and unsappy romantic comedy he co-wrote and starred in a few 
            years ago, opposite Dan Aykroyd, and oh yeah, Minnie Driver. He's 
            building up good sport credits, stashing cash, looking for the right 
            material, something. I imagine this, because I can't imagine why 
            else he's made the two movies he's made most recently, <i>America's 
            Sweethearts</i> and <i>Serendipity</i>.</b> </font></span></p>
            <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">
            <span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
            <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">
            <span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">That's not to say 
            that <i>Serendipity</i> -- a mostly snowy, sort of holiday romance 
            featuring a lot of ticking clocks, Louis Armstrong singing &quot;Cool 
            Yule,&quot; and Kate Beckinsale as Cusack's ostensible love object -- is 
            as flat-out awful as the Julia Roberts vehicle. It is to say that 
            Cusack can do better.</font></span></p>
            <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">
            <span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
            <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">
            <span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">I also imagine 
            that at some point, <i>Serendipity</i> probably looked better than 
            it ended up. Surely, it looked like a fine idea to couple Cusack and 
            Beckinsale (she's not Ione Skye, but she's entirely charming in her 
            own way, <i>Pearl Harbor</i> notwithstanding), and it also must have 
            looked good to Cusack to be paired again with his offscreen best 
            friend Jeremy Piven, here again playing a buddy, even more 
            incisively than he did in <i>Grosse Pointe Blank</i>, where they 
            were, in a word, excellent together). And it likely seemed that 
            director Peter Chelsom (who made <i>Funnybones</i> and <i>The Mighty</i> 
            before he faltered -- appallingly -- with <i>Town and Country</i>) 
            was going to be able to pull something clever out of the corniness, 
            much like Stephen Frears did with Cusack's <i>other</i> recent 
            romantic comedy, <i>High Fidelity</i> (which was mostly saved, it 
            must be said, by the fabulous Jack Black). </font></span></p>

            <span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Serendipity</font></span></i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">'s 
            story involves Jonathan (Cusack) and Sara (Beckinsale), who meet way 
            too cute at Bloomingdales, each trying to buy the same pair of black 
            cashmere gloves as a gift for his or her partner. As they battle 
            wits in an effort to &quot;win&quot; the gloves, they realize that they're 
            actually rather smitten with one another, though of course, neither 
            can admit it or act like it. Or rather, both do act like it, but in 
            that indirect, romantic comedic way: they flirt, they almost kiss, 
            they really want to do right by their SOs, but they're so obviously 
            &quot;meant for each other&quot; that their efforts to <i>not</i> be together 
            are tedious from jump. </font></span></p>
            <p style="margin:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">
            <span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Never mind. 
            Sara and Jonathan spend the evening fighting the future -- more 
            specifically, having coffee at the sweet little dessert place across 
            from Bloomingdales named Serendipity (so one of them, I think it's 
            Sara) can define the word for the rest of us, then skating at 
            Wollman Rink in Central Park, playing an adorable game where he 
            writes his name and number on a $5 bill and she does the same in a 
            copy of <i>Love in the Time of Cholera</i>, both agreeing that if 
            they are indeed destined to be together, they will indeed find these 
            items sometime during their lifetimes. He thinks this is a bad idea. 
            You might agree with him.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">They have one 
            more not-so-happy accident, during yet another let's-test-our-karma 
            game, in which they each take a glove and board opposite elevators 
            in the Waldorf Astoria, to see if they will hopefully, miraculously,
            <i>fatedly</i> press the same floor number. (To clarify, though they 
            do press the same number, his elevator is invaded by a bad little 
            boy who presses 20 more numbers in between, apparently just to mess 
            up Jonathan's life plan). Poor Sara leaves frowning, in a haze of 
            disappointment, and poor (with whom you spend a few more minutes, 
            watching his desperate dashes in and out of the elevator, on 
            ascending floors) ends the sequence wandering the snowy street 
            outside the Waldorf alone. The camera pulls out, the scene fades to 
            black.</font></span><font face="Verdana" size="2"> </font></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Cut to a few 
            years later. Jonathan's an ESPN producer (not a jock, but with 
            appropriately masculine interests), engaged to marry the lovely and 
            wealthy Halley (Bridget Moynahan), at the Waldorf, as a matter of 
            fact. And Sara's moved to LA, where she's a therapist who counsels 
            her clients on the utter fallacy of believing in fate, even as she 
            keeps telling herself (and her best friend Eve [Molly Shannon, 
            considerably less unbearable than she is when she plays the Catholic 
            schoolgirl on <i>SNL</i>]) that she might just re-find that 
            just-perfect-for-her fellow she met in Bloomies so long ago. She's 
            got an obvious reason to be wishing for this unlikely accident, 
            because she's engaged to marry a guy named Lars (John Corbett), a 
            long-haired, new-agey recorder-player, part John Tesch, part Kenny 
            G, part egotistical lout. When he proposes, he hides the ring inside 
            descending-sized boxes, but as soon as she says yes, he's planning 
            the honeymoon around his world tour's Bora Bora leg. It's a mystery 
            why Sara's with him at all, except that she needs to be distracted 
            somehow, to explain why she is so slow to pick up on her feelings 
            for Jonathan. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">And so, you 
            wait for the inevitable. Sara decides that, on the eve of her 
            wedding, she'll head back east, in hopes of <i>running into</i> 
            Jonathan somewhere in New York City. Whatever. He has a bit more 
            method to his madness: on the day of the big rehearsal at the 
            Waldorf, he drags his buddy, <i>NY Times</i> obits writer Dean (Piven) 
            along for several hours worth of chasing down clues to Sara's 
            whereabouts. This is because he believes that his last-minute 
            discovery of her credit card receipt, still inside the single black 
            cashmere glove that he's kept all these years, is suddenly a &quot;sign,&quot; 
            some kind of message from Fate, the very Fate that he so disparaged 
            when trying to convince Sara to give up her digits so long ago.
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">For you, this 
            discovery is indeed fortunate, because it pits Jonathan against a 
            persnickety Bloomingdales clerk played by Eugene Levy (essentially 
            playing Jim's Dad Working in a Swanky Department Store: ah well, 
            it's a living). Jonathan and Jim's Dad compete comically over who 
            gets to be where vis-à-vis the gloves-and-ties counter (Jonathan is 
            supposed to &quot;behind the line,&quot; whatever that means) and whether or 
            not Jonathan will ever see the information that he needs to save him 
            from his non-magical match. That he's making the right move here, in 
            spite of the cockamamie hijinks he endures and commits, is 
            underlined every time the sweet but dim Halley comes on screen, 
            which isn't so often, and each of her scenes is devastatingly foofy 
            (as when she intuits that Jonathan is distracted, tearfully 
            observing, &quot;You've been somewhere else the past few days,&quot; just 
            before she gives him the momentous pre-wedding gift, a copy of <i>
            Love in the Time of Cholera</i>, the very copy that.. and yes, you 
            know the rest.) </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Though Chelsom 
            deploys clever devices to make the movie seem slightly less 
            formulaic than it is -- time-lapse photography and clocks to mark 
            the passing of precious time, lovely shots of the city, looking 
            quaintly serene -- it is what it is, a standard romance. The sad 
            part is that Jonathan probably isn't so well-matched with Sara, who 
            did send him off on that silly search for the book years before, but 
            is pretty obviously well-matched with Dean, who not only tells him 
            off when he needs it (like, hey, maybe marrying Halley is a bad 
            idea, just in itself) and most importantly, he doesn't play those 
            games that most all romantic comedy characters seem condemned to 
            play. For a Best Friend, Dean is unusually complex, with his own 
            relationship &quot;issues,&quot; and sincere good will toward his fretful pal 
            and the girl he thinks he loves, though it's his job to live 
            vicariously through Jonathan's romantic success, Piven's witty, 
            understated performance makes Dean the movie's most serendipitous 
            element. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Yet, Chelsom 
            and company appear overwhelmed by the premise of Marc Klein's 
            screenplay, which is simply too syrupy, this despite the fact that 
            the dialogue is occasionally crisp (especially when deftly delivered 
            by Jeremy Piven) and its self-conscious allusions to those crazily 
            classy Fred Astaire-Ginger Rogers plots, what with all the chance 
            meetings and preposterous coincidences and soulmates-made-in-heaven 
            stuff. Surely, such grandly movie-ish machinations are hard to 
            overcome. But then… <i>Grosse Pointe Blank</i> did it, right?</font></span><font face="Verdana" size="2">
