<p><span style="font-family:Verdana"><font size="2">Convicted of some low-level
drug offense or another, twenty-one-year-old middle-class bad boy Ron Decker
(Edward Furlong) falls victim to a judicial crackdown and receives a hefty jail
sentence in the local <i>Animal Factory</i>. Once in stir at the state pen (the
film was shot at the dormant century-old Holmsburg State Prison outside
Philadelphia), Decker develops an uneasy and ambiguous mentor relationship to
the well-connected Earl Copen (Willem Dafoe), who commands grudging respect from
all jailbird demographics. Eschewing the standard and explicit sensationalism of
a modern-era prison picture in favor of a more deliberately developed set of
interpersonal relationships, director Steve Buscemi (<i>Tree’s Lounge</i>)
brings none of the eccentric, nervous energy associated with his acting to the
film. Instead, the complexities of men thrown together against their will
between cinderblock walls is fleshed out deliberately and provocatively, with
the novel by Edward Bunker (partnering with John Steppling on the script) as the
blueprint. Thus, Earl’s motivations for taking Ron under his wing, at first
suspicious, stay on the level but never become completely clear. Again with
shaven skull (in preparation for his turn as Max Schreck in <i>Shadow of the
Vampire</i>), Dafoe gives one of his better career performances, part menace and
part benevolent father figure. He’s surrounded by an authentic group of
character actors, the two most startling of which are Tom Arnold as a lusty
backwoods inmate and Mickey Rourke -- virtually unrecognizable in heavy drag
makeup -- as the cellblock queen &quot;Jan the Actress.&quot; Even Furlong’s
punky demeanor, previously annoying, serves him and the material well. Both the
English and Spanish subtitled video editions are priced to rent, while the
Columbia Tristar Home Entertainment DVD pressing has no extra features.</font></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana"><font size="2">When sassy two-bit thief
Alvin (Jamie Foxx) spends a little quality time in a cell with the scruffy
Jaster (Robert Pastorelli), himself fresh from the desertion of his partner
Bristol (Doug Hutchison) in the midst of a $42 million gold bullion robbery,
determined Treasury agent Clenteen (David Morse) comes to believe that Alvin
knows where the fortune is hidden. But does he? Setting itself up initially as a
by-the-numbers brother-on-the-run-against-The-Man thriller, Bait morphs slowly
into something else, a genuinely absorbing innocent-in-peril saga that benefits
greatly from Foxx’s clever performance; just when the audience thinks
they’ve got him pegged, it turns out the gears have been turning and he’s
again eluded the agent’s wrath (a pity the forceful and complex Morse is
becoming the go-to guy for hard-ass heavies). And if the high-octane pace and
whizbang gadgetry often hides the true ancestry of Bait’s story (by Andrew
Scheinman, Adam Scheinman and Tony Gilroy) under a technological sheen, director
Antoine Fuqua (The Replacement Killers) seems to know full well that he’s
working at the intersection of Bond and Hitchcock. Warner Home Video’s DVD
edition features a commentary by Foxx that, while not previewed at press time,
promises to be an irreverent and inventive spin on the standard filmmaker
discussion track</font></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana"><font size="2">How did Kim Basinger and
Christina Ricci get mixed-up in this movie? Basinger plays a mother whose child
is supposed to have unusual -- even messianic -- powers; Ricci pops in and out
of the film as a bedraggled runaway who warns her that her child is being sought
after by an organization that's &quot;like a religion, only it's the opposite of
religion&quot;. They're lead by Rufus Sewell (<i>Cold Comfort Farm</i>), whose
eyes seem to be pointing in two different directions at the same time during all
his close-ups. Whether this was intentional or not, I can't say, but the
filmmakers' crass attempt to wring audience reaction to this wretched material
by repeatedly placing a young child in danger (at one point, positioned on a
ledge and being encouraged to step off of it) was most definitely, and
contemptibly, intended. The film also stars Jimmy Smits as an FBI cult expert
and Ian Holm as a Jesuit priest. Paramount Home Video’s tape release is priced
to rent, while the DVD features a commentary track with director Chuck Russell
(who helmed that energetic remake of <i>The Blob</i>) and visual effects
supervisor Joel Hynek. Cast and crew interviews round out the package.</font></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana"><font size="2">In modern-day Baltimore, a
group of cinema terrorists calling themselves &quot;The Sprocket Holes&quot; and
posing as the staff of the grand old Senator Theater kidnap visiting star Honey
Whitlock (Melanie Griffith), a bitter industry bitch who soon falls under the
spell of crusading leader Cecil (Stephen Dorff) and willingly participates in
his bizarre production of <i>Raving Beauty</i> (&quot;we are all part of one
giant projector,&quot; is a typical example of their fractured agitprop).
Spoofing both the current independent cinema craze and the Patty Hearst story
(she’s a long-time Waters cohort with a bit part here), the film is Waters’
most energetic in years, as exuberantly stupid and potty-mouthed in its way as <i>Pink
Flamingos</i> nearly thirty years ago. He hasn’t changed, but the industry
around him has embraced his crudity with little of his panache to temper it.
Sure, he still has difficulty modulating his actors, and the story jumps around
with an abruptness that is either unbridled enthusiasm or lack of pacing skills,
depending on the level of your partisanship. But remember: Waters was doing this
kind of guerilla filmmaking long before most of his troupe was born (well, not
Melanie Griffith), and when somebody yells &quot;bad reviews can’t hurt me
now!,&quot; it can’t help but serve as a reassuring endorsement of Waters’
eternal manifesto. Artisan Entertainment’s DVD edition of the film features a
commentary track by Waters and the Comedy Central production featurette <i>Canned
Ham: Cecil B. Demented Behind the Scenes</i>. -- Eddie Cockrell</font></span></p>

iguanodon Aladar is forced to deal with his upbringing and the nature of
tolerance and survival when a meteor forces the relocation of his adoptive, uh,
herd. Anthropomorphism continues apace at the Mouse House (that’s Walt Disney
Productions), but the example set by <i>Dinosaur</i> is particularly jarring:
the consistently impressive hyperrealism of the animation, which combines real
exterior nature shots with computer-generated animals, is at odds with the
slang-y dialogue of the beasts, an undistinguished running commentary of
Saturday morning-level situations and asides (one lemur describes himself as a
&quot;love monkey&quot;) that may play well with tots but is tough sledding for
anyone over about twelve. Why, then, does the film insist on the kind of mature
brutalities that can only terrify its intended audience? These and other logical
questions about the wisdom and success of the undertaking are moot, as <i>Dinosaur</i>
came in ninth in the 2000 revenue sweepstakes with $137.7 million at the
domestic box office -- proof, as if any were needed, that technical spectacle,
relentless marketing and product branding will usually overcome a lazy and
superficial story. That success, in turn, spawned an admittedly impressive
two-disc collector’s edition with more features than can manageably be listed
here. </font></span><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

a remorseless, ambitious and very angry image consultant in Los Angeles,
forty-year-old Russ Duritz (Bruce Willis) gets a makeover of his own courtesy of
himself as eight-year-old Rusty (Spencer Breslin). Charming beyond all reason,
this contemporary fantasy, a creative collaboration between screenwriter Audrey
Wells (<i>The Truth About Cats and Dogs</i>) and director Jon Turteltaub (<i>While
You Were Sleeping</i>) is unabashedly cloying: Marc Shaiman’s brassy score
lays it on thick at every turn, while the cumulative message embedded in the
story -- learn not to be a victim while you’re a child -- provides
stressed-out adults with a little wish fulfillment in their entertainment. And
therein lies the problem: who, exactly, is the film pitched at? Kids will find
the exposition and various subplots far too abstract, while with a name like
Disney’s The Kid, adults aren’t likely to rent the thing to begin with.
Still and all, Willis proves once again to have strong comedic skills (and is
developing quite a sixth sense for choosing material keyed around children),
Breslin is amusing as Rusty, and Lily Tomlin has a number of good bits as his
wisecracking assistant. Disney’s VHS tape is priced to sell, and the DVD
edition includes a commentary track from Turteltaub and Breslin, a conversation
with the director, production featurette and trailer.</font></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">In contemporary Dallas,
wealthy and popular gynecologist Sullivan Travis (Richard Gere) seems
overwhelmed by the women in his life, who include his mentally deteriorating
wife Kate (Farrah Fawcett), soon-to-be-married eldest daughter Dee Dee (Kate
Hudson), her paranoid sister Connie (Tara Reid), his meddlesome sister-in-law
Peggy (Laura Dern) and the torch-carrying secretary Carolyn (Shelley Long). It
isn’t until the good doctor’s new patient Bree comes along (in the person of
Helen Hunt, suddenly ubiquitous once more) that he can make any kind of sincere
connection with another woman. Essentially an opportunity for some of today’s
brightest and most promising actresses to work with an indestructible sex symbol
(Gere) and equally tenacious director (the great Robert Altman), <i>Dr. T and
the Women</i> provides a loosey-goosey improvisational platform for all of the
above, courtesy of the broad script from Anne Rapp (who also penned <i>Cookie’s
Fortune</i>). Since disparity is the watchword in an Altman ensemble cast, the
above are augmented by Liv Tyler, Lee Grant, Janine Turner, Robert Hays and, of
all people, Andy Richter, who seems to have found a new comedic gravity now that
he’s off Conan’s couch. So why wasn’t this a hit? In the same year that
found Altman’s monumental </span><i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Nashville</span></i><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">
finally coming to DVD to little acclaim, the hazards of intricately spontaneous
filmmaking are readily apparent: these kinds of movies, the kind at which Altman
excels, require a lot of audience concentration for a payoff that is less
dramatically motivated than dictated by the satisfaction of improvisation and
character development. Thus, while it is tempting to say &quot;nothing
happens&quot; in <i>Dr. T and the Women</i>, look closer: the production is, in
fact, a bit more than modestly enjoyable as another one of those creative
hothouses presided over by Altman which end up enriching all who take part. The
videotape is priced to rent, and the DVD edition includes an interview with
Altman and an isolated music track commented upon by long-time cohort Lyle
Lovett.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana"><font size="2">When an eleven-year-old girl
is found brutally raped and murdered outside her tiny working-class town in
northern France, the subtle emotional ripple effect of the investigation
eventually overwhelms sensitive police superintendent Pharaon De Winter
(Emmanuel Schotté), who lives with his mother and hangs out with his neighbor
Domino (Séverine Caneele) and her boorish boyfriend Joseph (Philippe Tullier).
In 1997, director Bruno Dumont received decidedly mixed reviews for his debut
feature, <i>The Life of Jesus</i>. As with <i>Humanité</i>, it is a deliberate,
often inscrutable blue collar drama with the courage to show life’s
mundanities in real time: villagers walk, talk, eat, work, bicker and make love
(in nearly explicit sequences) with a deliberate rhythm some found seductive and
others maddening. Nevertheless, <i>Humanité</i> followed in the previous
film’s footsteps and won numerous high-profile festival awards, including Best
Actor (Schotté is a timid, wide-eyed marvel of confused compassion), Best
Actress, the Grand Prize of the Jury and the <b><i>Palme d’Or</i></b> award
for best film of the festival. Patience is decidedly a virtue in order to
completely appreciate these extraordinary films, as is a belief that the
cumulative actions of each individual point unerringly to their destiny in life.
Winstar’s letterboxed VHS tape is priced to rent, and it shares with the
spartan DVD edition a clean, crisp transfer.</font></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana"><font size="2">One of the biggest surprises
of the 2000 film year was this entirely engaging film, with Billy Crudup, in an
astonishing performance, as the hapless protagonist who can't help but screw-up
everything, from getting addicted to drugs, having a relationship with his
girlfriend (Samantha Morton), making a living for himself, or having an
encounter with a malevolent, snakeskin-wearing man who may or may not be the
Devil. He finally attains stability, and redemption, in the Southwestern desert,
where he learns how to interact with people at a retirement home and through an
Amish couple whom he sees but never introduces himself to. Director Alison
Maclean (Crush) has marshaled numerous names, including Denis Leary, Will
Patton, Dennis Hopper and Holly Hunter, in supporting roles, and Jack Black,
previously of <i>High Fidelity</i>, is brilliant, again as a hospital orderly
with whom Crudup's character works for a spell. The VHS edition is priced to
rent, with no compelling extras on the DVD.</font></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Penelope Cruz gives a
dynamite performance in this small, fleeting, but nonetheless enjoyable romantic
comedy as a cook who leaves her native seaside town in Brazil to go to the U.S.
-- and San Francisco, another town by a sea -- after having trouble with her
boyfriend. The boyfriend goes after her, and so, too, does everyone else, after
they get a taste or even a whiff of her cooking. (It is not, of course, just how
she makes it, but the feeling that she puts into it while she makes it that
causes people to become enchanted.) Brazilian director Fina Torres' film may
seem technically crude or unsophisticated by Hollywood standards -- but
sometimes that's not such a bad thing. And the music, with original tunes by
Luis Bacalov, combined with Cruz's performance, is wonderful. The DVD has no
extras.</span><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana"><font size="2">Among the most ravishingly
beautiful Technicolor films ever made (Jack Cardiff won an Oscar for his
cinematography), <i>Black Narcissus</i>, adapted by Michael Powell and Emeric
Pressburger from the novel by Rumer Godden, tells of a young Mother Superior,
Sister Clodagh (Deborah Kerr), and her struggles establishing a school and
hospital with an offshoot of her Sisters of Mary order at a remote, windswept
former palace and harem 9,000 feet up in the Himalayas. Wracked by doubt and
desire, Sister Clodagh tries as best she can to manage the four nuns under her,
only to watch as the increasingly unstable Sister Ruth (Kathleen Byron) cracks
under the pressure of putting thoughts of sexy British local Mr. Dean (David
Farrar) out of her mind. An update of the lauded laserdisc issued by The
Criterion Collection some time back, this newly expanded edition features a
gorgeous digital transfer from a 35mm interpositive print (created with
Cardiff’s input), a fine essay by respected film critic Dave Kehr on the
fold-out inner sleeve, a theatrical trailer, English subtitles for the deaf and
hearing impaired and an exciting collection of production stills (incredibly,
the film was shot entirely in and around London’s Pinewood Studios, with a
collection of matte paintings and camera tricks, supplementing Alfred Junge’s
production design, that puts modern computer generated images to shame). The
most important extras of the set are a commentary track featuring a conversation
between Powell (who died in 1990) and Martin Scorsese, a huge fan of the film
whose editor, Thelma Schoonmaker, was married to the director; and the
whimsical, specially commissioned &quot;Painting With Light,&quot; Craig
McCall’s 27-minute documentary on Cardiff and the making of Black Narcissus.
Sure to be listed among the top DVD releases of the year (pity Entertainment
Weekly couldn’t hold their January 10 &quot;50 Best DVDs&quot; issue a few
weeks), <i>Black Narcissus</i> -- named for the exotic imported aftershave used
by one character -- is an essential part of any movie fan’s burgeoning
collection. Perhaps Scorsese puts it best, when he describes this one-of-a-kind
film as &quot;bathed in color.&quot;</font></span></p>

City, a group of Spanish day laborers bicker among themselves before one is
crushed by a falling wall; two teenagers from the same village meet by chance at
a wedding reception, only to lose each other in the concrete canyons; a homeless
puppeteer tries to enroll his daughter in a public school; a sweatshop worker
desperate for wages to send home to her sick daughter stands up to her callous
employer. Five years in the making, <i>The City </i>(<i>La Ciudad</i>) employs
classic elements of black and white photography, documentary and social realist
filmmaking to tell a quartet of stories, linked by a visa lottery
photographer’s storefront shop and peopled with immigrants selected by
photographer-writer-filmmaker David Riker (who moved from pictures to film
because &quot;I wanted the people in my photographs to be able to speak&quot;).
&quot;The pain you go through in this country to get a life…,&quot; someone
says in the first episode, and to the heartbreaking strains of Tony
Adzinikolov’s score this remarkable film gives an eloquent face to that daily
struggle. Available on tape only, <i>The City</i> is in Spanish with English

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana"><font size="2">In early 1970s Georgia,
determined cockfighter Frank Mansfield (the late, great Warren Oates) plies his
trade on the violent rural circuit. Among the handful of great cult movies of
the 1970s, the film was adapted from hard boiled writer Charles Willeford’s
novel by director Monte Hellman (<i>Two Lane Blacktop</i>) and an uncredited
Earl Mac Rauch (<i>New York, New York</i>), produced by the legendary Roger
Corman, photographed by the great Néstor Almendros (<i>Days of Heaven</i>),
scored by the then-unknown Michael Franks and edited by Lewis Teague (<i>Alligator</i>).
The cast features a young Harry Dean Stanton, an even younger Ed Begley Jr.,
Millie Perkins, Troy Donahue, Richard B. Shull and Troy Donahue. Owing to the
violence of the rooster battles there’s been controversy surrounding this
memorable work for twenty-five years, and to this day the film is banned from
public exhibition in the United Kingdom. But above all <i>Cockfighter</i> is a
film about honor and addiction, and a touchstone of such cultural importance
that Almendros devotes a chapter of his sadly out-of-print 1986 memoir <i>A Man
with a Camera</i> to his work on it and Willeford (whose name is misspelled on
the sleeve) also wrote extensively about his experiences on the set. Note that
the expressive Oates acts the role almost entirely mute, with his thoughts
punctuating the action via narration. The splendid Anchor Bay DVD transfer is
accompanied by Tom Thurman’s incisive fifty-four-minute 1993 documentary
career overview <i>Warren Oates: Across the Border</i>, talent bios, various
media spots (a TV ad refers to the film under one of its many alternate titles, <i>Born
to Kill</i>) and a commentary interview in which Hellman and original production
assistant Steven Gaydos (now the London-based co-executive editor of Variety)
discuss the movie’s gestation and marketing -- including the director’s
reluctance to make a movie with such violence towards animals and frustration at
not having enough time to do it right -- with American Cinemateque programmer
Dennis Bartok.</font></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana"><font size="2">Dante Tomaselli's debut
feature, which he wrote and directed, is about a woman who's found dead in her
infant son's nursery, face-down in a birthday cake lying on the floor; a nun who
is killed after being struck by a model airplane, and another nun who's attacked
by a flying pair of open scissors; a young teenage boy (Danny Lopes) at a
Catholic school who sees faceless nuns strolling on the lawn, and leering nuns
looking in at him through the window; a sinister, tough-sounded priest (Vincent
Lamberti) who wears a black leather overcoat, gives instructions to his class on
how to perform a frog dissection by first placing &quot;pins through its hands
and its feet,&quot; and dispenses pills to the students on the q.t. (&quot;Can
priests take Valium?&quot; one boy asks); the boy's grandmother (Irma St. Paule),
who seeks help from the school's headmaster and, when that doesn't work, from a
psychic (the psychic says that her grandson is &quot;very far away, though. Much
farther than you thought.&quot; &quot;You mean, he ain't in New Jersey?&quot;);
phantasmagorical scenes which are supposed to represent the boy's deceased
mother trying to use her son to get out of Hell; and, in one scene, the boy,
clad only in a diaper, locked up in a wire animal cage while a woman torments
him by shaking the contents of a baby's bottle at him. Tomaselli has described
this film (which is beautifully photographed, by Brendan C. Flynt) as being like
a visit to &quot;a psychedelic fun-house&quot;; he may want to turn his
attentions more towards story and character. Without them, the film descends
into being simply one freaky-deaky scene after another.</font></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana"><font size="2">Married Osaka paper merchant
Jihei (Kichiemon Nakamura) sacrifices everything -- his family, his business,
his very soul -- in service to his erotic obsession with courtesan (read:
prostitute) Koharu, played by Shima Iwashita -- director Masahiro Shinoda’s
wife and business partner. On the heels of their 2000 release of Kwaidan (see
the 2000 <i>Nitrate Online Fright Film Festival</i> here), The Criterion
Collection once again explores the stylized theatrical conventions of the
Japanese film. Here, Shinoda and screenwriters Taeko Tomioka and Toru Takemitsu
(the highly-respected composer) adapt Chikamatsu’s 1720 <b><i>Bunraku</i></b>
puppet play, mixing obvious theatrical conventions and puppetry with live
action, eccentric framing and a highly stylized black-and-white look. The
emphasis in this version is on honor and destiny: the only way to transcend
their transgression is through the extreme act of the title. Tellingly, both
courtesan Koharu and Jihei’s wife Osan are played by Iwashita -- an
indication, perhaps, that Shinoda (who may be glimpsed in the early scenes as
filming is prepared) isn’t comfortable with the tradition. The DVD package
features a generally fine digital transfer from a 35mm composite fine-grain
master (which does show a little wear), an illuminating essay by the late
feminist film theorist Claire Johnston, and newly transcribed and very clear
English subtitles.</font></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana"><font size="2">In a remote corner of
western Canada, an American army base and the surrounding community are
terrorized by a series of unexplained deaths until crusading Major Jeff Cummings
(Marshall Thompson) and his new squeeze Barbara (Kim Parker) discover that
kindly yet intense professor R.E. Walgate (British character vet Kynaston
Reeves) is actually projecting his thoughts via atomic energy into hideous
mutant brains that fly through the air, whip their tales around the necks of
their victims and suck out their brains. Now that’s entertainment: when not
engaged in the preservation of more lofty cinematic touchstones (see <i>Black
Narcissus</i> and <i>Double Suicide</i>, above), The Criterion Collection finds
plenty of time to rescue and restore such legendary B movies as <i>The Blob</i>,
Brian De Palma’s <i>Sisters</i> and Herk Hervey’s low-budget classic <i>Carnival
of Souls</i>. Cinematographer-turned-director Arthur Crabtree’s <i>Fiend
without a Face</i> fits snugly and proudly into this roster, a quasi-legendary
genre exercise that overcomes some early inertia to generate a supremely creepy
climax highlighted by a bevy of the brains terrorizing a group of humans trapped
in the living room of a remote house (<i>Night of the Living Dead</i>, anyone?).
The DVD sports a new, digitally-cleaned transfer from a 35mm fine-grain master
that preserves the stark black-and-white palette, while the always-dependable
Criterion extras include audio commentary from producer Richard Gordon and genre
film writer Tom Weaver; an illustrated essay on British genre films by film
historian Bruce Eder, an essay in the fold-out booklet by professor and author
Bruce Kawin; still photos and ephemera with commentary; and vintage
advertisements and lobby cards that provoke a tangible nostalgia for a long-lost
era of shamelessly titillating promotion.</font></span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana"><font size="2">On the eve of his death in
1828 at eighty-two, the painter Francisco de Goya y Lucientes (Francisco Rabal)
lies confused and ill in the house he shares with the last of his many lovers,
Leocadia (Eulalia Ramón), and their young daughter Rosario (Dafne Fernández).
Helpless to control the visions that come to him unbidden, his life and
tumultuous times are then told in flashback, as the forgetful Goya (embodied as
a younger man by actor Jose Coronado) spins tales of his eventful life -- he
lived through the decline of Spain, four monarchies, occupied government and
bloody war of independence -- to the tolerant Rosario, who’s obviously heard
them all before. Beyond breathtaking, this collaboration between director Carlos
Saura and cinematographer Vittorio Storaro (whose numerous collaborations
include <i>Flamenco</i> and <i>Tango</i>) pulses with life, energy and
imagination, as key works from the painter’s oeuvre are brought vividly to
life on lavish sets constructed at Rome’s storied Cinecitta Studios. Although
unscreened at presstime, Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment’s DVD edition of
the film promises a stunning sensory experience, a riot of light, color and
sound accessible regardless of prior familiarity with Goya or his work; the VHS
tape is priced to rent.</font></span></p>

<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">Here’s an
invigorating and charming companion piece to Ken Burns’ Jazz (see January’s
Box Set Corner). Filmed at Paramount’s studio in Astoria, Queens, these
collections of authentic period short films from some of the greatest names in
music -- originally conceived to preface and complement the Hollywood movies of
the period on a theater’s bill -- flesh out the clips presented in the Burns
work. Thus, while Jazz shows clips from Louis Armstrong’s <i>A Rhapsody in
Black and Blue</i> (which gets disc one off to a propulsive start), the set-up
to the song is included here to place it in dramatic context. A standout lighter
moment on disc two features Anna Chang fending off the advances of obnoxious
sailor Cary Grant in <i>Singapore Sue</i>. The roster of talent is truly
impressive, with performances from Duke Ellington, Ethel Merman, Cab Calloway,
Ginger Rogers, Fats Waller, Bessie Smith, Bing Crosby and many more. Without
overt emphasis, the compilation also addresses the criticism that Latin
influences on jazz are underserved in Burns’ documentary: Vincent Lopez’ <i>Those
Blues</i> and the special bonus short <i>Jazz a la Cuba</i>, featuring Don
Aspiazu and His Famous Cuban Orchestra doing that Rhumba thing under aerial
shots of old Havana, provide a vivid climax to volume one. The clever menu page
of these Kino on Video editions have a jukebox interface, which allows the

<p><span style="font-size: 10.0pt; font-family: Verdana">A conflicted yet feisty
young woman, Lolly Ann (Angela Bettis) finds her ticket out of a repressed
smalltown life in the form of Mexican classmate Joseph (Douglas Spain), who
breaks into her home while on the lam from a violent run-in with racist locals.
The generally firm-handed directorial debut of actor Don Most (Ralph Malph on
the old <i>Happy Days</i> TV program), the film overcomes a heavy-handed racist
subplot to soar on the wings of the chemistry between the two leads and Bettis’
remarkable, mercurial perf as Lolly Ann. An extraordinary complex creature whose
demeanor recalls the noble vulnerability of Joan Allen and the defiant resolve
of Holly Hunter, the teenager is straddling that fence between adolescence and
womanhood, burdened with an austere childhood yet not quite ready to stand on
her own two feet. In the same way Juliette Lewis commanded the screen in Martin
Scorsese’s remake of <i>Cape Fear</i> by virtue of her anonymity, Bettis --
who segued from this to a distinctive supporting role in <i>Girl, Interrupted</i>
-- gives proceedings an unpredictable, invigorating emotional charge. Vanguard
International’s VHS release is priced to rent, and research indicates the DVD
has no extra features.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family:Verdana"><font size="2">Called out of retirement by
his former boss Jack Crawford (Dennis Farina) to help catch the crudely dubbed
&quot;Tooth Fairy&quot; serial killer (Tom Noonan), intuitive and empathetic FBI
Forensics expert Will Graham (William Peterson, who plays an older and wiser
spin on the character in CBS’ surprise hit <i>CSI: Crime Scene Investigation</i>)
is reluctantly forced to seek advice from his old nemesis, the now-incarcerated
but still highly dangerous madman Hannibal Lecktor (Brian Cox). After the brutal
killing of tabloid journalist Freddie Loundes (Stephen Lang), blind photo
developer Reba (Joan Allen) is imperiled, only to be daringly rescued by Graham.
Michael Mann’s third feature and first following the tremendous success of his
television series <i>Miami Vice</i>, <i>Manhunter</i> takes a number of
liberties with its source novel, Thomas Harris’ &quot;Red Dragon&quot; (&quot;Lecter&quot;
somehow becomes &quot;Lecktor&quot;), yet Mann nails not only a suffocating mood
of sinister dread but a visual strategy that is at once obviously 1980s lurid
but somehow timeless in its elemental, stylized use of color -- qualities which
have earned the film a reputation as among the most stylish and frightening of
the decade. Credit cinematographer Dante Spinotti, working on his first American
film, for refining a look that has served Mann well in his subsequent movies
(both <i>Heat</i>, which was in gestation at the time, and the acclaimed <i>The
Insider</i> reflect both story themes and visual motifs). Anchor Bay
Entertainment offers both the razor-sharp and vivid transfer of the released
version and a &quot;Director’s Cut&quot; on separate VHS tapes. The single DVD
edition features two David Gregory documentaries on the film, <i>The Manhunter
Look: A Conversation with Dante Spinotti</i> (ten minutes) and Noonan, Peterson,
Cox and Allen’s reminiscences in <i>Inside Manhunter</i> (seventeen minutes),
while a two-disc &quot;Limited Edition&quot; has the released version on one
disc and the director’s version (only three minutes longer and reportedly of
poor quality) on disc two. Conspicuously absent from any supplementary material
is Mann himself.</font></span></p>

enjoyable &quot;B&quot; monster movies from the Fifties and early Sixties is
alive and may be found in this 1984 picture (previously released as <i>Night
Shadows</i>). Two brothers, Jack (the talented Wings Hauser) and Mike (Lee
Montgomery), are on vacation and have their car waylaid outside a town in the
Carolinas which, coincidentally, has a chemical plant nearby which is dumping
toxic waste that is subsequently turning all the inhabitants in the town into
toxic zombies with a very bad attitude towards garden-variety human beings (one
zombie, trying to get at someone in a car, simply sticks its finger up to the
glass of a closed window and melts his way through it). Bo Hopkins plays the
town's disgraced sheriff, trying to make good, and Jennifer Warren is the town
doctor. Jody Medford also provides some female interest: in her first scene, she
says &quot;I must look a mess,&quot; then takes off the kerchief ‘round her
head, lets down her hair, and turns into a Vargas beauty. John &quot;Bud&quot;
Cardos directed, and the picture has a lush music score by Richard Band, some
surprising plot turns, fine make-up effects, and a couple of genuinely creepy
moments.</span></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Among the most audacious and subversive
conjurers in the cinema, Dusan Makavejev (b. 1932, Belgrade) used the
do-it-yourself filmmaking aesthetic necessitated by his Yugoslav birth and
upbringing, combined with a keen appreciation for psychology (in which he
majored at university) -- and an eternally controversial championing of the
libido over all -- to fashion some of the most distinctive and freewheeling
feature films ever conceived. Built largely around staged sequences featuring
actors improvising in real-life situations (often supplemented by
&quot;found&quot; footage), each work is a volatile mix of drama and
documentary, comedy and tragedy, sex and politics, all uniquely informed by the
filmmaker’s nomadic lifestyle. After years of spotty availability, Facets
Video has assembled six of his 10 features to date (including his first four)
into one cohesive package that charts the improvisational yet firmly focused
concerns of this visionary, provocative filmmaker. In <i>Man is Not a Bird</i> (<i>&#268;ovek</i>
<i>nije Tica</i>, Yugoslavia, 1965), an engineer assembling machinery in a small
town finds love and wonder, while <i>Love Affair, or the Case of the Missing
Switchboard Operator </i>(<i>Ljubavni slu&#269;aj ili tragedija službenice</i>,
Yugoslavia, 1967) looks at the romance between a rat exterminator and the title
character. <i>Innocence Unprotected</i> (<i>Nevinost bez zaštite</i>,
Yugoslavia, 1968) reassembles the surviving cast and crew of a grade-Z 1942
melodrama made in Nazi-occupied Belgrade, while his most notorious work, <i>W.R.
-- Mysteries of the Organism</i> (<i>W.R. -- Misterije organizma</i>,
Yugoslavia/Federal Republic of Germany, 1971) hilariously mixes the teachings of
sex therapist Wilhelm Reich with various dramatic and documentary sequences
promoting political and sexual insurrection (that the &quot;W.R.&quot; might
also mean &quot;world revolution&quot; is just one of many elements that earned
the film both the Luis Buñuel prize at the Cannes festival and a an exhibition
ban from unamused Yugoslav authorities). Two flamboyant tales of sexual
emancipation in France and Holland form the backbone of the eternally
controversial and little-seen <i>Sweet Movie</i> (France/Federal Republic of
Germany/Canada, 1975), while the 1992 return to form <i>Gorilla Bathes at Noon</i>
(Germany, 1992) follows a disoriented and abandoned Russian officer around the
changing Berlin landscape. Of his remaining four features, only 1981’s
Swedish-British co-production Montenegro (aka <i>Pigs and Pearls</i>, starring
Susan Anspach) is available; among the works apparently gone missing is among
his most high-profile, 1985’s Australian-shot <i>The Coca Cola Kid</i>, in
which Eric Roberts and Greta Scacchi tryst against the backdrop of a whimsical
soft drink war (many of these films will be broadcast on the Sundance Channel in
early February). Each tape is also available individually at $24.95; at $149.95
the complete set is no monetary bargain but offers the committed cineaste an
invaluable glimpse into iconoclastic mid-century central European filmmaking. </font><font size="2"><span style="font-family:Verdana">
