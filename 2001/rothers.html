            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>The Others</i> begins with a 
            horrific scream. A really gruesome, creep-you-out scream, issuing 
            from Grace (Nicole Kidman), as she awakens from a nightmare. With 
            the camera close on her white-white face, she gasps for breath, then 
            composes herself. Fervently Catholic and genteelly stoic, Grace 
            rises to confront her day. She's had nightmares before. </font></b>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">During the final days of World War 
            II, Grace is living in a huge mansion on the dreary Isle of Jersey, 
            a place picked out by her husband Charles (Christopher Eccleston), a 
            couple of years ago, just before he left for the front. Though 
            chances are slim to none, Grace holds out hope that he will return, 
            partly in reaction to the dire turns her life has suddenly taken: 
            not only have her servants mysteriously &quot;vanished into thin air,&quot; 
            but a strange malady has made her children suddenly deathly allergic 
            to sunlight. She now must keep the curtains drawn at all times, and 
            to ensure that no crack of light slips in accidentally, she carries 
            with her a clinking big ring of keys and locks every door behind her 
            before she moves on to another room. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's no surprise that the kids -- 
            Anne (Alakina Mann) and Nicholas (James Bentley) -- are looking 
            pasty, even cadaverous. Still, they hardly alarm the new crew of 
            servants who arrive unexpectedly to apply for the newly vacant 
            positions. Stern housekeeper Mrs. Mills (Fionnula Flanagan), 
            literally mute maid Lydia (Elaine Cassidy), and crinkly yard man Mr. 
            Tuttle (Eric Sykes) show up on the doorstep, just on the chance 
            there may be work at the house, where, they say, they worked a long 
            time ago. Seeing Grace's distress, Mrs. Mills reassures her that 
            they will soon have the place in order, the dead branches and dusty 
            attic rooms all cleaned up. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Written, directed, and scored by 
            the young Spanish filmmaker Alejandro Amenabar, <i>The Others</i> 
            explores the evolving relationship between Grace and the servants, 
            especially Mrs. Mills, as this mirrors Grace's changing perception 
            of herself, in the world. Full of self-doubts but determined to 
            stick to her faith and above all, protect her children, Grace 
            struggles to maintain her respectable household and her sanity. 
            Actually, the house -- foreboding, massive, and creaky, not to 
            mention very dark -- is an apt metaphor for Grace's changing 
            sensibility and self-image. While she feels trapped within and by 
            it, she also feels connected to it, unable to leave, partly because 
            her children are stuck inside, but also because she's so used to her 
            solitude that she's becoming vaguely afraid to venture outside.
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film's concentrated focus on 
            Grace's internal struggle means that Kidman is on screen during much 
            of the film, and she makes an exemplary neo-gothic heroine, her face 
            drained of color and her posture achingly proper, perhaps especially 
            when some unseen scary thing is coming up behind her. And there are 
            unseen scary things in the house. Throughout <i>The Others</i>, what 
            you don't see is more dreadful than what you do. Grace's devotion to 
            her kids is admirable, of course, but the film is as much about the 
            oppressiveness and costs of being a mother, as it is about her 
            &quot;good&quot; maternal love. Within the film's architecture, Anne and 
            Nicholas are mostly extensions of Grace's troubled psyche. And this 
            makes their scary paleness even more pronounced. In an effort to 
            please their mother and avoid the effects of her migraine headaches, 
            Anne and Nicholas work hard at their school lessons, memorize Bible 
            passages, and stay as quiet as possible. Most of the time, they 
            appear to be eerily serene, whispering to one another about mummy's 
            recent &quot;breakdown&quot; (to which they allude in only the vaguest terms), 
            or fretting about the &quot;intruders&quot; who come to their bedroom at 
            night. In particular, Anne describes and then sketches a boy named 
            Viktor, whom no one else can see. Like many older sisters, she 
            insists on frightening while also looking out for her brother, in 
            this case, by detailing the differences between ghosts who &quot;wear 
            sheets and rattle chains&quot; and those who are less aggressive, like 
            Viktor. Nicholas is skeptical, but willing to believe her, as he can 
            come up with no other explanation for the noises in the house.
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The kids' lives apart from Grace, 
            even in their confinement, make them seem like little strangers, and 
            Grace's increasing fearfulness and withdrawal only exacerbate the 
            situation. Kidman -- with the help of fabulous shadows and gently 
            probing close-ups -- conveys Grace's developing brittleness while 
            making you sympathize with her. Amenabar's elegant score -- mostly 
            comprised of stark, single notes -- raises the emotional ante while 
            making your imagination do most of the work. Grace's nervousness 
            around the servants, who are so obviously &quot;other,&quot; by job definition 
            and by entrenched class system, is especially acute and well-drawn. 
            Mrs. Mills hovers in the hallways, quietly observing and judging, 
            and Grace begins to resent and depend on her simultaneously. Despite 
            her stiff-upper-lippish demeanor and continued attempts to get the 
            servants on her &quot;side,&quot; in taking care of the children and 
            maintaining the house, Grace can't help but feel her grasp on her 
            environment is slipping away. Her loss shapes the film's gradual 
            narrative movement, away from some material surface reality, into 
            some more substantive and much more alarming surrealness, beyond 
            what's visible. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There's good reason for Grace to 
            feel this loss, as far as we can see, which frankly, isn't so far. 
            Given the premise -- that the house must remain dark at all times --
            <i>The Others</i> has a built-in ghastliness, which it deploys to 
            great effect. As Grace walks from room to room, her sensible shoes 
            clacking on the hardwood floors, the camera follows or anticipates 
            where she's headed, but can never show explicitly what's around her. 
            Your vision is thus as limited as hers, and the film sucks you up 
            inside her emotional fraying, without you being quite aware that 
            it's happening. This isn't to say that the movie's structure is 
            perfect -- early on, you start to imagine where it might be headed, 
            as particularly odd events occur, but it's never so annoying as the 
            film to which it's being compared, the overrated <i>Sixth Sense</i>. 
            At twenty-nine, Amenabar already has established himself as a 
            filmmaker possessed of unusual subtlety and sensitivity. As in his 
            previous work, here the fragmented narrative forces your 
            participation in its unfolding. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And so, as it becomes clear that 
            &quot;others&quot; are not only external threats, but also coming from within, 
            you are also implicated, you are part of this fabric of relations 
            and fears. Though Grace is intent on &quot;closing the curtains,&quot; she 
            can't keep the light out (so, yes, the overriding metaphor is a 
            little obvious). And her need to see mirrors yours. As she forces 
            herself to investigate her own home, discovering its history as well 
            as her own suppressed memories, she also comes to understand her own 
            complexities, her beliefs, and her relationships. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There is, of course and 
            unfortunately, an evolving context in which to read <i>The Others</i>, 
            having to do with its production history and current promotional 
            apparatus. Kidman's starring role has something to do with her 
            ex-husband Tom Cruise's production of the film (along with his long 
            time professional partner, Jane Wagner), and Cruise's complicated 
            relationship with Kidman and Amenabar extends to his appearance in 
            the upcoming <i>Vanilla Sky</i>, the U.S. remake of Amenabar's 
            previous, Spanish film, <b><i>Abre Los Ojos</i></b> (<i>Open Your 
            Eyes</i>), which starred the then unknown Penelope Cruz, who is also 
            starring in the remake and now reportedly living in new boyfriend 
            Tom's LA mansion. Oh, the tangled webs! </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The drama came to a (non -) head at 
            the 7 August premiere of the film, where ex-&quot;power couple&quot; Cruise 
            and Kidman both made appearances, separately. I can't tell you how 
            many times I've seen the clip of the tensely smiling Mr. &quot;Show Me 
            the Money&quot; asserting his &quot;professional&quot; obligation to support the 
            film. In a weird, remote, like-you're-watching-a-movie kind of way, 
            the taut smiles and awkward bodies can make you feel badly for all 
            of them. And all right, while all this gossipy stuff has nothing to 
            do with the movie, there's an uncomfortable resonance in the 
            relentless sense of otherness that Hollywood breeds, perhaps 
            especially between those far-off &quot;stars&quot; and those human &quot;fans&quot; who 
            are trained to sympathize and identify with their idols. How much 
            more &quot;other&quot; can you be than to be a movie star or her fan? </font>
