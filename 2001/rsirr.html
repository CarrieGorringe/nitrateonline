            kid has talent! Mad skills!&quot; Though this line is uttered by one
            Coach Griffin (Michael Clarke Duncan), it's clear that this is
            exactly what every character in <i>They Call Me Sirr</i> thinks
            about young Sirr Parker, star cornerback, devoted older brother to
            Donyea, and very nice person. We might assume that the real-life
            Parker (now twenty-three years old and coming off his rookie season
            with the Cincinnati Bengals) is all of these things, but Robert
            Munic's film makes him look near-saintly, miring him in sports-flick
            and hood movie clichés until the poor kid can hardly move, no
            matter how mad his skills may be.</b> <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Unfortunately
            titled to call up memories of a couple of Sidney Poitier's most
            famous films (<i>To Sir, With Love</i> and <i>They Call Me Mr. Tibbs!</i>),
            <i>They Call Me Sirr</i> is one of those &quot;famous black
            individual&quot; movies, extolling the kid's extraordinary triumph
            over adversity in a way that is so clichéd that you end up feeling
            grumpy and guilty that you can't feel good for him. The film never
            actually tells you why Parker's mother named him Sirr (though you
            might guess, as the press notes explain, that she had in mind to
            &quot;ensure him respect&quot;). The film begins with a voice over,
            in which the teenaged Parker (played by the charismatic Kente Scott)
            reminisces, &quot;It's funny how some things stick in your mind, no
            matter how hard you try to cut them loose... The one thing I always
            remember making sense to me was football.&quot; As a means to
            introduce our hero's difficult situation -- living in South Central
            Los Angeles, abandoned by his junkie mom Sharon (Novie Edwards),
            being raised by his ailing Grams (Jackie Richardson), and finding
            his talent and salvation in playing football -- this is a seriously
            bland bit of narration, its lack of originality underlined by the
            fact that it accompanies a series of black and white images of the
            boy and his ball. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            a child, Sirr has a couple of clean-looking banger friends, Damian
            (Chris Collins) and Dante (Doron Bell, Jr.), who look out for him,
            cheering him on at football games, refusing to let him participate
            in gang activities, and, most remarkably, never aging a day, even
            while Sirr himself is played by three actors (first by Trevonne
            Chung, then Kyle Kassardjian, and finally, Scott). &quot;You got the
            gift, Sirr&quot; declares Dante. Or again, &quot;This ain't your
            life, Sirr. Your life is much bigger!&quot; As well, the D's help
            Sirr take care of his little brother Donyea (Tyson Fennell, then
            Jordan Fennell), whom Sharon leaves with him during a brief,
            tearful, and painfully trite almost-reunion scene. Marked as an
            addict by her dark-circles-under-the-eyes makeup and shambling
            affect, Sharon approaches Sirr and her mother on the sidewalk,
            infant swaddled in her arms. When cute little Sirr gives her the
            evil eye and asks why she hasn't called, it's just too much. Sharon
            loses her cool, hands her baby over to Grams, and runs off down the
            street, with the camera looking after her from the boy's point of
            view. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Such
            movie-of-the-weekish insta-plotting happens again and again in <i>They
            Call Me Sirr</i>, simplifying emotions so they're identifiable --
            and painfully familiar from previous movies and TV -- in twenty
            seconds or less. Repeatedly, you see Sirr grappling with his
            feelings and demands on his time, both needing and resenting his
            mom, loving and stressing about football, washing dishes to support
            his brother and (I'm out of breath just listing all this...) getting
            good grades. A couple of montages show Sirr taking care of the baby,
            reading his weighty <i>American History</i> tome, and hauling ass to
            football practice. Then, bing!, he's old enough for high school, at
            which time he meets his greatest mentor, Coach Griffin, who first
            appears looming in the foreground of a shot, his mouth wide and
            voice booming as he yells at his players, driving them to excel. As
            soon as Coach catches one glimpse of Parker on the field, he knows
            all he needs to know, and comes by the house (which, he helpfully
            reminds his assistant, he never does!) to insist the boy play for
            his Monroe High School team. This is an opportunity too fabulous to
            pass up, as it will inevitably lead to Sirr being scouted by
            colleges (he ends up at Texas A&amp;M). &quot;I'm not in the dream
            business,&quot; Coach assures Grams. &quot;I deal in reality.&quot;
            Right.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            saga continues, organized like <i>Love &amp; Basketball</i>, by
            &quot;quarters&quot; (1st, 2nd, etc.), and celebrating Sirr's huge
            heart, as well as setting up little snippets of story -- Sirr's
            grandma dies (after a scene or two where she coughs ominously), his
            teammate is killed by gang members, and his homeboys are involved in
            a drive-by shooting, artfully intercut with a football game, so that
            slow-motion bodies are flying every whichway. Gee, do you think the
            sequence is suggesting that violence is the American Way? You could
            say that subtlety is not this movie's strong suit. You could also
            say that it doesn't do right by its subject. While Sirr Parker's
            story is inspiring and moving, <i>They Call Me Sirr</i> is anything
            but. <o:p>
