            Korean films have been about as popular among mainstream U.S.
            filmgoers as an American-built television set found over in that
            neck of the world. We just haven't seen all that many at the local
            art house. One of the strongest economies in East Asia, it also has
            a thriving film industry that rarely gets exposed to those of us on
            the other side of the Pacific Ocean. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Lies
            (Gojitmal)</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Nowhere to Hide (Injong sajong polkot opta</i>), and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Chunhyang</i>
            all had North American commercial premieres late last year in New
            York City, and the latter is now helping warm seats at D.C.'s
            Visions Cinema/Bistro/Lounge. It relieves neck strain that Visions'
            screens are higher than most theaters, making for easier reading of
            the subtitles. Thanks to distributor Lot 47 Films, a taste of the
            Orient has landed here for a limited layover.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            for director Im Kwon Taek, it hasn't been easy crossing the ocean.
            For the most part critics and film festivals attendees have been the
            only lucky ones to catch up with a small fraction of his work. Those
            family-owned Korean markets that dot American suburbia undoubtedly
            offer up more of his product off their video shelves than we
            realize, yet lacking one key ingredient -- subtitles. Im, Korea's
            most highly regarded director, has had a prodigious directorial
            career, dating back to his 1962 debut feature <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Farewell
            to the Duman River</i>. At age sixty-four he had been producing two
            to three films a year; <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Chunhyang</i>
            is his ninety-sixth film in nearly four decades of filmmaking, yet
            only the second that I know of that has had theatrical outings in
            the United States. The other title, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Sopyonje</i>
            (1993), enjoyed at two-week engagement in Washington but probably
            was little seen outside of major metropolitan markets. His output
            has trickled lately -- this is only his fourth feature in the last
            seven years -- but you can see the hand of a master at work in this
            single movie. And often in single frames.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Im
            has fashioned, through screenwriter Kim Myoung Kon, the latest
            retelling of an old Korean legend of teen romance and class
            struggles, the cultural equivalent of Shakespeare's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Romeo
            and Juliet</i> retold with the angst (and music) as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">West
            Side Story</i>. It is story that has been told many times before in
            Korean cinema, but this fable has also been embedded into other art
            forms, including novel, poem, opera, play, animation, television,
            soap opera, and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">p'ansori</i>, a blending of music and ballad that enraptures audiences
            with energetic one-man storytelling. This performance art is
            heightened by emotionally forceful rhythms of an accompanying
            drummer, an integral part of the duet as it is he who navigates the
            pace of the tale. Im has placed this traditional operatic technique
            as an overlay for his modern cinematic tableau of bold colors,
            breath-taking landscapes, and impeccable acting. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">P'ansori</i>,
            often inspired by folk tales, was used in the 1970s and 1980s by
            rebellious students to mock existing political agendas. Here, Im
            cushions his adaptation around a live performance by Cho Sang Hyun,
            a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">p'ansori</i> Pavarotti whose
            incantations are often heard over the soundtrack, and his
            percussionist partner Myung Hwan Kim.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Im
            undertook a nationwide search for his young stars, seeking
            youngsters he felt exuded the particular undimpled fifteen-year-old
            beauty he desired. Lee Hyo Jung and Cho Seung Woo thus became
            Chunhyang (which translates as &quot;spring fragrance&quot;), the
            delicate daughter of a courtesan, and Mongryong Lee, the privileged
            son of a Namwon district governor. They marry in secret, their
            forbidden upper/lower caste union known only to the noble son's
            devoted and somewhat comic servant Pangja (Kim Hak Yong),
            Chunhyang's fierce-hearted mother and proud former courtesan Wolmae
            (Kim Sung Nyu, also well known as a female <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">p'ansori</i>)
            and her family's staff. A year passes and the boys' father is
            appointed to a high position in Seoul and the love-obsessed couple
            must part or face class embarrassment. Her Yin descends to a life of
            sadness and loneliness, while his Yang forces himself into three
            years of intense studies for a difficult test that might result in a
            well-heeled position. He more than succeeds, but is immune to the
            fact that a new governor back in Namwon province has learned of the
            undisclosed marriage and smugly pursues Chunhyang. He terrorizes the
            citizens and in particular the young wife, who defiantly bows to
            agonizing torture rather than become the spiteful leader's
            courtesan. Joan of Arc is an obvious role model here. Righteousness
            and love win out in the end.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            Korea's largest filmed production ever, employing over 8,000 extras
            and 12,000 costumes over a four-month shooting schedule, the effort
            recaptured in painstaking historical accuracy (enhanced with some
            fully-integrated CGI work) the reality of eighteenth-century Korea.
            The photography by Jung Il Sung (whose camerawork is as steady,
            deliberate, and determined as the cast) often overwhelms the action,
            imbuing golden hues, rolling fogs, and intoxicating images, but
            these become luscious memories, savored long after leaving the
            theater. The first sighting of Chunhyang catches her on a giant
            swing draped from a large tree, he angelic motions sweeping higher
            and higher, her dress billowing about her attractive frame. The
            ecstasy and intensity of the story, characters, and production molds
            <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Chuhnyang</i> into a majestic
            masterpiece. If you're looking for that next taste of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
