            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 28 December
            2001</i></font><p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The only 
            explanation for <i>The Majestic</i> must be that everyone was out of 
            their minds while they were making it, or at least temporarily taken 
            leave of their senses. This is a movie that zooms straight into 
            cloud-cuckooland from the start and never comes back.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Pete (Jim Carrey), a Hollywood 
            screenwriter in 1951, gets conked on the head, loses his memory, and 
            wanders into the quaint California small town of Lawson, where he is 
            immediately mistaken for Luke, one of the local boys who went off to 
            fight in World War Two, was highly decorated, and then became 
            missing-in-action. Luke's father (Martin Landau) is also the 
            proprietor of the local movie theater, which has been closed down 
            since after the war, and Pete helps get it spruced up and re-opened, 
            thus reviving the town's dreams and spirit in the process. Everyone 
            loves him (there is one dissenter, but, considering that he lost an 
            arm during the war, you can understand why he'd be cranky) -- but 
            then a fleet of F.B.I. cars, arriving with all the noise and thunder 
            of Klaatu's flying saucer landing on the Washington Mall in <i>The 
            Day the Earth Stood Still</i>, pulls into town. Seems Pete was about 
            to be served with a subpoena by the House Un-American Activities 
            Committee, which had just come west to search for Reds under 
            Hollywood's beds when Pete lost his memory.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film's depiction of Lawson, an 
            apparently typical small town in grass-roots America during the 
            years after World War Two, is so bucolic that I almost expected it 
            to be revealed as a hallucination Pete had been having while he was 
            being hospitalized for a concussion. It has the too-perfect look of 
            those small towns that characters sometimes wandered into on <i>The 
            Twilight Zone</i>. People say things like, &quot;Great guys should always 
            win..” TV is dismissed as something that will never catch on because 
            it lacks being a communal experience -- &quot;Where are the other people? 
            Where's the audience?&quot; Pete's idyll in Lawson also seems like it's 
            been made up almost entirely from recycled bits and pieces from 
            other movies. The most obvious is <i>Hail the Conquering Hero</i> 
            (1944), but Preston Sturges, who knew better, set up the conceit so 
            that Eddie Bracken's character knows, going in, what he is doing -- 
            he not only doesn't want to let the townspeople down by saying that 
            he is actually someone else, but he also feels badly over having 
            been excluded from war service to begin with.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Here, Pete is not just playing to 
            the townspeople's illusions, he's supposed to be finding a life for 
            himself in Lawson that he never had in Hollywood, although we're 
            shown so little of what that life was like in Hollywood that we 
            don't know what he was missing. (We do know that he was a minor 
            screenwriter, with only one film to his credit, a cheesy flick 
            entitled <i>Sand-Pirates of the Sahara</i>, which makes H.U.A.C.'s 
            pursuit of him seem even more improbable.) On the other hand, since 
            so little is shown of Pete's earlier existence, you begin to wonder 
            if &quot;Pete&quot; was who Luke was, for the nine-plus years that he was 
            missing in between the war and his return home to Lawson. (You have 
            lots of time trying to get this movie to make sense in your head 
            while your watching it -- it is played out, at length, for over 
            two-and-a-half hours.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jim Carrey does show, during the 
            scenes in Lawson, an ability to express sincerity and joy in a 
            quiet, genuine manner that at times approaches gracefulness. (It's a 
            very fine quality that will probably be used to good effect in 
            another movie.) But he's supposed to be playing a lost man, here, 
            and a sense of emptiness wells up in Carrey's chestnut-dark eyes, so 
            much so that, when he later strikes his mighty blow against H.U.A.C., 
            you don't know where it's coming from or what his character's 
            drawing from within himself to perform it.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Everything winds up with Pete 
            appearing before the H.U.A.C. Committee, in Washington, where, 
            standing before members played by Hal Holbrook and a formidably icy 
            Bob Balaban, he ends up -- giving them a lecture on the First 
            Amendment, and even calling the committee members &quot;bitter.” Luke's 
            girlfriend, Adele (Laurie Holden, who has a cascade of blonde hair 
            and the smoky-eyed look of Lizabeth Scott), had exhorted Pete to 
            remember what the boys from Lawson were fighting for over in Europe, 
            and how they waged a war against the forces of Fascism. A lot of 
            people who actually appeared before H.U.A.C. were long-standing 
            anti-Fascists, and some of them indeed tried to remind the Committee 
            about First Amendment protections which were guaranteed to U.S. 
            citizens under law, but before they could speak their piece, the 
            Committee, not wanting to listen to any of that, simply cited them 
            for contempt of Congress (the Committee being a Congressional body) 
            and threw them in the hoosegow. Some were given a second chance, and 
            were brought out of jail in exchange for naming names; others, for 
            personal or professional reasons, &quot;cooperated&quot; with H.U.A.C. before 
            even running the risk of jail time. None of the H.U.A.C.'s 
            investigations into Hollywood were televised, as &quot;The Majestic&quot; 
            claims they were; the later Army-McCarthy hearings were, which was 
            when defense lawyer Joseph N. Welch demolished Senator Joseph 
            McCarthy -- who, with his list of &quot;card-carrying Communists,” helped 
            get the whole &quot;Red scare&quot; thing started -- with only a few simple, 
            eloquent words. Bertolt Brecht, one of the very first in Hollywood 
            subpoenaed to testify, was the only one who managed to bamboozle his 
            way past H.U.A.C., and he had already booked passage back to Germany 
            directly after he was called to appear. Blacklisting in the 
            entertainment industries continued well up until the 1960s, and it 
            would not be until the 1970s that any serious reassessment of the 
            Committee's destructiveness, and utter futility, of the H.U.A.C. 
            investigations would be made. (No instance of Communist 
            anti-government subversion or influence was ever discovered, but a 
            lot of people were thrown out of work, some of them for good, and 
            some even committed suicide because of it.).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">All of these inconvenient 
            historical facts make Pete's little hatchet blow against H.U.A.C. in
            <i>The Majestic</i> look even more dubious, because it never could 
            have happened. Yet, the filmmakers have claimed that this picture is 
            the first &quot;real&quot; depiction of the McCarthy era. Why have they 
            invented this? Are the filmmakers THAT desperate for a feel-good 
            movie, at any price? Are they making it for us, or for themselves?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There's been some bickering, 
            recently, over the veracity of <i>A Beautiful Mind</i>, but the 
            makers of that film set out to make a valid, and engrossing, 
            depiction of mental illness, and on those terms the film succeeds 
            admirably. <i>Pearl Harbor</i> pointedly left out such highly 
            pertinent facts as the Japanese occupation of China, and ended on 
            the chokingly awful line, &quot;Before the Doolittle raid [on Tokyo], 
            America knew nothing but defeat. After it, nothing but victory.&quot; 
            That film was the product of hacks who were trying to pull one over 
            on the audience; <i>The Majestic</i> is the work of ostensibly 
            talented and sensible people who ended up making (to borrow a term 
            from Peter Rainer) a &quot;fully-realized dud,” one where they followed 
            through on their original vision to the very end, no matter how 
            wonky that may actually be. It may be appropriate (coincidental? 
            deliberate? unconscious?) that the last film run by the Majestic 
            Theater is <i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</i>.</font></td>
