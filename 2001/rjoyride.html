            review by <a href="../kj.html" target="_top">KJ Doughton</a>, 5 October
            2001</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>Joy Ride</i>, the road 
            thriller directed by film <i>noir</i> master John Dahl, will 
            certainly have you gripping your armrest a time or two.&nbsp; However, 
            when viewers step off of this suspenseful yet formulaic roller 
            coaster, it’s a safe bet that they’ll be quickly diverted by 
            thoughts of unpaid bills, shopping lists, and other domestic 
            obligations.&nbsp; It’s not what you would call a “resonant” film.&nbsp; </b>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Unlike previous Dahl outings such 
            as <i>The Last Seduction</i> and <i>Red Rock West</i>, both of which 
            shot their characters into a pinball machine of unpredictable twists 
            and turns, <i>Joy Ride</i> has a more basic design.&nbsp; Boy drives 
            across the country to pick up his girlfriend. His troublesome 
            brother comes along for the rise. A malevolent trucker behind the 
            wheel of a sleek, eighteen-wheeler stalks them down the highways of 
            America. If this script blueprint sound familiar, that’s because 
            Steven Spielberg filmed it for <i>Duel</i>, a 1971 
            made-for-television nail-biter starring Dennis Weaver.&nbsp; More 
            recently, the road rage concept resurfaced in Jonathan Mostow's 1997 
            kidnapping thriller, <i>Breakdown</i>.&nbsp; <i>Joy Ride</i> is the 
            latest example of Hollywood’s fascination with terror on the 
            interstate, and it’s tense enough to make you reconsider that 
            upcoming cross-country trip you were planning for the fall.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Lewis Thomas (Paul Walker) is a 
            handsome, fresh-faced college student (think of a younger, 
            sandy-haired Rob Lowe) attending classes at a California 
            university.&nbsp; He gets a call from Venna (Leelee Sobieski), a lifelong 
            friend burning the midnight oil in a Colorado school.&nbsp; Even though 
            she is poised, shapely, and outgoing, Lewis has always perceived of 
            Venna as a “good friend.” Heaven forbid that romance would spoil 
            such a camaraderie, but love is what Lewis feels stirring inside 
            when Venna announces that she has broken up with her long-time 
            boyfriend.&nbsp; Lewis suggests that he trek to Boulder, pick her up, and 
            take her back east to their hometown for the holidays.&nbsp; She accepts.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A few complications arise, 
            however.&nbsp; Starving student Lewis has no wheels, so it’s down to the 
            corner used car lot to score a 1971 Chrysler Newport.&nbsp; Meanwhile, he 
            fits Salt Lake City into his agenda after the news that older 
            brother Fuller (Steve Zahn) is in jail there.&nbsp; It’s clear that 
            Fuller, who hasn’t made contact with his sibling in five years, is 
            an impulsive troublemaker.&nbsp; Combined with Lewis’ more tentative 
            nature, their chemistry is about as amiable as oil and water.&nbsp; The 
            duo stop in Montana for some minor car repairs, and Fuller has a 
            weathered, old citizen’s band radio added to the Chrysler.&nbsp; Soon, 
            the two are eavesdropping on conversing truckers who sling such 
            lingo as, “There’s a Kojack with a Kodak,” and “You’re coming up on 
            a 200-mile slip ‘n slide.”&nbsp; In this age of PCs and web surfing, it’s 
            somewhat startling to remember that CB radios are still a popular 
            communication tool. When Fuller refers to the device as “a type of 
            prehistoric Internet,” we can relate.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The heart of the film develops when 
            a raspy voice emanates from their radio, identifying itself as a 
            trucker with the handle Rusty Nail. &nbsp;Egged on by the insistent 
            Fuller, Lewis impersonates a female traveler that they dub Candy 
            Cane.&nbsp; So convincing are Lewis’ ladylike raps that he soon has Rusty 
            Nail lusting after him during a suggestive rapport.&nbsp; Later, after 
            they’ve staked out a Wyoming hotel room and had a run-in with an 
            obnoxious patron residing next door, the brothers hatch a cruel 
            prank.&nbsp; Lewis will summon Rusty Nail to the room next to them: 
            instead of an insatiable damsel, the trucker will contend will the 
            scumbag holed up there.&nbsp; It’s a humiliation that even Ben Stiller 
            couldn’t endure.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The scheme works.&nbsp; The boys fire up 
            their radio from the motel parking lot, and inform Rusty Nail to 
            “bring some pink champagne.”&nbsp; However, things turn ugly when police 
            show up at their door the next morning and announce that the 
            mangled, jawless body of their temporary neighbor has been pulled 
            off the freeway.&nbsp; Apparently, Rusty Nail doesn’t have much sense of 
            humor. Worse yet, he’s become aware of the boys’ identities, and 
            plans to even the score with some gruesome payback.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The remainder of <i>Joy Ride</i> is 
            an adrenaline rush of effective, if unlikely, action set pieces.&nbsp; 
            Especially strong is a scene involving a red herring that shatters 
            all expectations: it builds up unbearable tension, then reveals 
            itself as a false alarm. We chuckle in relief and wipe our brow.&nbsp; 
            Then, hell suddenly breaks loose all over again with no warning.&nbsp; 
            Dahl toys with us like a cruel predator, flashing signs of calm our 
            way before kicking them out of reach.&nbsp; By the time Venna unwittingly 
            joins the ride, Rusty Nail has turned into a truck-inhabiting 
            terminator who kidnaps her for use as bait for a vicious prank of 
            his own.&nbsp; “If you go to the police,” this faceless driver warns the 
            brothers, “I will take her apart, piece by piece.”</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Dahl employs Hitchcockian moments 
            of expert suspense, such as a cat-and-mouse chase through a 
            cornfield, and a motel showdown involving a rigged door, a shotgun, 
            and a parade of cops in hot pursuit.&nbsp; It’s some of the craftiest 
            nastiness since Brian DePalma in his prime. Meanwhile, there’s a 
            worn, rural tone to <i>Joy Ride</i> equal parts rain-spattered 
            windshields, the red and blue neon of a roadside motel’s “vacancy” 
            sign, and the vast, flat wastelands of a desert freeway.&nbsp; Envision
            <i>Blood Simple</i> by the Coen Brothers, and you’ve got a pretty 
            good picture of how things look in Dahl-land. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Even so, there’s something very 
            cardboard about the feel of <i>Joy Ride</i>.&nbsp; Dahl’s direction is so 
            smart, it’s hard to suspend disbelief as the vengeful trucker 
            becomes increasingly all knowing and indestructible.&nbsp; He seems to 
            know names, relationships, and locations without any explanation.&nbsp; 
            By the time his violent spree is over, he has emerged as Freddie 
            Krueger speeding around in a Peterbilt. Let’s hope that Dahl 
            abandons such paint-by-number genre pieces in the future, and 
            graduates to a more complex script that lives up to his wicked 
            talent.</font></td>
