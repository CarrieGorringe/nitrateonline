            review by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 15 February
            2001</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Writer-director Adam Brooks’
            adaptation of Jennifer Egan’s novel <i>The Invisible Circus </i>deals
            with several potent ideas: drugs, sex, terrorism and international
            relations. Curiously, the film is less engaging to the heart and
            mind than a long monologue on C-SPAN. Despite a solid cast and
            authentic European and American locations, the proceedings in <i>The
            Invisible Circus</i> inspire little more than indifference.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Beginning at the dawn of the '70s
            in San Francisco, the movie follows a young woman named Phoebe (Jordana
            Brewster) who has never really gotten over the death of her sister
            Faith (Cameron Diaz). Phoebe has always looked up to her older
            sibling and wished she, too, could on a whim take off for Europe.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Faith, as the tiresome voiceover
            constantly reminds us, was vivacious and cheerful. Therefore, it
            seems suspicious that she would kill herself. Deciding to get to the
            truth and to give herself a little adventure, Phoebe decides to head
            to the Old World herself when she reaches eighteen.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When she arrives, she discovers
            that some of her suspicions were reasonable. Faith’s boyfriend
            Wolf (Christopher Eccleston from <i>Elizabeth</i>) has changed
            radically since the early '70s. His once long hair (actually
            unconvincing extensions) is now cropped short, and his bohemian ways
            have long been abandoned. Wolf tries to tell the doubting Phoebe
            that her sister had joined some radical leftist movements that
            advocated violence. His case isn’t helped by his selective
            delivery of the truth.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Nor is the film’s romantic
            subplot. The strong-willed Phoebe and the more pragmatic Wolf have
            all the chemistry of oil and water, and all the narration Brewster
            can recite can’t change that. Brooks, whose previous writing
            efforts have included undistinguished films like <i>Practical Magic</i>
            and <i>French Kiss</i>, also goes overboard with flashbacks. At
            times, it’s a little tricky to tell when we are in the early '70s
            or the late '70s. These sequences are also so superficial that they
            add little to the current narrative. Brooks manages to waste the
            skills of two terrific actors like Blythe Danner and Patrick Bergin
            (as Phoebe’s parents) because he uses them as props rather than
            full characters. We are told volumes about their troubled
            relationship, but these scenes would be much more meaningful if we
            could actually see how their marriage is strained. We never see them
            really interacting, so we’re forced to take Phoebe’s word about
            the whole situation.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In addition, the core characters
            are hard to embrace. Phoebe seems impulsive and foolish, and her
            sister seems more frivolous than charismatic. Wolf’s cold manner
            makes him an odd romantic attraction, so one has a hard time
            believing that one woman, much less three, would fall for him.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To his credit, Brooks imbues a nice
            faded look that helps suggest the period nicely. He also avoids
            loading the soundtrack with needless oldies tunes. Nonetheless, he
            wastes a lot of time with a silly acid-inspired sequence that
            features Pheobe taking to her sister through a window pane. The
            sequence feels more forced and cheesy than surreal. Because of too
            many scenes like these, <i>The Invisible Circus</i> feels less like
            a drug trip and more like the annoying side effects on the morning
            after.</font>
