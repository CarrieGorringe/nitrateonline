            Adapted from Hanif Kureishi’s novel of the same title and his 
            stories <i>Nightlight</i>, <i>Strangers When we Meet</i> and <i>Love 
            in a Blue Time</i>, <i>Intimacy</i> provides a viewing experience 
            that mirrors its protagonists’ frustrating lack of fulfilment. The 
            film’s apparently uncompromising honesty regarding emotional 
            relationships is subverted by the unrelenting manner in which its 
            points are made. The unrelieved grimness of Jay (Mark Rylance) and 
            Claire’s (Kerry Fox) affair engenders a feeling that a real marriage 
            or sexual encounter is never quite as joyless as those on show here. 
            The voyeurism of the camera is too intense for sexiness, placing the 
            sex acts under a microscope until they become abstracted into a 
            melee of body parts. Even the brief, much-vaunted shot of oral sex, 
            reputedly the first to be screened in a mainstream picture, is so 
            real that it is unreal, and devoid of sensuality.</span></p>
            <p><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">
            The leads are impressive: Mark Rylance, delivers a strong 
            performance and Kerry Fox’s success in a gruelling part was rewarded 
            with a Best Actress award at Berlin this year. Timothy Spall as 
            Claire’s husband Andy delivers a typically layered and 
            scene-stealing performance. The presence of Marianne Faithful in a 
            cameo role strains narrative credibility but she plays her part 
            well. Rylance is best known in Britain as the artistic director of 
            The Globe Theatre, where he has staged productions of Shakespeare’s 
            plays with male actors in even the female roles, just as they would 
            have been in Shakespeare’s day. Rylance probes gender relationships 
            in a very different context here, but The Globe’s tenuous claims of 
            accurate reconstruction are paralleled by the inauthentic nature of 
            Chéreau’s mannered realism.</span></p>

            Though written and acted by British talent, <i>Intimacy</i> has a 
            French cinematographer, and it is the director Patrice Chéreau’s 
            first English language picture (best-known for his film <i>Queen 
            Margot</i>, or <i>La Reine Margot</i>). It is tempting to ascribe 
            the extraordinarily unforgiving treatment meted out to London in 
            this film to an outsider’s perspective. The city has never looked 
            quite so bleak, dun and alienating, an appropriate backdrop to the 
            story but an overly harsh depiction of the real London. The bleak 
            ugliness of Jay’s flat, where the lovers meet every Wednesday 
            afternoon for their passionate non-verbal sex sessions, ensure that 
            even the intense eroticism of the film’s first half hour is fatally 
            compromised.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align:justify">
            <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">The 
            inability of the sessions to continue once discourse and knowledge 
            has been introduced is poignant and convincing. Jay and Claire, both 
            on the run from marital and parental responsibilities, must maintain 
            the illusion that their relationship is fuelled solely by sexual 
            gratification. The moment Jay follows Claire to a pub cellar where 
            she plays Laura in a production of <i>The Glass Menagerie</i> is the 
            moment the spell begins to be broken. Jay’s ensuing, odd friendship 
            with Claire’s husband consolidates the damage.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align:justify">
            <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">
            Though the reasoning behind the end of Jay and Claire’s trysts is 
            made clear, their rationale for beginning their liaisons is left 
            frustratingly opaque. Meaningless sex would be easy for Jay’s trendy 
            bar manager character and an aspiring actress such as Claire without 
            recourse to the glum trappings and risky routine of weekly trysts in 
            a New Cross flat. Though this elusiveness of meaning and coherence 
            reflects the film’s primary message, that even under the starkest 
            scrutiny human motivations are inscrutable, plausibility of logic 
            and character motivation is too often tested.</span><br>
