            review by <a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>, 28 September
            2001</i></font>
            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>&quot;I'm pretty sure there's more 
            to life than just watching a really, really silly movie, and I plan 
            on finding out what that is.&quot;</i></font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thus says one intrepid film critic, 
            rephrasing one of the many nitwitted maxims uttered by infantile 
            Derek Zoolander and his fellow empty-headed male models. 
            Director-writer-star Ben Stiller has declared dumb-down war on the 
            fashion industry's suave strutter-boys in this big screen upgrade to 
            the mindless 1996 VH1/Vogue Fashion Awards character he co-created 
            with <i>MTV Movie Awards</i> writer-producer Drake Sather (who 
            shares screenwriting and story credit). Derek, the glamour-puss 
            poser <b><i>de rigueur</i></b> and Male Model of the Year three 
            times running has the hottest expression in the biz (&quot;He's almost 
            too good looking,&quot; offers up Natalie Portman, one of the many campy 
            celebrity cameos that pepper the film). Yet his world-renown, 
            sullenly vacant &quot;blue steel&quot; is showing signs of rigor mortis, and 
            his fans and <i>fashionistas</i> are aching for his new façade 
            &quot;magnum,&quot; a running gag, work-in-progress mug shot that finally 
            makes an opportune debut at a fashionably climactic moment. <i>
            Zoolander</i> is a masquerade spy caper for the cognitively 
            challenged. <i>Austin Powers</i> for the hard-edged, youngish 
            twenty-first-century masses, although not nearly as embraceable or 
            charming as that spy spoof in search of a wider audience. The 
            laughter you hear emanating from your belly is book-ended by loud 
            guttural groans and repetitive eyeball wanderings. Perhaps all these 
            variables can be explained by some well respected physicist in a 
            hypothetically elegant equation:</font></p>

            <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Bear in mind this is only a theory. 
            And I have not factored in the historically superficial predecessors 
            such as Mike Meyers, Jim Carrey, Adam Sandler, <i>Spinal Tap</i>, 
            and a host of other dimwitted—and more successful—satirical 
            ancestors. <i>Zoolander</i> stands just below the middle of the 
            crowd of &quot;this-in-not-a-cerebral comedy&quot; genre, no better, no worse. 
            It is eye candy aimed at the vacuous throes of our society, those 
            legions who are clueless about technology, left turns, and how 
            Starbucks orange mocha Frappuccino® might seriously affect your 
            driving habits. If you laughed at the stupidity that has spawned 
            such tech support urban legends—including the true one about the 
            person who broke the &quot;4x cupholder&quot; on his/her computer—then you 
            might get a kick out of how Derek and his &quot;stone&quot;-y-eyed competitor 
            Hansel (Owen Wilson) attempt to get some secret files out of an 
            Apple iMac.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The slender plotline involves a 
            hypnotic plot to assassinate the prime minister of Malaysia (what, 
            no fictional country?), a humanitarian figure intent on wiping out 
            child labor practices, miraculously regaled with a front-row seat 
            for the annual VH1 awards show. Huh? Well, that's the short story. I 
            won't go into the long one, as there isn't one, except for that thin 
            connection with the &quot;accidental&quot; deaths of all those pre-thirty 
            macho supermodels.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mixing conspiracy themes not 
            dissimilar to those found in <i>The Manchurian Candidate</i>, <i>
            Soylent Green</i>, and even the obscure <i>Wild in the Streets</i> 
            (a ludicrous 1968 drama in which anyone over thirty-five is sent to 
            retirement camps and fed a stream of hallucinogens), Derek Zoolander, 
            with an assist from &quot;humorless&quot; Time Magazine journalist Matilda 
            Jeffries (Christine &quot;Marcia, Marcia, Marcia&quot; Taylor, a.k.a. Mrs. Ben 
            Stiller), is cold on the trail of a dim secret behind why there are 
            no male models who live past a certain age. Popping up with a few 
            lines to force feed the story along is television's former ace of 
            government/alien conspiracy theory David Duchovny, again spoofing 
            his former character and offering one of the few genuine chuckles 
            escaping from yours truly. Frenetic <i>SNL </i>performer Will 
            Ferrell is the freakish, curly-haired Mugatu—evidently the 
            illegitimate offspring of Colonel Sanders—once the inventor of the 
            piano key necktie and a now a raging queen in fashion design circles 
            (Coming soon…<b><i>Derelicte</i></b>, the haughtiest line in 
            wretched excess). As the mannequin of several mysterious dark suits 
            espousing the rag trade's need for those young, cheap, foreign 
            fingers, he plots with Milla Jovovich's Katinka to brainwash the 
            feeble-minded hero. Ben's dad Jerry does his shtick as Maury 
            Ballstein, Derek's womanizing agent who is obliquely tied into the 
            plot.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Stiller's vanity salute to popular 
            culture's moronic simpleton sub-genre will undoubtedly tickle some 
            viewers' funny bones with goofy gratification. For others, it will 
            fall flatter than a buzz cut. <i>Zoolander</i> flits from one forced 
            gag to the next, be it an animated masculine &quot;walk-off&quot; between 
            Derek and nemesis Hansel (as refereed by David Bowie), the doltish 
            Derek mistaking bulimia for the ability to read minds, or a 
            frenzied, enlightened orgy involving the three principals, two 
            Finish dwarves, and a Maori tribesman.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In that momentary pause at the end 
            of <i>Zoolander</i>'s runway, it's time to stare off into the crowd 
            and see if anyone's laughing.</font></td>
