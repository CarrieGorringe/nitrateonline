            review by <a href="../gianni.html" target="_top">Gianni Truzzi</a>, 26 October
            2001</i></font><p align="left"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The 
            creepiest thing about <i>Donnie Darko</i> isn't his nighttime 
            rendezvous with a skull-faced bunny rabbit, or Donnie's wicked smile 
            as he slings the axe over his shoulder. It's the gnawing certainty 
            that we've seen these trappings before: the upper-middle class teens 
            in a tony private school, the boys prowling like wolf packs, the 
            girls sensing their adolescent power, the misfits chafing at 
            convention, obsessions with sex and kids living secret lives their 
            parents hardly guess at. This staple formula is familiar, but hard 
            to recognize among the dark, brooding wierdness. What 
            twenty-six-year-old writer-director Richard Kelly has made is a John 
            Hughes film (<i>Sixteen Candles</i>, <i>Pretty in Pink),</i> turned 
            inside-out, with its entrails hanging. </font></b>
            <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The year is 1988, 
            about a month before the presidential election, and the blare of
            Echo and the Bunny<font size="2">men's </font>&quot;Killing Moon&quot; as Donnie bicycles in his pajamas through the 
            well-groomed, automatically watered lawns of Middlesex bespeaks the 
            chafing of Reagan-era complacency. Donnie (Jake Gyllenhaal, of <i>
            October Sky</i>) is not your average troubled movie teen, but a 
            recovering juvenile arsonist, whose life is full of therapy and 
            medications. And now he makes nocturnal jaunts in a state of 
            half-sleep when summoned by a spirit in a grotesque rabbit suit -- a 
            sort of anti-Harvey -- named Frank. It's on one of these occasions, 
            a night when Frank informs him there are twenty-eight days until the 
            end of the world, that a jet engine of mysterious origin plummets 
            from the sky into Donnie's now empty bedroom.</font><p align="left">
            <font face="Verdana" size="2">After saving Donnie's life,&nbsp; Frank 
            beckons him to perform destructive acts, with which the confused 
            youth complies (&quot;I have to obey him, or I'll be left all alone,&quot; he 
            confides to his shrink, Katherine Ross), but to uncertain end as the 
            clock ticks down to the supposed apocalypse. To understand what's 
            happening to him, Donnie plunges into time travel mysticism and 
            wormhole theory with the aid of sympathetic teachers played by Noah 
            Wylie and Drew Barrymore (who also executive produced this daring 
            film).</font><p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It seems 
            almost inevitable that Donnie will connect with the equally troubled 
            new girl at school (<i>Stepmom's </i>Jenna Malone). He is as 
            alienated from his insular environment as <i>The Catcher in the Rye</i>'s 
            Holden Caulfield, or Benjamin in <i>The Graduate</i>, and in Kelly's 
            savage suburban world of cocaine-snorting bullies and aimless teen 
            cruelty, Donnie's apparent schizophrenia seems like twisted reason. 
            His intelligence (his scolding principal admits his test scores are 
            &quot;intimidating&quot;), is his weakness, making him smart enough to 
            recognize the hypocrisy around him, and what emerges, gradually but 
            indisputably from its sprawling threads, is a broad condemnation of 
            the 1980s.</font><p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Some 
            of Kelly's contrivances, woven amidst the synth-rock soundtrack of 
            Tears for Fears, The Church and Duran Duran, are overkill even as 
            they amuse. Patrick Swayze's turn as a self-help guru who distills 
            all human reactions to love or fear (wasn't Fear an eighties band, 
            too?) is a grand performance, but it stretches credulity to believe 
            that the town would be so in thrall to him that they would allow the 
            fundamentalist gym teacher (Beth Grant) to use his instructional 
            videos as her curriculum. It hardly seems necessary to manufacture 
            such a bizarre cause for commonplace teen resentment.</font><p align="left">
            <font face="Verdana" size="2">There is a note of payback for high 
            school slights in this young director's first feature, from the 
            caricatures of the right-wing townspeople to the snottiness of 
            classmates, but is that so wrong? William Goldman, the Olympian god 
            of screenwriting, famously contends that <i>all </i>writers are 
            driven by &quot;I'll show you&quot; revenge. In this context, Kelly's potshots 
            take on the sheen of a riff on the Hughesian universe of affluent 
            self-absorption.</font><p align="left">
            <font face="Verdana" size="2">With an ending that frustrates 
            meaningful interpretation, <i>Donnie Darko</i> is not a comforting 
            film, yet I take a great deal of comfort from it. It's encouraging 
            that a young man whose consciousness was forged in the vacuity of 
            the eighties, its celebration of the synthetic and the crucible of 
            reactionary politics, could resist its toxic embrace and compose 
            such a lashing indictment of his time. Kelly has made an imperfect 
            but audacious movie with a powerful visual style.&nbsp; This is a film 
            worth getting out to see, and I will be watching for his next one, 
            too.</font></td>
