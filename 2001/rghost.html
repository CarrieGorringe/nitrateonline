            review by <a href="../kj.html" target="_top">KJ Doughton</a>, 2 November
            2001</i></font><p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Enid, the heroine 
            of Terry Zwigoff’s <i>Ghost World</i>, models a Batman-style bondage 
            cap, a polka-dotted blouse, zebra-pattern shirts, and shocking-green 
            hair dye during the movie’s fascinating chronicle of her young, 
            post-high school life.&nbsp; Played by <i>American Beauty</i>’s Thora 
            Birch, this nonconformist might dress loud, but she’s an island of 
            bitter alienation beneath the makeup, shades, and fishnet 
            stockings.&nbsp; Using sarcasm and irony as defense weapons, Enid walks 
            the outside parameters of life, observing those around her with 
            barbed disdain. At her high school graduation ceremony, she snickers 
            as a wheelchair-bound student gives an inspirational speech about 
            surviving an auto accident and giving up drugs.&nbsp; “I liked her a lot 
            better when she was an alcoholic and a crackhead,” smirks Enid.
            </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Indeed, this retro-girl might seem 
            cold, but perhaps Enid has a point. Soon after the graduation 
            ceremony, she eyes the same injured classmate chugging booze at a 
            party.&nbsp; The world is full of phonies, and Enid wears her honesty 
            like a badge of honor, even if it means closing the door on a social 
            life. “I think only stupid people have good relationships,” she 
            reasons in smug justification. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Ghost World </i>is the most 
            accurate account of contemporary teen life ever filmed. It joins <i>
            American Graffiti</i>, <i>Dazed and Confused</i>, <i>The Graduate</i>, 
            and <i>Diner</i> as a valentine to that time in one’s life when the 
            security net of school is pulled away, and The Great Beyond looms 
            ahead.&nbsp; But unlike such previous coming-of-age films, <i>Ghost World</i> 
            feels like something from the new millenium, a time when honesty 
            seems truly extinct, and strip malls are the defining image. In one 
            of the movie’s best scenes, Enid takes on a job at a multiplex 
            cinema concessions counter, but it’s a doomed combination.&nbsp; “After 
            about five minutes of this movie,” she tells a thirsty customer, 
            “you’re gonna wish you’d had ten beers.” Such comments raise the ire 
            of a theatre manager, who complains, “Never criticize the feature! 
            And why aren’t you pushing the larger sizes?” </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Joining Enid in her war against all 
            things conventional is Rebecca (Scarlett Johansson, the “piano girl” 
            from <i>The Man Who Wasn’t There</i>).&nbsp; Both are bored and jaded, 
            spending the summer amusing themselves by heckling Josh (Brad 
            Renfro), a boy attempting to jump-start his existence as a mini-mart 
            attendant. They analyze fellow bizarros while sipping coffee at a 
            diner (“He’s gotta be a Satanist,” insists Enid as she eyes a bald 
            man with a goatee sitting across the restaurant). They answer 
            personal ads placed by lonely men, then observe as the love-starved 
            gents come to a designated meeting place, only to wait, and wait… 
            and wait.&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon, however, Rebecca is showing signs of growing out 
            of The Cult of Enid: she takes a job at a Starbucks-style coffee 
            chain, and starts hanging out with more conventional co-workers. 
            When Rebecca complains about all the “creeps” that she brews java 
            for, Enid treats the comment like sacrilege. “But those are <i>our 
            people</i>,” she responds in disbelief.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Eventually, however, Enid’s armored 
            bubble is burst by Seymour (Steve Buscemi), a nebbish who manages 
            restaurants.&nbsp; Seymour’s true passion isn’t his job, however – it’s 
            his rare collection of 78 rpm records and a burning love of blues 
            music.&nbsp; When Enid first speaks to the geeky recluse, it’s at a 
            garage sale that he’s running to thin out the “less essential” 
            vinyl, and she’s impressed by his knowledge of such beloved discs.&nbsp; 
            Played by Steve Buscemi, the “funny looking guy” from <i>Fargo</i>, 
            Seymour comes across as a skeletal sad-sack whose dark eyes and 
            jagged teeth resemble something from <i>Night of the Living Dead</i>, 
            especially while he’s munching on a vat of gooey chicken wings.&nbsp; But 
            this visual unpretentiousness appeals to Enid. There’s a purity 
            about him – a <i>realness</i> -that she finds attractive. Could it 
            be that Seymour is Enid’s ticket back into the human race?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The two hang out together.&nbsp; At a 
            blues bar, Seymour complains when the roar of televised sports 
            coverage interrupts a guitar-strumming blues musician. “Turn off 
            their stupid sports until he’s done playing,” the purist protests.&nbsp; 
            Later, when a blaring, commercial party band called Blues Hammer 
            takes the stage, Seymour makes a hasty run for the exit.&nbsp; “I can’t 
            relate to 99.9% of humanity,” Seymour complains to Enid after their 
            escape. “Give most of these people a pair of Nikes and a Big Mac, 
            and they’re happy.”</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s here that the true heart of <i>
            Ghost World</i> is revealed.&nbsp; The film’s characters are caught in a 
            battle between honesty and survival, between holding true to their 
            beliefs and selling out, and it’s the same battle that haunted 
            Robert Crumb, the object of Zwigoff’s brilliant 1995 documentary, <i>
            Crumb</i>. Like Seymour and Enid, artist Crumb was portrayed as a 
            fringe-dweller who resented the neon artificiality of Corporate 
            America.&nbsp; The little happiness he derived from life seemed to come 
            from old blues music and his own cathartic cartoons, often 
            unflinchingly honest glimpses into the festering underbelly of 
            alienation, racism, and exploitation that thrived around him. Crumb 
            was the anti-Norman Rockwell of art. His comics would make good 
            reading fodder at a screening of David Lynch’s <i>Blue Velvet</i>, 
            another film that ripped the lid off of small-town U.S.A. and found 
            cockroaches burrowing beneath. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With <i>Ghost World</i>, Zwigoff 
            again asks the question: must people give in to the blandness of 
            commercial culture to survive in America? Or does nonconformity 
            result from an inability to change? When Seymour wears a pair of 
            stylish jeans provided by a new girlfriend, Enid criticizes him for 
            selling out.&nbsp; Later, when she attempts to expose racism with a well 
            intended, remedial art class exhibit, she’s flunked by a wimpy 
            teacher (Illeana Douglas) who gives in to public pressure and does 
            the wrong thing.&nbsp; Ultimately, it seems that the only person Enid can 
            depend on is a demented old man who sits at an out-of-service 
            transit stop waiting for a bus that never comes. “You’re the only 
            person I can count on,” she tells him. “No matter what, I know 
            you’ll be here.”&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The haunting, final scenes from <i>
            Ghost World</i> are surprisingly powerful without being 
            cut-and-dried.&nbsp; Zwigoff offers up no easy solution for his cast of 
            isolated characters -- not for the fate of Enid and Seymour, or for 
            the future of Enid’s friendship with the more adaptable Rebecca.&nbsp; 
            However, by the end of <i>Ghost World</i>, one gets the impression 
            that Enid has at least escaped the sidelines of life, and braved 
            onto the playing field.</font></td>
