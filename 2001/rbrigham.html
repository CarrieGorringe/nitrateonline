            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 18 May 2001</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Wes Clayton, the character
            played by Richard Dutcher in <i>Brigham City</i>, is the sheriff in
            the small, close-knit, tranquil Utah town of Brigham, where most of
            the residents are L.D.S., they routinely address each other as
            &quot;Brother&quot; and &quot;Sister&quot; rather than
            &quot;Mister&quot; or &quot;Missus,&quot; and there is a feeling of
            community that not only provides a sense of respite but also of
            being away from the mainstream, where the daily news carries a
            litany of crimes being perpetrated large and small. Just about the
            only dispute in town seems to be between those who want to listen to
            country music and those who don't. (Rap and rave have apparently not
            yet made an inroad, there.)<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Wes is not only the town sheriff,
            but he is also a bishop for one of the local Latter Day Saints
            wards, making it not uncommon for citizens who are also church
            members to approach him at the office regarding urgent matters which
            are, as Wes terms them, of a &quot;spiritual&quot; rather than
            &quot;temporal&quot; nature. (Wes tries to discourage this, for the
            simple reason that he does not want to use up time when he's being
            paid to act as sheriff, but he will make exceptions.) He also seems
            to have found an equilibrium for these two responsibilities, but at
            a cost. His careful, even courtly, demeanor is partly the result of
            his suffering a great tragedy, involving the loss of his wife and
            son, and he has one leg in a brace as a memento of the calamity.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When a murder victim turns up at,
            appropriately, the outskirts of Brigham, Wes wants to contain the
            situation and handle it within the town's jurisdiction, but
            circumstances dictate the involvement of F.B.I. agents from outside.
            When a second body turns up -- right after the town stages its 138th
            anniversary celebration -- news crews materialize, and the
            mediaspeak term &quot;serial killer&quot; is invoked. Asked if there
            was ever a murder in the town of Brigham before, Wes replies,
            curtly, unhesitatingly, and even resentfully, &quot;Never.&quot;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While <i>Brigham City</i> functions
            on one level as a murder mystery, it also serves as a depiction of
            what happens when a community finds itself in an inexorable
            situation of disruption and change. Fliers are issued from the
            police station to residents: Wes, in his capacity as bishop, calls
            upon the young boys who are Aaronic Priesthood holders in his ward
            to distribute them, somewhat like Brigham's own version of the Baker
            Street Irregulars. People start drawing the blinds on the windows
            facing each other's houses. Residents become openly emotional, and
            those who look like they aren't acting emotional enough over what
            has happened are looked at askance.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When a young girl disappears and it
            is feared that she may become the next murder victim, door-to-door
            searches are conducted by the men in the community, in pairs: Wes
            lays down specific instructions, ranging from being as polite as
            possible about the business at hand to making sure that they do not
            split-up from each other at any time. For those who had served on
            missions for the Church and clocked some hours knocking on doors,
            Wes reassures them that this will simply be just like &quot;in the
            old days.&quot;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The story plants its share of red
            herrings, and it has one scene with a &quot;jump&quot; in it that I
            haven't seen since whatever the last numeric installment of <i>Scream</i>
            was. (The filmmakers apparently just could not resist the urge.) One
            of the residents turns out to have a very good reason, indeed, for
            not wanting to have his residence searched: he has a secret, but it
            turns out to be a very fallible one, a frailty rather than a crime,
            but the film conveys a full sense of what the character would feel
            once other people in the community found out about him, and how they
            would never look at him in the same way again.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Dutcher, who also wrote and
            directed the film, has earlier voiced his commitment to making films
            which would involve L.D.S. aspects of life, and <i>Brigham City</i>
            includes one scene where, as one of the late-night sessions at the
            police station finally winds down and the fate of the missing girl
            is still up in the air, last-minute checks are made and someone
            suggests that, before they leave, a moment of prayer might not be
            entirely out of order. Lead by Peg (Carrie Morgan), the engagingly
            spunky woman who works as secretary at the station, we steady
            ourselves for a moment of respectful piety and instead see how this
            provides a way where the people involved, taxed to their endurance,
            are able to draw together, re-forge their commitment and unity to
            the task at hand, and express some deep emotion and concern that
            they might have otherwise kept locked-up inside.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Morgan's performance (she
            introduces the debate over the pros and cons of country music in the
            film) is one of several fine ones in the picture, which has been
            splendidly photographed, against backgrounds of greens, oranges, and
            golds, by cinematographer Ken Glassing. Matthew A. Brown, the
            untried missionary who was the central character in Dutcher's last
            film, <i>God's Army</i>, shows considerable range here as Wes'
            deputy Terry, who lives in town with a wife and child (and another
            on the way), but nonetheless has moments where he chomps at the bit
            to find out what's going on out there in the teeming world beyond.
            Wilford Brimley plays Stu, the town's former sheriff who still stops
            in to help out at the station every day, and he turns out to be
            wonderful, providing the film with some, if not exactly blasts, than
            good gusty expulsions of irascible air. (One surprising aspect about
            the film: the moments of humor that occur without throwing the film
            as a whole off-kilter.) And Tayva Patch plays the F.B.I. agent,
            Meredith, who stays in Brigham until the investigation is concluded.
            She and Wes could very easily have been thrown together during the
            course of events to become a romantic duo. Instead, there is an
            unspoken acknowledgment between the two that they could take the
            first tentative steps towards having a relationship if they wanted
            to, but it is never forced, and it is never agonized over. It lends
            the film a very welcome air of subtlety.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As a performer, Dutcher has become
            an actor who can communicate a great deal while doing very little.
            Wes emerges as a man who does not go in for expressions of high
            emotion: he only raises his voice a couple of times during the
            story, even with the specter of the town that has come to form the
            fulcrum of his life unraveling around him, and even then it is only
            briefly. When Wes says that a murder has &quot;never&quot; occurred
            in Brigham, it is because that is how he wants to see the town: as
            has been shown over the last century alone, horrors can occur just
            about anywhere, under any circumstances. What's remarkable about Wes
            is how he never loses his capacity to feel, especially towards
            others -- his character could have easily become embittered or
            closed-off. Wes does not seem to want to become like that because it
            would be a way for the brutality that he so disdains in the
            &quot;outside&quot; world to gain a foothold within himself and
            claim a victory. The weariness and sorrow that seem to limb his eyes
            and features betray what must be an ongoing internal struggle, day
            by day. One of the most affecting moments I've seen in any film this
            year has to do with when Wes is shown going through his daily
            routine of placing one fresh-picked flower at the site where his
            wife and son are buried. It's not just the visit or gesture that
            makes the scene, but the moment when Wes, off-handedly, sweeps clear
            with one hand any dirt or debris that has collected at the base of
            the markers.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The killer is, indeed, apprehended
            by the end of <i>Brigham City</i> (and, not to fear, I would be
            loathe to reveal who it is, here, but I would have liked to have
            been in the audience during the film's premiere showing: they must
            have let out quite a yelp). But at the same time a considerable
            dilemma is created. Wes has carried out his duty as a law enforcer,
            but can he continue to function as a spiritual leader? The question
            is answered in a closing sequence which is, in a word or two,
            absolutely extraordinary, and played out with almost no spoken
            dialogue, showing how Wes acknowledges his regret, and how the
            community, which is composed of both his friends and the people to
            whom he is supposed to be serving as bishop, reforms and regroups
            once more. It is the kind of scene which could hold its own against
            two others, Bibi Andersson's monologue in Ingmar Bergman's <i>Persona</i>,
            and the breathtaking closing scene in Terence Davies' <i>The Long
            Day Closes</i>: scenes in which, once you start watching them, you
            get an idea of what it is that they are trying to accomplish, and
            while you're watching to see if the scenes can possibly sustain
            themselves well enough accomplish what they have set out to do, the
            anticipation heightens the dramatic and emotional effect. (And,
            believe me, this is a comparison that I do not make lightly.)<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Brigham City</i> is a picture
            that is set within an L.D.S. community and whose ideas are
            essentially universal, so it has the advantage of being a film that
            is both dramatically engaging and has something on its mind. Just
            this past week, at the annual Cannes festival, Jean-Luc Godard, in
            person and in his new film, announced his disgust with the lack of
            current films that traffic in any genuine ideas of their own.
            (&quot;No wonder you need other people's stories,&quot; two

            own.&quot;) Dutcher being mentioned in the same breath as Bergman,
            Terence Davies, and Godard? He may very well come over and whack me
            on the back of the head for that, but I don't care. Just as long as
