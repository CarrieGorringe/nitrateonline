            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Elvis is dead, and it would be
            damned kind of us to leave him that way -- especially when the
            vehicle for his return to the public eye is an uninspired façade of
            a narrative like this.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Demian
            Lichtenstein’s <i>3000 Miles to Graceland</i> is the latest
            cinematic offering to rape our collective past, cheerfully
            exploiting American nostalgia and pillaging the icons of an earlier,
            less jaded generation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>There’s
            nothing wrong with satirizing our heritage when it’s done well --
            just take a look at the brilliant <i>Pleasantville</i>, for instance
            -- but this film feels less like homage than a cheap attempt to make
            whores from our cultural icons for a quick buck.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>May that be all this film earns at the box office.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The story centers around a group of
            hard-nosed thieves who rob a casino while dressed as a gaggle of
            Elvis impersonators.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>All
            the film’s main characters are lifted wholesale from the Hollywood
            Book of Requisite Action-Movie Stereotypes, including the gang’s
            two ringleaders (Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner), whose inability to
            agree on the best way to divvy up the loot results in one stale
            argument scene after another; a shallow single mother (played with
            no stretch whatsoever by Courtney Cox, whose performance here equals
            the dramatic range she displayed in Bruce Springsteen’s “Dancing
            in the Dark” music video); and an army of ever-expendable
            secondary characters, who exist here only to bring some name
            recognition to the project<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>(Ice
            T?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In an Elvis movie?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Well, thank yuh.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Thank yuh very much.).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film’s trailer would have you
            believe that the majority of the tale revolves around the planning
            and execution of the robbery, but don’t be fooled -- the meat of
            the story centers more on the aftermath of the heist than the crime
            itself, which is over and done with in the opening five minutes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Unfortunately, the first warning signs of the movie’s
            dearth of quality are apparent before this bullet ballet is over.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Lichtenstein, attempting to disguise the film’s
            disastrously uneven editing, takes every opportunity to flaunt his
            music video roots at us -- the two gunfights which bookend the movie
            are constructed with quick jump cuts and needlessly “flashy”
            camera shots that would be far more at home on MTV than in a film
            aspiring to tell a coherent story.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The poor filmmaker, helming his second feature film with <i>3000
            Miles</i>, doesn’t yet seem to have a grasp on good narrative
            storytelling technique, choosing instead to obfuscate the plot
            behind stylistic editing and underwhelming camera moves that add
            nothing but length to the final film.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But as tedious as the opening
            bloodbath is, things only get worse after our merry band of nitwits
            hits the highway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As
            you might expect, <i>3000 Miles to Graceland</i> is, in fact, a road
            movie about a trip to… Canada?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Yes, you read that correctly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Canada.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
            despite the fact that Graceland plays no part in the film itself,
            its spirit does sort of hover over the movie -- a sad, disheveled
            icon that once had meaning, but now rots away like so many peanut
            butter and ‘nana sandwiches left out in the rain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>(Rather like Presley himself, in the hands of this movie.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>It’s sad that Elvis, arguably the first true Sugar Daddy of
            rock and roll -- and I’m talking <i>lots</i> of sugar, swee’pea
            -- has been forced to “pseudo-star” posthumously in this banal
            tale of crime, guns, and Elvis impersonators, which serves less as a
            cohesive narrative than a barometer of pain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>This is not the first film to ever feature Elvis
            impersonators as an integral part of the plot, but it’s
            unquestionably the worst).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The cast is populated by a group of
            Hollywood A-list actors, all of whom should have known better.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Kurt Russell and Kevin Costner get the king’s share (no pun
            intended) of screen time, and therefore deserve the complete career
            derailments that are likely to occur after John P. Consumer gets an
            eyeful of this garbage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
            is particularly disappointing -- and surprising -- since Russell
            drew critical accolades for his performance of Elvis in John
            Carpenter’s 1979 TV miniseries; as such, it’s lamentable that he
            comes across so ham-fisted this time around -- not so much
            incompetent as begging for attention.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And sadly, Kevin Costner proves
            that the dramatic rebound I thought I’d glimpsed in the recent <i>Thirteen
            Days</i> is nothing more than a passing fluke.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>In <i>3000 Miles</i>, Costner’s performance as Dances with
            Whoppers (his character is actually named Murphy, but admit it, you
            like my idea better) comes across not so much as an effective
            villain but a reluctant actor; I’ve heard of phoning in a role
            before, but Costner here doesn’t even seem to have the coins
            needed to place the call.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>With
            starring roles in such recent cinematic disasters as <i>Waterworld</i>
            and <i>The Postman</i> under his belt, Kevin Costner proves one
            thing in <i>3000 Miles From Graceland</i>: he has the worst agent in
            the known universe.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">So, is there <i>anything</i>
            positive I can say about this film?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>(Joe thinks very, very hard.)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Well, I guess the cars were kinda cool.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>And I suppose that there are moments in <i>3000 Miles From
            Graceland</i> that manage to capture the gritty excitement of being
            out on the road, with the dust flying up around your car while the
            approved soundtrack of rebellion -- rock and roll -- explodes from
            your speakers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But with
            this material’s painfully inept handling, it might have been
            better if the film had choked on that dust instead of cruising into
            theaters.<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"></o:p>
