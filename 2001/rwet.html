            daughter, now a freshman at Syracuse University, wanted so much for
            me to write a good review of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Wet
            Hot American Summer</i>, which she saw back in the dry, cold
            American winter of Sundance. But this dreadful excuse of a comedy
            makes real-life bug juice and mystery meat look a whole lot more
            appetizing than sitting through this silly excursion to Gilligan's
            Summer Camp. So, daughter dearest, I'll let my readers judge whether
            the review is good. The film? Well, I think you've already got a
            tinkering for how I feel about that.</b><o:p>

            of Gotham City have suffered through <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Summer</i>
            for over a month (where it opened on parents' weekend); now
            distributor USA Films flushes out the rest of the country with this
            lame elegy to the sexual frustrations and over-indulgences of hippie
            camp counselors of the early 1980s. Set twenty years ago, give or
            take a week or two, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Summer</i>
            captures the wild and wacky atmosphere of the final (full) day at
            Camp Firewood, in Maine [actually Camp Towanda in Pennsylvania], a
            non-religious but generally Jewish (yes, there's a big nose
            reference) gathering of spoiled and heart-broken children and their
            &quot;adult&quot; supervisors, and suggests that this is the norm
            for summer-camp experiences. Now, I was five years old when I first
            hit the sleep-away camp circuit, first in upstate New York, then
            three years in South Bend, Indiana (Culver Military Academy, with
            not-very-fond memories of formation marching, in light blue
            uniforms, to watch John Wayne movies every Tuesday night), before
            settling in at a series of locations run by Camp Ramah. One of their
            campsites, condemned some thirty-plus years ago, was in Moodus,
            Connecticut, where we often dined on green eggs and suffered the
            consequences…at least until visiting day. Daily stopovers at the
            infirmary were <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">de rigueur</i>,
            where patients occasionally arrived with upset stomachs and left
            with bee stings. Sure we (the campers) had our share of sexual
            awakenings, but <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Wet Hot American Summer</i> purports that nearly every non-camper and
            some of their young subjects are scheduled to die of sexual
            starvation within twenty-four hours unless so satisfied. And there's
            a couple of compulsory yet lifeless food jokes in this corpse of a
            movie, mostly at the expense of Christopher Meloni (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Law
            &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Oz</i>),
            as a battle-scarred Vietnam veteran who talks with cans of
            Pozinsky's Mixed &quot;Quality&quot; Vegetables and cooks up coital
            relief with the local refrigerator.<o:p>

            <p><span style="color:black"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The cast,
            featuring <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">SNL</i> alumni
            Janeanne Garofolo and Molly Shannon and fellow NBC veteran David
            Hyde Pierce (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Frasier</i>), are all an accomplished bunch. All have made better films;
            they probably haven't suffered in worse. Garofolo, a darkly comic
            sparkplug, reigns over the craw as Beth, the carefree camp director.
            Her role here is best defined as thin. In fact, every character is a
            thespian toothpick, the actors embodying them all searching for
            morsels of inspiration, sadly lacking in the script by MTV and VH1
            veterans Michael Showalter and David Wain, longtime members of the
            MTV sketch-comedy troupe The State. Wain, directing his first
            feature, lacks the visual discipline and control to make this film
            register more than a Labor Day blimp on the cinematic scoreboard.
            The film's title contrasts sharply with its damp, muddy look, and
            its inadvertently switching afternoon- and evening-lit scenes as if
            continuity didn't matter. All the actors meander about
            direction-less, much as the dorky campers and spaced-out counselors
            all search for organized activities. Someone must have stuffed
            Wain's megaphone with wet toilet paper as everyone suffers in this
            tiring day-in-the-life-of story.<o:p>

            <p><span style="color:black"><font face="Verdana" size="2">One of
            the most annoying aspects of the screenplay is that the writers have
            dumped an entire summer's worth of &quot;educational&quot; exercises
            into one final day. What the heck has the staff been doing for eight
            weeks (hibernating?) that it jumbles together capture-the-flag, the
            talent show, a two-hour ride for an all-day, all night rafting trip,
            and the desperate &quot;I've got to have sex before camp ends&quot;
            relationships into the final hours of the summer experience?<o:p>

            <p><span style="color:black"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Then
            there's the careless attitude surrounding most of the employees, who
            favor French kissing at the expense of a drowning child, or tossing
            campers out on the roadside from a moving van. One agonizing,
            laughless segment has a good many counselors and the camp director
            taking an early morning hour off to head into town, where they smoke
            dope, buy cocaine, drink beer, and snatch purses, only to return to
            camp &quot;refreshed&quot; and none the worse for their actions.<o:p>
