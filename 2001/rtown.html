            wasted acting talent in a leaden script that could sink the Titanic.
            It's a sad case of querulous halitosis, talky takes, atrociously
            unfulfilled jokes, and a tankful of overpriced (an $85+ million
            budget…why??) disjointed incidents of adulterated comedy from the
            mixed-up mind of Michael Laughlin, an occasional
            producer-writer-director more known for his only other directorial
            output back in the 1980s (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Strange
            Behavior/Dead Kid</i>, a cult horror film; <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Strange
            Invaders</i>, a 1950s sci-fi spoof, and the oddball drama <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Mesmerized/Shocked</i>). Buck Henry, who makes scattered appearances in
            the film as a divorce attorney, &quot;polished&quot; the script to a
            dull finish.</b><o:p>

            the footage spliced together for the trailer makes you want to whine
            and wonder. For sure New Line ultimately decided to write this
            clunker off. They have a website up, but the trailer attached still
            proudly ends with &quot;March 16th&quot; as the impending opening
            date. It opened April 27<sup>th</sup>, if you care. I assume someone
            in the NL marketing department misremembered that date as the Ides
            of March and decided to tinker with the film for another six weeks
            instead of incur the wrath of cinema-going Caesars. Unfortunately
            any strategy in trying to glue back the broken pieces of this
            cracked egg was bound to go aground. As a spokesman for my fellow
            Romans: Two Thumbs Down.<o:p>

            is definitely the kind of movie that will tarnish more than a few
            careers. Including that of director Peter Chelsom, who appears to
            have grown too fast after a charming 1991 debut with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Hear
            My Song</i> and the startlingly offbeat comedy <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Funny
            Bones</i>, a truly endearing piece of slapstick worth repeated
            viewers. But <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">T&amp;C</i> is a tired mess, with drowsy pacing and a nearly threadbare
            &quot;story about men who do stupid things&quot; as the preview
            heralds. Wait, perhaps they are talking about the producers who made
            the movie?<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Basically
            the story of two jet-setting, upper crust, happily-never-after
            couples, Porter and Ellie Stoddard (Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton),
            hitched and bickering some 25 years, with children, a posh Fifth
            Avenue apartment to die for and great beachfront property out in the
            Hamptons; their friends in infidelity are Griffin (Garry Shandling),
            an antiques dealer with his own repressed secret that will leave his
            hissy-fitful wife Mona (Goldie Hawn) adrift in a crying game. The
            foursome do everything together, or attempt to, but deceit, lies,
            and a few bodies wander into the mix. The libidinous temptations run
            excessively high for Porter, a morally reprehensible, but wildly
            successful, architect. He plucks a naked cellist (<span style="color:black">Nastassja
            Kinski) with a &quot;resonating box between her legs,&quot; mauls a
            Sun Valley drugstore cowgirl (Jenna Elfman) on Halloween in a bear
            suit, and falls prey to a rich child-bitch-in-heat (Andie MacDowell)
            and her family from Hell (Charlton Heston showing his true colors as
            spokesman for the N.R.A., although he could easily handle similar
            chores for Arsonists Anonymous).<o:p>
            </o:p>

            </span></font></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            a comedy of sexual mores, the movie is paced like a geriatric
            lightweight. Each scene is set up the same annoyingly episodic way.
            Comedy lurks in the background, ready for a counter-reaction shot or
            double-take expectations, but the pay-off is less than inspired and
            generally groan-worthy. One such irritating sequence has Ellie
            nonchalantly handling a large carving knife, making off-hand
            comments to Porter about murder and extramarital activities
            (relating to a movie she caught earlier that day), as Porter sits
            there sweating bullets. Or as Porter and Mona, fresh from a casual
            romp at her broken down family mansion down in Mississippi,
            emphatically confess to each other that their Southern rendezvous
            was a mistake. Ba-da-bom: next shot has them sexually entangled for
            another quickie. For all the high-priced thespian gas pumped into
            this oversized balloon, you would hope for an explosion of laughs.
            Instead, the script and direction pinch the end of the inflated,
            oversexed film and you end up with that annoying, high-pierced whine
            of air (and the audience) escaping. The end result is the same: a
            limp, over-extended bore.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Overstuffed
            and bloated, this romantic dud is the kind of fowl weather friend
            everyone will want to pluck. As an affair or two or more to
            remember, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
