He smokes cigarettes he rolls himself. He's sort of hipster-punk, exponentially cool and more than a little wary of the business he's in. All this makes sense, if you know that he came up in and around Washington DC's punk scene, listening to Black Flag, Minor Threat, and Fugazi. Nowadays, the Bennington College graduate is a New York-based actor, probably best known for his work on CBS's The District, but more inclined to talk about his other work, on stage in NYC and in films, for example, Mary Harron's I Shot Andy Warhol and American Psycho.

<p><font face="Verdana" size="6">Aardman Vs. Bolex: Not Bloody Likely<br>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="4">A Conversation with Dave Borthwick and Alex 
Riddett</font><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="4"><br>
</font></span><i><font size="1" face="Verdana">interview by
<a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 26 October 2001</font></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Bristol, England is 
blessed with two of the finest animation studios in the world: Bolex Brothers 
and Aardman. The two have created 3-D stop-motion cartoons that push the media 
into new and fascinating directions, even if the products from the two shops 
could not be more diverse. One associates the small Bolex team, who were 
officially created in 1991, with quirky, dark films like <i>
<span style="font-style:italic">The Secret Adventures of Tom Thumb</span></i>, 
in which live actors were filmed at the same time as the puppets. This process 
made the humans seem even more alien and creepy than any of the animated 
creatures on the screen. With some charming commercials for bagels, beer and 
tea, the crew at Bolex Brothers can then go and make fascinatingly quirky shorts 
like <i><span style="font-style:italic">The Saint Inspector</span></i> and <i>
<span style="font-style:italic">Keep in a Dry Place and away from Children</span></i>. 
Their films have been popular on the festival circuit and taken home awards from 
The British Film Awards and from the San Francisco International Film Festival.</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The larger Aardman has also 
had its share of acclaim and is certainly the better known of the two animation 
houses. Founded by Peter Lord and David Sproxton in 1972, they've created 
memorable characters like <i><span style="font-style:italic">Morph</span></i>,
<i><span style="font-style:italic">Rex the Runt</span></i> and the Oscar-winning 
duo Wallace and Gromit. Most of the Nick Park directed series involving the 
famous inventor and his smarter dog were shot by cinematographer Dave Alex 
Riddett. Riddett also shot Park's other Oscar-winner <i>
<span style="font-style:italic">Creature Comforts</span></i>, in which human 
London residents' voices come out of the mouths of animated zoo animals. He also 
supervised the photography on the studio's first feature, <i>
<span style="font-style:italic">Chicken Run</span></i>, a critical and popular 
favorite. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">One might imagine the two 
studios attacking each other's work or belittling it. After meeting two 
representatives from them, it is quickly obviously that any rivalry is friendly 
and even supportive. Bolex mastermind Dave Borthwick, who wrote and directed <i>
<span style="font-style:italic">Tom Thumb</span></i> and edited the 
aforementioned shorts has long been a close friend and frequent collaborator 
with Riddett, Riddett worked with Bolex and even appears in <i>
<span style="font-style:italic">Tom Thumb</span></i>. The two were in Kansas 
City last April discussing their friendship and the art of making animation that 
actually does please both children and adults. As guests of the Kansas City 
Filmmakers Jubilee, the agreed to meet with me at a restaurant that was only a 
mile or two from where Walt Disney had his first studio. Thankfully, that 
prospect didn't seem to intimidate them.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">Dan Lybarger</font></i></b><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>:
</b></i>(to Riddett) Working with Bolex Brothers probably helped you with 
Aardman.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>Alex Riddett: </b></i>
Of course, it was more like tricks with storytelling, from a photographic 
viewpoint. [At Bolex Brothers] we were playing with a lot of visual ideas, 
actually creating stuff you haven’t seen before. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>Dave Borthwick: </b>
</i>It’s a little bit more organic way of working. It could be anything. There’s 
a beast in there. There’s a film in there, and it’s dying to get out. I feel 
very much the same way with the way stories and scripts develop. I’ve written 
scripts, but the way we put that into the film, it’s made up to camera. I like 
something that’s more than the sum of its parts. Basically, you come up with 
something different than the script. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I love things that are just 
visual poetry, without rationalization. You can’t explain them; they just feel 
right. That’s the sort of element I like to keep in the films I work in. They’re 
the sort of thing that keeps an audience engaged in the film. The imagination is 
engaged. There’s a big risk when you’ve got a film that lays it all on the line. 
Everything’s out there. You’ve got the action happening. You’ve got the verbals 
giving what the action said. It doesn’t leave an awful lot to the imagination.
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>AR: </b></i>It’s like 
the early “Aard” stuff. It’s not dissimilar. It wasn’t an attempt to make 
feature films or just tell stories. It was finding a new way to do something. 
It’s like taking real voices (as in the Oscar-winning Aardman short <i>
<span style="font-style:italic">Creature Comforts</span></i>, on which Riddett 
worked as cinematographer) and adding visuals to it. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">It’s kind of what happened in 
Bristol. The industry kind of grew around us. The Aardman style was invented and 
gradually built for a series of projects. It was a formula that was written in 
Bristol because there wasn’t a way of making animation slightly adult oriented 
and for kids as well at the time. That’s fairly commonplace now. A lot of the 
early “Aard” films which were just a big gag. Sometimes, it was just trying to 
do a very serious piece.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DL: </b></i>Yes, 
because Peter Lord’s <i><span style="font-style:italic">Adam</span></i> is 
clearly not for children. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DB: </b></i>I think it 
really happened for us when this category “adult animation” suddenly got 
invented. I don’t know where it’s come from. Our stuff suddenly fit in. </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>AR: </b></i>I’ll tell 
you one of the reasons, actually. At (Britain’s) Channel Four, there was a 
TV-station started up, kind of an independent television thing. They did 
alternative stuff, not just popular stuff. They had a reasonable budget to put 
stuff out. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DL: </b></i>Is there a 
better market for “adult animation” in the U.K. than in the U.S.?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>AR: </b></i>There’s a 
lot of good underground stuff here, but I don’t know.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DL: </b></i>I just 
mention that because I don’t know if the U.S. has any animation filmmakers like 
Japan’s Hayao Miyazaki. When his adult oriented <i>
<span style="font-style:italic">Princess Mononoke</span></i> made it here, no 
one knew what to make of it, and it was a hit in the rest of the world. A lot 
people failed to understand that it was not for kids.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DB: </b></i>The amazing 
thing is unless you’re getting into porn with any adult animation, kids love it 
as well. My kid’s eight years old and he watches all the really edgy stuff. He 
also loves <i><span style="font-style:
italic">Thomas the Tank Engine</span></i> as well. He loves the really naughty 
stuff as well; he finds it really funny. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>AR: </b></i>The only 
real outlet (for animation) other than television was the festivals. The 
festival scene in the early 80’s was great. (In the U.S.), we had Spike and Mike 
pick up on Aard stuff, and in there you had a good mixture of stuff. You had 
some twisted stuff and some gag films. There’s a good following coming up with (Aaardman’s 
video for Peter Gabriel’s) <i><span style="font-style:italic">Sledgehammer</span></i> 
and MTV.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DL: </b></i>I had some 
friends in L.A. who instantly knew who you guys were and had seen <i>
<span style="font-style:
italic">Creature Comforts</span></i>.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>AR: </b></i>What helped 
on that was the Oscar stuff as well. That year Nick (Park) was nominated for two 
categories (for directing <i><span style="font-style:italic">Creature Comforts</span></i> 
and the Wallace and Gromit debut <i><span style="font-style:italic">A Grand Day 
Out</span></i>). He’d just finished <i><span style="font-style:italic">Creature 
Comforts</span></i>, which he was doing as part of a series we were doing for 
Channel Four. He thought we got a nomination; I’m on the map now. He went to 
Hollywood never thinking he might actually win it. He had a good chance he had 
two out three (possible nominations). It was like “Wow! It’s for Bristol!”
</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DL: </b></i>One of the 
things I loved about watching the <i><span style="font-style:italic">Wallace and 
Gromit</span></i> DVD recently is getting to see the evolution of Nick Park’s 
work. When you see these two really early things he did: <i>
<span style="font-style:italic">Rat and the Beanstalk</span></i> and <i>
<span style="font-style:italic">Walter Goes Fishing</span></i>. They’re light 
years away from the quality he eventually mastered, but yet in the early stop 
motion stuff you can see he has an awareness of all the real time stuff that has 
to happen like waves and candle light. It’s fascinating that even at this early 
point he understands these things that will show up later in <i>
<span style="font-style:italic">Chicken Run</span></i>.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DB: </b></i>A lot of 
that is coming at it from a filmmaker’s point of view, how you represent things 
on film like time passing. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>AR: </b></i>It’s 
cinematic technique. (Animation) has all of the elements you’d expect in a 
live-action film. We’ve never thought of it as anything other than a proper 
film. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DB: </b></i>I think the 
other side to that is that their shooting animation the way they would shoot 
live action. It’s a proscenium arch, locked up camera.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>AR: </b></i>Simple 
lighting, so you don’t have to change it. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DL: </b></i>That’s 
interesting that you mentioned the lighting because one of the things that makes
<i><span style="font-style:italic">Chicken Run</span></i> so effective is the <i>
<span style="font-style:italic">noir</span></i>-ish lighting and how you 
captured the look of movies like <i><span style="font-style:italic">Stalag 17</span></i> 
and <i><span style="font-style:
italic">The Great Escape</span></i>. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>AR: </b></i>We looked 
at those films. There’s a joke in there. As it starts, we got a thing like 
prison camp with real people so we try to delay the point that it’s about 
chickens by using shadows running behind sheds. You say <i>
<span style="font-style:italic">film noir</span></i>, but it’s actually pretty 
easy. It’s a lot easier than trying to light a normal scene and make it 
interesting or stylized. It’s always good to have a reason for it. You never do 
it just for the sake of it. It’s what you wanted, a sense of mystery. As soon as 
the characters get in, you have to play it a little bit careful because they’re 
not people in rubber chicken suits. They have to be real people, real 
characters. The lighting, the camera angles, and the composition get so 
important. You probably have to think about it more than you do in live action.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DL: </b></i>Because you 
guys work with clay, doesn’t all of the heat from the lights hurt the models?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>AR: </b></i>Not much. 
It does get hot in there, but unlike live action, you don’t need a massive 
amount of light. We get away with two-second exposures. So there’s an advantage 
in that respect. You know where the characters are and where they’re going to 
be. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DL: </b></i>You have a 
movie like <i><span style="font-style:italic">Chicken Run</span></i>, which is 
co-financed by big companies like Pathé and Dreamworks, which was still an 
incredible film despite these outside influences. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>AR: </b></i>You work 
with very little money, where they’re not going to hound you, or in our case we 
ended up in a situation where there was a lot of money about and there was a lot 
of influence. What DreamWorks wanted was something quite unique. What we 
produced wasn’t Wallace and Gromit, but something they produced themselves. They 
had very careful that they weren’t getting killed. There was some resistance 
with the British way of working. They’d have some specific ideas or they’d be 
very vague about something. I think we were quite lucky in that respect. They 
treated us quite kindly. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DL: </b></i>Didn’t they 
also give you more production assistance, like more storyboard artists, etc.?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>AR: </b></i>Their 
storyboard artists are brilliant. They have a very good way of working and they 
work very tightly with the storyboards. Their storyboards don’t change much from 
the finished thing. Whereas with us storyboarding is an indication of what you 
might do. You can always get more ideas later. We like to have that freedom to 
where you’re just going to make it turn out better. The only time that isn’t 
allowed [with Aardman] is probably on some of their features and in commercials.
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">[In commercials], you’ve made 
agreements, and you’re suddenly arguing about the seventeen shots that make up a 
commercial. There’s too many people in the decision chain, and they’re all 
worried about their back. “We don’t want any surprises. We don’t even want nice 
surprises!”</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DB: </b></i>“We haven’t 
researched that! That’s a great idea, but it might upset our target audience!”
</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DL: </b></i>[To Dave 
Borthwick] That reminds me of <i><span style="font-style:italic">The Saint 
Inspector</span></i>. This thing is so delightfully weird, that one wonders what 
sort of target market was intended for that film.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DB: </b></i>It’s the 
same thing when we were making <i><span style="font-style:italic">Tom Thumb</span></i>. 
We dare not think what sort of audience is watching because if we did we’d be 
making decisions on it that weren’t appropriate. What we wanted was to make our 
film the way we wanted to make it. We enjoyed the process of making it. We liked 
it, and if anyone else liked it, it was a bonus. I think it went so well because 
was because we were trusted with it and did things that we normally wouldn’t 
have done. As it turned out, kids liked it. It was never intended as a kids 
film. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>AR: </b></i>It was the 
parents who were the objectors. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DB: </b></i>It was the 
parents who were disturbed, not the kids.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DL: </b></i>When you’re 
looking at Tom, he’s such a grotesque character, but yet you grow to love him.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DB: </b></i>We tried to 
make [the characters] not just dumb and hairy. We tried to give them redeeming 
qualities. Suddenly, you're able to twist people’s emotions around. The 
characters will redeem themselves in an unexpected way. You become emotionally 
engaged in the film.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DL: </b></i>When I look 
at the stuff you folks have done where you incorporate living actors with the 
animation, it must be a nightmare for the performer. With the commercials you’ve 
done, you’re moving away from that.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DB: </b></i>A lot of 
that is that you take pixelation so far, and then there’s not much further you 
can go with it. I think in a way, we’ve sort of reached that. The thing we’re 
still playing around with is still working with actors and working with an 
actor’s performance in anything other than a live action. Using film like that 
is like using videotape. I want to increase the range of an actor by varying the 
speed so they can form expressions and movements that they couldn’t possibly do 
in live action. I think a lot of actors like to have the chance to perform 
that’s getting the chance to allow them to expand their possible ways of 
performance. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DL: </b></i>Tim Burton 
insisted on using puppets over other types of special effects in <i>
<span style="font-style:italic">Beetlejuice</span></i> because he felt the 
actors would give better performances if they could actually see the creatures.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DB: </b></i>They 
audience may doesn't understand the details or the intellect how a thing is 
technically achieved, but they can feel it. It's magic. It's not some technical 
mysterious process it's gone through in post-production, where two separate 
elements have been married together. Technically, [my work] may have been very 
rough around the edges, but you had a sense of seeing that happening right in 
front of the camera. There's a real relationship there. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>AR: </b></i>There's the 
big difference with 2D animation. In 2D there has to be a lot of layers, and the 
actual filming of it is like a post event. No matter how much preparation you 
did on the set, it's a live performance stretched over a long period of time. 
Good animators have a sense of this timing. They know their character's 
performance. Their character can manages to do something quite different. </font>
</p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DL: </b></i>[to Riddett]: 
When did you hook up with Aardman?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>AR: </b></i>I knew Pete 
[Lord] and Dave [<font color="black"><span style="color:black">Sproxton</span></font>] 
when I first came to Bristol during the Morph series. I went to go visit to see 
what they were up to. It was around the point when they started to get 
commercial work. Otherwise, I was just going there to see what they were doing. 
They had been interested in what we were up to. It wasn't a career thing. You 
couldn't get a job there. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DB: </b></i>You start 
thinking about doing it for a career, and you're not going to get anywhere near 
it. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>AR: </b></i>It must be 
quite difficult these days for people entering into it because at Aard there is 
a system set up. They do try to encourage everybody there to feel like they are 
part of the process rather than just you're coming in there as a model maker, 
and that's what you do.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DL: </b></i>One of the 
reason Japanese animation is sometimes a tricky sell in the U.S. market is that 
many of the cultural idioms in the dialog don't translate easily.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DB: </b></i>One thing 
I'm really interested in is how much information you can get over without 
dialog. Film is a visual medium. It's about body language. It's about action. 
It's about movement. There so many other means by which you can get that 
information across. You can get quite a complex story over without dialog.
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>AR: </b></i>That's what 
you've developed very well. The Aardman's thin is taking real words and getting 
a plasticine character to say them. In the early stages of <i>
<span style="font-style:italic">Chicken Run</span></i>, it was so bloody wordy. 
It was worked and reworked. There was too much dialog for my liking. My favorite 
scenes are the action scenes, the stuff where I get more involved in. The dialog 
is very much an animator's thing, and they've got to make it work. The Aard 
thing is about character animation, which is about people talking, eye movement. 
That is something that Aard's developed incredibly. Probably too much emphasis 
has been put on it. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DB: </b></i>Our 
principle is basically if you can do it without words, do it without words. 
Words are the absolute last resort. If you convey the same information without 
words, first you've got something that's immediately internationally understood. 
You don't get into problems translating that into another language to get the 
same meaning. Body language is the same anywhere in the world. To me, that comes 
across more successfully and with much more impact. As long as you've got dialog 
to use as a crutch, you're going to go less effectively with the visuals. </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>AR: </b></i>That stuck 
a nerve because that's the bit I least enjoy. That's the stuff at the start of 
the shot, and you have to keep it right in its place. You don't want any flashy 
photography. You have to keep to whatever is appropriate for the scene. It's the 
animators' little area to move around it. A lot of Aardman's character 
animation, the facial stuff, it's all centered around that. What I really love 
on the Wallace and Gromits is the chase stuff. That's where I come to the fore, 
with all the stuff whizzing by. Did the shot vibrate? Is it a quick cut? That's 
all about action stuff. It's more visual.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DB: </b></i>The 
dialogue seems to me the weakest element. It's a stupid generalization, I know.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DL: </b></i>Yes, when I 
saw the Bolex Brothers commercial for Lenders Bagels, I ignored the voiceover, 
and all I could think about was the bagels.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DB: </b></i>My 
favorites (commercials) are the Nestea ones and the Carlsberg Beer one with the 
little (snowman) who's really frustrated, and the look his wife gives him is, 
&quot;Please don't go. You're going to die!&quot; He says, &quot;Sorry, honey, a man's gotta do 
what a man's gotta do. You can say that in tiny expressions, and that's going to 
communicate to everybody.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DL: </b></i>[to Alex 
Riddett] One of the most effective moments in <i>
<span style="font-style:italic">Chicken Run</span></i> is when we find out 
Rocky, the Rhode Island Red can't really fly by using the poster instead of 
dialog.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>AR: </b></i>You should 
let the audience think they've discovered it.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DL: </b></i>In <i>
<span style="font-style:italic">Chicken Run</span></i>, how did the use of 
computer-generated images (CGI) affect the film?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>AR: </b></i>A lot of 
that was done outside, but not completely. We spent a lot of time with CFC [The 
Computer Film Company, the UK-based house that created effects for <i>
<span style="font-style:italic">Cast Away</span></i>, <i>
<span style="font-style:italic">The Truman Show</span></i>, and other films] 
because they used to do a lot of visual effects for live action films. We 
rejected so much stuff to star with because it was too real. We had to find 
something that was realistic in the context of the rest of the film. The gravy 
had to look like it was made of plasticine. The plane had to have a certain 
quality. If you stuck reality into our films, no matter how polished they are, 
it would stick out.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DB: </b></i>It would be 
like if we'd stuck live action shots into Tom Thumb. It would have made the 
pixelation stuff look really bizarre. You have to be consistent with what you 
set to do. If you have something like water or flame, you choose something 
that's appropriate with the solutions you've already chosen.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>AR: </b></i>I'll give 
you several examples. In the Wallace and Gromits, when we did the rain effects, 
most of that was done in camera, like when Gromit is chunked out. Most of that 
is done in camera. All of the splashes are actually animated. The stuff that 
runs down his face is like glycerin. Then we did a superimposition of a shower 
against a black velvet background. It was very simple. When we did it more 
sophisticated in <i><span style="font-style:
italic">Chicken Run</span></i>, we developed a lot of the stuff we do a lot 
more, and we worked very closely with the CGI guys. In the next one (<i><span style="font-style:italic">The 
Tortoise and the Hare</span></i>), we're going to involve them right from the 
start. There's not going to be a post-production facility where the just drop 
the thing. They should be part of the process.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DB: </b></i>There's 
always that problem you run into when you start working with CGI. You have to 
keep your world consistent. A lot of our stuff was about doing it in camera 
because we couldn't afford it. We started resorting using postproduction in the 
commercials because the ad agency didn't think it was a real commercial if there 
wasn't some post. It's very rare we use [CGI] for an effect, and usually it 
doesn't work as successfully as something we've done in camera.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DL: </b></i>One of the 
things I noticed when I was looking back at the old Wallace and Gromits, you can 
see the animators' thumbprints. The characters are so endearing that after a few 
seconds, you don't notice.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>AR: </b></i>The reality 
in that world is that the characters have marks around their faces a lot. </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DB: </b></i>We've (Bolex 
Brothers) decided we want to go back to making films in the spirit that we first 
started making them. That means we don't aspire toward making features on the 
same level as Aardman. We've got a script idea we were (pitching) around in L.A. 
They were saying, &quot;How much do you want?&quot; It's like if we ask for less than $10 
million, they won't take you seriously anyway. All time I was saying to my 
partner, &quot;I don't want that much money.&quot; I could make this for a million and a 
half or two million, and I'd rather do it that way because of what it requires 
of us when we make a film. If you look at the $25 million plus it cost to make
<i><span style="font-style:italic">Chicken Run</span></i>, a lot of that went 
into how that plasticine was made. I remember a lot of the concern that went 
into that. &quot;This is going to be seen on a 35 mm screen. There can't be the 
slightest blemish on it.&quot; They didn't worry about that on <i>
<span style="font-style:italic">A Close Shave</span></i> or <i>
<span style="font-style:italic">The Wrong Trousers</span></i>, and they were on 
35 mm as well. People don't necessarily get bothered by that. If you are going 
to spend money, spend it where it's bloody important. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>AR: </b></i>Why does it 
have to be that finished? To a lot more of a degree, it doesn't. It's weird 
thing. (<i><span style="font-style:italic">Chicken Run</span></i>) was our first 
feature film. &quot;God, this has got to be slick.&quot; It does shift your mentality in a 
bad way. You look at it, and it doesn't need to be (slick). It work against it.
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DB: </b></i>That should 
be set up in a situation or environment where the soul of the film should be 
enhanced, not just the finish of it. I come across as being naïve to the powers 
that be. But I know at the end of the day, one of the most important things 
about making the movie is that you enjoy doing it, that you're excited by doing 
it, you're challenged by doing it, and all the stuff that instills in you gets 
reflected and communicated in the film. That's what people relate to, not how 
polished it is. You could have a crap idea and tart it up with as much money as 
you want, and it's still a crap idea.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DL: </b></i>Look at <i>
<span style="font-style:italic">Titan A.E. </span></i>They had no shortage of 
funds, and you can see the committee mindset creeping through.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>AR: </b></i>Can I just 
give you an anecdote on that? A few years back on of our top animators now, but 
he was just starting at the time, he went off to do a job with Ray Harryhausen, 
our big hero. Harryhausen was asked to do a commercial for some cheese dipping 
sticks, in which a dinosaur is chasing a bikini-clad woman. He picks her up and 
dunks her in the cheese and eats her. The agency obviously wanted something like 
a Harryhausen film because he did <i><span style="font-style:italic">One Million 
Years B.C.</span></i>, and they got Ray to do it. Ray's brought into this job 
with our animator as his assistant. Ray's a master of special effects, but 
looking back people would say, &quot;Look you can see the matte lines.&quot; All of the 
sudden you can use new technology, and you can do things like digital 
compositing. He got the background looking really good. You couldn't tell the 
background had been superimposed. He managed to get a good realistic look to it. 
The agency said, &quot;No, we don't want that! We want it to look like one of your 
films!&quot; They actually went and reprocessed it.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DL: </b></i>That 
reminds me of what photojournalist and later director Gordon Parks (<i><span style="font-style:italic">Shaft</span></i>) 
once told students. He said if you have one exposure left in the camera and you 
have to shoot either a man's dead body or the wife who murdered him crying, what 
do you shoot? I guess you can figure out his answer. He said the dead guy 
doesn't have the story. <i><span style="font-style:italic">Chicken Run</span></i> 
reminded me of that because when Mr. Tweedy take the ax to a chicken's head 
early in the film, we don't see the chicken killed directly. We see Ginger 
watching. We don't need to see the chicken's head falling off.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>AR: </b></i>There was a 
lot debate about that actually. It was one of those screening things. We did a 
test screening of the original cut of the film, and it was dramatic. You saw the 
shadow, and you heard the crunch of the neck being severed. They had objections, 
not from the kids. There's a lovely creature being killed. We didn't have all 
the blood squirting out, but it was pretty close. We had to change it. A lot of 
the people in the crew were livid about it. We had to establish that it was a <i>
<span style="font-style:italic">real</span></i> death. It still works.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DB: </b></i>That goes 
back to what we said earlier on about leaving it to the imagination. The 
audience can think of something much more terrible than what we can do showing 
it. You show [the chickens'] reaction to the thing. It's their heads. That's 
much more brutal than with any front-on shot.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>AR: </b></i>You don't 
need to do it with ketchup splattering everywhere. It's the subtle things. The 
iris in their eyes could be contracting or something. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DL: </b></i>Do you two 
have any advice for the people behind animation projects that didn't take off 
like <i><span style="font-style:italic">The King and I</span></i> or <i>
<span style="font-style:italic">The Road to Camelot</span></i>? </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DB: </b></i>I've never 
given advice to anyone that I didn't heed myself. If I give advice to anyone, 
it's to avoid formula. It's a gut instinct.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>AR: </b></i>Unless you 
really like formula. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DB: </b></i>One of the 
problems about trying to get a film seen more widely is that all that 
distribution machinery is geared around formula. &quot;It's really imaginative and 
incredible, but we don't know how to sell this.&quot; We didn't want it to be a 
particular genre. Now with the internet technology and everything else, it's 
going to help that because you're not necessarily held to ransom by that stuff. 
There are other ways of getting films and seen by people. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DL: </b></i>One thing 
that really interests me about hearing you two talk about your two studios is 
that there's no real feud the way some commentators talk about it. Some claim 
there was a Beatles vs. Stones feud, when in reality both bands were actually on 
friendly terms and even played on each others' albums.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DB: </b></i>[Aardman] 
was among the first there. We're kind of risking being competitive with them but 
not because of Aardman at all. The two ends of the spectrum are still there.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>AR: </b></i>It keeps a 
whole balance.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DL: </b></i>It's like 
Blur and Oasis getting along.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>AR: </b></i>The only 
reason is because the press put (The Stones and Beatles) there as the two most 
popular bands of the time. &quot;Let's make them rivals.&quot; They're not the same bands 
at all!</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DL: </b></i>There's a 
press-created Chaplin and Keaton rivalry, when in reality both were buddies. If 
there were, Chaplin wouldn't have warned Keaton not to sight with MGM, which 
Keaton admitted was the biggest mistake of his career. Chaplin knew that 
Keaton's spontaneity was a poor match for a regimented studio like MGM.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DB: </b></i>I had a 
very similar thing that illustrates how much Bolex and Aarman can confide. When
<i><span style="font-style:italic">Tom Thumb</span></i> first came over to the 
States and really got a lot of critical acclaim here, the studios like Disney 
were ringing us up saying, &quot;We'd really like to do business with you. We really 
want to collaborate with you, etc. etc. My gut instinct said stay well away from 
these people. I just think these people are going to eat me alive. There's no 
way they're going to let us make this kind of film in collaboration with them.
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I felt really doubtful in 
myself. I felt am I being really sissy here? Am I being really stupid? Should I 
be going with this? Pete [Lord] always sort of encouraged us from the first days 
when made the pilot film [for <i><span style="font-style:italic">Tom Thumb</span></i>], 
he'd say to us, &quot;What happened to it? Where is it?&quot; We'd say, &quot;It hasn't gone 
down really well the BBC pulled it out.&quot; He said, &quot;Get it into festivals! Get it 
seen! He'd encouraged us a lot.&quot; I'd gone to him around the time Disney was 
ringing us up. They started sending me scripts which were crap [laughing]. Pete 
said, &quot;Don't worry about it. They've been trying to buy us for two, three years 
now. What they want is that they've seen something they think is really 
different and really interesting and they want to buy you into a film deal. They 
don't care if you make a film as long as you don't make a film for anybody 
else.&quot; He was always supportive of us and what we were doing. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I know having gone through 
all the doubts I went through, thinking, &quot;Sh*t. I have tried to gear through all 
that machinery.&quot; I've come around thinking the only way we can do what we can do 
what we're wanting to do is to do it on the other end of the spectrum with a 
lower budget, independent kind of thing and making animation that kind of way. 
We're not asking for that much money that's going to be worrying people, and 
they're going to give you the freedom that you need. They're not going to 
interfere with it because they've got to get a return on a big investment. 
Unless you are able to take chances, there's no way we're going to be able to 
make interesting films.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DL: </b></i>In many 
ways, <i><span style="font-style:italic">Chicken Run</span></i> seems like a 
miracle. Some of the early DreamWorks cartoons make with people Jeffrey 
Katzenberg brought over from Disney for stuff like <i>
<span style="font-style:italic">The Road to El Dorado</span></i> seem like 
retreads. <i><span style="font-style:italic">Chicken Run </span></i>seems 
unique.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DB: </b></i>It was 
really bizarre at that time about three years ago when we were doing the tour 
(of Hollywood), they were all saying, DreamWorks as well, that we need to make 
films that are outside the Disney formula. What they were doing was the same 
thing. I don't know why. Why don't they spend less bloody money on it so they 
have less to lose and they can take more chances?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>AR: </b></i>What's the 
reason? None of them is going to be taking risks. It's just like TV adverts. You 
make a TV advert because it’s the same as something people already like. It 
guarantees success. You can come up with something totally original and take a 
chance on it and you can lose. (With Hollywood), &quot;Let's let somebody else come 
up with something and then buy them!&quot; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana"><i><b>DB: </b></i>You're not 
going to come up with anything new by taking safe bets. It just stands to 
reason. Its just variations on the theme.</font></p>
