            <p><font face="Verdana" size="5">Tears, fears, and Mariah Carey</font></p>
            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">As sixty-some million TV viewers 
            know, the 21 September telethon, <i>America: A Tribute to Heroes</i>, 
            was a singular event. For one thing, as critics have noted more than 
            once, it was unusually &quot;tasteful,&quot; with simple sets decorated only 
            with candles, with performers taking a uniformly careful and sober 
            tone. For another, it was simulcast on multiple channels and raised 
            some $150 million for victims of 11 September. And for still 
            another, the show featured a slew of mostly 
            middle-American-appealing movie stars and musicians, giving 
            unsensational performances to no applause. Fred Durst may have been 
            the exception with regard to this generational &quot;appeal,&quot; but the 
            Limp Bizkit frontman was, as he has been in all his recent 
            appearances, subdued. These days, breaking stuff isn't as fun as it 
            used to be. </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Heavily promoted as &quot;an 
            unforgettable and uplifting evening filled with music, memories, 
            hope, and inspiration,&quot; the tribute was indeed mostly music, with 
            the movie stars offering brief comments or quotations (perhaps most 
            memorably, Will Smith introduced Mohammad Ali). A couple of days 
            before the airdate, Mariah Carey's name was added to the list of 
            performers, marking her return to public view following her 
            much-reported breakdown in August. And I confess that, when she came 
            on stage to sing &quot;Hero,&quot; her eye shadow gold and glamorous, her 
            black dress elegant and, well, snug, I caught myself wanting her to 
            do well. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">She did fine, delivering a solid, 
            unspectacular performance in support of the worthy cause. For all 
            her public traumas, the girl can sing. Personally, I was glad that 
            she didn't do all that extra stuff she's so found of, the multiple-syllabling 
            and the high-note-hitting. And so what if she did try too hard 
            during Willie Nelson's closing sing-along version of &quot;America the 
            Beautiful,&quot; scatting awkwardly and intrusively? She was there to 
            prove that she was a trooper and a star, that she could be a team 
            player, that she was back on her feet, that she could keep her 
            clothes on. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A few weeks ago, you'll recall, 
            Mariah was unable to manage any of these things. Way back before 11 
            September, Mariah's meltdown was &quot;news. You may remember those days, 
            when media couldn't get enough of stories about Ben Affleck's 
            alcoholism and Gary Condit's infidelity. Now, after 11 September, 
            it's embarrassing and frankly depressing to think anyone paid 
            attention to such trivia, watched <i>Access Hollywood</i> for news 
            on her condition, &quot;tensions&quot; between her and rival Jennifer Lopez or 
            ex-husband Tommy Mottola, and rumored liaisons with &quot;rappers.&quot; And 
            imagine, someone was laughing at those late night TV jokes about her 
            &quot;extreme exhaustion,&quot; her bizarre striptease on <i>TRL</i>, and the 
            plaints she posted late at night to her website: &quot;I don't know 
            what's going on in my life.&quot; Such drama.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And yet, because Carey had for so 
            long acted like an out-of-touch diva, the press typically treated 
            such behavior as just part of the deal, maybe a little ridiculous, 
            but &quot;good&quot; copy. Now, the same behavior looks infinitely sad. And 
            now, the packaging of that same nonsense as &quot;plot&quot; in <i>Glitter</i>, 
            a.k.a. Mariah's First Movie, also looks sad. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As it happened, <i>Glitter</i> 
            opened on the very day Carey appeared on <i>America: A Tribute to 
            Heroes</i>. It was the only big studio movie to open wide that 
            weekend, as most studios rescheduled releases to suit a proper 
            mourning period. Perhaps Mariah's people felt they couldn't afford 
            another postponement (the movie had been pushed back once already, 
            following The Breakdown). Or perhaps they believed that, given the 
            film's lousy pre-release buzz, they would avoid competition and just 
            get the thing out and over with. Whatever their reasoning, the 
            unfortunate timing made Friday a strangely weighted day for Carey. 
            All of a sudden, there she was, the one-two Mariah punch. </font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Stranger still: so brave and 
            determined was she to get &quot;back out there,&quot; that Mariah Carey even 
            made an appearance at a Westwood theater to watch the film with 
            fans. In this brutal business, no one does this so publicly, for 
            obvious reasons of self-preservation. But, there she was. According 
            to SonicNet, Carey smiled a lot, signed copies of the movie 
            soundtrack CD, and spoke to interviewers outside the theater, 
            asserting her hope that moviegoers would find some pleasant 
            distraction in <i>Glitter</i>. She thanked her fans for their 
            support and observed, by way of explanation for The Breakdown, &quot;I 
            tend to work myself to the ground like a superhero.&quot; She added, 
            &quot;Obviously nothing can overshadow the events that have gone on, and 
            I need to stay focused on that.&quot; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The fact that most people have 
            indeed stayed focused on that, the unspeakable that, is one good 
            reason why <i>Glitter</i> had a terrible opening weekend. Another 
            reason is that it's a bad movie, even taking into account that it's 
            primarily a star vehicle. At some point, someone probably had high 
            expectations for the project. Obviously, Mariah is humungously 
            popular, despite and because of her diva rep and her multimillion 
            dollar Virgin Records contract. And there are quality names attached 
            to the production end of it -- the screenplay was written by Kate 
            Lanier (who wrote the women's power anthem-movies <i>Set It Off</i> 
            and <i>What's Love Got to Do With It</i>, and okay, <i>The Mod Squad</i>), 
            and directed by Vondie Curtis Hall (who made the excellent <i>
            Gridlock'd</i>). Still, it seems clear, looking at the finished 
            film, that the signs of its badness must have been everywhere.
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The most obvious sign of <i>Glitter</i>'s 
            misguidedness is its reported basis in Carey's own life story, 
            filtered through <i>A Star is Born</i> and any number of tragic 
            show-biz biopics. Carey's rags-to-riches character, Billie Frank, 
            first appears as a young girl (played by Isabel Gomes), trying to go 
            unnoticed in the low-rent bar where her boozy mother Lillian (Valarie 
            Pettiford) sings the blues. When the audience razzes mom, she brings 
            the girl on stage to bail her out. And as her mother stumbles back, 
            clutching her ice-clinky drink, Billie emerges as the spotlight hog 
            she's destined to be, belting out a tune like nobody's business. Or 
            rather, like somebody specific's business -- Mariah Carey's. </font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A few scenes later, mom sets the 
            house on fire and hands Billie over the state (the search for her 
            mom will trouble the poor girl for the rest of the film, though the 
            fact that she becomes a super-visible celebrity, thus making it 
            quite easy for her mother to find <i>her</i>, seems to be lost on 
            the plot's sentimental illogic). Literally, as soon as Billie walks 
            in the orphanage door, Billie meets the girls who will become her 
            lifelong friends and backup singers, Roxanne (who will grow up to be 
            Tia Texada, in an embarrassing &quot;hot Latina&quot; turn) and Louise (Da 
            Brat, who also guests in Carey's awful &quot;Loverboy&quot; video, driving a 
            race car while she raps and a short-shortsed Mariah cavorts on the 
            track). These girls are the only characters who ask about Billie's 
            racial identity (her melancholy mom is black, her dad a selfish 
            white guy who rejects them out of hand). Billie informs her new 
            friends that she's &quot;mixed,&quot; and that's the last you hear about it, 
            though you'd think it would be quite important concern for Billie, 
            given that she's living in disco-era NYC. Just why the film is set 
            in the 1980s is not clear either, except maybe, that it occasions 
            the wearing of many horribly dated little-girly-meets-drag-queen 
            costumes (Roxanne's are particularly unflattering). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Perhaps because she wears pigtails 
            and a baseball cap with her shorts, Billie's career as a back-up 
            singer is soon over, and she's got the attention of all kinds of men 
            who want to produce her. First, the too-smooth Timothy (Terrence 
            Howard, unfortunately making a habit of playing 2D villains), who 
            has her doing vocals for his lipsync-ing girlfriend; and second, the 
            too passionate Dice (Max Beesley, one of the least charismatic, most 
            uncomfortable actors I've seen in some time). He offers to make her 
            a star and buy out her contract with Timothy -- without telling her 
            that he's doing it, and without paying Timothy the $100,000 he's 
            promised him. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">All this comes back to bite Dice 
            when Timothy comes to collect and busts him to Billie. By this time, 
            though, Dice is already on thin ice with his girl, as his mounting 
            jealousy of her success has led him to drink, yell, and haul her out 
            of a party (away from romantic rival Eric Benet) and off a video 
            set. This last takes place during a strange scene where the 
            euro-trashy video director is so fixated on his &quot;brilliant&quot; concept 
            (&quot;Sex sells!&quot;) that he apparently doesn't notice his star's 
            absolutely terrible performance. Ostensibly, she's embarrassed to be 
            wearing a bikini, but... come on. She is Mariah Carey, and besides, 
            there's not a scene in the film where Billie isn't wearing some 
            skimpy or otherwise tediously sexed-up costume. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This kind of tonal schizophrenia 
            pervades <i>Glitter</i>. On one side, the barebones of the plot are 
            just tedious: Billie and Dice break up and almost make up, he pays a 
            predictable terrible price, and she is emphatically not Mrs. Norman 
            Maine, though she makes a stoic stand and sings a sad song just the 
            same, telling her screaming fans assembled at Madison Square Garden, 
            &quot;Don't ever take anybody for granted, because you never know when 
            you might lose them and you'll never see them again.&quot; (This cheesy 
            moment -- and presumably not the faulty grammar -- drew gasps from 
            the audience with whom I saw the film, not because of the film's 
            context, but because everyone there had another, immediately 
            pressing and painful notion of loss in mind.) </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">On the other side, of course, the 
            narrative falderal is just irrelevant. Whatever the reasons for the 
            film's existence and Carey's general career overdrive&nbsp; -- to keep up 
            with J. Lo and Britney and whoever else is coming down the pike, to 
            keep her visible and moving units, to appease the diva, or to expand 
            her already considerable talents -- the offscreen costs are 
            obviously too high. Roundly assailed by critics, the movie is not 
            going to pay off as hoped. Even the soundtrack is falling below 
            Virgin's big-money expectations, entering Billboard's chart at 
            number seven. That Carey's a weak actor may not matter in the grand 
            scheme (persistence counts: Madonna eventually got <i>Evita</i>, for 
            whatever it was worth). But the fact that she and her crew picked 
            such a deficient vehicle for her suggests that they're all needing 
            to refocus, on something, anything, meaningful and productive.&nbsp;
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What such meaningful focus might be 
            or lead to is a question that many of us are asking ourselves now. 
            We don't have to look for it in front a bijillion other people, but, 
            ironically, our ability to stay private, to mourn and rage and 
            submerge/refind ourselves in too much or too little work only makes 
            Mariah Carey's &quot;superheroic&quot; tears and fears seem more 
            representative, not less. I'm certainly not suggesting that Mariah 
            Carey's career and personal troubles be read in conjunction with the 
            gargantuan violence and horror erupting all around us. The 
            connections among these events are tenuous and coincidental, surely 
            not deep or even very clear. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Maybe I'm just trying to sort out 
            why I was moved by Carey's performance on <i>America: A Tribute to 
            Heroes</i>, why I was glad to see that she looked less frazzled than 
            I expected. Part of my surprise at my own reaction, I confess, is 
            that I was never a Mariah fan before. I don't own one of her albums, 
            and have always regarded her as something of an anachronism, even 
            when she was &quot;hot,&quot; however many years ago that was. And yet, I 
            sympathized with her, and appreciated her work that night. Even 
            people who are obviously better equipped emotionally (or who have 
            friends and associates who are better equipped) to deal with the 
            legendary &quot;vagaries of fame&quot; have a hard time in Carey's business.
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And beyond my not-very-personal 
            investment in Mariah's professional and mental health, I am struck 
            by her obvious fragility and stubborn resilience, her rawness and 
            her weirdness. As irrelevant as she's always seemed to me, she has 
            been very relevant to everyone who has bought her records and 
            posters and keychains. Their relationship to her is theirs, and they 
            are generous to share it with each other and the rest of us. They 
            want her back, for their own good reasons. Seeing her perform on 
            Friday night reminded me that recovery -- as public as this 
            difficult process has become in recent days -- is a very private 
            thing, no matter all the rhetoric to the contrary. </font>
