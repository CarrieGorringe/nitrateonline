            are the words of Marcus Garvey. For all his ambition, political
            acumen, and fiery oratory, Garvey may be best remembered for his
            uniforms. Featuring shiny buttons, epaulets, and a hat resembling
            that worn by Napoleon Bonaparte (plume and all), Garvey's was a
            serious uniform, and, judging by every portrait I've seen of him in
            it, he was quite aware of its seriousness. He knew as well that
            uniforms tend to instill pride in their wearers, as do parades for
            their marchers, and rallies for their participants. He worked all of
            these avenues to bring to his followers a sense of self-esteem and,
            importantly, entitlement. Believing that black people the world over
            had been convinced that they were unworthy of land, wealth, and
            self-governance, even civil rights, in the early twentieth century,
            Garvey made it his mission to remind black men and women of their
            honorable heritage and inspire them to move on toward a glorious
            future based on international unity. <o:p>

            <i>Marcus Garvey: Look for Me in the Whirlwind</i>, part of their
            &quot;American Experience&quot; Series, presents the many sides and
            struggles of Marcus Garvey. The documentary follows a general
            trajectory, describing a bit about Garvey's childhood in St. Ann's
            Bay, Jamaica. Born in 1887, he was raised by a strict father (who
            once left him alone at the bottom of a grave to teach him --
            perversely -- self-reliance) and an encouraging mother (she believed
            he was destined for great things, even wanting to name him
            &quot;Moses&quot;). As a child, the documentary reports, Garvey
            played with a young white girl; but as they entered adolescence, her
            father sent her away to school to avoid further contact with him. At
            this point, apparently, fourteen-year-old Garvey
            &quot;discovered&quot; racism and vowed to do something about it. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            1914, inspired by his reading of Booker T. Washington's <i>Up from
            Slavery</i>, Garvey established the Universal Negro Improvement
            Association (U.N.I.A.) and African Community's League (A.C.L.), both
            dedicated to racial unity, economic independence, moral melioration,
            and educational achievement, but within two years, he had run into
            money trouble -- a kind of trouble that would plague him throughout
            his career -- and he headed for the United States, where he soon
            settled in Harlem. <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There,
            he restarted the U.N.I.A., based at first on support from New York's
            West Indian immigrant community. In order to publicize his extensive
            plans for black education and self-employment, he founded a
            newspaper, <i>The Negro World</i>, and in order to finance them, he
            started a shipping company, the Black Star Line, and the Negro
            Factories Corporation (started in 1920), which developed grocery
            stores, a restaurant, a laundry, a moving van company, and a
            publishing house. During these years (1919-1922 or so), Garvey was
            also busy touring, giving speeches, opening chapters of the U.N.I.A.
            all over the U.S, marrying his &quot;soulmate,&quot; Amy Ashwood,
            and surviving an assassination attempt (which, for his followers,
            only made him seem more clearly &quot;chosen&quot; to lead them). It
            wasn't long before he caught the attention of the FBI; in 1919, the
            Bureau assigned a young Justice Department operative, one J. Edgar
            Hoover, to gather damaging information on Garvey, a scheme which
            meant hiring the first African American agent to go undercover and
            befriend and betray Garvey (and so, the strategy behind COINTELPRO
            was instituted). He also met with leaders of the Ku Klux Klan,
            stating that he believed these were the true power-holders in the
            United States. Eventually, Garvey and his organizations would be
            undone -- he would lose all his money, be jailed for mail fraud,
            rejected by black U.S. leaders (W.E.B. Du Bois called him
            &quot;dictatorial, domineering, inordinately vain, and very
            suspicious&quot;), and deported to Jamaica in 1927. Though he and
            his second wife, his former secretary Amy Jacques, would have two
            sons (both interviewed briefly for this film), Garvey would die a
            broken and lonely man, in 1940, in London. <o:p>

&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"> tracks most of the events in Garvey's remarkable life,
            using standard documentary devices -- talking heads (mostly
            historians who opine on the man's psychology or, more usefully,
            establish historical contexts for his actions and reactions, as well
            as some eyewitnesses, who recall the thrill of seeing Garvey when
            they were children), artfully blurred dramatic reenactments, and a
            few of those period-music-accompanied slow zooms on old photographs
            that Ken Burns has made famous. The American Experience website
            includes materials cited in the film, including transcripts of key
            primary documents, such as Garvey's autobiographical statement, <i>The
            Negro's Greatest Enemy</i> (written while he was in New York's Tombs
            prison) and the Declaration of Rights of the Negro Peoples of the
            World, which was drafted and adopted at U.N.I.A. Convention held in
            New York's Madison Square Garden in 1920, which also elected Garvey
            &quot;Provisional President of Africa.&quot; This extraordinary text
            begins with the following preamble: &quot;Be it Resolved, That the
            Negro people of the world, through their chosen representatives in
            convention assembled... protest against the wrongs and injustices
            they are suffering at the hands of their white brethren, and state
            what they deem their fair and just rights, as well as the treatment
            they propose to demand of all men in the future.&quot; Such protest,
            as we know, continues in less unified forms to this day. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            documentary paints a multi-faceted portrait of Garvey, without final
            answers as to why and how he happened when he did. He emerges as a
            fascinating and frustrating figure, at once vain and inspirational,
            authoritarian and enigmatic, self-absorbed to the point of driving
            friends and supporters away, and yet so dedicated to his greater
            cause that many people around the diasporic world -- Africans,
            African Americans, West Indians -- were moved to support him with
            whatever meager means they had (one woman remembers her father
            investing the family's food money in the Black Star Line, much to
            her mother's chagrin). To capture such a &quot;whirlwind&quot; would
            be impossible; but <i>Marcus Garvey: Look for Me in the Whirlwind</i>
            provides a provocative introduction to this compelling, complex man.
