<meta name="description" content="SIFF 2000 - True, The Seattle International Film Festival is a bit of an endurance test. With five screens and over 250 films to choose from, attending this cinematic equivalent to the New York Marathon is a blur of flashing passes at ushers, negotiating crummy seats after late arrivals, and staying awake during that third film of the day.  However, like any challenge, there are rewards to be had for the persistent.  Watching its train of images passing by, one can find connections between seemingly unlikely movies. Perhaps they deal with similar subjects, or boast comparable styles.  Or perhaps they tell the same stories, using dramatically different approaches.">

<p class="MsoTitle"><font face="Verdana" size="5">On the Waterfront</font><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">This summer’s Seattle 
International Film Festival covered the Puget Sound area with a dragnet of 
banners, advertisements, billboards, and fanfare that impacted both sprawling 
plazas and discreet coffee shops.&nbsp; Like the last fall blooms on a weathered 
garden mum, a few other northwest movie events are surging in SIFF’s receding 
wake.&nbsp; Later this month, The Olympic Film Festival will rear its head, while 
that refined, Victorian seaport of the Olympic Peninsula, Port Townsend, closed 
the book on September with its second annual film celebration.</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Seattle International 
Film Festival boasted late-night Asian mayhem such as <i>Battle Royale</i> and
<i>Dead or Alive</i>, the presence of the always-caffeinated Quentin Tarantino 
ranting maniacally from a screenside podium, and a massive, five-theater network 
of screens. The Port Townsend variation was an entirely different animal.&nbsp; 
Instead of Capitol Hill moviehouses like The Egyptian and their faithful 
punk-rock congregations worshipping at the altar of John Woo or Paul Thomas 
Anderson, the more mellowed-out Port Townsend offered Eva Marie Saint fielding 
questions on her career of pictures, including <i>On the Waterfront</i> and <i>
North by Northwest</i>.&nbsp; Instead of sprawling over three weeks of screenings, 
this smaller compilation of films was tucked into one tidy weekend.&nbsp; 
Gray-haired, sixty-something ladies in fleece jackets and affectionate, young 
couples flocked to such lush, restored, downtown theatres as the Rose and the 
Rosebud. Meanwhile, participants braved a gasp-inducing flight of cement stairs 
to access the higher-altitude Broughton, a community recreation hall converted 
into a moviehouse for this seasonal event.&nbsp; In Seattle, you might find yourself 
arguing with another passholder over whether or not Tim Blake Nelson’s <i>O</i> 
had racist overtones. In Port Townsend, the person in line next to you&nbsp; was more 
likely to comment on the lovely weather, or recommend a good espresso joint.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Strangely enough, the genial, 
“block party” atmosphere surrounding Port Townsend was offset by the rather 
dark, heavy films on offer. <i>L.I.E</i>. concerned pedophilia, <i>The Cart Ma</i>&nbsp; 
followed a transient’s loss of freedom via incarceration, and <i>The State I Am 
In</i> told the story of a teenager’s repressed, miserable life as she followed 
her fugitive parents on the lam.&nbsp; Even <i>Intimacy</i>, a would-be 
celebration of the flesh, focused its voyeuristic microscope on the lives of two 
downtrodden U.K. lovers as they groped each other to escape depression, 
fractured home lives, and unfulfilled dreams. A real upper, this merry platter 
of celluloid depressants.&nbsp; Meanwhile, 
one could recline on a sea of hay bails tossed about on the roped-off Taylor 
Street block, where an outdoor screen boasted free screenings of<b><i> </i></b>
<i>North by Northwest</i> and <i>Koyaanisqatsi</i>. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Such relatively innocent 
blasts from the past were a welcome antidote to <i>L.I.E.</i>, one of the 
event’s more controversial entries.&nbsp; Directed with shockingly realistic strokes 
by Michael Cuesta, this film rummages around in the ruined lives surrounding the 
east coast’s Long Island Expressway. We follow fifteen-year old Howie (Paul 
Franklin Dano), a gentle-faced, sad-eyed youth with the heart of a poet.&nbsp; 
Howie’s mother recently died during a car wreck on the L.I.E., and the grieving 
son makes it a ritual to balance on the edge of the freeway’s overpasses, 
tempting death as he stares into the oncoming traffic below.&nbsp; “There are lanes 
going east, lanes going west, and lanes going straight to hell,” he observes.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Indeed, hell would seem an 
appropriate stomping ground for Big John (Shakespearean actor Brian Cox), a Long 
Island war veteran who collects vintage military pistols, dances with his 
elderly mother at birthday parties, croons at the piano, and fancies good 
poetry. He also prowls the area’s pick-up joints, helming an orange muscle car 
and hunting for young boys.&nbsp; Big John is the local sugar daddy - a chicken hawk 
preying on underage youth and immortalizing their images on computer files and 
snapshots after he’s had his fun.&nbsp; When Howie joins a group of delinquents and 
robs Big John’s basement one evening, he is discovered. The menacing homeowner 
gives Howie a choice: he can face the wrath of the police after being reported 
for burglary, or he can “work off” the incident by maintaining a relationship 
with the older man.&nbsp; The core of <i>L.I.E.</i> concerns the connection between 
this sick predator and the needy Howie, who presents himself as a vulnerable 
target after his self-involved father is arrested for shady business dealings 
and his best friend abruptly leaves town. Indeed, in the wake of his mother’s 
passing, the remnants of family that Howie has tried to salvage have abandoned 
him. The remaining reels of <i>L.I.E. </i>pose the question: will Big John 
exploit Howie for his own personal gratification, or control his unhealthy 
impulses and provide some humanity and paternal support for the lad?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Because of the movie’s 
subject matter, <i>L.I.E. </i>was slapped with an NC-17 rating, even though its 
sexual content is implied rather than graphic. Even so, there’s no denying the 
queasy blanket of disturbing, unsettled tension that drapes this frank look at 
the inner circle of a pederast.&nbsp; There’s a scene where Big John confirms his 
habits and behavior to Howie, and it’s a sad theft of innocence, reminiscent of 
Laura Dern being verbally seduced by an older Treat Williams in the 
similarly-themed coming-of-age film, <i>Smooth Talk</i>.&nbsp; Meanwhile, as Cox 
plays him, this pseudo-villain does come across as having empathy, charm, and 
the complicated chemistry of a man reluctantly acting out the deeds of a monster 
before resurfacing back to some semblance of decency.&nbsp; As he comes to understand 
the extent of Howie’s pain and loneliness, Big John’s id and superego wrestle 
each other into overtime. There’s a scene where another character chastises the 
man for his depraved sexual habits, stating “You ought to be ashamed of 
yourself.” We believe him when Cox’s scary creation retorts, “I am. Every time.”
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">What a shame, then, when <i>
L.I.E. </i>ends in an abrupt, easy fashion that fails to bring the story full 
circle. It’s a tidy little wrap-up that concludes a movie too complicated for 
such a neat finale.&nbsp; Nevertheless, <i>L.I.E.</i> proves to be a strong slug of 
cinema. Like <i>Taxi Driver</i>, <i>The Godfather</i>, and <i>The Silence of the 
Lambs</i>, it explores characters with evil in them, who are too complex to 
merely be labeled as monsters, and the more sympathetic beings that surround 
them, testing their ruthlessness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Another dysfunctional coming 
of age film clouding Port Townsend’s typically perky mood was <i>The State In Am 
In</i>, which brought to mind Sidney Lumet’s superb 1988 movie <i>Running on 
Empty</i>,&nbsp; with its story of a child born to fugitives of the law.&nbsp; Lumet’s 
film focused on an American husband and wife who stay high on the FBI’s most 
wanted list, since blowing up a napalm lab seventeen years earlier in protest of 
the Viet Nam War.&nbsp; Ever since this deed, they have stayed one step ahead of the 
law, towing their children along with them like so much awkward baggage.&nbsp; The 
late River Phoenix gave the best performance of his career as Danny, whose 
future is tainted by the notoriety of his parents’ past.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Directed by Christian Petzold,
<i>The State I Am In</i> spins a similar yarn, following Cher (Barbara Auer), 
Hans (Richy Muller), and their teenaged daughter, Jeanne (Julia Hummer).&nbsp; The 
trio lives a nomadic existence, trekking from country to country in their car 
like vagabond entertainers straining to make their next gig. The monotony of the 
road is punctuated by phone calls to fellow underground friends-in-hiding, with 
the hope of scoring some cash, or run-ins with the police that end in screeching 
tires and bullet wounds.&nbsp; While Cher and Hans struggle not to meet a Bonnie and 
Clyde-style demise, they force Jeanne to wear nerdy, inconspicuous sweaters and 
facilitate a unique form of on-the-road home schooling. “No boy will want to 
look at me now,” weeps Jeanne as she dons a dopey jacket. “That’s good,” snaps 
back the unsympathetic Hans. “We don’t want anyone looking at us.”</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Inevitably, Jeanne rebels 
against this prison-like existence, where long-term friends, dating, and the 
other rituals of adolescence are discouraged.&nbsp; After meeting Heinrich 
(Val-Kilmer lookalike Bilge Bingul), a hunky surfer riding the waves in 
Portugal, Jeanne must choose between the frantic, scattered routine of her 
parents and a more conventional life without them. The shaggy-haired Heinrich, 
intrigued by Jeanne’s shy, withdrawn manner, confesses to being “a McJobber who 
has surfer dreams and loves Brian Wilson.”&nbsp; It’s painful to hear his love 
interest lying about her more dramatic past, as she fabricates stories about 
being in a cult group. Her parents catch on to Jeanne’s blossoming affair with 
Heinrich.&nbsp; “Do you realize what’s at stake here?” they complain, terrified that 
their identities will be leaked out to the new boyfriend. “When you’re in love,” 
acknowledges Cher, “you tell each other everything at some point.”</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>The State I Am In</i> 
lacks the polish of Lumet’s film. It’s a murkier, messier hybrid.&nbsp; We never know 
exactly what Hans and Cher did to gain such notoriety, and their network of 
acquaintances – such as a shady author named Klaus who has past romantic ties 
with Cher – emerge from the shadows temporarily before quickly stepping back 
in.&nbsp; In some ways, this works in the movie’s favor, revealing the fractured 
instability that defines life on the run.&nbsp; And like a top spinning violently out 
of control, <i>The State I Am In</i> ends with this rootless family careening 
into directions simultaneously tragic and hopeful.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There’s nothing hopeful in 
the dire, depressing <i>Intimacy</i>, one of those <i>Last Tango In Paris</i> 
knockoffs that gives sexually explicit foreign films a bad name. The story 
follows a miserable pair of losers, Jay (Mark Rylance) and Claire (Kerry Fox), 
and their once-a-week Olympic bouts of sex in the former’s filthy, disheveled 
flat.&nbsp; Jay has left his wife and children, while Claire flirts with amateur 
theater and a loveless relationship with her husband.&nbsp; In between some 
startlingly graphic sexual encounters (complete with bona-fide erections, 
fellatio, and condom application), <i>Intimacy</i>’s lead characters wax 
philosophical about life, the world, and the meaning of it all. Sample line: 
“Marriage is a war, a battle, a terrible journey – but it’s worth living for.”&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The same can’t be said for this movie, a pretentious endurance test that isn’t 
worth two hours of wasted time, even with all of the gyrating buns and heaving 
chests.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">A much wiser take on life was 
the brilliant documentary <i>Before Leaving</i> (“<b><i>Avant de Partir</i></b>”), 
which plunges viewers into the relatively unexplored territory of long term 
care.&nbsp; Putting into focus the goings-on at a French nursing facility, director 
Paul De Laubier find a bustling, emotional whirlwind that contrasts our notion 
of nursing homes as depressing dumping grounds for the ill and elderly.&nbsp; 
Laubier’s camera follows the incredibly demanding routine of Ms. Abbes, an 
energetic, forty-something brunette who manages the care for dozens of 
residents, each with their own particular and demanding set of needs.&nbsp; As <i>
Before Leaving</i> begins, a nurse informs us that two classifications of 
patient reside there: those with Alzheimer’s, who can recall older memories, but 
not current events, and psychotic patients who have been institutionalized most 
of their lives for schizophrenia-like conditions.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Cinema has mostly cast a 
blind eye onto this population in the past. We fear that which we know is 
inevitable, and <i>Before Leaving</i> thrusts us into the challenges of growing 
old like no film that’s come before.&nbsp; When Ms. Abbes approaches a bedfast woman 
lying limp and frail in her quiet room, assisting her with a drink of water 
after the resident confirms, “My left hand doesn’t work,” it’s an unblinking 
dose of reality.&nbsp; Moments later, we’re introduced to perpetually sad Mr. 
Martins, crying and rattled by a loud neighbor’s ranting. “It seems like I’ve 
lost everything,” she sobs. “And I forget all these days that have passed.”</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Perhaps the most fascinating 
story is that of Mrs. Colizza, a stubborn matriarch admitted by her daughter 
after her failing memory and legs made her a liability at home.&nbsp; “Thank you for 
a dreadful day,” she scowls at her guilt-ridden daughter. “You tricked me. How 
could your dare bring me here? You tried to get rid of me!”&nbsp; Later, when Ms. 
Abbes attempts to orient the bitter woman, Mrs. Colizza reveals the root cause 
of her frustration. “I used to be a human resource director,” she boasts 
proudly. “I was responsible for 400 people. I love being the boss!”&nbsp; Clearly, a 
submissive life is not her cup of tea.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Other patients take comfort 
in valued routines and rituals, which are met as efficiently as possible by Ms. 
Abbes and her capable staff. Mirielle, fresh from a psychiatric ward, wants 
nothing better than to have lunch – twenty four hours a day.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Lulu 
perseverates on shopping. “It has to be K-Mart,” she insists. “The others are 
too expensive!”&nbsp; The film makes us aware that even as the sun sets on life, we 
grasp onto customs and traditions to maintain a sense of meaning and order.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There are moments of great 
joy in <i>Before Leaving<b>,</b></i> such as a birthday party where patients 
belt out traditional French songs in the manner of a spirited choir.&nbsp; The movie 
reveals the healing power of humor when a kindly male co-worker teases the 
cynical 89-year old birthday girl Coco. “Are you the Coco of my heart,” he 
teases, before serenading her like a suave suitor.&nbsp; “Oh, hush,” she grins. 
“You’re not my boyfriend!”&nbsp; There’s also a beautiful moment during an evening 
outing, where the patients enjoy a moonlight night of boating, while the Eiffel 
Tower hovers protectively in the background. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Before Leaving</i> reveals 
that life in these institutionalized settings is, perhaps, not so different from 
that practiced in the outside world. There are the same politics, mind games, 
values, and pleasures found throughout life in any locale.&nbsp; Most importantly, 
there is the struggle to understand that we are responsible for our own 
happiness.&nbsp; One can leave this existence like Mrs. Colizza, wielding her cane 
like a ringmaster as she spits vile insults at her son-in-law, or like Ms. 
Mathiely, a one-time Paris opera singer who “won all the prizes” in her youth. A 
century later, she can still enjoy the magic of a classical tune sung by a 
dining room full of clapping, chanting patients singing in not-so-perfect 
harmony. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Second Annual Port 
Townsend Film Festival, poised on an airy waterfront of sailboats, kayakers, and 
art shops, would seem a kinder, gentler antidote to its forceful Seattle 
counterpart. However, its challenging, provocative menu of biting films proves 
that the kind little block party out on the peninsula is no lightweight.&nbsp; This 
weaving of light and dark is sure to produce a similar web of contrasts in years 
to come.&nbsp; </font></p>
