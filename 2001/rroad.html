            children heading &quot;home&quot; has long been a popular theme in
            U.S. media. Just think back on a few recent melodramas featuring
            characters who return to their roots and/or rediscover themselves,
            once they head back to see parents, siblings, or traumatic childhood
            memories: <i>Hope Floats</i>, <i>The Gilmore Girls</i>, <i>One True
            Thing</i>, <i>Judging Amy</i>, <i>The Myth of Fingerprints</i>, <i>Ed</i>,
            <i>Providence</i>, <i>Any Day Now</i>... The list goes on and on, as
            does the familiar storyline: if you can reconnect with some past
            grievance or difficulty, you can make yourself whole again. It's all
            part of a grand plan and testament to the human spirit. As moving as
            such a story can be (and it's at least as often corny as it is
            effective), the emotional displays tend to be large and the
            consequences contrived. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Knowing
            this story a little too well makes it all the more refreshing to
            find a version that actually feels new. Such is the small miracle
            offered by Zhang Yimou's <i>The Road Home</i>, a film that is
            breathtakingly unspectacular, simultaneously simple and nuanced. The
            script, adapted by Bao Shi from his own novel, tells a tale as basic
            as can be: an engineer from the city, Luo Yusheng (Sun Honglei),
            comes home to the tiny village where he grew up, in order to help
            his mother, Zhao Di (Zhao Yuelin), arrange for his father's burial.
            He imagines, while driving the long, stark road home, that the whole
            business will be painful but also predetermined: a funeral is a
            funeral, after all.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">On
            his arrival, however, Yusheng finds Di parked in the snowy yard, at
            the schoolhouse where his father taught for some forty years.
            Chilled to the bone and bereft, she agrees to return to her humble
            home with Yusheng, but insists that he arrange for a traditional
            procession and burial. These ideas include a group of men carrying
            her husband's coffin from the city hospital to the village, no small
            feat, especially because, as the mayor informs Yusheng, all the
            young men, like Yusheng himself, have moved to the city, leaving
            only old men, women, and children in the village. As he contemplates
            just how to get this job done -- indeed, whether he should get it
            done -- Yusheng recalls the story of his parents' courtship, and
            learns some things about himself in the process. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">When
            the extended flashback begins, the film's washed out black and white
            turns to brilliant, lush color. This choice surely enhances the
            past's romance and sensual excitement, but the effect is actually
            more complex than that, suggesting the many colors that often
            attributed to memories, especially in the wake of loss. In this
            lengthy part of the film, Yusheng's mother is reintroduced as a
            lovely young girl (played by Zhang Ziyi, the dazzling breakout star
            of <i>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</i>, here in her film debut,
            which was completed before the Ang Lee film), living with her blind
            grandmother in rural poverty. As soon as she hears the voice of the
            new schoolteacher, Luo Changyu (Zheng Hao), Di falls completely in
            love, and the rest of the film follows their proper, agonizingly
            respectful efforts to get together. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Di
            takes the first step, undertaking to prepare a delicious meal each
            day for Changyu's lunch, while he and the other men of the village
            build the new schoolhouse. The trouble is, all the village girls are
            bringing special dishes to the communal table, for all the village
            men at work building the new schoolhouse, and it's hard for Di to
            see who takes her dish, given that the girls must remain at a
            distance while the men eat. These scenes, repeated several times,
            are so lovely and carefully composed that it's difficult to describe
            them: as the men approach the table, you see only their torsos and
            arms, their dark clothes blending together so they look like a herd.
            At the same time, the sounds of their shuffling footsteps, mixed
            with dishes rattling, overcome any individual voices. Poor Di
            strains to see who picks up her dish, but cannot. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Their
            eventual meeting, when Changyu comes to her home (according to the
            village code, he visits each home for a meal), allows them to
            reveal, without speaking, their mutual admiration, and from this
            moment, Di is determined to prove herself worthy of the city
            gentleman's affections. Just as their romance might begin, though,
            Changyu is called back to the city because of ominous-sounding but
            ineffable &quot;political trouble.&quot; While other villagers
            gossip and then begin to forget their beloved schoolteacher, Di is
            firm in her resolve to await her husband-to-be's return. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Zhang's
            films are always pulsing with rich details of color and sound --
            think of the dyed fabrics flapping in <i>Ju Dou</i> (1989), the
            fabulous costumes and carefully prepared foods of <i>Raise the Red
            Lantern </i>(1991), or the delicate but persistent clink-clink of
            mah-jongg tiles in <i>Shanghai Triad</i> (1995) -- all of the above
            made with the director's former partner and muse, Gong Li. Always
            attuned to the textures and sensual experiences of daily life, even
            when set against the relatively epic backdrop of <i>To Live</i>
            (1994), Zhang recently returned to a simpler style in <i>Not One
            Less</i> (1998), using non-professionals as performers and scaling
            down his backdrop for the story of a schoolteacher in a tale more
            mundane than earth-shaking. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><i><font size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
            Road Home</span></font></span></font></i><font size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana">
            is similarly scaled back, but also suffused with a nostalgia that's
            unusual for Zhang, best known for his critiques of Chinese
            traditions, and rigid gender and class structures. Here Di's
            passionate, naive devotion to Changyu is unquestioned, a function of
            her vibrant youth and optimism, her utter lack of experience,
            self-consciousness, or cynicism. While her yearning and beauty
            recall conventional romantic heroines (and indeed, the aged Di's
            home has on its walls posters for Cameron's <i>Titanic</i>, the most
            overblown romantic movie in recent memory -- she knows her own
            framework), Di's tenacity is something else. And though the film is
            replete with images of her incredible face -- smiling, breathless,
            dissolving into vast golden fields and sun-dappled backroads -- it
            is the character's own absolute faith in herself, her determination
            to endure despite all political or social edicts, that grants the
            film unusual, and unusually moving, weight. </font></span></font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><o:p>
