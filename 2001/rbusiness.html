            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b>Julie
            (Stockard Channing) is good at her job. She's spent years climbing
            the corporate ladder, equally adept at making faultless
            presentations and schmoozing with a**holes. And yet, Julie remains
            unsure of herself. When, en route to an important pitch meeting, she
            learns that her boss is flying in for an unscheduled one-on-one, she
            imagines that she's about to be fired.<o:p>
            </b>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">During
            the first few minutes of Patrick Stettner's <i>The Business of
            Strangers</i>, you learn a lot about Julie. She's on the move,
            traveling first class, but everywhere she goes looks the same; all
            the restaurants, boardrooms, and hotel suites feature the same bland
            décor. As Julie click-clicks through a starkly white airport,
            Teodoro Maniaci's camera tracks behind her, then moves around to
            reveal her game face: prepared and in control. The problem is, she
            can never be sure just what she's prepared for and in control of,
            but that is the precise nature of her business, which is
            characterized by treachery and tension.&nbsp;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Indeed,
            minutes after Julie's in-charge intro, things start to go wrong. She
            can't get any detailed info on this upcoming meeting with the boss,
            then her Big Presentation goes badly because her new assistant,
            Paula (Julia Stiles), arrives forty-five minutes late, crucial
            power-point equipment in tow. When Julie snipes at Paula, the girl
            comes back with her own declaration of war: Julie is an
            &quot;uberfrau,&quot; too uptight and merciless. As if to prove the
            point, Julie takes aim the best way she knows how: in a fit of
            frustration and fear, she fires the girl.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">After
            this multi-layered disaster, everything changes again: the meeting
            with the boss, in a sterile airport café, results in Julie's
            promotion to CEO. That she has misinterpreted the situation so
            colossally probably says less about Julie than the unreadably brutal
            business world she inhabits, but still, it sets her up for what
            follows, namely, Paula's increasingly complicated vengeance plot,
            which seems part ferocious spite, part meticulous calculation, and
            part<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>arty
            concoction designed to show off acting chops. But while <i>The
            Business of Strangers</i> does make some room for Channing and
            Stiles to stretch out, its basic premise -- the meanness of the
            business of strangers -- is worn-out.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Still,
            the plot itself isn't wholly predictable: when the women meet again
            in the hotel bar, they bond over a few drinks and their shared anger
            at being pawns in a men's game, then exorcise their fury against a
            smarmy headhunter, Nick (Frederick Weller). But Julie and Paula
            don't have that much to say to one another: locked in mutual
            melodrama, they eventually reveal self-incriminating and
            self-destructive bitterness. Julie is burdened with the usual
            motives for her meanness -- she's divorced, childless (she didn't
            want them, which apparently marks her as un-warm, or perhaps
            un-generous, in the film's emotional economy), hard-drinking, and,
            no surprise, lonely. Paula, still young and rebellious (at least in
            her own mind), isn't quite so immersed in corporate culture, but
            she's a natural, both enraged and wily enough to hold her own
            against anyone in that environment. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Full
            of as-yet unfocused cruelty, Paula becomes an object lesson for
            Julie, who is, in the midst of her supposed triumph, looking for a
            reason not to live the life she's living. Or, more precisely, she's
            looking for a way to test herself, now that she's found her own
            judgment to be so disastrously defective. Coming across Paula later
            that evening in the hotel bar, Julie feels guilty and buys her a
            drink, then offers to put Paula up in the hotel with her company
            card. On their way down to the pool in the elevator, the women find
            themselves surrounded by men in suits: Paula starts a game,
            apologizing to Julie for... &quot;you know.&quot; As the guys eye
            them, Paula sighs, &quot;I just wasn't in the mood.&quot; Julie
            takes the challenge, suggesting that Paula's racist because she was
            afraid of the <i>black</i> dildo. Ding: arriving at their floor, the
            women exit, pleased that they've so easily titillated these foolish
            men. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">From
            here, the movie traces their bonding process: they drink together in
            the hotel bar with a series of anonymous men, until Paula, absent
            briefly for an unsatisfying make-out session with some finesse-less
            creep, returns to their table to find Julie flirting with Nick. Here
            the movie abandons potential complexities for stereotypes. Paula
            might be jealous of Julie or Nick or even of their easy-seeming
            relationship (they know each other professionally, but hardly trust
            one another -- here they are, as always, performing to get what they
            want). The women retire to Julie's room, where Paula accuses Nick of
            date-raping<o:p>
            a
            friend of hers back in college. When he shows up at the door, drunk
            and stupid, the women decide to teach him something, though they're
            not sure what.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Paula
            administers a knock-out dose of Julie's valium, which leaves Nick
            quite out of the film's central action -- the women working out
            their own anxieties and competitions over his comatose body. Julie
            and Paula then get serious with one another, testing the limits of
            their new friendship: Julie observes, &quot;It is all about
            trust,&quot; but it's not really. It's about power and fear, which
            are in the same ballpark as trust, but more difficult to own.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            women are canny enough to move Nick out of Julie's room before they
            do anything, dragging him to a section of the hotel that is -- so
            symbolically --under construction. Surrounded by plastic coversheets
            and unfinished boards, Julie and Paula strip him to his boxers (why
            they stop here is not so clear), then write nasty words on him while
            pressing each other's obvious buttons: Julie accuses Paula of being
            privileged and apathetic, Paula accuses Julie of being a lonely old
            lady; Paula dares Julie to touch Nick's dick, to pose for a photo
            with the body, and then, to kiss her.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">These
            last moments are clearly unnerving for Julie, but the film never
            makes clear why they are, since she is, after all, a self-aware,
            tough chick who is comfortable in a mostly un-self-aware, tough
            world. Paula apparently introduces the chance Julie will be
            &quot;caught&quot; or that she'll do something she hasn't done
            before. But what is the real risk here? Paula suggests that Julie
            may be: a) unhappy with her life and b) interested in girls, but how
            can either of these be new ideas, to Julie, or to viewers? In fact,
            none of this all-night exchange is so wayward or alarming as the
            movie seems to think it is. Though, I must say that Nick's
            unconsciousness through it all is a nice touch: he is an appropriate
            emblem of what ails the women, a cocky fellow who is also ragingly
            irrelevant. Paula's ostensible insight about women in business --
            &quot;We express issues of doubt and control differently&quot; -- is
            lost: these women reflect and even emulate the men they despise and
            envy. This in itself is hardly a trite observation (it's actually
            quite sad), but the film sets it up like it's a revelation, rather
            than a point of departure. <i>The Business of Strangers</i> doesn't
            press on to any of the more dangerous questions it hints at: Paula's
            performance never reveals anything you don't presume about her, and
            Julie learns precisely what you think she will.<o:p>
