            is the Farrelly brothers' idea of a family movie, and it's one that
            contains two scenes that I'd be reluctant to let any children of
            mine see (one involves upchucking, the other a pimple, and both are
            shown in all their perfectly reviling glory).</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Bill Murray plays Frank, a zoo
            attendant who has allowed himself to go completely to pot, from
            consuming a steady diet of junk food to lax personal hygiene habits,
            all to the perpetual consternation of his young adolescent daughter
            (charmingly played by Elena Franklin), who chides him regularly but
            loves him anyway.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Frank, though, is actually a
            secondary character, the basis for the teeming City of Frank, the
            anthropomorphic realization of how all the myriad systems of the
            human body work together to keep itself functioning. Osmosis Jones
            is a white blood cell who talks and acts like a rogue police cop,
            and is assigned to work various details depending on what favor he
            is in at the time. He's working tartar control on Frank's gum line
            when a mysterious, sinister invader shows up, looking like one of
            the more cosmic villains in a <i>Fantastic Four</i> adventure.
            &quot;Be careful, I'm contagious,&quot; he growls, as he extends one
            talon-like fingertip that causes a fissure of fiery inflammation to
            crack-open and explode wherever it touches.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Lawrence Fishburne provides the
            perfectly malevolent voice for this character, while Chris Rock does
            the wonderfully cheery, get-down cadences for Osmosis, who, as in
            any number of cop dramas seen in recent years, gets paired up to
            work with an unlikely partner: Drix, a souped-up cold medication who
            confidently blitzes various germs and bacteria (and is voiced, in
            another perfect match-up, by David Hyde Pierce).</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Piet Kroon and Tom Sito directed
            the animated sequences which depict that action inside Frank's body,
            and, with the exception of a couple of C.G.I. and digital effects,
            it is all hand-drawn and looks all the better for it. It's also more
            inspired, and appealing, than what's going on outside. The
            live-action sequences, which are filmed in a haze of brown (I
            suspect the usually ace cinematographer Mark Irwin was goaded along
            with cries of, &quot;Use more filters! Make it look dirtier!&quot;),
            seem to become more grimy and greasy-looking as the movie goes
            along, and they become increasingly harder to watch. Bill Murray
            seems to be comfortable playing-down to expectations, happily
            opening his mouth to show the audience whatever half-chewed debris
            may still be floating around in there. Chris Elliott, with long
            stringy hair, shows up as Frank's beer-swilling buddy, and Molly
            Shannon makes a couple of appearances as a school teacher whom Frank
            humiliated in public -- she peers at him through dorky-looking
            eyeglasses, scrunches up her nose, and then explodes into a tizzy of
            indignation and disgust. That's pretty much all that the movie
            requires her to do. (At least she doesn't have to launch
            body-slamming kicks at people, like Renée Zellweger had to do in <i>Me,
            Myself and Irene</i>, but the filmmakers still manage to find some
            way to work against the natural charm of their lead actress.)<o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While the animated sequences of <i>Osmosis
            Jones</i> are worth saving for posterity, the live-action sequences
            directed by the Farrellys are another matter. Do they really think
            that people out there in the big, wide, wonderful world are as
            one-dimensional and malodorous as the characters they keep depicting
            in their films? They could end up blitzing themselves like the cold
            germs that are blitzed by Drax in this film.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
