            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 14 December 2001</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In <i>Vanilla Sky</i>, Tom Cruise
            plays David Aames, Jr., a brash young publisher who is wealthy,
            successful, and very sure of himself, and who takes things much too
            lightly (as evidenced by one of his enterprises, a glossy magazine
            that resembles <i>Maxim</i>). As he leaves to go to work in the
            morning, Cruise's character stops, looks to one side before
            embarking into the street and the outside world, as if checking to
            see if someone is going to run up to him and say, no, you're not
            suppose to be having another perfect day in a perfect life, there's
            been a mistake. No one stops him, though, and from his expression he
            knows there won't be, but, after getting that verification, he
            begins. It's a very nice touch to open the movie on.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The girl whom he is seeing, Julie
            (Cameron Diaz), does not take things lightly. In fact, she causes
            David, to become both hideously disfigured and permanently injured
            in ways that not even the best surgeons and specialists can set
            right, and he then becomes a psychological wreck as well. Reality
            also begins to change on him in insidious ways. Cameron Crowe, who
            wrote and directed the film, signals from the start that something
            is amiss beneath the surface -- we see David in detention, speaking
            to a psychiatrist (Kurt Russell, looking very studious) who treats
            him as if he were insane, and since the story is being told from
            David's point of view, we begin to wonder if the events as related
            on the screen are what really occurred, or the product of David's
            physical and emotional trauma. Shortly before he is disfigured,
            David meets and falls for the lovely<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Sofia (Penélope Cruz), whom he effortlessly wins away from
            his friend Brian (scraggly Jason Lee). After he's disfigured, Sofia
            keeps changing places with Julie -- at one point, Sofia acts as if
            she and David were never intimately acquainted&nbsp;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The fluctuations and ellipses are
            explained away by a curveball thrown in the film's last half-hour --
            having to do with &quot;designer&quot; realities, complete with tech
            support, in the form of a deferential, rather sepulchral-looking,
            Noah Taylor -- but this is essentially a story about how a man finds
            himself, &quot;waking up&quot; so that he can become a better
            person, and how he then carries on with his life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Casting Tom Cruise, who is one of the most photogenic
            personalities around right now and who is very muscularly-defined
            for the film, as a character who lets damage to his outer self
            affect his internal self is not a bad idea. But Cruise plays David
            with too much emphasis on the arch, florid way in which he handles
            everything in life, and the character comes off as a bit too smarmy.
            His self-infatuation and mockery may be entertaining at first, but
            it comes at the expense of showing us<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>whatever worthier self<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>may
            lie underneath, waiting to be salvaged, and without that David, and
            Cruise, just seems to be show-boating through much of the action, as
            he, literally, descends into the puddles and the gutter.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I can't say that the pairing of
            Cruise and Cruz is exactly volcanic, either. In fact, it's something
            of a dud: they speak softly to each other, gaze into each other's
            eyes, and as they flirt and twinkle their way along, the movie
            flops-over into a swoon. There is also a curious amount of smiling,
            or, rather, baring of teeth, which, after a while, looks less like
            romancing than flinching.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Cameron Crowe based the movie on
            the 1997 film, <b><i>Abre los Ojos</i></b> (<i>Open Your Eyes</i>),
            which was directed by Alejandro Amenábar, who was responsible this
            year for the exquisite ghost story <i>The Others</i>. <i>Vanilla Sky</i>
            has some painfully obvious business involving David wearing, or
            carrying around, a smooth latex mask, which looks like something out
            of a Laura Branagan music video. (The &quot;real&quot; man can't
            show himself.) On the other hand, the film also contains some
            stunning visual coups, including an evocation of an early Bob Dylan
            album cover, and a brilliantly put-together montage which makes
            unexpectedly effective use of passages from two song recordings, one
            by the Monkees, the other by Todd Rundgren. (The film's title comes
            from a song written by Paul McCartney.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And that brings us, again, to the
            ending, which is either going to wow people or infuriate them beyond
            belief. David has to choose between staying still or starting a new
            life. The best thing to do would be to choose the adventurousness of
            living -- it's more brave and affirming, because of all the
            possibilities inherent. Instead, David chooses -- or, in fact, has
            already chosen -- a solution which is so far-flung as to scale the
            whole movie down to the point of insignificance. After all the
            gimcrackery, <i>Vanilla Sky</i> ends up telling us, yeah, life is
            fine, as long as you have, say, a really good alarm clock stashed in
            case of emergencies.</font>
