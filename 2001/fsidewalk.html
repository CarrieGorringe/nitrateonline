Interview with Edward Burns<br>
</font></span><i><font size="1" face="Verdana">interview by 
<a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 23 November 2001</font></i></p>


<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700"><font size="2">He looks 
like a movie star. Eddie Burns is wearing his hair cropped short, black 
open-necked shirt and slacks. He looks sleek, and a couple of people stop to 
notice him in the Four Seasons restaurant. But he's something of a paradox, too, 
or at least in some conflict. Burns thinks of himself as a filmmaker who acts to 
finance his real job. I've met with him a few times now, to talk about films 
that he's made at different points in his life. In 2001, he's not so wound up as 
he was when he was promoting is first feature, <i>The Brothers McMullen</i> 
(1995), but rather, more self-conscious. But he's still a considerate, friendly 
guy. A guy you'd probably like in real life.</font></span><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">I'm talking to him two days 
after Flight 587 fell out of the sky onto a neighborhood he says is just &quot;five 
minutes&quot; from where his Queens-based family has spent vacation time. It's hard 
not to talk about recent events with Burns, who is quietly, but obviously, 
shaken. His life has been affected variously, including the postponement of his 
wedding to fellow New Yorker Christy Turlington, and the opening of his new 
film, <i>Sidewalks of New York</i>. A faux-documentary about six major 
characters in love and out, the film is part Woody Allen, part Max Ophuls, and 
all Burns, in its obvious affection for the city. We begin by talking about one 
of the film's quirkiest aspects, its soundtrack.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Cynthia Fuchs: </font>
</span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">What inspired 
you to score <i>Sidewalks</i> with lyric-less Cake songs? </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Edward Burns: </font>
</span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">That's pretty 
cool, huh? I'd been a big fan of the music, because it's such a different sound, 
with the horns that they use, and I thought, stripped of lyrics, this would be 
great as a movie score. We were editing the film, and since we made it for under 
a million dollars, we had no money for a composer. So I took one of their albums 
and pulled little pieces of instrumental, cut it to a bunch of scenes, sent that 
to John McCray (in the band), and asked him if the idea interested them at all. 
He said, &quot;Seems pretty cool.&quot; They sent us the tapes and we basically did needle 
drops. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Was this different 
from scoring your other movies? </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">EB: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">On <i>McMullen</i>, we 
sort of did the same thing, we took prerecorded music and did needle drops, 
found a spot in the tune, and did rough fade-ins and fade-outs. The great thing 
about music is, you just experiment. The song you think is going to be a 
disaster turns out to be perfect. There's one scene in particular, when I'm at 
the video store with Rosario Dawson [as Maria], and we're wanting the same video 
and looking at each other. When we laid that piece of music against picture, the 
shifts in the music hit the cuts exactly. It was as if they wrote it for the 
scene. So that gave us the faith to try other stuff. Someone once gave me this 
theory that creative work has a certain cadence or tempo, and even if a piece of 
music wasn't written for a certain piece of film, occasionally they have the 
same cadence. Who knows if that's true? But it's a cool theory.&nbsp; </font></span>
</p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">How did you come to 
the documentary interview structure? </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">EB: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">It came to me, 
basically, on the set of <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>. We were all young guys, 
hanging out, trading war stories about relationships, things that had gone 
wrong. I thought it would be interesting to do a film about what happens when 
people come together and apart, the screw-ups that can happen, rather than the 
romantic comedy, which examines it all coming together beautifully. I started 
working on that, on the set. Then, we were scheduled to shoot <i>Ryan</i> in 
sixty-six days and we wrapped in fifty-eight, because Spielberg was using 
handheld cameras and available light. I'm sitting in a foxhole one day thinking, 
&quot;I make these low budget, independent films. If I could adopt this style, I'd 
cut my schedules in half and budget down to nothing. That means I maintain 
creative control.&quot; And because of that, I can get Stanley Tucci to work, because 
he's only here for two days. Dennis Farina worked one day, Heather Graham worked 
five days. It was a way to get a great cast even though I had no money. And 
pseudo-documentaries are the cheapest thing to shoot: stick somebody on a corner 
with a camera, and get it in one take. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">How was that for 
actors, the one-take approach? </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">EB: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">If they didn't get the 
line right, we'd do another take, but really, while seventy-five percent of the 
interviews were scripted, the rest was improvised. We interviewed everybody 
three different times, in different locations. I told the actors there would be 
one set of interviews done before the crew followed your character around with 
cameras, the second during that time, and the third, a couple of weeks after the 
crew had left your character. That way we could have different perspectives. And 
during those three interviews, I told them, we'll ask questions that aren't in 
the script, so just answer them in character. That makes it feel as authentic as 
possible. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">We also didn't hire a 
production designer, and only shot on locations that already existed. The 
location manager found apartments that would match the characters. So we'd rent 
apartments from people and use their beds and their sheets and their bathrooms. 
And the thing that was great about that is I could work against [that idea] 
where, whether it's a television show like <i>Friends</i> or a movie like <i>
Autumn in New York</i>, you always see apartments that nobody could afford. I 
make movies and I can't afford the place that you see a waitress living in. Even 
Katz's Deli: we couldn't afford to close that place down for a day, so they 
said, &quot;Look, for the money you have, you can have six tables.&quot; So they're open 
for business and we're shooting. It was definitely a new way of shooting a movie 
for me, and I hadn't directed a movie since <i>No Looking Back</i>, which was 
the worst experience. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">I spoke with you when 
you were promoting <i>15 Minutes</i> [in which Burns co-starred with Robert De 
Niro], and you described that as the opposite of what you wanted to direct, at 
that point. </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">EB: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">You know, acting in <i>
15 Minutes</i> was fun, but when I got off that set, I was hungry to do what I 
love to do. I was trying to get this other film made, <i>On the Job</i>, this 
sort of epic, Irish American movie, but we need about $30 million, and we just 
couldn't get the money. And so I pulled this script for <i>Sidewalks</i> out of 
the drawer and showed it to my producer. I met her January 20th, and we were 
shooting by February 23rd. And that day, it was sixty-two degrees in New York; 
the day before it had been thirty degrees. Everything just kind of fell our way. 
It was one of those things that doesn't happen in the movie business. And I was 
able to hire friends who don't have agents. Whereas, when you're working with a 
studio, they say, &quot;Get the guy off <i>That '70s Show</i>.&quot;&nbsp; </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">What's your sense of 
how the movie works differently, after the 11th, than how you initially 
envisioned it?</font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">EB: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">It's tough for me, 
because I'm so close to all of it, the film and the event. I live eight blocks 
from the World Trade Center and was there when it happened. You hear people 
talking around the country about New York, which was a city that a lot of people 
maybe didn't love to embrace. And now, you're hearing all these people who are 
pro-New York, even rooting for the Yankees, when before they wouldn't dream of 
doing that. But while other movies set in New York have been successful, like <i>
When Harry Met Sally...</i>, this one is <i>about</i> real New Yorkers, in a way 
that those movies aren't. And people seem to have a new interest in who New 
Yorkers are. I'll be interested to read or hear what people think about the 
movie, based on the &quot;post-eleven point of view.&quot; </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF: </font></span>
</i></b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Sidewalks</font></span></i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
takes on class differences -- most obviously in the &quot;bridge and tunnel&quot; speech 
that Tommy makes. How is that important for you? </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">EB: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">What I wanted to do 
was look at as many different types of New Yorkers as I could, that I thought I 
knew well enough to portray accurately. So, of the six characters, five come 
from different boroughs, everybody is a different ethnicity, and I have the one 
out-of-towner, [Ashley], played by Brittany Murphy. I wanted to play with the 
idea that, as different as they all are, everybody's looking for the same thing. 
Originally, that scene where I'm talking to Heather [playing Annie], about being 
a &quot;bridge and tunnel&quot; kid, was about bragging rights, wearing where you come 
from as a badge of honor. Now, though, that scene feels different, as the 
character talks about how his dad helped build the city, how his dad was a cop. 
But it's too soon. Maybe a year or two from now, with more perspective, we can 
look back on it and see what it means. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">I've read somewhere 
that, because you do so much on your films -- writing, directing, acting -- you 
become an &quot;easy target.&quot; It's a lot of responsibility, but obviously you embrace 
it in some way. </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">EB: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">You can't worry about 
what your critics are going to say. I've stopped reading them, because they can 
be just too painful. Woody Allen said once that he stopped reading reviews 
because &quot;I'm not the idiot they say I am and I'm not the genius they say I am.&quot; 
For me, starting as a writer, I wanted to direct only to maintain control over 
what I'd written. And the acting was an extension of that too. I don't want 
someone else to make a decision about something I've written and that I care 
about. If I wrote an action script, I wouldn't feel the need to control every 
aspect of that. But I'm not doing those films. It's important to me that music 
like Cake's is used in my film. I don't really write about my life; my point of 
view comes through, and I'll use my background as a backdrop, the neighborhood I 
live in, but I rarely pull something from my experiences. Maybe I'm not brave 
enough, or, maybe I want my friends and family to continue talking to me. </font>
</span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">You've done a lot of 
work in a short time. How has your understanding of what's possible for you to 
do in this business has changed? </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">EB: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">There are two parts to 
that. In the beginning, when I started out, I had no intention of acting at all; 
I wanted to make one film a year, to stay in New York. But when the second film 
[<i>She's the One</i>] came out, it got beaten up a lot, people said it didn't 
&quot;fulfill the promise of <i>Brothers McMullen</i>,&quot; or, &quot;It's too much like <i>
Brothers McMullen</i>. Now, <i>I</i> never said that I was going to top Orson 
Welles on my second time out. I always said, I wanted to make small films while 
I learned how to do this. I had never been on a movie set before. For <i>
McMullen</i>, we had a three-man crew. And when I was given money to direct a 
real movie, I knew I should stay close to home, and thought, &quot;Don't f*ck this 
up, because if you screw this one up, they won't let you make number three.&quot; 
It's different for guys coming up through the indie world, because our first 
films are made on credit cards and student loans, with untrained actors. You're 
not really learning how to make movies there, you're experimenting, and some of 
us get lucky. It's not like coming up in the commercial world, or the old studio 
system. For us, it's smart to take it easy, do what Rick Linklater is doing now. 
We have to learn our craft, and for me, that's not just as a director, but also 
as a screenwriter. It's not something you're instantly great at, at least in 
most cases. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">So my whole plan for my 
career was to take it slowly, to gradually increase my budgets and my canvases. 
Right now, I'm a little frustrated because I'm trying to get <i>On the Job</i> 
made. I want to work with a more substantial budget. I've made five now, for a 
combined budget of $12 million. I'm ready to graduate to that next level. </font>
</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">And the other thing is 
that, on the third film [<i>No Looking Back</i>], we had such a hard time 
raising even $6 million, that I was advised to act in big Hollywood movies, 
because that way your name means more and we'll have an easier time raising the 
money and you'll have more creative control. That's how I started to act, and 
after <i>Ryan</i>, I think I got sidetracked. Not that I want to take any time 
back, but I moved out to LA and pursued it for two years, to become a movie 
star, and then make the movies I want to make. That didn't really happen either.
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">And then I had fun making
<i>Sidewalks</i>, making a well-crafted film for such a low budget, compared to 
the really tough time I had on <i>No Looking Back</i>, with the studio 
suggesting changes. They weren't terrible in any way, but it was a level of 
collaboration that I wasn't comfortable with, for that relatively small budget. 
So where I've come to is this: if can keep making my movies at the $1-2-3 
million levels, I'll never work with a studio again. It's not worth it. At the 
same time, I'm also really antsy to make the bigger budget film, and I'm ready 
to collaborate on that side. It doesn't make any sense to make a movie between 
$4 and 15 million. At fifteen, they're paying you to collaborate. </font></span>
</p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">What did your 
experience on <i>15 Minutes</i> tell you about that &quot;level of collaboration&quot;?</font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">EB: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">I know I'm not an 
irresponsible filmmaker. You see money on bigger budget films being spent 
unnecessarily. I know that would never go on on my set, because I'd rather put 
that money up on the screen. But at the same time, there are certain things that 
go along with making films at that level, the toys you get to play with. I've 
had one crane in all my movies. I've never had a Steadi-Cam, and no actor on any 
of my films has ever had his own trailer. These are things you take for granted 
on other films. It's fun, but at some point, you wanna see what they're doing 
over on the other side. You do get to work at a more leisurely pace, and get 
access to locations that I can't get access to. I've never had a scene with more 
than ten extras, other than Katz's Deli, where they weren't extras. [Laughs].</font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">How did you decide on 
the handheld camera and jump cuts? They seem particularly New York-ish. </font>
</span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">EB: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">I wish I could take 
credit for the jump cuts. I can take credit for knowing to hire a documentary 
editor, this guy named David Greenwald. The first day, we're doing the handheld, 
but also shooting traditional coverage, wide shots, medium shots, but all 
handheld. Now, when you cut on an Avid, you cut what you shoot the next day. So 
David shows me the scene, and it looks great. Then he says, let me show you 
something else. And he basically took one of the master shots, cut that with 
jump cuts, so it appeared that it was one camera in the room, like a documentary 
crew with one or two cameras. I said, &quot;That is cool.&quot; So we changed the style of 
shooting on the third day. We stopped doing traditional coverage and just shot 
with one or two cameras, knowing we'd use the jump cuts, and that worked 
seamlessly. It gives the movie a different sort of energy and rhythm, butting 
one line up against another, or a facial reaction up against a line. There are 
great, sort of unintentional, unsaid moments in the film now, because of that. 
And New York is so kinetic and frantic, and the jump cuts do give it that 
energy. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">That raises another 
question: as a writer, you create characters with what they say, often. In this 
movie, there's so much that was not said. </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">EB: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">I love dialogue-driven 
films, but when I reread my scripts, much more so recently, there's a 
redundancy. I seem to not give the audience enough credit at times with my 
earlier stuff, and so now, I try to find the moments that say it without 
[speaking] it, which is hard. The best thing for a screenwriter to do, is to get 
into an editing room, because that's the last rewrite. That's where you 
discover, &quot;We don't need that scene.&quot; It's a different language, and audiences 
get things, so you don't really need to articulate everything for them. Being in 
the editing room has definitely made me a better screenwriter, because I want to 
avoid the costly mistakes of shooting scenes you don't need. On a seventeen-day 
shoot, those two scenes take up a lot of time. And on a bigger film, if you can 
cut five scenes, at $200,000 apiece, you've saved a million dollars.&nbsp; </font>
</span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">But the system seems 
designed to perpetuate the overspending and the overtime. </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">EB: </font></span>
</i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">It's weird, but yes. I 
can't wait to get overpaid. </font></span></p>
