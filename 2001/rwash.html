            at Foot Locker just isn't cutting it for Sean (Dr. Dre). Maybe he has
            other aspirations, maybe not. But there's no doubt about the limits
            of Footlocker: The opening black-and-white still photo montage that
            opens D.J. Pooh's <i>The Wash</i> shows in painful detail the
            drudgery of working chain retail: stacking boxes, catering to snitty
            customers and an overbearing manager. By the time the credits are
            over, Sean has moved on. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            first step is to go home, to the apartment he shares with Dee Loc
            (Snoop Dogg). They spend a pleasant evening with a couple of ladies,
            after a brief run-in with a fellow holding a gun to Sean's head and
            a brief interruption by the LAPD, who, after waving away the smoke
            from their faces, warn Dee and Sean to turn down their very loud
            music. (They turn it up, point being, po-po are useless.) Next
            morning, Dee sends Sean down to the car wash where he works (and
            sells weed on the side). Sean applies for the assistant manager's
            position, and Mr. Washington (George Wallace) is so impressed with
            his quiet demeanor and apparent seriousness, that he makes Sean
            Dee's boss. Tensions arise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Much
            like director D.J. Pooh's 1995 breakout feature, <i>Friday</i>, <i>The
            Wash</i> is short on plot, long on silliness. While the film
            obviously nods to Michael Schultz and Joel Schumacher's 1976
            power-to-the-people classic, <i>Car Wash</i>, it lacks that film's
            class-analytical bite. In fact, <i>The Wash</i> appears not to have
            much at all on its mind. You get the sense that Dre and Snoop,
            longtime collaborators, got some of their friends together and had a
            really good time on the set, making shit up as they went along. This
            crew includes Pooh veteran Tiny Lister as Dee's amiable co-worker;
            Bruce Bruce as a donut-eating toy cop; Shaquille O'Neal, Ludacris,
            and Xzibit as angry customers; and Dre protégé Eminem as Chris,
            recently fired car-washer who spends most of the movie threatening
            Washington by phone, then hooting maniacally, all alone in his
            red-themed bedroom. This doesn't look like much of a stretch for the
            cartoonishly psycho Slim Shady, but perhaps it's good practice for
            playing himself in the upcoming movie based on his life. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Whatever
            this mad dog Chris has going on, it's not much connected to the rest
            of the film anyway. Then again, nothing in the film is much
            connected to anything else in it (not unlike the incoherent
            scene-by-scene organization of <i>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's
            Stone</i>). Dee and Sean have to work out their beef, and also try
            to make time with girls in tight tops, and meanwhile: Pauly Shore
            pops up in the trunk of a Mafioso's car, about to be murdered for
            sleeping with someone's sister, and okay, no one cares. Sean comes
            up with a surefire way to draw customers, girls in bikinis wiping
            down cars in the front lot. Eye-rolling cashier Antoinette (Angell
            Conwell) watches some <i>106th &amp; Park</i> on the TV. Mr.
            Washington is kidnapped by a couple of homeboys (Shawn Fonteno and
            Pooh -- or, as the <i>New York Times</i> refers to him, Mr. Pooh),
            who get way too mad when the self-inflated boss-man chases them off
            his property. <o:p>

            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Given
            that the film is opening the same week as <i>Harry Potter</i>, it's
            pretty much guaranteed to disappear quickly from theaters; it will
            also likely do fine on video/dvd, owing to its hiphop star-sightings
            factor, and its <i>Friday</i>-like affection for good-natured smoke
            jokes. And if <i>The Wash</i> lacks <i>Friday</i>'s audacious
            freshness (not to mention Chris Tucker), it does offer a few funny
            moments, owing to its stars' palpable low-key chemistry: Snoop makes
            an excellent Mean Face, snarling as he guns his fantastically
            acrobatic low-rider's engine, and Dre affects a weirdly believable
            haplessness. I'm not sure what to make of the smelly toilet jokes
            (brought on by Sean's inexplicable downing of a cheesesteak
            burrito), except that they demonstrate Dre's usual ability to make
            fun of himself (for a sharper poke, see Eminem's &quot;Guilty
            Conscience&quot;). <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            broader question that, if not exactly raised by <i>The Wash</i>,
            might be extracted from it, has to do with the means by which young
            black male artists find their way into the film business. While the
            music industry is open enough to black male performers who strike
            pseudo-threatening, thuggish poses (and has adjusted its marketing
            strategies accordingly, so the executives are making tons of money
            off acts with increasingly short half-lives), and television has
            long been comfortable with raunchy comedians (at least on the
            non-major networks), the movie industry has a particular structure
            in place, and there's no breaking in if you don't play by the rules.
            And even if you do play by the rules, if you're a young black male
            actor, you're more often than not relegated to familiar
            &quot;types,&quot; no matter your range or talent: see Mekhi Phifer,
            Omar Epps, the aforementioned Chris Tucker, even Chris Rock, whose
            increasingly open conservatism is earning him increasing access to
            wherever it is he wants to be. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Self-mocking
            comedy has always been the quickest way for outsiders to get inside,
            of course. Dre and Snoop's current venture, like the upcoming <i>How
            High</i>, featuring another famous pair of hiphop pals, Redman and
            Method Man, both mocks and confirms the public impression of their
            relationship (in this case, diehard loyalty, good fun, laid-back
            rivalry), while leaving invisible the obvious hard work and
            intellectual activity that goes into their art (in addition to the
            albums and the clothing lines, they have put together a
            studio-distributed movie, not an easy thing to do). There are surely
            reasons for this -- hard work is an establishment value best
            repudiated, the non-threatening black man gets paid -- and given
            current cultural circumstances, rocking boats is no way to get over,
            if that's what you're interested in doing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            still. Even if it's not surprising, it's at least a little
            disappointing that <i>The Wash</i>, released almost twenty-five
            years after <i>Car Wash</i>, is revisiting the earlier film's
            concerns (unemployment and minimum wage labor, neighborhood
            violence, racism, booty-chasing) without much changed in terms of
            what's at stake, who cares, and how to cope. Underclass and working
            class existence is indeed much the same as it was so many years ago.
            And while such existence conveys upon a hiphop artist immediate
            cred,. It's good to have fun, especially when you can afford it. <o:p>
