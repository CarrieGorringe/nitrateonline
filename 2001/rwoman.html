            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In the second of the three
            stories which make up <i>The Day I Became a Woman</i>, a young
            Iranian woman, Ahoo (Shabnam Toloui), bicycles furiously alongside
            many other women, their black <i>chadour</i> billowing behind them
            like kites, down a winding path which borders the ocean, taking them
            from high cliffs down to sea level and back again. And all sorts of
            men show up trying to stop Ahoo as she pedals along her way. There's
            her husband, who arrives, on horseback, and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>tries everything from reminding her that cycling isn't good
            for her bad leg to threatening to divorce her. He turns up later
            with a local <i>mullah</i>, who also beseeches Ahoo to stop what
            she's doing, to no avail. (The divorce, it turns out, can be
            performed on the spot.) Then Ahoo's brothers and father take their
            turn at bullying her. But still she continues onward, even though it
            is clearly a physical and emotional exertion.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Is she, along with the other women,
            taking part in some sort of cycling competition? Are we watching an
            allegorical fantasy, or reality? As it turns out, we can interpret
            the sequence either way. The symbolism is obvious: the men, on
            horseback, represent the arcane, while the women, on their
            efficient, smooth-running riding machines, are quite modern. And
            always out in front, there is one Iranian girl who pedals along,
            unperturbed, in traditional dress but listening to music on a set of
            headphones, either indifferent or oblivious to what is going on
            behind her.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The sequence carries unexpected
            power, though. For one thing, you may not realize until well into
            the episode (which is over twenty-six minutes in length) that
            everyone in it is constantly in motion. (Something I can't recall
            seeing employed in anything since Zbigniew Rybczynski used it for a
            Depeche Mode music video in the 'Eighties.) Also, there is a
            combination of striving and purity in the face of actress Shabnam
            Toloui---she looks like someone who deserves to achieve whatever
            simple goal she's attempting to reach. When she lowers her foot
            towards the ground, at one point, as if she were going to come to a
            stop, I found myself, if not gasping, than taking an unexpected
            intake of breath. She isn't going to give-up after all, is she...?
            But, no, she's just slowing down so that she can shift into a lower
            gear on her bike, without interrupting her progress. The episode
            itself ends on a deliberately ambiguous, but haunting, note, with
            the camera gliding, like the characters, along its own way, while
            the people whom we were watching become smaller and smaller until
            they're indistinguishable from the rough and mostly barren
            landscape.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film was directed by Marzieh
            Meshkini from a screenplay written by her husband, the celebrated
            Iranian filmmaker Mohsen Makhmalbaf; their daughter, Samira
            Makhmalbaf, has, at age twenty-one, already completed two feature
            films, while this is Meshkini's first. In the film's opening story,
            a young girl (Fatemeh Cheragh Ahktar, who is enchanting) is about to
            have her ninth birthday, upon which she will enter womanhood and
            will no longer be allowed to interact freely with men. Having been
            born at noon, she given the time up until then to pay one last visit
            to a young boy who has been her playmate, all the while diligently
            marking the time. The third story follows another woman, this one
            very old (Azizeh Seddighi), who's first seen disembarking in a
            wheelchair from an airliner in the city of Kish, after which
            itinerant boys wheel her all over the place, through ultra-modern
            shopping malls where mannequins, and shoppers, wear up-to-date
            Western-style clothing, as she buys all the things she says she's
            always wanted in life but never had a chance to get---everything
            from furniture to appliances and tableware. Since she does not have
            a house in town, everything ends up parked on a beach. The episode's
            closing image could have come from the best of Fellini: the boys use
            rafts made of oil drums strapped-together to float the old woman's
            new possessions out to sea, while the woman herself rides grandly on
            her own raft, bobbing amid all her newfound luxuries.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While it may be asking too much to
            expect the same rich emotional panoply that Satyajit Ray could evoke
            from something as simple as a family riding down the road on their
            horsedrawn wagon in <i>Pather Panchali</i>, it would be great to
            report that <i>The Day I Became a Woman</i> is a success, but it
            falls short of that. Each of the film's stories turn out to be built
            on one idea, which is then developed...just...a...litttle...bit, and
            that's all. The stories end up seeming less than anecdotal. We never
            find out, for example, exactly what the bicycling race means to Ahoo
            in the second episode, and when the old woman in the third episode
            demands that a transparent glass teapot that she purchased be
            returned to the store from which it came forthwith because it's
            &quot;naked&quot;, it registers only as a quaint joke.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Iran has experienced a whirlwind of
            change over the last twenty years, from rule under the Shaw to a
            strict Islamic Fundamentalist regime and, now, a society where Islam
            is being challenged by a growing women's movement demanding more
            freedoms. Meshkini and Makhmalbaf made <i>The Day I Became a Woman</i>
            as three short films, so they could technically get around possible
            government censorship, even though the move denied them access to
            government-controlled film stock and equipment. This may have been
            one of the reasons why the stories in the film were kept
            &quot;small&quot;, but the filmmakers may also have thought that
            emotional and dramatic resonance would come in and fill up some of
            the space. That doesn't really happen. For better or worse, we are
            left wanting to find out more, not less, about the people who see in
            the film.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><u></o:p>
