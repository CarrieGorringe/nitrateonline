            Thermopolis (Anne Hathaway) is a frizzy-haired,
            thick-glasses-wearing high schooler. (And let's not even get into
            the traumas that must be incurred by that last name.) She feels
            awkward and alienated at her private school, frustrated that the boy
            she likes, a beautiful jock named Josh (Erik von Detten), doesn't
            seem to know she's alive, and miserable that the most popular girl
            in school, the dominant cheerleader-bitch Lana (MTV teen-talk-show
            hostess, Noxzema spokesgirl, and singer Mandy Moore), treats her
            like dirt from another planet. In other words, Mia feels a lot like
            most girls in high school. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Or
            so you're supposed to think. In fact, there's nothing ordinary about
            Mia, nothing that remotely resembles most girls in high school,
            starting with the fact that she lives in an extraordinary San
            Francisco &quot;space&quot; with her single mom, an apparently
            independently wealthy artist named Helen (Caroline Goodall). You're
            introduced to their amazing former firehouse of a home during the
            opening credits sequence, under new-girl-on-the-pop-block Krystal's
            lively first single, &quot;Supergirl.&quot; Mia prepares to face her
            day, donning her uniform, gathering her books, and sliding down a
            fireman's pole from her loft to the humungous
            kitchen-dining-room-living-room area. She says bye to mom and meets
            her best friend, budding environmental activist Lilly Moscovitz (the
            superb Heather Matarazzo, who has not nearly enough to do in this
            film), whereupon the girls ride their scooters to school, up and
            down the SF hills. All in all, it looks like Mia's got a fine life
            for a girl who thinks she's an irredeemable outcast. </font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And
            then the conventional and improbably premise of Garry (Beaches)
            Marshall's <i>The Princess Diaries </i>kicks in, which might be
            understood as a confirmation of the all right-ness of Mia's life so
            far, or an argument that it needs serious improvement. Mia gets a
            letter from her grandmother announcing that she is coming to visit,
            in itself not a remarkable event, until you learn that grandma is
            Mary Poppins. Just kidding. But close: grandmother on her dead
            father's side is Queen Clarisse Renaldi (played by Mary Poppins,
            a.k.a. Julie Andrews), and, well, Mia is supposed to leave her SF
            life and head to (the make-believe country of) Genovia, in order to
            take her rightful place as heir to the throne. Needless to say, this
            bit of news throws a wrench in Mia's immediate plans, like passing
            history class. Or, as she puts it: &quot;I'm not ready to be a
            princess. I'm still waiting for normal body parts to arrive.&quot;
            But if Mia is at first properly horrified at this extraordinary turn
            of events, the film depends on her agreement to give it a try. And
            so, the deal is that she'll go through intensive princess
            &quot;training&quot; for a month, try out at a lavish state dinner,
            and then she and Clarisse will reevaluate.The training amounts to an
            elaborate makeover (where's Freddie Prinze Jr. when you need him?),
            during which Mia is reconditioned so that she will use the correct
            fork, walk with a book on her head, cross her ankles when she sits,
            speak proper English (as it appears that this is, conveniently, the
            language they speak in Genovia), and of course, have her appearance
            radically altered. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Among
            the many habits Mia must change is her too-teenish tendency to bob
            her head along with music on the radio (&quot;You're not a doggie on
            a dashboard!&quot; cries her alarmed grandma). Luckily, the
            behavioral transmutations are assisted by Clarisse's most trusted
            and charming servant, a limo driver named Joe (Hector Elizondo, who
            has now appeared in something like 300 Garry Marshall movies). He's
            got his act together: he can kowtow and bow his head with the most
            obsequious of Clarisse's roustabouts, but he has somehow earned her
            subtle respect as well. Joe's advice to Mia is inevitably practical
            and wise (&quot;No one can make you feel inferior,&quot; he intones,
            &quot;without your consent&quot;), and he even has a few pearls to
            bestow on the queen when she behaves too queenishly (and Elizondo is
            very likely the only actor on the planet who might have made this
            character watchable; he has an easy rhythm with Andrews and he's
            lovely with the kids). Because of Joe, Mia's etiquette instruction
            is slightly less offensive than it might have been. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Not
            so the beauty makeover, for which Clarisse taps a foo-foo fellow
            called Paolo (Larry Miller). He throws up his hands -- literally and
            often -- and immediately proclaims the impossibility of the task
            before him, decrying the poor girl's Groucho-meets-Brooke-Shields
            eyebrows and absolutely frightening hair. When she emerges from the
            miraculous process (aided by lipstick and mascara girls Gretchen and
            Helga -- whose names, alongside Paolo's and Joe's, imply that
            Genovia has a very rich cultural history indeed), Mia is
            transformed. Gone are the frizzy hair and thick glasses: the new and
            improved Mia is sleek and elegant, like she's just stepped off the
            cover of Cosmo Girl! <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            new look leads to predictable problems with Lilly (who thinks first,
            that Mia will abandon her and second, that Mia should take the
            princess job so she'll be in a position to help save the
            rainforests) and even more with Lilly's older brother Michael
            (Robert Schwartzman), who suddenly realizes that hey! Mia's, uh,
            like, really pretty. And oh yes, Lana: feeling threatened by a
            princess in her domain, she's very mean, and will have to learn a
            lesson about sharing with others. She also gets to sing about a
            minute of a song at a school function on the beach. While this
            abbreviated performance is obviously inserted for no other reason
            than the fact that Lana is played by Moore, it does make you wonder
            just whom the film is aimed at: most of the girls (and boys) who
            appreciate Moore will be bored to tears with the rest of this
            silliness. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Director
            Marshall says that he wanted to make a G movie that his
            granddaughters could see, that would, we might guess, provide the
            same sort of uplifting and girl-empowering message that his Pretty
            Woman did for so many Julia-wannabes a few years back (we might
            safely presume that no one wanted to be like anyone in Exit to
            Eden). Adapted from Meg Cabot's novel by Gina Wendkos (Coyote Ugly,
            which some folks might see as another girl's empowerment story), <i>The
            Princess Diaries </i>was produced by Whitney Houston's BrownHouse
            Productions, who are, according to their own press, all over this
            you-go-girl angle. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            problem is that the story in <i>The Princess Diaries</i> is
            distressingly out of date, especially in its quaint notions of what
            constitutes &quot;success&quot; or &quot;empowerment&quot; for
            girls. True, the film itself rather undermines this faith in
            straightened hair and contact lenses as means to power when Mia
            makes a big speech about her desires and limits while wearing not
            the gown she's supposed to be wearing, but a rain-soggy sweatshirt.
            But the many contrivances by which the film gets Mia to this point
            are tedious and wearying, even for supergirls. <o:p>
