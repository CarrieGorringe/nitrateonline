            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In <i>Legally Blonde</i>, Reese
            Witherspoon plays Elle, whose wonderful, pink, bubbly world,
            centered around the Delta Nu sorority house (whose location is never
            entirely identified in the film), suddenly comes crashing down when
            her boyfriend, Warner (Matthew Davis), announces that he's breaking
            up with her. Aspiring to go into politics, he wants to marry &quot;a
            Jackie, not a Marilyn,” and then packs himself off to Harvard Law
            School to get a degree. Elle, however, becomes undeterred by his
            opportunistic behavior, and goes right after him by entering the law
            school, too. LSAT scores of over 170 needed for enrollment? Piece of
            cake. And she gets a member of a famous filmmaking dynasty to create
            her &quot;enrollment video,” as well. The members of the law
            school's higher faculty can't help but let her in.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film itself, directed by Robert
            Luketic and adapted, by screenwriters Karen McCullah Lutz and
            Kirsten Smith, from a novel by Amanda Brown (which is described as
            being &quot;an anthropological study of the 'law student
            species'&quot;), starts out on a high note but turns formulaic and
            bends way too much to please the audience. Even Vivian (slack-jawed
            Selma Blair), the girl who is the chief rival for Warner's
            attentions, becomes one of Elle's friends and staunch-supporters,
            while the guy (Luke Wilson) who is obviously the right one for Elle
            is under her nose all the time. (Wilson brings a beautifully
            understated, courtly manner to the role that brings to mind the
            young Gary Cooper.) The film appears to have been massively reshot,
            sometimes to ill effect (Matthew Davis appears to be playing one
            type of character in the early scenes of the film, then another type
            entirely during the scenes at Harvard), and has a flood of
            post-production dubbing, some of which overly spells out points in
            the story that we have probably already figured out for ourselves.
            Wilson's character, Emmett, is even heard telling Elle that she
            should &quot;take&quot; her &quot;power&quot; -- the
            &quot;power&quot; of her blondness -- and &quot;channel it towards
            the greater good&quot;.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The movie still works, however,
            because Witherspoon, and the filmmakers, have zeroed in on what
            Elle's best qualities are: she may look spacey and sound spacey, but
            she's essentially good, fair-minded, and she doesn't play herself
            cheap. Helping a Cambridge beautician (Jennifer Coolidge) get a
            piece of valuable personal property back becomes something of great
            importance to Elle. She makes many friends in the process, and
            they're good friends, and you can see why Elle is appealing to them.
            Reese Witherspoon, who has been doing some brilliant work for years
            in many films, turns Elle into a resourceful, self-determined,
            indomitable radiance of light, and her characterization makes sense
            from top to bottom. Even her legal <b><i>coup de grace</i></b> near
            the end, where she exposes a criminal by using her thorough
            knowledge involving the dos and don'ts of hair permanents, seems
            positively, absolutely right.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
            world, it seems, could use more &quot;blonde power,” but, at least
            the way Reese Witherspoon personifies it, you can understand why.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
