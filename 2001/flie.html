<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Thirty-eight-year-old Michael Cuesta changed 
careers after a successful run as a commercials filmmaker and still photographer 
working alongside his mentor, legendary fashion photographer Irving Penn. In a 
fine feature film debut Cuesta has made what might be the year's most 
controversial movie. <i>L.I.E.</i> stands for Long Island Expressway, the place 
where songwriter Harry Chapin died in a smash-up and a couple years ago, 
talented director Alan Pakula died in an accident as well. For the young 
protagonist of Cuesta's film, fifteen-year-old Howie Blitzen (newcomer Paul 
Franklin Dano in a heartbreaking performance), the expressway also has recently 
taken his beloved mother's life, leaving the boy adrift with her memory and a 
preoccupied developer dad who is juggling a crooked career and a young 
girlfriend, leaving little time for his son. Howie hangs out with the 
charismatic, sophisticated Gary (Billy Kay), a charmer with a dark streak and 
secret; Gary urges Howie to help him break into houses in the upscale 
middle-class neighborhood and one night they crack the lock on the house where 
Big John (Brian Cox) lives. Big John is an ex-Marine and a proud war veteran. 
The boys intend to steal his guns. But Big John catches them in the act and 
though they get away, he manages to tear the pocket off Howie's jeans. Big John 
confronts Gary, who, being pimped by the older man, and Gary tells him Howie 
instigated the break-in. Big John ambushes Howie only to discover that Gary has 
lied. Nonetheless, the realization of his friend's dual life, compounded by his 
loneliness and sexual confusion, pushes Howie into a tailspin of difficult 
self-discovery. Big John edges his way into Howie's life, becoming a surrogate 
dad. It's a relationship that is built on tenuousness, since Big John in a 
pedophile and Howie is vulnerable. But somewhere in the older man, a state of 
grace and decency exists. He realizes Howie is different and that the trust that 
has begun to bud is to be honored, much like his old vow to the military and the 
American way. Cuesta has crafted a movie of subtlety, balance and dignity and <i>
L.I.E.</i> is quite remarkable in it's ability to mine subtext and thought from 
its characters. The film has created a furor with its &quot;sympathetic pedophile&quot; 
angle but it's more Howie's story than Big John's. And Cuesta refuses to go to 
that exploitative place that so pervades Larry Clark's puerile movies (<i>Kids</i>,
<i>Bully</i>). Instead he allows his characters to reveal themselves and he 
doesn't smugly revel in sexual opportunism and voyeurism. It's refreshing, 
moving, cautionary and redemptive. I talked to Michael Cuesta to find out just 
where <i>L.I.E.</i> was conceived, how it grew, and why this small film that 
could challenges the notion that a commercials-maker can't make a movie of 
substance.</font></b></p>

<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">Paula Nechak: </font></i></b>
<font size="2">I'm thrilled that you've kept an exploitative edge and a 
personally invasive eye and ego out of your film. It's my major complaint with 
Larry Clark's movies. Thankfully the understatement in <i>L.I.E.</i> is 
remarkable as is the way you let the characters alone to reveal themselves.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">Michael Cuesta: </font></i></b>
<font size="2">Thank you. That was very much in the writing. Like Brian Cox said 
recently at the Edinburgh Film Festival when someone asked him what he did to 
prepare for the role of Big John, &quot;I read the script.&quot;</font></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">PN:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
Was it easy to keep that objectivity, that balance?</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">MC:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
Absolutely.</font></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">PN:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
How did a seasoned theater and film actor like Brian Cox work with young pups 
Paul Franklin Dano and Billy Kay? Did they look up to him and ask his advice 
about performance and technical issues?</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">MC:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
He was Big John in a way. That dynamic was there and when I saw it I said, 
&quot;Brian, I like this.&quot; Part of my finding him in the character and shaping the 
role was seeing him be that guy in between takes. He and Paul had a banter that 
was great. I told them, &quot;Guys, we've got to get that in the dialogue. Let's pick 
it up.&quot;</font></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">PN:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
There's a homoerotic undertone between the boys and it almost turns into a 
&quot;don't-wish-too-hard&quot; scenario. It's like the manifestation of that unfulfilled 
energy arrives in the form of Big John.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">MC:</font></i></b><font size="2"> I 
think people, and this may not answer what you're saying, but people always 
thought, well, in the straight community Howie is straight and in the gay 
community, Howie is gay or will end up gay. I love that kind of cocktail party 
conversation, which we have everywhere in this world. The ambiguity of Howie's 
sexuality exists, I know. but to me, he doesn't know, he's exploring who he is. 
It's just palpable enough to put your own experience onto it rather than just 
define it, you know? Everyone goes through it. I'm married and I have kids and 
I'm straight but I remember being in that position with a kid I wanted to be. 
There's a whole world of exploring that and I put that into the movie. Once I 
put that sexual aspect in the film really began to develop.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">PN:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
Going with Lot 47 Films as a distributor is smart. They also distributed <i>The 
War Zone</i>, another arguably difficult film to market. One thing that concerns 
me is how the outside world will perceive the surface, not the subtext of the 
film.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">MC:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
That concerns me but the reasons I went with Lot 47 is for the reason you 
mention. They had a history of taking on difficult subject matter and Jeff 
Lipsky is a champion. If he loves a film he truly loves it, and in my case even 
more than I love my film. (laughs) I tell him &quot;I can't sit through my film 
anymore&quot; and he says, &quot;I can't sit through it enough.&quot; How can you pass up a guy 
like that? To me it was important to find the company that would believe in <i>
L.I.E.</i> not just know how to cut the trailer. It's not like &quot;how do I market 
this movie, it's I love this film.&quot; Sony Pictures Classics saw it and Michael 
Barker really loved it and considered buying it. He was sitting next to Kenneth 
Turan from the Los Angeles Times after a screening and Turan said, &quot;Yeah it's 
very good. I think we just watched the best film about a sympathetic pedophile,&quot; 
and Barker responded, &quot;Oh f*ck, how am I going to market this one?&quot; So, like 
Jeff Lipsky says, distributors are lazy. They don't do the homework on how to 
market movies they really like. Something gets in the way that's difficult and 
even though they're passionate about it, they won't buy it. Jeff had to accept 
the NC-17 rating because of the United Artists theatre chain. He has a good 
relationship with them and he knows most of the money will come from them and 
because they only take rated films, not unrated one, we would have to accept an 
NC-17. (laughs) He also knows the NC-17 would provoke some discussion and get 
some press.</font></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">PN:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
You had a successful career as a still photographer and as a commercials 
filmmaker. What, at age thirty-seven, occurred to make you tell yourself that 
you had to go in this other direction? Was it a logical extension for you?</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">MC:</font></i></b><font size="2"> I 
always wanted to make a film. Doing commercials made a nice living and I bought 
a house and had a life. But <i>L.I.E.</i> was always around, for many years 
actually. On and off, shelved and un-shelved. It's why it probably ended up 
being what it is, it had time to evolve. But now I have the bug and I'd like to 
make another film with the next year.</font></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">PN:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
What do you think of the backlash against the empty beauty projects that are 
made by ex-commercial filmmakers like Ridley and Tony Scott, Adrian Lyne, 
Michael Bay...</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">MC:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
Some guys also make terrific films. I'm a big David Fincher fan. I also loved <i>
Being John Malkovich</i> and you can't get a more commercial background than 
Spike Jonze. Yet he made a very fun, smart film.</font></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">PN:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
Did memories of your own youth come back to haunt you while you made <i>L.I.E.</i>? 
Was it a therapeutic purging for you?</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">MC:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
Yeah, in a way. But going back to the backlash against filmmakers of commercials 
because I didn't really respond [to it], I think the biggest mistake commercials 
directors make is they can't decide between the two mediums and they're very 
different. Michael Bay doesn't know the difference between Pepsi-Cola and an 
historical piece. I don't think Ridley Scott does either. Commercials directors 
probably are not very good script readers.</font></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">PN:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
What kind of responsibility did you feel to Paul, especially, and Gary - one had 
limited experience the other none at all. How did you trust them to respect the 
autobiographical details of your life that were injected into the movie and do 
it justice?</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">MC:</font></i></b><font size="2"> A 
lot of directing is being open and caring and not over-directing. With kids it's 
really important to let them be who they are, let them be natural. They're not 
learned actors and they don't have the skills Brian Cox brought to the table. <i>
L.I.E.</i> was very much about doing that and not letting it get unwieldy. You 
don't discuss the characters, you know? They're kids. Filmmaking isn't an 
intellectual process anyway, I think it's the opposite. It's intuitive and more 
an emotional process though the results are intellectual. But making it and 
creating it is very much different than working with actors. As Antonioni, one 
of my favorite directors, said, &quot;The most important thing is to get the actor to 
be at his natural state.&quot;</font></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">PN:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
Since the film took awhile to get created, what changed from the first 
inceptions to the end result?</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">MC:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
One of my favorite scenes was made up. One of my other favorite scenes was 
created in the editing room. I think every director's dream is to tell the story 
without words; to be a silent film director. But would I do it? No, I like 
movies that talk.</font></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">PN:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
Were your expectations met by the actual experience?</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">MC:</font></i></b><font size="2"> I 
actually found it very easy compared to making commercials. Still photography is 
so different. But in commercials I'm expected to make it better and I'm always 
stressed out. With <i>L.I.E.</i> I trusted my script and I trusted my casting. 
To me it was sitting back and enjoying the ride because I knew it was all 
working. </font></font></p>
