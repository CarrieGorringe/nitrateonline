            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 26 October
            2001</i></font><p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;It's gross!&quot; 
            exclaims Beverly, the character played by Drew Barrymore in <i>
            Riding in Cars With Boys</i>, and it's not the sound of a girl 
            yelping just for the sake of doing so. Beverly, so to speak, has had 
            a snootful.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At fifteen, living and attending 
            high school in an upper-middle-class neighborhood in Connecticut in 
            1965, she has become pregnant and has decided to have the baby, even 
            though her father (James Woods) acts as if he's been betrayed by his 
            daughter for not being a &quot;nice girl&quot; and for becoming sexually 
            mature. (Earlier, he could not even bring himself to addressing the 
            matter of her developing from a child to an adolescent.) Ray (Steve 
            Zahn), the young guy who fathered the child, takes responsibility 
            and proposes to marry Beverly. They wind up in a bungalow on a 
            cul-de-sac, Ray becomes erratic at work and in his comings and 
            goings, and Beverly needs help to do simple household chores as she 
            becomes bigger than a house. She sees her friends go on to attend 
            the senior prom, and to graduate. When her embryonic fluid makes a 
            mess on the bathroom floor, you can tell that Beverly's just about 
            had it: this is not what she expected, it is not fun, and she wants 
            to go back to something way less icky and uncomfortable, but she's 
            stuck with this, anyway, and she's going to have to handle it.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film overall turns out to be 
            flawed, but it is pleasing to report that Drew Barrymore gives her 
            first fully-realized performance as an adult character in <i>Riding 
            in Cars With Boys</i>. One of the best things about her performance 
            and the film is how it shows things changing incrementally rather 
            than in broad, dramatically-familiar strokes. Beverly has to take 
            small steps into the territory of having and raising a child and, 
            later, doing it on her own, putting up with all the attendant 
            indignities and making the necessary decisions, while still holding 
            on to whatever dreams or aspirations she may have, whether they be 
            becoming a writer or finding a better place to live. She has to live 
            with her growing son, Jason, as a &quot;team&quot;, not in the conventional 
            mother-child relationship. For his part, we can see at the same time 
            how Jason senses he's missing out on something but doesn't fully 
            understand why -- why, for instance, his father has to exit the 
            family picture. (Steve Zahn, initially, and to one's horror, looks 
            like he's going to be reprising his dumber-than-dirt Roscoe Ates 
            routine from <i>Happy, Texas</i> and <i>Forces of Nature</i>, but, 
            fortunately, he does not, and gives one of his best performances in 
            years.) The result is a quietly-accrued stockpile between mother and 
            son which spans back for years. The film's main story is framed by a 
            car trip which Beverly takes with the grown Jason (Adam Garcia), and 
            Barrymore gives Beverly in these scenes a round-featured, self-made 
            look that hints at a person who's acquired a tough hide underneath 
            while also having to be able to bounce from one situation to the 
            next, as needed. You want to know how someone who looks like that 
            developed from the one, still with some baby fat clinging to her 
            cheeks, who is seen earlier at a wedding reception where she sits, 
            like a firing range target, at a table because nobody can think of 
            how to approach her and offer congratulations under the particular 
            circumstances.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The director Penny Marshall, 
            working from a screenplay adaptation of a memoir by Beverly Donofrio, 
            is more of a compassionate director than a hard-nosed observer, and 
            she tends to work in little enlightening, corrective, and 
            therapeutic messages into the narrative regarding girls needing to 
            stand up for themselves and for each other, how they need to be 
            nurturers, their self-growth potential, and the importance of family 
            relationships. The material also seems softened, so that it never 
            comes off as being too grating or sandpapery to the audience's 
            sensibilities. (Marshall just recently revealed, though, that the 
            film went through a rushed, forced post-production, which accounts 
            for many of the jumps and gaps that occur as the film unfolds, as 
            well as, possibly, the tiny appearance made late in the film by 
            Rosie Perez.) &quot;When does this job ever end?&quot; Beverly says at one 
            point about mothering, while, at another, crying that she's &quot;screwed 
            up&quot;, prompting Jason to instantly disagree, even though we know that 
            he sees life with Beverly involves everything revolving around her. 
            &quot;You gotta tell them you need help,&quot; Ray says slyly to his adult 
            son, so, when Jason does ask his mother for help, Beverly 
            unstintingly asks, fully ready to be supportive and unselfish, 
            &quot;What's wrong?&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film may lean in the direction 
            of becoming sappy. But it never really becomes sappy, and it also 
            has a number of genuinely fine moments -- a beautiful reconciliatory 
            closing scene, and one where Beverly and her best friend Fay 
            (Brittany Murphy), both many months with-child, touch tummies 
            together and allow themselves to become momentarily jazzed over 
            having kids at the same time. (Murphy, much less dour, here, than in
            <i>Don't Say a Word</i>, is looking to turn into quite an actress.) 
            I will refrain from using the term &quot;bumpy ride&quot; (it is banished, the 
            same way Susan Traherne banished the word &quot;Suez&quot; in <i>Plenty</i>), 
            but suffice to say that <i>Riding in Cars With Boys</i> has plenty 
            of things in it to enjoy, and a performance by Drew Barrymore that 
            will, hopefully, be the first of many more, fine ones to come.</font></td>
