            review by <a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 19 January
            2001</i></font>
            <p><i><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Snatch</font></b></i><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">,
            the new film by British director Guy Ritchie, which he wrote and
            directed, is an escalating comedy of mayhem involving a large stolen
            gem and what happens as it is passed through the hands of a whole
            series of shady characters, ranging from would-be petty crooks to
            medium-sized aspiring crooks, crime bosses in both London and New
            York City, at least one hitman, and a dog. The ensuing roundelay is
            punctuated by some colorful dialogue (&quot;Who took the jam out of
            your donut?&quot; complains one guy in regards to another's bad
            attitude), some baroque profanities, and wince-inducing stagings of
            mayhem.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ritchie mixes in some established
            stars alongside some relatively unfamiliar ones, for an
            all-in-the-gang feeling: Dennis Farina plays the New York crime boss
            who literally travels in a flash over to London upon the first sign
            of serious trouble (he also gets to deliver a terrific exit line);
            Benicio Del Toro appears as a courier with a gambling habit and what
            sounds like a Hungarian accent; Rade Sherbedgia plays a London crook
            with KGB training who, literally, won't stay down; and Brad Pitt
            appears as an Irish Gypsy with lots of tattoos, an ability to knock
            out guys with one single blow, and bursts of speech so
            indecipherable that even the other characters on-screen complain
            that they can't make anything out of it.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ritchie's earlier, debut film, the
            1998 <i>Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels</i>, was both hugely
            successful and sparked a title wave of U.K. gangster pictures. It
            was also a knockoff of <i>Reservoir Dogs</i>, which was itself a
            knockoff of every gang-with-a-plan thriller you could think of. The
            difference is that Quentin Tarantino made his picture with genuine
            wit, creativity (in the ways he recombined material from all sorts
            of places), and enthusiasm. Ritchie's two films are a bit more
            aloof, and the borrowings feel like they're of a second, or even
            third, generation quality: you may recognize the opening scene where
            the action is followed on a succession of security monitors and end
            up finding yourself more concerned with wondering where you have
            seen it before (and whether it was probably done better in the other
            film you saw it in) than with what's going on with the screen
            characters in front of you.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film wants to induce the same
            kind of giddiness one would get from an amusement-park ride, but
            there's no feeling for the characters except for those who make some
            immediate connections. Alan Ford, who plays a powerful London
            mobster in the film who's referred to as Brick Top, brings such a
            palpable sense of tightly-wound anger and barely suppressed
            aggression to every scene he's in that you don't wonder if the mere
            mention of his name would turn men's blood into ice. (He also has a
            great scene where he tutors some guys on the best way to go about
            disposing of a human body<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">
            -- </i></b>borrowed, I may add, from an actual case which took place
            in the British countryside during the 1980s.) And Vinnie Jones, a
            former professional soccer player who appeared in <i>Lock, Stock...</i>
            as the guy who wielded a shotgun in one hand while taking care of
            his young son with the other, plays a dapper gunman who can sit
            down, rivet people with his gaze, and speak very softly yet make his
            meaning and intentions perfectly well understood.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Otherwise, the film identifies
            upfront who everyone is and what their relation is to everyone else,
            and then merrily plows right into the story with gay abandon. You
            get the feeling that it doesn't matter whether you know whom you're
            looking at during any particular moment, because the film certainly
            doesn't seem to care.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What is Guy Ritchie aiming at? The
            film certainly can't compare with Mike Hodges' 1971 <i>Get Carter</i>,
            which I just happened to have a look at for the first time recently,
            an incredibly bleak but incredibly haunting look at British
            gangsters which shares with this film many of the same types of
            characters along with an &quot;out with the old boss, in with the
            new boss&quot; type of storyline. In Hodges' film, there was menace
            but not a whole lot of gunfire, because everyone in the film knew
            that each and every gunshot meant something. Although <i>Snatch</i>
            makes a reference to &quot;for every cause, there's an effect,&quot;
            a lot of guns are fired but it doesn't seem to make any difference
            who's on the receiving end. While I don't expect pictures like <i>Snatch</i>
            to come with an existential message, the way it works does weigh you
            down after a while. In that way, it's emblematic of the increasing
            age of isolationism we are living in, where empathy has been
            replaced by indifference, and other people register only as images
            of an outside world.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
