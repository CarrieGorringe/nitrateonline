            opens with a series of hard-to-read images, as if the darkness on
            screen has come alive, filled with fluttering wings and pounding
            heartbeats. As the image finally comes into focus, you find yourself
            being stared at hard by the ever-intimidating face of Samuel L.
            Jackson: &quot;Don't you watch me!&quot; he roars. And for an
            instant, you might think better of what you're about to do.</b><o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jackson's
            character, the paranoid schizophrenic Romulus Ledbetter, is known
            around New York City streets as the Caveman, because he lives in a
            cave in a park. At that daunting moment when you first see him, Rom
            is actually not yelling at you, but at a timid social worker, whom
            he distrusts on principle. But throughout the film, Rom is trying to
            beat back the demons that populate his own skull. As ferocious as he
            seems to you, he's haunted by demons far more ferocious, beset by
            nightmares he can't identify. Now dreadlocked, glowering, and
            looming -- and when Jackson looms, you know he's looming -- he was
            once a piano prodigy and teacher at Julliard. But it's been years
            since his wife Sheila (Tamara Tunie) kicked him out of the house,
            and though he understands his plight, he can't go back, no matter
            how much he misses his former life. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Rom
            isn't exactly a reliable narrator, but the film makes this
            unreliability its focus, taking you inside his skull, so you can see
            what he sees. He keeps a television in his cave, on which he sees
            projected a series of &quot;messages&quot; directed at him by evil
            (corporate) forces. Romulus's collective name for these forces is
            &quot;Stuyvesant,&quot; and he imagines they shoot devastating,
            puke-green z-rays at him from the Chrysler Building. One morning,
            Rom wakes to find a frozen corpse in a tree just outside his cave.
            Believing that this street kid, Scotty (Sean MacMahon), has been
            murdered by &quot;Stuyvesant&quot; as yet another message to him,
            Rom heads off to the payphone down the street to call Lulu (Aunjanue
            Ellis), who happens to be a cop. She answers wearily, roused from
            sleep -- they've been through something like this before -- but soon
            after, she arrives on the scene with a skeptical white detective in
            tow. As Rom spits his theory of the crime, she's so frustrated and
            saddened by his ravings that she tries to hide the fact that they're
            even related. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Intriguingly,
            <i>The Caveman's Valentine</i> asks you to sympathize with a
            difficult character, and simultaneously to understand, from Lulu's
            perspective, what makes him, frankly, unsympathetic. But as the film
            turns more complicated and less coherent, it has trouble balancing
            its thrilling plunges into Romulus's skull (where you see the
            muscular black male angels that so unhinge him but also charge him
            up) and its efforts to show you how other characters respond to his
            lurching about. The swing character here is Sheila -- she stands
            outside his skull, but she is wholly a figment of his need and
            desire, appearing to him sporadically, to offer advice and
            encouragement. But while he's talking to her, everything and
            everyone else has to stop, and this makes for some awkward pacing.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            part, the movie's unsettled structure has to do with Rom's own
            problems with keeping things straight. His skewed perspective comes
            across in Rom's scenes with his reluctant benefactor, a rich,
            self-confident bankruptcy lawyer named Bob (Anthony Michael Hall).
            When Rom asks the guy for a suit of clothes, Bob tests his musical
            skills, then says okay, even inviting him into his super-nice
            apartment to meet the wife, Betty (Kate McNeil) and enjoy a lime
            rickey (and when you see the neon color of these drinks, you might
            wonder just whose perspective is skewed here). Rom and Bob achieve a
            kind of comedy routine rhythm, as each<o:p>

            past and around the other, then behaves, out of politeness, as if
            everything's just peachy. Rom's own frustrations with the niceties
            of social interactions are almost palpable here. But the most moving
            image in the Bob and Betty world involves Betty, who warms up to her
            unusual houseguest, helping him shave his beard and shampoo his
            formidable dreads. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            such cross-cultural change-ups suggest, the film -- written by
            George Dawes Green, based on his 1994 Edgar Award-winning detective
            novel, and tweaked by Lemmons -- is only superficially a murder
            mystery. And on that level, it lacks narrative and logistical sense:
            Rom implausibly moves between locations apparently many miles apart,
            without visible, or even imaginable, means of transportation, while
            tracking down world-famous avant-garde photographer David Leppenraub
            (Colm Feore), whom he suspects of torture, murder, and general
            sexual nastiness. Scheming his way into Leppenraub's Long Island
            home (by unconvincingly pretending he's sane enough to have written
            a piano piece in the photographer's honor), Rom meets Moira
            Leppenraub (Ann Magnuson), David's sister and an artist herself. She
            and Romulus share a certain disregard for commercial interests
            (though she is clearly wealthy and used to privilege), as well as a
            taste for life on the fringe. Briefly, their liaison helps Rom to
            recognize himself again.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            the father-daughter relationship -- at once connected and
            disconnected -- is the film's most tenuous, crucial, and potentially
            terrifying, much as it was in Lemmons' first feature, <i>Eve's Bayou</i>
            (where Jackson also played an all-powerful and all-fallible father).
            When the rest -- the murder mystery, the questions about art and
            obscenity, the by-definition corrupt class system -- starts to feel
            distracting, the movie flounders. Elegantly shot by cinematographer
            Amelia Vincent and effectively scored by Terence Blanchard, <i>The
            Caveman's Valentine</i> has much to offer, even aside from Jackson's
            lauded powerhouse performance. Despite and sometimes because of its
            unevenness, the film conveys the delusions of daily existence with
            fierce poetry. </font><o:p>
