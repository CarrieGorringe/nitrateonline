            achieves a kind of visual poetry, rhapsodic and turbulent. And for
            the most part, it is joyous, even breathtaking, to watch. Julian
            Schnabel's second arty biopic is, much like his first, 1996's <i>Basquiat</i>,
            a heady mix of wonder and polemic, in love with its subject and also
            full of itself. Based on the writings of Cuban writer Reinaldo
            Arenas (Javier Bardem, in a riveting performance), <i>Before Night
            Falls</i> traces his arduous, fabulous life, from his impoverished
            childhood in the Oriente province, through his days as a promising
            student at the University of Havana and prize-winning young
            novelist, to his years of imprisonment by Castro's regime, as a
            homosexual and dissident. And then, for an inexplicably brief few
            minutes, the film wraps up by montaging Reinaldo's final ten years
            in New York. Here, in 1990, he committed suicide at the age of
            forty-seven, while suffering from AIDS. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's
            a lot of life to pack into a little over two hours, and the film
            does it by working across media, layering Arenas' own poetry in
            voice-over, elaborate camera moves, and vibrant colors. It opens
            with a camera looking up at a canopy of lush trees, taking the point
            of view of the infant Reinaldo in his mother's (Olatz Lopez
            Garmendia) arms, while the adult Reinaldo narrates her ordeals,
            abused by his father and unhappily returned to her parents' home,
            the child &quot;the sign of her failure.&quot; <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">From
            here the film cuts to the boy, three or four years old, naked and
            digging about in a muddy hole. He looks content, but again, the
            camera -- craning up and out from the hole, then speeding back and
            away at ground level -- intimates his restlessness. Like all the
            childhood scenes, this one is tropical and heated, as Schnabel and
            cinematographers Xavier Perez Grobet and Guillermo Rosas translate
            Reinaldo's evolving &quot;natural&quot; passions into rich greens
            and deep browns, and lots -- I mean lots -- of water. The camera
            repeatedly shows Reinaldo enraptured by rain, waterfalls, rivers,
            the ocean. Obviously, such images of thrilling torrents are
            metaphors for sex, but they're about the sensuality and freedom that
            Reinaldo feels driven to put into words. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            many women in his early life encourage the boy's
            &quot;sensitivity,&quot; but his grandfather rejects it. When
            Reinaldo's teacher comes to the house to announce that her student
            has a gift for poetry, the old man -- already concerned that the boy
            is girlish -- goes ballistic, chopping down trees on which his
            grandson has carved poetic musings. Reinaldo and the teacher look on
            aghast, the camera whipping back and forth, taking on the
            grandfather's -- or maybe even the axe's -- point of view. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Such
            bizarre, impressionistic imagery is of a piece with Schnabel's art,
            known for its spectacular unruliness. <i>Before Night Falls</i>
            includes other jarring moments, as when Reinaldo, running away from
            home, catches a ride with a cart-driving peasant, played by a
            heavily made-up, corny-accented Sean Penn. This episode delivers
            Reinaldo directly into the next stage of his life: when the peasant
            dumps him off, he's picked up by a truckload of triumphant anti-Batista
            rebels, who are warmly welcomed by villagers along the road. At this
            point, around 1958, Reinaldo comes into his own -- and turns into
            Javier Bardem -- studying in Havana and becoming sexually active.
            This will, of course, get him into all kinds of trouble under
            Castro's rule. While the film does not enumerate Reinaldo's many
            sexual encounters (Arenas claimed he had 5,000 by the time he was
            twenty-five), it does suggest his pursuit of pleasure, pain, sex --
            experience of all kinds. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            his hazy crazy beach-cruising days are numbered, and it's not long
            before he's arrested. At the infamous El Morro prison, Reinaldo is
            locked in solitary confinement, in a metal box with a dirt floor.
            When he's in the regular prison population, Reinaldo gets along by
            writing letters for all the prisoners, while also keeping up his own
            writing. He's aided by resident drag queen Bon Bon (Johnny Depp,
            looking as lovely as he did playing a harem girl in <i>Don Juan
            deMarco</i>), who smuggles his work out so that they might be
            published in Europe. The film makes the metaphorical point that no
            one is always quite what he seems, I suppose, by also casting Depp
            as Lieutenant Victor, the prison authority most determined to beat
            Reinaldo's defiance and creativity out of him. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">These
            scenes inside are harrowing, of course, but like everything else in
            this episodic movie, they pass by like some surrealish dream.
            Reinaldo doesn't &quot;develop&quot; as a character so much as he
            survives. Finally, after his release from El Morro, Arenas does
            leave Cuba during the chaotic 1980 Mariel Harbor exodus, when Castro
            evicted Cuba's &quot;deviants, homosexuals, and mentally ill.&quot;
            Once in New York City, he and his friend Lazaro Gomez Carriles (now
            guardian of Arenas' estate and played in the film Olivier Martinez)
            enjoy one ecstatic scene, driving through Greenwich Village streets
            in a convertible. Almost immediately, Arenas falls ill; in his
            suicide note, he blames Castro for everything. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Schnabel
            has clear ideas about the sanctity of self-expressive freedom,
            political and artistic. But he carefully avoids close analysis of
            his subject or even much explanation of events, preferring to detail
            surfaces and let viewers grapple with what he/she sees. The film is
            frank about its own obsessions and passions, which are, in the end,
            more Schnabel's than Arenas'.<span style="mso-spacerun:
