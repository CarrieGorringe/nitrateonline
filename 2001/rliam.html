            review by <a href="../gianni.html" target="_top">Gianni Truzzi</a>, 5 October
            2001</i></font><p><font face="Verdana" size="5">Baring the Cross</font></p>
            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">It feels odd to want to defend 
            the Catholic Church<i>,</i> with its long, pain-inflicting history 
            of rigid orthodoxy. One would have thought that writer Jimmy 
            McGovern would have exorcised his demons in his controversial 1992 
            film, <i>Priest</i>, but apparently not. McGovern's newest story, <i>
            Liam</i>, followed closely on its heels with the release of the 
            BBC-produced film, <i>A Love Divided</i>, adds to the church's 
            indictment -- already lengthy with the burning and stoning of 
            heretics, the Crusades, the Inquisition and the frequent 
            bloodletting over doctrine -- the more prosaic terrors of Catholic 
            school.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Eight-year-old Liam Sullivan's 
            inability to get his words out in front of adults without stammering 
            leaves him a quiet observer of his own life. In 1930's Liverpool, 
            there's a lot to watch: His Dad loses his job at the shipyard, his 
            elder sister and brother go to work and the bonds of the family, 
            along with the rest of the community, unravel as the acrimony of 
            poverty sets in. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Liam (Anthony Borrows) watches 
            intently, but the reverse is true, too. &quot;I'm watching you, Liam 
            Sullivan,&quot; the policeman cautions when he catches him peering into 
            the pub windows, where the women croon &quot;Someone to Watch Over Me.&quot; 
            The neighborhood mothers look after him, and his stern teacher rails 
            over her students' &quot;filthy, dirty souls&quot; as they ready for their 
            first communion. The priest strides the rows of desks to remind them 
            with dark cruelty how Jesus is aware of them, since each of their 
            sins &quot;drives the nails deeper into the hands of Christ.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As Liam's Dad, Ian Hart gives a 
            tragic performance as a working-class <i>King Lear</i> who loses 
            everything to his anger and bigotry. Best known for his dynamic 
            performance as John Lennon in <i>Back Beat</i>, Hart seems at home 
            in the setting (albeit about ten years early) in which Lennon grew 
            up. Quick to find a scapegoat, he blames the Jews who own the 
            shipyard and the Irish immigrants (despite his own surname) who 
            compete with him for wages. He resents his own son Con (David Hart), 
            who becomes the major breadwinner, and his growing rage drives him 
            to the camaraderie of the local black-shirted fascists. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Complicating matters -- and 
            threading the story to its final disaster -- is the job Liam's 
            teenaged sister Teresa (Megan Burns) takes as a maid for the Jewish 
            shipyard owners. &quot;No cleaning toilets,&quot; Liam's Mum (Claire Hackett) 
            tells her, trying to retain some family dignity. &quot;No daughter of 
            mine cleans another woman's toilet.&quot; Of course, that's exactly what 
            Teresa must do, but not before clumsily denying she is a Catholic to 
            secure the job. Her crisis of conscience only worsens when she 
            discovers the lady of the house has a lover, and pays Teresa with 
            extra favors to carry messages between them.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The church, meanwhile, seems 
            incapable of even offering solace. The only solution the priest can 
            offer Teresa is to quit her job.&nbsp; When she emerges crying from the 
            confessional just as Liam did before her, their mother begins her 
            confession with &quot;Father, what have you been saying to my kids?&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Director Stephen Frears invariably 
            makes films that are interesting (<i>My Beautiful Launderette </i>
            and <i>Prick Up Your Ears</i>), even when they fail as 
            disappointingly as <i>Liam</i>. Frears washes his scenes with the 
            yellow of old film stock, trapping memory like flies in amber, and 
            he offers cinematic truth to the period. Other critics have compared
            <i>Liam </i>to Frank McCourt's <i>Angela's Ashes </i>for its 
            depression-era UK setting, but it really falls within the childhood 
            memoir movie tradition of Truffaut's <i>400 Blows </i>or John 
            Boorman's <i>Hope and Glory. </i>Unlike those better films, Frears 
            and McGovern refuse to stay within the bounds of the child's point 
            of view. We witness Ian's Dad in the pub, Teresa at work -- places 
            Liam does not go -- and view them with an adult comprehension of 
            what's going on. We're kept outside of Liam's head, and made to wait 
            to know why he is so disturbed by seeing his mother naked. Frears 
            never commits to deciding whether Liam is observer or observed, and 
            its wonderful performances are diminished by a story that sprawls 
            too widely to satisfy.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><a name="ALoveDivided" target="_top">A Love 
            Divided</a></i> is based on the real events of a family dispute that 
            exploded into religious war in County Wexford, Ireland, in 1957. 
            When Sean Cloney (Liam Cunningham), a Catholic, and Sheila Kelly (Orla 
            Brady), a Protestant, got married, they made a vow to each other: 
            &quot;We musn't let anything come between us...you and me against the 
            world.&quot; What they didn't count on, though, was the strength of the &quot;ne 
            temere&quot; pledge that a Protestant partner in a mixed-religion 
            marriage had to take requiring the children to be brought up 
            Catholic.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For years, Sean and their two 
            daughters obediently walk up the hill to the Catholic church, while 
            Sheila joins her parents and sister down the hill at the Protestant 
            church. By the time their eldest daughter, Eileen, is school-age, 
            Sheila insists that she and Sean should decide where she goes to 
            school. Father Stafford (Tony Doyle) gruffly insists otherwise. 
            &quot;There are no minds to be made up,&quot; he decrees. &quot;You made a solemn 
            vow the day I married you. That means she goes to [the Catholic 
            school] St. Bridget's.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sheila's insistence on her rights 
            as a parent threaten to expose the tensions the town has papered 
            over with false amity. The Protestant minister counsels her to go 
            along, as they all do to keep things peaceful. &quot;What's wrong with 
            you?&quot; demands Sheila's sister, enumerating the joys being 
            threatened. &quot;I don't know,&quot; Sheila puzzles back. She's lived with 
            the oppression of minority status for so long she can't recognize 
            it.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Father Stafford's pressure on Sean 
            drives a rift between the couple, and Sheila reels at his 
            repudiation of their private promise. Impulsively, she runs away 
            with the two girls, and what began as a marital row grows into a 
            public scandal, as Father Stafford, with the support of the bishop, 
            declares a boycott of all Protestants until Sheila's whereabouts are 
            revealed and the girls returned.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Some Irish observers date the 
            decline of the Catholic church's power to the boycott in Wexford's 
            Fethard-on-the-Sea, prodding modern Ireland to become a secular, 
            pluralistic country. The events of this tiny village got the 
            attention of the world, with a write-up in <i>Time</i> magazine 
            sparking the couple's eventual reconciliation when Sheila read it in 
            her haven in Scotland's Orkney Islands.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like <i>Liam</i>, <i>A Love Divided</i> 
            is a story of catastrophe brought on by prejudice, and they both lay 
            much, even all of the blame at the pre-reformed church's altar. The 
            key difference -- and what makes <i>A Love Divided</i> a more 
            watchable film -- is that the latter offers the promise of 
            redemption through love. And, after all, isn't that what Jesus (at 
            least after Vatican II) would do?</font></td>
