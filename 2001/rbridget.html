            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In
            her diary, Bridget Jones is a star. Smart, snarky, and agonizingly
            self-aware, she records her endlessly witty thoughts, wishes, and
            observations semi-regularly for a year, over which time she learns
            something about her desires, her neuroses, and the tyranny of social
            order. An articulate, middle-class, thirty-two-year-old
            &quot;singleton,&quot; Bridget Jones is a star in the (so-called)
            real world, too, as the much-loved heroine of Helen Fielding's 1996
            novel, <i>Bridget Jones's Diary</i>. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Bridget's
            apparent appeal is that she is so much like so many other young
            women -- and perhaps men as well -- who feel beset by familial,
            professional, and cultural ideals advertised on TV and magazine
            covers. She imagines herself the cynical, self-aware anti-Cosmo
            girl, pitted against the cruelly impossible demands imposed by
            commercial imagery: size minus-one bodies, creamy complexions,
            perfectly pouty lips. At the same time, and almost in spite of
            herself, Bridget is also the consummate Cosmo girl, driven to
            achieve precisely those ideals that she understands as unhealthy and
            mass-marketed, the cultish ideals of social etiquette, banality,
            short-sightedness, and above all, self-improvement. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Bridget's
            resistance to expectations made her a cultish figure in her own
            right. And so, the much-anticipated movie based on Fielding's book
            arrives with all kinds of strikes against it, not least being the
            individual ways that readers pictured their Bridget: you may recall
            that the casting of Texas-born Renee Zellweger as the definitively
            British Bridget raised a ruckus. In fact, Zellweger does fine, even
            saddled with all the news items about her efforts (she gained weight
            for the role, spent seven months living in London in order to polish
            her accent, worked in a publishing house to get the feel of
            Bridget's day-to-day boredom, etc.) Her performance is as bravely
            self-humiliating and obnoxious as a Miramax-financed movie might
            allow. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            problem is that she's no longer the star of her own snipey diary,
            but of a very regular romantic comedy, pushed and pulled into shape
            by producers Tim Bevan and Eric Fellner (<i>Four Weddings and a
            Funeral</i>, <i>Notting Hill</i>) and co-writer Richard Curtis (<i>Notting
            Hill</i>). These fellows have clearly perfected a formula that mixes
            dry Brit humor with fluffy romanticism, some distance from the
            novel's mostly nasty, narrow perspective, by way of Jane Austen. The
            fact that this crew selected veteran documentary-maker Sharon
            Maguire to direct suggests that perhaps, somewhere along the line,
            they had a sense that the movie might reference some kind of
            realism, however fictional. But that's precisely the paradox the
            movie can't get around -- it's a prince-charming fantasy with
            aspirations to real-world groundedness. And so it runs smack into
            the very problem it can't avoid: by externalizing Bridget's thoughts
            as &quot;objective&quot; scenes including other characters who have
            their own points of view, the film necessarily loses the novel's
            tight focus on Bridget's musings and misunderstandings. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            isn't to say that the novel doesn't cheat in its own way: Bridget's
            diary entries contain ample portions of dialogue and description
            that aren't strictly from her point of view. But such literary
            fudging gives her own observations a context, certainly useful for
            readers looking to position themselves in relation to her. The film
            has a built-in context, in that it does not, like a diary might,
            take place only in Bridget's head. Rather, the film offers any
            number of characters' responses to Bridget, even as it also offers a
            few subjectively surreal, <i>Ally McBeal</i>-ish moments. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            film opens with Bridget's diary-like voice-over describing her
            distress at having to attend a Christmas season party. Invited by
            friends of her parents, she must confront not only her own Mum and
            Dad (Gemma Jones and Jim Broadbent), but also assorted folks from
            her childhood, including one Mark Darcy (the cleverly cast Colin
            Firth, who, as Bridget fans already know, was Fielding's model for
            the character). Mark Darcy (always referred to as the two names
            together) is a well-to-do, well-intentioned human rights barrister,
            though dreadfully inept when it comes to social events, like saying
            hello. Bridget is feeling stressed, since everyone she meets is
            asking her about is her non-existent love life, and so she takes it
            out on Mark Darcy, revealing to him her most nervous, least
            quick-witted self. So now you know, if you didn't five minutes
            before: Bridget is destined to end up with this awkward,
            handsome-ish chap. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            a result of this early, disastrous encounter, Bridget goes home to
            beat herself up some, drink herself into a hangover, and smoke too
            many cigarettes in one sitting: in the novel, she keeps close count
            of calories, alcohol units, and fags, an obsessiveness that the
            movie reduces to selectively lifted voice-over passages, but also
            tries to translate into images. And so you see mini-montages of
            Bridget in her flat, drinking, being depressed, wearing her
            penguin-patterned PJs, accompanied by Jamie O'Neal's &quot;All By
            Myself.&quot; Oh, the humanity, etc. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At
            this point the film sets up the requisite obstacle to Bridget's
            realization that she will end up with Mark Darcy, in the form of her
            boss at work (she's a publicist for a publishing house), the dashing
            Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant, playing his usual character, this time
            with what appears to be deliberate smirkiness). They flirt
            comedically, have sex adorably, and she worries sympathetically that
            his aversion to commitment is indeed for real. At the same time,
            she's dealing with the break-up of her parents' marriage (her mother
            falls for a TV shopping channel host, who invites her to be his
            co-hostess), her &quot;smug married&quot; friends (who invite her
            for dinner, then harass her about her singleness), and her good
            chums eagerly offering up cartloads of dating advice (a trio that
            includes two eccentrically outfitted girls and a gay man, but of
            course). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Add
            to this her many v. public humiliations -- embarrassing Salman
            Rushdie (playing himself) at a book party, wearing a Playboy Bunny
            costume to a party where no one else is in costume, and working
            briefly as a reporter for a local TV news program, whereupon she
            literally splats her derriere on the camera. This is the stuff of
            soaps and game shows, so obviously outrageous that viewers can rest
            assured that their own lives are not like that. But again, here
            comes the paradox that the movie can't avoid: Bridget's dating
            travails and colorful imagination -- occasionally made visible in
            scenes such as her wedding fantasy, or Daniel's so-droll
            introduction, striding into the office to the tune of Aretha
            Franklin's &quot;Respect,&quot; or Bridget's fantasy date, when he
            picks her up in his convertible and greets her with a manly growl
            that sounds like a perfectly tuned engine -- all make her familiar,
            if only because of the <i>Ally McBeal</i> connection. It's this
            familiarity that's troubling. Inside the frankly sexual, frankly
            desirous, and frankly pissed off anti-Cosmo girl is a Cosmo girl,
            just waiting for her happy ending. <o:p>
