            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 5 January
            2001</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>It seems only natural that,
            after having dealt with America's most bitter internal conflict (<i>The
            Civil War</i>) and its most indigenous pastime (Baseball), Ken
            Burns' should turn his attention to America's most indigenous music.
            Burns has been working on <i>Jazz</i> for several years, now -- with
            some time-outs for looks at architect Frank Lloyd Wright and early
            women's movement founders Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B.
            Anthony -- and the results, like the multiple courses served at a
            fine French restaurant, will finally be unveiled on P.B.S., starting
            January 8, and continuing, in ten parts, until January 31. Aside
            from the advance tchotchkes -- the coffee-table book, the CDs, the
            magazine cover stories, the postcard collections, etc. etc. -- only
            about an hour and a half, excerpted from several episodes, has been
            made available to members of the press, and I am happy to report
            that the material thus seen has more interesting stuff in it than a
            lot of full-length feature films that came out over the last year. I
            can only imagine, or hope, that the rest of the documentary
            (seventeen-and-a-half hours worth -- as Judith Crist would say ,
            clear your evenings, or your VCRs, in advance) will be just as good.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Jazz</i> has its origins in the
            blues and spirituals that were brought to, or created in, the
            American South; in the honky-tonk music of saloons, chorus girl
            shows, and bordellos both well-appointed or not; and in the ragtime
            music that heralded the American &quot;century of progress&quot; at
            the turn of the 20th century. Jazz accommodated both the extreme
            highs and lows of the blues and ragtime. (Appropriately, the opening
            episode of <i>Jazz</i> is entitled &quot;Gumbo.&quot;) Louis
            Armstrong is introduced in the series with an amazing piece of early
            sound film, stepping forward from his seven-man combo and telling
            us, &quot;I'm Mr. Armstrong, and we're going to swing one of the
            good ol' good ones for ya...&quot; Upon which he starts up the group
            in a rendition of Dinah, his back to us but with his head down and
            shoulders working as he gets things started, with a conspiratorial
            glance or two at us. The musician Matt Glasser, over half a century
            later, gives us some wonderful commentary on how they play this
            song, elocuting on the recording phrase by phrase as the musicians
            create something exhilarating. Then we hear Armstrong in a recording
            of Black and Blue<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>--
            originally written as a song sung by a woman about her wandering man
            -- and how he turns it into an introspection by an African-American
            trying to live in the heinously restrictive conditions of the time.
            Called the &quot;most influential&quot; singer of the twentieth
            century (and I am not inclined to dispute it), Stanley Crouch puts
            the capper on things when he says that, anybody who would want to go
            back to &quot;the old way&quot; of crooning a tune after hearing
            Armstrong sing, &quot;He'd need to be deported. To somewhere. Not on
            the Earth. Maybe Pluto.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">From Armstrong, there is the
            evolution, by way of the naughty, bawdy, legendary clubs of Kansas
            City, Missouri, to swing, probably the single most influential
            element on Americans fighting in the Second World War -- whether on
            the homefront, in Europe, or in the blistering Pacific, it was both
            a morale booster and a reminder of what everyone was fighting for.
            (The excerpts from the episodes in <i>Jazz</i> devoted to swing
            virtually burst with energy, and should be knockouts.) Meanwhile, on
            New York's 53rd Street, Billie Holiday was creating a genuine
            sensation, starting in 1939, with her renditions of Strange Fruit at
            the club Café Society (which called itself &quot;the wrong club for
            the right people&quot;). One of the most surprising, and enjoyable,
            commentators to appear in <i>Jazz</i> is Buck O'Neil, a former
            player in the segregated all-black baseball league who was first
            interviewed for Baseball, and who turns out to have been a jazz
            aficionado, as well, and he speaks wonderfully about it. Of
            &quot;Lady Day&quot; (a moniker bestowed upon Billie Holiday by
            saxophonist Lester Young), O'Neil says, &quot;Anybody could sing [a]
            song, and when Lady Day sung it, it was a different song
            altogether.... It just made you feel good all over, or,...she'd make
            you maybe wanna cry. It might bring back the greatest moments in
            your life, and it might bring back the saddest moments in your
            life.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After 1946, musicians broke from
            the big bands and began playing on their own, in clubs where there
            was music but no dancing -- the creation of be-bop, the soundtrack
            music for the &quot;bohemian&quot; and &quot;beat&quot; culture of
            the Fifties. Charlie Parker, who played with Dizzy Gillespie's group
            before going it alone, is recalled by drummer Stan Levey, who
            describes a torturous cross-country tour to play on the West coast
            (where jazz fans couldn't figure out what this new be-bop freeform
            was all about): in one instance, Parker walks off a train in the
            middle of the Southwestern desert, disoriented and looking for a fix
            of the heroin that he had been hooked on since his teen years. (Chet
            Baker's recently-published memoirs revealed that all the West coast
            musicians gave heroin a try, just to see what it was like, without
            knowing what they were letting themselves in for.) Parker said that
            a recording he made at the time of Lover Man should be &quot;stomped
            into the ground&quot;; naturally, it became one of his most popular
            recordings and still turns up most often on compilations of his
            music.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Duke Ellington, one of the greatest
            American musicians, kept his big band together in the Fifties but
            was in dire straits, until he let tenor-saxophonist Paul Gonsalves
            riff for twenty-seven choruses on a performance of Diminuendo and
            Crescendo in Blue at the 1956 Newport, Rhode Island jazz festival.
            The audience then demanded four encores. (Gonsalves' bravado
            high-end notes can be heard echoing through Gerald Wilson's trumpet
            in Ellington's music for Anatomy of a Murder.) The Newport festival
            is a good example of what many people in the series repeatedly refer
            to as jazz's &quot;inclusive&quot; quality -- the 1958 festival,
            captured on film in Jazz on a Summer's Day, included on its program
            Gerry Mulligan, Dinah Washington, Anita O'Day (whose scattershot
            rendition of Tea for Two is first seen bewildering, then
            enrapturing, the audience in attendance), Louis Armstrong, and, as
            the final performer, the great gospel singer Mahalia Jackson.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">From Armstrong to the &quot;swingos&quot;
            (as a lachrymose writer for Variety is quoted as having called swing
            fans and musicians) to Ellington and Gonsalves, the both inclusive
            and improvisational music form would continue in the music of Miles
            Davis (who had no trouble dipping into Spanish music traditions for
            &quot;Sketches in Spain,&quot; or in the emerging rock-and-roll form
            to help create the controversial &quot;jazz fusion&quot; movement),
            Thelonious Monk (deeply mysterious in person, but a genius at the
            keyboard), and Dave Brubeck (whose playing had the clear, precise
            beauty of an Einstein equation, or a painting by Picasso or Joan Miró);
            the scat-singing of Ella Fitzgerald (who, like Billie Holiday, has
            been much imitated, never duplicated); the expansive, crystal, lunar
            performances by pianist Keith Jarrett (who played just as darn long
            as he wanted to, and he did so, too); and on up to such present-day
            icons as Herbie Hancock, Marian McPartland, Pat Metheny, Gato
            Barbieri, and the Marsalises, &quot;pere&quot; and &quot;fils.&quot;
            To name a few. (You can throw in Kenny G., too. If you want to.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Some years ago, a friend of mine,
            who said that his wife played with a local jazz group, was told by
            someone that, well, that was just fine, if only &quot;everyone
            played together.&quot; My friend was polite but, understandably,
            chagrined by this response. What's great about jazz is that
            everybody can play it, that everybody can play it together, and that
            it can go wherever it goes, be what it will, and the form still
            holds together. Chet Baker could jam on short notice with Dave
            Brubeck, as he did at the 1955 Newport Jazz Festival, or with Van
            Morrison and Elvis Costello, as he did at Ronnie Scott's in the
            mid-1980s. Michel Legrand could make recordings with Miles Davis (in
            both the Fifties and the Nineties), Lena Horne, or Jessye Norman.
            Davis, in turn, could record, with a quartet of musicians, the music
            for Louis Malle's Elevator to the Gallows over the course of two
            nights, nothing written down in advance, in a screening room (and
            all the tracks have been issued on CD to prove it).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jazz is capable of great
            raucousness and intensely personal expressions. Wynton Marsalis
            calls it &quot;the soul of our nation,&quot; while Albert Murray
            describes it as music that &quot;always moves in the direction of
            elegance, which is the most civilized thing a human being can do.
            The ultimate extension, elocution, and refinement of effort is
            elegance, where just doing it gives pleasure of itself. That's about
            as far as we can get by Life.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And, as Keith David says in the
            narration for <i>Jazz</i>, &quot;Above all, it swings.&quot; During
            the three times I saw the preview tape, my foot never stopped
            keeping time with the music.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
