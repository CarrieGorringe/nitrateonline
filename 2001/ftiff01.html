<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Row upon row of grim-faced individuals
clustered around every spare TV around Avenue Road, and Cumberland Terrace. The
same individuals with their cells jammed more tightly to their ears than normal
(&quot;normal&quot; being defined in the entertainment world as eighteen hours a
day), making cell signals more valuable than the necklaces being sold at
Bulgari's around the corner on Bloor Street. These are probably the most lasting
images of this year's film festival. After Tuesday the eleventh, the festival
became irrelevant, even to the staff; press screenings weren't cancelled that
day until 2:00 p.m., possibly because those in charge were, understandably, so
overwhelmed by grief that the idea that the festival should just cancel itself
and not bother them in doing so was the best means of dealing with this
overwhelming situation. Director Leon Ichaso rightfully cancelled the screening
of his film, <i>Piñero</i>, some twenty-five minutes into the film (from the
minor amount of footage made available to those of us in the audience, Benjamin
Bratt's performance in the title role looks promising). Our presence in that
theatre could presumably be attributed to thoughtlessness or indifference to the
horrible events unfolding elsewhere, but many of us there (myself included)
probably wanted nothing more than a temporary diversion from it all, an
opportunity for recovery (after walking around in an emotional haze for two
hours, doing something -- anything -- became an ever-increasing necessity), and
a refusal -- however insignificant -- to allow terrorists any sort of victory.</font></p>

usual glitzy, insouciant (a.k.a. pre-September 11) self remains a question mark.</span></font></p>
