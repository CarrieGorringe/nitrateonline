            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>Say It Isn't So</b></i><b>,
            the latest entry in the new American film School of Rotten Comedy,
            casts Chris Klein as Gilly, a guy who finally finds love in the form
            of Jo, played by Heather Graham, only to encounter an inordinate
            obstacle to their romance in the form of the possibility that they
            just might be -- gasp! -- brother and sister. Anybody expecting this
            to turn out be a sweet, sensitive comedy-drama on the subject,
            though, had better go elsewhere.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Trying to hit the
            so-gross-it's-cool target as many times as possible, the filmmakers
            fill every inch of the movie with bile, turning it into an
            increasingly rancorous and putrefying carnival sideshow. Kline's
            Gilly is an Illinois animal control officer who lures household pets
            into traps so they can keep the solitary animals at the shelter
            company. Graham's Jo turns out to be a hair stylist who can't cut
            hair. Her and Gilly's &quot;meet-cute&quot; occurs when she
            accidentally cuts part of his ear off with her scissors.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jo's mother is a white-trash
            harridan (played by Sally Field, of all people), her father (Richard
            Jenkins) a paralytic stroke victim who issues curses through an
            electronic voice box. The &quot;<i>pièces de résistance</i>&quot;
            include his being hauled around like a piece of lumber and dropped,
            several times; Gilly disguising himself with body hair that was
            actually removed during bikini-waxings; another of the characters
            turning into a paralytic stroke victim; and Jo climbing up onto the
            roof of a building and holding a gun to her head.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In between, there's a parade of
            greasy, toothless, pockmarked, and otherwise malformed faces,
            insults, and humiliating situations, each one trying to top whatever
            had just gone before. After a while, you find yourself cringing,
            like a Dickensian schoolboy being caned, in anticipation of what's
            going to come next.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Jo,
            distraught, flees Illinois for the town of Beaver, Oregon, which is
            festooned with signs for the &quot;Beaver Police&quot;, a salon
            called &quot;Beaver Cuts&quot;, etc. Gilly drives all night to be
            with her, but hits a man on the road who has one, no, make that two
            prosthetic legs. Naturally, they become good friends (the guy is
            played by comedian Orlando Jones, who manages, in some scenes, to
            actually rise above the circumstance).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In order to keep the story going,
            the film has to turn everybody into either an imbecile, a cretin, or
            both, which becomes tiring; and both the film and its characters
            constantly dump on Gilly and Jo. Chris Klein and Heather Graham
            happen to be two of the most naturally charismatic performers
            working in films today, and to have to watch them making their way
            through the increasingly cruddy material is hard enough. That the
            filmmakers take the further step of using their appeal to make them
            look risible is inexcusable. The two actors become objects of scorn
            because they're not as repulsive as everyone else around them. The
            apex occurs when Klein's character, who has already suffered about
            forty million insults (&quot;Sweet Jesus, you ponied your
            sister!&quot;) and indignities for committing incest (which, it
            turns out, he didn't do, and this is made clear very early on),
            becomes pinned like a butterfly on mounting paper when he gets his
            hand stuck in a cow: he stands, speechless and helpless, in public
            while people on both sides of a city street simply stand and jeer at
            him, over and over. Aside from the fact that it's not funny, I
            happen to know for a fact that no self-respecting citizen of an
            Oregon town would ever allow something as cruel as that to happen
            without intervening. But that's what happens when these consarned
            filmmakers from out-of-state barge into town.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Oddly enough, I found myself
            ineluctably remembering Joseph N. Welch's remark to Senator Joseph
            McCarthy during the 1954 Army/McCarthy hearings, the remark that
            would break McCarthy's career, &quot;Have you no sense of decency,
            sir...?&quot; The film <i>Say It Isn't So</i> has no dignity, no
            decency, no shame, no sense of morality one way or the other, and no
            sense of humor. It isn't nothing; it's worse than nothing.</font>
