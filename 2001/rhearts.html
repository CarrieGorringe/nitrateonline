            review by <a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>, 21 September
            2001</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In the immediate aftermath of
            the terrorist attacks that have ripped our guts out, most, but not
            all, civilized people have had little reason to escape the security
            of their homes for blithe entertainment at a neighborhood theater.
            Most press screenings were cancelled in the days and week that
            followed the tragedies; indeed openings of several films have been
            postponed indefinitely in the hope that time will heal the emotional
            wounds inflicted on all of us. For my wife and I, our need for a
            personal escape from the televised madness and the devastating
            numbness of post traumatic syndrome was based in a singular romantic
            event -- our twenty-fifth wedding anniversary -- that fell the day
            after the nightmarish events began. We stubbornly headed out for
            dinner and a preview screening, albeit one with few other souls in
            the house, of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Hearts in
            Atlantis</i>. It was the perfect tonic to soothe our crushed
            spirits. And I'm not saying that because it helped us forget the
            world outside. I had already seen the film twice before -- it was
            love at first sight. Castle Rock/Warner Bros. pushed back the
            initial nationwide public previews to the following Friday and
            Saturday, all the better to build positive word of mouth.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I'll add my rousing drumbeat…if
            you like the &quot;gentler&quot; side of Stephen King (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Shawshank Redemption</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Green Mile</i>, and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Stand by
            Me</i>), you'll love <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Hearts in
            Atlantis</i>, marvelously adapted by Academy Award-winning
            screenwriter and author William Goldman (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">All
            the President's Men</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Butch
            Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</i>), who is no stranger to the master
            of horror's appeal. He transformed <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Misery</i>
            into one hell of an entertaining film. With <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Hearts</i>
            he adds another feather in his well-adapted hat, compressing
            elements from two of King's stories that appeared in the collection
            of the same title (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Low Men in Yellow Coats</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Heavenly
            Shades of Night Are Falling</i>). The latter seventeen-pager is used
            as the film's framing device that introduces us to fifty-something
            Robert Garfield (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Green Mile</i>'s
            David Morse), a world-renowned photographer with a shelf filled with
            his coffee-table books and an aging picture of an angel -- a relic
            that eventually finds a new, heart-rending home in his past.
            Returning to his home town to attend a funeral, he journeys back
            forty years to the morning of his eleventh birthday and the magical
            seasons that follow. Astute readers of King will recognize his
            universal appeal as a master storyteller and the destiny-tinged
            elements that envelope his characters. Add in a stranger's
            supernatural touch and you will notice the obvious similarities
            between this film and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Green Mile</i>. Goldman graciously retains most of the original's
            bones, adjusting several of the peripheral elements in fleshing out
            the main characters and changing the perception of some of the
            book's gifts in favor of dramatic structure. He pumps up the mystery
            of the &quot;low men&quot; that threaten Anthony Hopkins' Ted
            Brautigan by removing their brightly colored overcoats and making
            them noirish shadows in a conspiratorial landscape. And he helps
            cement the love of a young boy for his deceased father by replaying
            a seminal, courageous moment in 1940s football history involving
            humble Hall of Famer Bronko Nagurski.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In that particular scene, director
            Scott Hicks (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Shine</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Snow Falling on Cedars</i>), douses the ambient room sound in favor of
            muted crowd cheers, subliminally intoxicating the viewer and
            grabbing you into the 1960 world of Bobby Garfield and the
            recently-arrived upstairs boarder, denizens of the seemingly
            carefree suburban Connecticut town of Harwich, Connecticut (with
            several Virginia communities subbing nicely for the period
            evocation). He closes the camera in on his two actors (Hopkins and
            Anton Yelchin), pulling engaging performances from the Oscar-winning
            star and the youngster opposite him. Hicks uses the inspiration
            found in this film's moments to reinforce Bobby's resolve later on,
            to call up an inner strength in saving a friend's life.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hicks likes to skillfully hush his
            soundtrack in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Hearts</i>'
            destiny-bending framework, but he doesn't overwork the effect. It's
            as delicate as the wind chime that tinkles on the front porch; as
            strong as the trains that whistle down the tracks nearby. Hicks is
            also busy adding old time favorites from The Platters, Fats Domino,
            Chuck Berry, and others to liven up the score and help move the
            moderate pace. As for the thespian talent in this microcosmic human
            drama, every one of key roles is filled with a perfect match. And
            Hicks guides them flawlessly, in much the same manner that fellow
            Aussie director Peter Weir handles his award-winning actors. Hopkins
            imbues his quietly gentlemanly stranger with a subdued contagious
            affliction, managing order out of the hounding chaos closing in on
            him, keeping his new friends safe from harm while trying to save his
            own spirituality. He's even willing to engage in a bit of flatulent
            humor, although less than in King's story. The enchantment of his
            performance is how well he underplays the role, particularly when
            Ted's other-worldly spells freeze his vacant-eyed glaze and drop his
            mouth open just so much. Yelchin and Mika Boorem (who were featured
            together in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">Along Came a
            Spider</i>)
            are blossoming talents. Yelchin's Bobby is an innocent curly-haired
            child brought face to face with danger, with only one adult's
            affection and the eternal puppy love of Carol Gerber (Boorem, aka
            Mel Gibson's daughter in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Patriot</i>), the girl-up-the-street, to guide him through troubled
            times. There is just the right amount of angst and wonder in
            Yelchin's expressions and old-beyond-her-young-years' strength in
            Boorem's angelic looks, allowing these children equal theatrical
            footing opposite elder statesman Hopkins. Hope Davis, one of my
            favorite character actresses, is Bobby's self-absorbed mother Liz, a
            bitter widow forever misplacing blame for her fate on the shoulders
            of her late husband -- a liability since transferred onto her son.
            She flits about the screen a matriarch in name only, a shapely yet
            garish Marilyn Monroe amalgam of blonde hair and red lips looking
            for love in all the wrong places. Other small parts are filled well
            by Celia Weston as a woman with a lovely laugh and kind words for
            Bobby's father, and by Alan Tudyk (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">A
            Knight's Tale</i>) as a sniveling carnival card-shuffling monte man.<o:p>

            Including the late Polish cinematographer Piotr Sobocinski's
            intimate camerawork. He helps us recall a childhood of glistening
            brooks and small town amusements, while also heralding the film's
            increasing sense of doom with dark, steamy visions of the &quot;low
            men,&quot; those ruthless boogeymen that haunt the murky urban
            streets in search of their prey. Composer Mychael Danna, who
            regularly scores Atom Egoyan's films, keeps the notes simple in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Hearts</i>,
            often resorting to a sparse yet winning piano track.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the end, we are left with that
            incredible wistful sadness of how life isolates us from our past and
            those childhood friends that are lost through the ravages of time.
            Those missed opportunities are the stuff that make <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Hearts
            in Atlantis</i> a cautionary, yet soothing, tale. Its hope lies in
            allowing us to find a way to rebuild ourselves out of the ashes of
