            move fast in Time and Tide. Tsui Hark's buddy-action movie is all
            about keeping up. If you're not wild about one plot, you might find
            something to like in another, and if one male lead doesn't appeal to
            you, well, there's another. And if the first pregnant woman isn't so
            interesting, well, there is a second. And if none of these
            storylines is your cup of tea, no matter. Just watch and listen --
            the speed and color and tumult will carry you. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Time
            and Tide marks the Vietnamese-born Tsui Hark's return to Hong Kong
            after making a couple of Jean Claude Van Damme movies, Double Team
            (featuring Jean Claude and Dennis Rodman's unforgettable climactic
            tussle with a Coke machine) and Knock Off (which was actually shot
            in Hong Kong, with Rob Schneider and Lela Rochon alongside the
            scrappy Van Damme, who plays a fashion designer --
            &quot;strange&quot; doesn't begin to describe it). The new movie is
            surely less strained than the U.S. productions, but it is a
            curiosity in itself, brimming with themes, in-jokey references, and
            desires, not all of which are crystal clear. Then again, this
            loosey-goosey verve has a certain offbeat appeal. Its buddies and
            action are too irregular to be predictable, and yet they also fit
            something approximating a formula -- boys-bonding, boys-ass-kicking,
            boys-finally-realizing-the-importance-of-family-and-friends.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            buddies are twenty-one-year old bartender turned bodyguard-for-hire
            Tyler (the Cantonese pop star Nicholas Tse, who also appeared in
            1998's Young and Dangerous: The Prequel and 1999's Gen X Cops) and
            Jack (Taiwanese rock star Wu Bai), a young Taiwanese mercenary who
            spent some time in Brazil training government soldiers, before
            returning home disillusioned. Tyler and Jack's affiliation is
            accidental, but their loyalty to one another grows exponentially, in
            relation to the overwhelming firepower visited on them by Jack's
            former associates, led by the surly Miguel (Couto Remotigue, Jr.).
            These guys, you learn through flashbacks, seem able to take out
            armies without breaking a sweat -- not exactly guys you want to mess
            with if you can help it. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Of
            course, messing with them is inevitable, though the route to this
            confrontation is convoluted. The film opens with Tyler, working at a
            bar and ruminating on the beginnings of the world. Within minutes of
            first appearing on screen, he's spent the night with an undercover
            lesbian cop, Jo (Cathy Chui), and she turns up pregnant. When he
            offers financial and emotional support, she turns him away. And so,
            the determined father-to-be is reduced to skulking around her
            apartment door, under which he repeatedly slips wads of cash (which
            are promptly chewed up by her dog). This money comes primarily from
            Tyler's new gig as a bodyguard, working for his Uncle Ji (Hong Kong
            movie-villain veteran Anthony Wong), whose other
            &quot;employees&quot; are scary thug-types who owe him money. Tyler
            looks relatively clean-cut compared to these guys, and he's
            certainly not so experienced in shooting guns and looking ferocious,
            but adapts quickly to his new environs and co-workers, and proves to
            be a super-crack shot and martial artist as well. Who knew? <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">One
            of Tyler's first assignments is to guard the influential triad boss
            Hong, whose estranged daughter Ah Hui (Candy Lo) has married Tyler's
            buddy-to-be, Jack. Tyler and Jack's coincidental meetings (there are
            a few jumbled together, including a chance meeting at a supermarket)
            lead to a serious male-bond, occasioned by the fact that Jack's
            former associates have arrived in town, looking to force his
            cooperation on one last job, namely, assassinating his
            father-in-law. When Jack resists, the big meanies kidnap Hui, who
            happens to be <b>very</b> pregnant at the time. Hui's condition
            reminds Tyler of his own idealized lady-love (the very one who wants
            nothing to do with him), and so he convinces himself that he must
            help Jack to rescue her. <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            search of a huge stash of money ($10 million) hidden in a locker at
            the Kowloon Train Station, everyone ends up at the station, where
            Hui goes into labor, her water splashes all over the floor as Tyler
            drags her to relative safety in a back room. He then works valiantly
            to help her give birth, and the scene is not a little awful: his
            arms are bloodied to his elbows, as her screams give away their
            position. Tyler soon realizes that someone needs to keep watch while
            he delivers the baby, and his drastically ingenious solution is to
            give Hui his gun, so that, between contractions, she can shoot down
            anyone who pokes his head in the doorway. While this image of the
            violent collision of life and death will remind some viewers of
            Christopher McQuarrie's much uglier version of same in Way of the
            Gun (and in Hong Kong last year, both movies were reportedly in
            release at the same time), it actually extends the metaphor, in that
            Hui does give birth and the infant becomes yet another element that
            Tyler must juggle while awaiting Jack's arrival on the scene.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            the above (incomplete) summary demonstrates, Hark's storylines (this
            one is scripted by Koan Hui) tend to be simultaneously fractured and
            lushly romantic (not unlike those of his Hong Kong action
            contemporaries, Wong Kar-wai and John Woo), and his attentions tend
            to focus on displacements and crises. He's best known for his <b>wuxia</b>
            pictures (Swordsman II and Dragon Inn) and his Once Upon a Time in
            China series with Jet Li, all of which display Hark's interests in
            brash stylistics as content: the actual narratives are less
            interesting than the techniques he comes up with to tell them.
            Together with co-cinematographers Ko Chiu Lam and Herman Yau, Hark
            here develops a peculiar hybrid of corny romance, bad FX (the
            burning building effect is straight-up lame), and seriously dynamic
            action scenes, all enhanced by fashionably jaggedy editing,
            time-lapse speediness, slow motion, and ridiculous (in the good way)
            camera angles. It's all like a tumultuous &quot;cine-wave&quot;
            heading for the shore; catch it, fashion the do-it-yourself
            narrative however you like, and don't think too much about what
            you're doing. <o:p>
