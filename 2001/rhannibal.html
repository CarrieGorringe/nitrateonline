            begins by reintroducing Hannibal Lecter. More accurately and
            appropriately, it reintroduces the idea of Hannibal Lecter as
            saleable product. At this moment, the buyer is a physically damaged
            and obviously obsessed collector of things Lecterian, one Mason
            Verger (Gary Oldman, unrecognizable under prosthetics and make-up).
            The seller is Lecter's former caretaker, Barney (Frankie Faison),
            who has kept a few items associated with the famous serial killer
            (for instance, the leather mask with the mean-looking little bars
            over the mouth, or tapes of conversations), and is looking to sell.
            Verger, being a fabulously wealthy and warped fellow, is the ideal
            client, disinterested in social, legal or moral questions, and
            willing to pay top dollar. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Verger
            might also be the ideal viewer for Ridley Scott's long-awaited
            sequel, which is premised on the belief that fans of the serial
            killer are slavering after anything connected with him. The ad
            campaign suggests as much -- you've waited for ten years and now, at
            last, he's returned to you. He's put on a few pounds, perhaps,
            having enjoyed something of a sedate life in Florence, where he
            actually keeps a job, looking after art in a library, but he's still
            the consummate connoisseur of all things fine and expensive and he
            still cannot abide &quot;rude people&quot; (in fact, he says, he
            prefers to kill them instead of polite ones). In short, he's much
            the same as the last time you saw him, in Jonathan Demme's 1991 <i>Silence
            of the Lambs</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>The
            same cannot be said for Clarice Starling, Lecter's
            adversary-cum-love interest. The last time you saw her, she was an
            FBI Agent-in-the-making, smart and vulnerable and played by Jodie
            Foster. In the opening scenes of <i>Hannibal</i>, Clarice is
            reintroduced as a ten-year veteran of the Bureau, still smart, only
            a little less vulnerable, and played by Julianne Moore (whose West
            Virginia doesn't have quite the brittle edge of her predecessor's,
            but who brings a certain graceful determination to her portrayal of
            this complicated character). Clarice is reintroduced while she's on
            the job, specifically, in charge of a career-making-or-breaking
            operation, the take-down of an international drug dealer, Evelda
            Drumgo (Hazelle Goodman). That the dealer is a stereotypically evil
            hard-case is bad enough. But it's also troubling plot-wise that this
            business is set to take place in a crowded outdoor marketplace
            (supposedly in DC, but a Richmond, Virginia public market stands
            in), at midday, while Evelda is surrounded by heavily armed
            bodyguards and toting a baby in a carrier on her chest suggests that
            perhaps it hasn't been so well-planned by those in charge, including
            Clarice, but... the movie is clearly looking for a dramatic intro
            for our hero, and this would be it. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Even
            before the operation goes inevitably and terribly wrong, Clarice's
            authority is challenged by the local cops, who sneer at her
            girlishness and resent her cold efficiency (she actually sleeps in
            the van on the way to the bust, suggesting that she's adopted some
            of the deadly calm for which Lecter is so well-known). It appears
            that she has become an effective fed in the years since her first
            encounter with Lecter made her famous (early in the film she
            receives notice from the <i>Guinness Book of World Records</i> that
            she holds the record as the female who has shot and killed the most
            people, a grim form of notoriety, to be sure). But that only makes
            her superiors madder at her -- and when they have the chance to nail
            her for the Drumgo fiasco, they do. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Her
            punishment takes the form of a very particular duty, namely,
            reassignment to the Lecter case; as he puts it to her, he has
            &quot;returned to public life.&quot; It's not long before you see
            that this reunion of Clarice and Hannibal is part of an elaborate
            revenge plot by Verger, who is the only survivor of one of Lecter's
            assaults (as a flashback informs us, Lecter somehow seduced the gay
            Verger to cut off his own face, which Lecter feeds to Verger's dogs
            -- the word &quot;gruesome&quot; doesn't begin to describe it, arty
            as its depiction may be). Understandably holding a grudge, Verger
            now hopes to bait Lecter by dangling Clarice before him. &quot;It's
            distress that excites him,&quot; observes this measly mastermind,
            upon which he engineers Clarice's distress, over her strained
            relationship to the Bureau and bad memories of her &quot;white
            trash&quot; upbringing (and yes, all this is terribly familiar from <i>Silence
            of the Lambs</i> -- the girl needs to move on, already). The primary
            instrument for these machinations is a Justice Department wanker
            Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta), working for Verger &quot;on the
            inside&quot; in order to insure Clarice will be in the dire
            professional and emotional straits necessary to entice Lecter step
            up to save her. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            this sense, the film works as a romance, with Clarice slowly
            devolving into a damsel in need of rescuing and Hannibal evolving
            into a man of (admittedly bizarre) conscience and propriety. Their
            coupling doesn't take precisely the turn laid out in Thomas Harris'
            best-selling novel, <i>Hannibal</i>, as Steven Zaillian's adaptation
            necessarily omits and changes some episodes, but the movie flirts
            with the possibility of having them &quot;hook up.&quot; For the
            first half and then some, the film splits its time between
            continents, tracking the activities of Clarice in DC and Lecter in
            Florence, where (paralleling Clarice's harassment by law enforcement
            types) he's being pursued by a Detective Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini).
            Poor Pazzi clearly has no idea whom he's dealing with, foolishly
            imagining that he will win Verger's three million-dollar reward,
            despite Clarice's warnings that the doctor will kill him. No
            surprise, this subplot leads to a grisly end for the hapless Pazzi
            and, finally, finally, the much anticipated encounter between
            Hannibal and Clarice by cell phone. And you've heard this so many
            times in commercials for the film that you're probably hearing it in
            your sleep by now, in Anthony Hopkins' unmistakable purr:
            &quot;Hello, Clarice...&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like
            the rest of the film, this scene is grandly atmospheric, Lecter lit
            from beneath so he looks like an old-fashioned movie monster, his
            victim gurgling and sweating in front of him, and Clarice icy and
            fierce on her end of the phone call. All this atmosphere, however,
            can be distracting. Don't get me wrong -- this is a beautiful movie,
            artfully composed by Scott and cinematographer John Mathieson, full
            of sinister shadows and filtered light, slow motion dream-like
            moments, and ceiling fans in almost every interior space, in the
            Italian library, in the FBI offices, in Verger's cavernous mansion,
            right alongside the multiple super-high-tech monitors he has hanging
            over his bed (why all the ceiling fans? I don't know, but they look
            great and make for an aptly ooky sound effect). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's
            pretty, but there's something a little too precious about all this
            magnificence. In part, it's serving the hyped up expectations of the
            film, not to mention the high-stakes players involved -- Scott's
            coming off <i>Gladiator</i>, Hopkins is an Oscar winner (for this
            role the first time), and the specter of <i>Silence</i> looms large.
            <i>Hannibal</i> probably can't help but fall short of expectations,
            yet some of its particular failings are annoying. Slow-moving as his
            story is, Lecter is like an upscale Freddy Krueger, the monster
            turned into celebrity, romantic icon, and merchandise. <i>Hannibal</i>
            doesn't even use slasher film conventions to its advantage (there's
            a scene toward the end that recalls the infamous family dinner in <i>The
            Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i>, but the <i>Hannibal</i> version lacks
            the comedic outrageousness of Tobe Hooper's masterpiece). But with
            Lecter looking so clearly supreme, Clarice looks a little feeble
            (even swoony), and their relationship is depleted of its once-ripe
            tension.</font><o:p>
