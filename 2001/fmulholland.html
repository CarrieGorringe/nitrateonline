Interview with Justin Theroux<br>
</font></span><i><font size="1" face="Verdana">interview by

<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700"><font size="2">Justin 
Theroux wears all black. Black jeans, black t-shirt, black leather jacket, 
heavily black-rimmed glasses. He smokes cigarettes he rolls himself. He's sort 
of hipster-punk, exponentially cool and more than a little wary of the business 
he's in. All this makes sense, if you know that he came up in and around 
Washington DC's punk scene, listening to Black Flag, Minor Threat, and Fugazi. 
Nowadays, the Bennington College graduate is a New York-based actor, probably 
best known for his work on CBS's <i>The District</i>, but more inclined to talk 
about his other work, on stage in NYC and in films, for example, Mary Harron's
<i>I Shot Andy Warhol</i> and <i>American Psycho</i>. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Theroux isn't eager to be a 
movie star, and so he picks parts that appease his restless sense of art, for 
instance, his latest, in David Lynch's </font></span><font size="2"><i>
<span style="font-family: Verdana">Mulholland Drive</span></i></font><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">. 
As Adam, the film director within the film, Theroux plays essentially two roles, 
the first a hapless victim of Lynchian circumstances, the second a skuzzy 
Hollywood player, sleeping with his leading lady, Rita (Laura Elena Harring), 
egged on by his insider mom, Coco (the alarming Ann Miller), and resented by his 
girlfriend's girlfriend, Betty (Naomi Watts). Though Adam has some of the 
stranger scenes in the film (see especially, his encounter with The Cowboy), it 
is focused on and through the women's perspectives. And that's where Theroux and 
I started.</font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>Cynthia Fuchs: </b>
</i>What's your take on Lynch's &quot;women characters&quot;?</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>Justin Theroux: </b>
</i>I know he gets flack for the way he portrays women, but if anything, I think 
he puts them on pedestals. He loves women. I think he's of the school of say, a 
Fellini, in that he realizes that he is male and has a strong libido, and so 
he's exploring <i>that</i>. It's all done very respectfully, and in the case of 
this movie, it's two women who love each other. He's very disappointed at the 
fact that it's getting all this &quot;hot lesbo&quot; press, because that's a really 
boring way to think about the film. I mean, the number of times I've been asked, 
&quot;Hey, were you on set for the girl on girl action?&quot; For chrissakes, it's so 
boring. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>That 
might play the other way too. The second time I saw </font></span>
<font size="2"><i><span style="font-family: Verdana">Mulholland Drive</span></i></font><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">, 
was with a queer film festival audience, who seemed to appreciate the strong 
characters and at the same time, the camp aspects of the film. </font></span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>JT: </b></i>I think 
that people have gotten over themselves since the <i>Basic Instinct</i> days, 
especially in the gay community, as far as being oversensitive not sensitive: 
there's room for everything at this point. To me, this is a tragic love story, 
between one character who's very powerless and another who's very powerful. I 
think it's an interesting set-up, whether it's male-female, two women, or two 
men. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>These two 
women seem especially aware of their embodiedness, their own relations to their 
bodies and the ways they are perceived as bodies. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>JT: </b></i>Exactly. 
And Lynch gets flack for having these dolled-up, red-lipsticked women, but if 
you look at his films carefully, you see that they're not just that. They're 
sweater girls, big fat girls, Laura Dern, a whole gamut of women in his movies. 
Same again, as Fellini, the mothers, prostitutes, and nuns, a whole spectrum.
</font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>How did 
this movie happen for you? </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>JT: </b></i>I'm not a 
big Lynch-head, and my house isn't covered with Lynchiana. But I obviously was a 
fan, and so I was excited. But it was a circuitous route to get the job. I had 
to be put on tape in New York just sort of answering questions, like &quot;Where'd 
you go to school?&quot; &quot;What do you read?&quot; General interest, boring questions. Then 
they sent him that tape and months went by. And I almost didn't even make that 
tape, because I thought, they're looking for a personality, you don't even 
audition. Then I got this call to go to LA, the next day, to meet him at his 
house. And I thought, well, if nothing else, I'll get to meet David Lynch. We 
had coffee, and it was the most wonderful meeting, because there was no one 
else, no casting directors, no other actors, just literally, coffee with David 
Lynch. We didn't even talk about the film, but about his painting, because I 
used to be a painter in college (I was a double major in drama and visual art). 
He showed me his photographs, and then he gave me the job. It was completely 
stress-free. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>And at 
that point had you read the script? </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>JT: </b></i>Yes, I 
had read it on the plane going out. Knowing his canon, I wasn't fearful about 
how it would turn out. I knew it would be something wonderful. His scripts 
themselves are kind of flat, they don't leap off the page. What he does is 
sound, tempo, color, that's where it fills in. And after I had the job, I got to 
ask all the questions I wanted to ask, which he just didn't answer. And I like 
that about him: it's your job to figure it out. I thought, as an actor, that 
you'd be let into that door, where he'd help you figure something out, but no. 
He actually does the actor a tremendous service, because in life, we don't know 
what's going to happen or how you might react to something. In a perfect world, 
David would probably not even let us read the scripts ahead of time. He'd just 
give us the scenes that day. All the intellectual aspect of making a film is 
stripped away. I mean, he'll answer questions that seem really pertinent when 
you're shooting, but for questions like &quot;Who is The Cowboy?&quot; or &quot;Is Adam making 
a good film?&quot; , he won't necessarily answer those. It's all whittled down to 
sort of Acting 101: just be in the scene, play the emotion, and react to what's 
being said. If he had been a first time director I might have been a little 
skeptical, but again, there's nothing courageous on my part about being in this 
film. I imagine that for the guy in <i>Eraserhead</i> [Jack Nance], that was a 
courageous performance because he didn't who the hell David Lynch was! </font>
</span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>There's a 
perpetual sliding in Lynch's films, between male and female characters and 
characteristics. Here that takes a structural form, because at first, it looks 
like it might be Adam's story. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>JT: </b></i>Right, 
and it ends up being the women's film, and more specifically, Betty's film, from 
her perspective. And, it takes this turn at the end that leaves everything 
leading up to that, which is the majority of my work, in question. So it's not 
just David projecting his ideas on what Hollywood is, it's really David 
projecting through this girl, her ideas of Hollywood, the City of Dreams. 
There's a communion back and forth between the audience, David, the characters. 
It's a never-ending rotation of moods and impressions. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>Do you 
have a different process as you work inside that than for a straight-ahead 
narrative? </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>JT: </b></i>I think 
actors protect themselves, especially when they're working with bad directors. 
They want to have as much control over their performance as possible, to clearly 
express certain things, because they're not sure what's going to happen in the 
editing. With David, you trust him so implicitly, that all that can kind of fall 
away. And you can just trust that whatever he edits in or out is going to be 
valuable. So it was a totally different way of working. It was like working with 
a painter, or just an artist, because at the end of the day, that sort of what 
he is, an auteur, a composer. Most directors are technicians, they come from the 
world of music videos or car commercials, or the stage. So they're good at 
getting the right angles and finishing on time, which can be frustrating. 
Whereas David really takes his time and doesn't let any of the technical end 
infect the creative part. He's on such a one-to-one basis with everybody on the 
set, there's no pecking order, none of this big trailer, small trailer, or 
&quot;You're the prop guy,&quot; and &quot;You're the PA,&quot; or &quot;You bring my coffee.&quot; Everyone 
is on the same footing, and he tunes everyone into that frequency. He's an 
incredibly calm presence, and is able to focus people, as to what we're all 
doing together, to the point where the film almost makes itself. It really is an 
amazing process. It's almost like, when you do see the film, you're impressed, 
that you were part of making it. And it doesn't really ring true to what was on 
set, you know, you see and think, &quot;That's really dark!&quot; </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>But it 
doesn't seem particular to Hollywood, the darkness in this film. </font></span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>JT: </b></i>David 
doesn't have an axe to grind. He's a very Zen guy, he meditates a lot, he's very 
in touch with who David is. So what he's really exploiting , I think, with all 
the aspects of his films -- violence, love, compassion, lust -- are things that 
take place in his subconscious. When he writes, he dictates into a recorder. He 
tries to clear his mind and catch ideas, that's how he puts it. Like, &quot;I'm a 
fisherman and I put a net into the water, and I pull it. Sometimes there's fish 
and sometimes there's nothing.&quot; He really is kind of culling his subconscious. 
His films move like dreams. There's a logic to dreams that doesn't necessarily 
follow linear narrative. You don't know why things happen, it's your 
subconscious pushing you, to give you information. David's films, like dreams, 
do tell you something with incredibly powerful imagery. </font></span>
<font size="2"><i><span style="font-family: Verdana">Mulholland Drive</span></i></font><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
in particular, is this woman's take on Hollywood, and the way in which Hollywood 
moves her around and the way she moves Hollywood around. And at the same time, 
there are scenes you could call non-sequiturs or Maguffins, if you're sort of 
being cynical: what is the blue box, who is the woman in the veil? But these are 
just symbols that your subconscious gives you all the time -- not these 
particular symbols, but the general sense of symbols. Although they don't 
necessarily add to the narrative content, they do add to the tonal content of a 
dream life. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>His films 
and the performances in them also seem very economical. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>JT: </b></i>That's 
true. In terms of just practical direction, he's very simple. He won't create 
massive back story and doesn't want you to do it either. He's more like, &quot;In 
this scene, your film is being taken away from you, and you'd be really angry.&quot; 
Or you can get even simpler: &quot;David, on a scale of 1 to 10, how angry am I?&quot; And 
he'll think for a minute and say, &quot;You're 8 and a half, maybe 9.&quot; Which is 
perfect, if I'm thinking, &quot;Who is the Cowboy?&quot; the scene isn't going to play. 
CF: Not everyone would feel fine with that kind of minimalism. How did you come 
to this sense of yourself, as an actor?</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>JT: </b></i>Well, I 
grew up in DC, was tossed out of several schools, and then I found this great 
sort of liberal arts boarding school in Williamstown, Massachusetts, a 
chop-wood, carry-water kind of environment, a wonderful socialist environment, 
where the students made the meals and cut the grass. And then I went to 
Bennington and studied drama and visual arts. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>Did you 
know early that you wanted to act? </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>JT: </b></i>No, I 
sort of did my first sort of professional-ish job in Washington, a play, when I 
was about 14, and then at this high school in Williamstown, we did a lot of 
plays and toured with them. Great plays, not <i>Lil Abner</i> type shows, but 
Gogol and <i>Rhinocerous</i>, pretty highbrow. We'd take them to Washington and 
to Mexico City. And I was interested in painting, so in college I decided to 
pursue both. Then when I got to New York, I thought, I have two very useless 
talents, I'll see which one sticks. And actually, painting was paying the bills 
first. I was doing murals and billboards. Then I got a job in a play and that 
started taking over my life. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>I have to 
ask you at least one question about <i>The District</i>, which, on its face, 
seemed like a really bad idea when it first aired. And while I still have 
doubts, I have to say, when you started sleeping with Ensign Ro [Michelle 
Forbes], the show took a turn for me. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>JT: </b></i>[laughs] 
Well, I've been released from my contract, but in a good way. It was mutual . 
I'm doing six episodes this year. It's fun to work at that pace, in tv, but it's 
frustrating, because there's a glass ceiling as to how creative it can be. So 
quality-wise, it suffers a lot. It has to do with where my interests lie. I'd 
much rather be doing a good play for $300 a week than episode television for a 
bazillion dollars a week. I did it, I made some money last year, and the show's 
good, but it meant uprooting from New York and going to Los Angeles, and they 
didn't really know what to do with my character. So I was sort of standing in 
scenes holding cups of coffee, saying, &quot;I can't spin this,&quot; or, &quot;You may not 
want to hear this, Chief,&quot; and I sort of became high-paid furniture. So I think 
it's better that they have me on an episode by episode basis, because then when 
they do use me, I'm used in a way that's more meaningful. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>So it 
sounds like you're not looking for the next Jim Cameron movie? </font></span>
</p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>JT: </b></i>It's such 
a tightrope that you walk, as an actor, because you have no choices, until you 
are Jim Carrey or someone like that. Even then, when you're at a certain height, 
the fall can be even greater, so you start choosing really safe projects. It's 
just because, film is an expensive medium. So I'm getting by right now on a lot 
of faith, thinking, okay, I'll be all right, hoping that something will always 
materialize. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>It also 
seems like there are options that aren't mainstream, on cable or wherever.
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>JT: </b></i>And 
that's just beginning to be cracked, there's more room to grow there, as the 
medium hopefully will become less and less dependent on commercial breaks, and 
more on subscriptions. Which would mean less money for actors and producers, but 
at the same time, quality can skyrocket. It's a terrible thing -- I'm pointing 
out the obvious, but -- when soda companies determine content. </font></span>
</p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>How can 
you tell when you look at something that you want to do it? I mean, with Lynch, 
you see his name and you sign up. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>JT: </b></i>Right, 
because he always has control over his material, you know there's quality 
control. But 99.9 percent of the time, the script is nothing to go by, because 
it's all subject to change, and will change. You do one week on <i>The District</i> 
and get seven drafts of the script before you shoot. It's mind-boggling, the 
things you can and cannot do. We had one line that was about Starbucks, that you 
couldn't say, and I had a line where I was supposed to say &quot;NRA,&quot; and I couldn't 
say &quot;NRA,&quot; and it wasn't clear if it was going to piss them off or make them 
happy or piss off anti-gun people. I don't know what it was. But anything that 
might alienate <i>anyone</i> is removed from the script. And you can't really 
make good art without alienating people. Any strong or good or worthwhile art 
movement alienates people first, and then sort of includes them. People have gag 
reflexes first, they're resistant to change, especially when it comes to art.</font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>And that 
raises the next question, what does it mean to &quot;sell out&quot;? Is there an 
identifiable line that you cross? </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>JT: </b></i>I grew up 
in the punk scene in DC, which was a pro-active movement. It was fun and you 
felt like you were being edgy and you <i>were</i> sort of weird -- this was when 
Mohawks and piercings were sort of the norm, you know. But eventually, they get 
found out, these good things, by corporations, by MTV. I remember when I used to 
go over the water, from DC to Virginia, and the kids would change. There would 
be mullets and Iron Maiden t-shirts, just a 20-minute walk over the bridge could 
completely alter the environment. Now, when I go around, in airports and malls 
or on the streets, it's all completely the same. The corporations have figured 
out a way to link them all, make them all want the same thing, but still think 
that there's choice. We used to take great pleasure in taking our white t-shirts 
and a big magic marker and writing &quot;Dead Kennedys&quot; or whatever on them, then 
putting them on and marching down the street and pissing people off. And if 
someone had actually gone out and bought a Dead Kennedys t-shirt, it would have 
been heretical. Now, kids look at that and say, &quot;How could you make a shirt? It 
looks like shit.&quot; So now, kids have these $45 shirts, and my mom bought it for 
me. So there's a difference. Even the alternative kids love a brand new pair of 
Nikes. It's unfortunate: unless you hit your television with a sledgehammer, 
you're not going to be able to be an individual. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>Do you 
think it'll swing back at any point? </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>JT: </b></i>All the 
stuff with the WTO, the kids in Seattle throwing a bricks through Starbucks 
windows -- I see it as a good thing. It's saying, like &quot;Fuck you.&quot; As long as no 
one's killing one another, I don't think there's nothing wrong with throwing a 
brick through the window of McDonalds. Obviously, it's against the law and you 
go to court, if you get caught, but at the same time, I'm sort of inspired when 
I see people thinking like that. Obviously you don't want them to be 
hyper-violent, but any time you can bite at the ankles of people who are 
dictating your lives… You need to be reminded. It happens to me. I live near 
SoHo, and when you walk around, you're advertised to a thousand times a day. And 
now -- you might not know this -- but they're advertising on the urinals in 
men's rooms in New York. It's the thing you piss on, saying, like, &quot;Piss on me, 
but buy me!&quot; They're willing to literally be defecated on in order to sell a 
product.</font></span><font face="Verdana" size="2"> </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>And of 
course, the kids who protest the WTO know how it works too -- they get 
themselves on TV. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>JT: </b></i>Yeah, 
they know! Really the only way to do it is to have, in essence, a publicist. And 
that means you're reduced to a sound-bite. I remember at one of the conventions 
at the Staples Center in LA, they had a &quot;riot area&quot; -- like they say, &quot;You guys 
can riot there,&quot; and they bring the cameras over and say, &quot;See, there's the 
rioters.&quot; It's Brechtian. You've got to put on a show, to make people believe 
that they're &quot;the best.&quot; It's all choreographed. That's why I say, kill your 
television, because you can't not be influenced. No one has a powerful enough 
mind. When you watch tv, you're on that ride. It becomes more real than reality. 
I think that's why the World Trade Center bombing upset people, because there 
were six different camera angles of the plane hitting the building, and within a 
day, they had theme music to it. And then they shelved the Schwarzenegger movie, 
right away. You know, I'm not a fan of shelving movies -- I mean, I'm a fan of 
shelving <i>that</i> movie -- but I'm not a fan of shelving movies that have 
that content. So what? I think we need to tell stories that reflect our world. 
It's the old story of Michelangelo meeting the Pope, who was upset at the images 
of &quot;Hell,&quot; and Michelangelo said, &quot;My job is to paint the world, yours is to 
change it.&quot; We can be reflective in movies and television, but we can't be 
irresponsible. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>So, there 
is a function for what you do. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i><b>JT: </b></i>Yes, I 
take it seriously. I don't take it over-seriously. It's not going to feed 
starving nations or quell riots, but I do take it seriously when I choose roles. 
Obviously I've made decisions that could be considered &quot;sell out&quot; decisions, to 
do television, and those are things that I didn't think I would ever do when I 
was graduating college. It came down to: do I eat or do I not? But more and 
more, I'm starting to think, &quot;No, just don't eat.&quot; If a role doesn't come along, 
generate something for yourself that doesn't just feed into the rest of the 
system. I've been fortunate to be part of movies that I'm proud of, like Mary 
Harron's movies: I did two already and I'm in her next one. I've done numerous 
plays that I think are important. So I don't feel like I've completely 
compromised, though, I've contributed to selling numerous products that I don't 
necessarily subscribe to. I've sold cheeseburgers. But it's a question of how 
bad a sell out you are; there are degrees. It's the system we have, capitalism.
