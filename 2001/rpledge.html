            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 2 February 2001</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>At the beginning of <i>The
            Pledge</i>, Reno police detective Jerry Black (Jack Nicholson) is
            being given a retirement party by his friends in the department when
            a call comes in and several of his colleagues have to leave the
            festivities. Jerry volunteers to come along, but is told he doesn't
            have to. &quot;Ahhh, I've still got six more hours...,&quot; he
            replies.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the snowy mountains outside of
            town, they find the remains of a young girl who has been so badly
            mutilated that the officers who are already there can't figure out
            how they are going to convey to the news to the dead girl's parents.
            Jerry, who has had some experience in these matters, volunteers to
            perform the duty, but when he does so, the response by the girl's
            parents (Michael O'Keefe and Patricia Clarkson) affects him to the
            point where he assures them, committedly, that he will see to it
            that whoever did this terrible crime will be brought to justice.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Almost immediately afterward, a
            younger detective, Stan (Aaron Eckhart, back giving his Grade-A,
            number-one louse performance), interrogates a suspect who was seen
            near where the murder was committed. Mentally handicapped (and
            played, in unnervingly accurate fashion, by Benicio Del Toro), Stan
            delivers a confession from him, but Jerry is not convinced. &quot;No
            offense,&quot; Stan tells him, .&quot;..but you're retired. You
            don't work here anymore.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Only Jerry turns up evidence of a second, then a third, child
            murder, all previously committed, similar, and all unsolved, and he
            understandably<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>finds
            his associates' eagerness to &quot;close&quot; the current case
            off-putting. He made a promise, Jerry tells his department chief
            (Sam Shepard), adding, &quot;You're old enough to remember when that
            meant something.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Whether a subsequent comment by
            Stan -- &quot;Get a life!&quot; -- is meant to be directed at Jerry
            or not is left tantalizingly unclear. The odyssey that Jerry sets
            out upon shows us the little bits and moments that go towards only
            further tacking-down a determination such as the one Jerry has taken
            upon himself. The cavalier attitude of a cop (Costas Mandylor) in
            another town who confides that crime scene photos no longer affect
            him to any degree. A revelation, from the grandmother (Vanessa
            Redgrave, who is quietly and absolutely wonderful) of the most
            recent victim, about a story that was the girl's favorite --
            &quot;She loved Anderssen,&quot; the woman says, referring to the
            story's author, Hans Christian Anderssen. Then there's a moment when
            the father (Mickey Rourke) of another victim disassembles, showing
            his feelings nakedly about the murder, before quickly pulling
            himself back together.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jerry even turns what should have
            been his inaugural retirement vacation, at a prime rural fishing
            spot, into a stakeout, buying a gas station located in the nexus of
            where the three killings occurred. There is even some measure of
            domestic tranquility with a local waitress, Lori (Robin Wright
            Penn), and her young daughter, Chrissy (Pauline Roberts), who turn
            out to be in need of some protection already. The way in which the
            film handles this unusual transition, which considerably extends the
            timeframe of the story,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>is
            remarkable -- it could easily have shattered the picture's hold on
            us -- but the story, and Nicholson's performance, deepens instead,
            as we see how everything fits in with Jerry's consistent vigilance
            towards the person whom he is intent on capturing.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">He suspects that a local man could
            be it -- played, in an obvious bit of casting, by Tom Noonan, who I
            had thought had left these kind of typecasting roles behind when he
            played his psycho-killer-to-end-all-psycho-killers in <i>Last Action
            Hero</i>. His character fits the profile that Jerry has assembled of
            the perpetrator, and he talks to Chrissy on more than one occasion.
            The picture shows, unnervingly, that the way Jerry talks to Chrissy
            is not all that different from the way the killer would, except that
            while we are thoroughly convinced that Jerry is good (and he is
            indeed a good person), there is no way that a young girl like
            Chrissy could distinguish whether she is being taken into the
            confidence of a demon or not.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is your one opportunity, so
            far, to see Jack Nicholson reading a bedtime story to a child, but
            not to worry -- it is one of the most moving scenes in the picture.
            Sean Penn had previously directed Nicholson in <i>The Crossing Guard</i>
            -- another story about the death of a child and the profound,
            long-term effects of such a tragedy -- and he evidently has a good
            rapport with the actor. There are traces of the ironic, wolfish
            Nicholson on view, but these attributes take on a whole different
            purpose, here. As deeply thoughtful as the circles under his eyes
            and the low, soft timbre to his voice, Nicholson's portrayal of
            Jerry is both heroic and, as the film builds towards its conclusion,
            ultimately devastating. The film shows how people -- those around
            Jerry, those with whom he felt secure -- can be casually callous for
            inadvertent reasons, but they're still being callous nonetheless,
            and the effects are none the less for it. Should we always take
            people like Jerry seriously? Should we be too quick to judge? Some
            people don't, or can't, be totally understanding all the time, but
            the picture's conclusion shows the consequences of being too
            off-handed and quick-to-judge (and, I should add, not in a way that
            we would expect). The film presents its conclusion soberly, without
            sentiment, and it gives Nicholson a chance to, while not speaking
            and portraying Sophocles' words, to give a performance that is every
            bit as shattering as Oedipus Rex.</font>
