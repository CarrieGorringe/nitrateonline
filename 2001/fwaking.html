<meta name="description" content="Mulholland Drive - Justin Theroux wears all black. Black jeans, black t-shirt, black leather jacket, heavily black-rimmed glasses. He smokes cigarettes he rolls himself. He's sort of hipster-punk, exponentially cool and more than a little wary of the business he's in. All this makes sense, if you know that he came up in and around Washington DC's punk scene, listening to Black Flag, Minor Threat, and Fugazi. Nowadays, the Bennington College graduate is a New York-based actor, probably best known for his work on CBS's The District, but more inclined to talk about his other work, on stage in NYC and in films, for example, Mary Harron's I Shot Andy Warhol and American Psycho.

Interview with Richard Linklater<br>
</font></span><i><font size="1" face="Verdana">interview by
<a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 2 November 2001</font></i></p>
<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Richard Linklater's movies feature lots of 
conversation, sometimes serving as plot, taking you places that you don't quite 
expect, then turning again. The writer-director of the groundbreaking <i>Slacker</i> 
(1991), as well as <i>Dazed and Confused</i> (1993), <i>Before Sunrise</i> 
(1995), <i>SubUrbia</i> (1997), and his not-so-well-received foray into 
Hollywood filmmaking, <i>The Newton Boys</i> (1998), is famously laid-back, and 
he seems comfortable with the whole cool-guy arty-filmmaker image. The Austin, 
Texas native could pass for twentysomething (he's really forty-one), laughs 
easily, and enjoys thinking out loud, running ideas around. He likes to take his 
shoes off, too. </font></b></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In addition to making films -- among them, he 
serves as Artistic Director for the Austin Film Society, which he founded in 
1985 as a venue for unusual, non-multiplex films, from around the world. It was 
through this program that he met Speed Levitch, the subject of Bennett Miller's 
1998 documentary <i>The Cruise</i>, who appears in Linklater's new film, the 
animated <i>Waking Life</i>, more or less as himself. That is, Speed shows up on 
the Brooklyn Bridge, with stars, clowns, splashes, and zaps flying around his 
head, holding forth on what might be understood as the film's premise: &quot;As one 
realizes that one is a dream figure in someone else's dream, <i>that</i> is 
self-awareness.&quot; Linklater sees Speed as &quot;one of those exuberant seekers. We 
need more of them. I'm kind of appalled who've seen that movie and come away 
thinking he's a tragic character or that there's something sad about him. I'm 
like, &quot;What are you talking about?&quot; I think he's just overflowing with life. But 
to think that that's a bad thing, it's terrible. He's only like twenty-five or 
twenty-six, and what twenty-five-year-old with that kind of brain is going to 
have it totally together? I predict incredible things for Speed, always.&quot; </font>
</p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">Cynthia Fuchs:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
How did you come up with the idea this film? </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">Richard Linklater:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
Like everything I do, it came from real life. Believe it or not, a movie that's 
so unreal takes all its cues from personal experience. That really happened to 
me, it was a really formative lucid dream, like in the movie, that series of 
false awakenings. It seemed to go on for weeks and weeks, and got creepy near 
the end. So the narrative structure is something out of my own experience. I'd 
been thinking about it for years and years, how it would work as a movie, and 
asking myself, &quot;Does it really work as a movie?&quot; It never did in my head, but 
when I saw some shorts by Tommy [Pallotta] and Bob [Sabiston], my friends, and 
then it clicked for me, &quot;Oh, that story I've been thinking about didn't quite 
work, this is the way it should work.&quot; It takes everything to that necessary 
level. It's realistic, and yet it's imaginatively constructed, a contradiction. 
And I thought, &quot;Oh, that's what your brain's doing, in dreams and in memory.&quot; 
There's no exact anything; it's all a reconstruction, constantly. So if the film 
can be perceived at that level, that's the right level to take in the story. A 
lot of this was instinctual, looking for a way to encompass the contradictions, 
like being awake in your sleep. Films are so much like dreams that I don't think 
films about dreams work, so this film had to be about something else. To me, it 
was about becoming aware in your dreams. And so the film itself sort of becomes 
aware as it goes. So all those things are on the same parallel track: you have 
what's going on in your brain as you watch it, the character -- Wiley -- 
becoming aware of the story, and the audience becoming aware of that same 
narrative at the same time that he is, it sort of sneaks up on you and then 
takes over the whole movie, in a way. But it's not an imposed narrative, it's an 
awareness of what was always there. So the narrative becomes aware of itself. 
And then the film [laughs] is actually aware of itself as a narrative, a story, 
a film. And that's the Soderbergh joke at the end, that the film is aware of 
itself as an economic entity. </font></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CF:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
So many films give you a story, ask you to identify with a character, and haul 
you out the other end, whereas here, you're asked to think about that 
identification process, because it's so not smooth. </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">RL:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
Yes, to have a lead character who realizes that he doesn't even know his own 
name, partway through the movie. You're rudderless, but you're in the position 
he's in, you have a perspective. The film is nothing but structure and 
perspective. It's like, &quot;Okay, I don't know my name,&quot; but what can you do about 
it? The film is linear, moving through a projector at a certain rate. Time is 
moving whatever you know or don't know. It tells you that you don't really need 
those hooks, you don't need a character you can empathize with. You see so many 
movies that give you ridiculous reasons to care about a character, like his dog 
died. But all that is constructs. You can care about other things.</font></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CF:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
It also asks the audience to be responsible for their own responses. </font>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">RL:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
Mm-hmm. It's very much a film that you have to participate in, because it's 
depicting that awareness of dreaming that by definition kicks you into a 
conscious level. You watch a film passively, and all of your personal stuff, 
ideally, goes away and you have this great two hour experience of another world, 
and then, the lights come on and you're back to your real world: &quot;Oh god, I have 
an appointment in fifteen minutes.&quot; That's a good film experience. But I like 
the idea that you have to be aware of what you're doing while you're doing it, 
again, analogous to being awake in your dream. The film demands that you be 
aware of it. I think it's there to help you in your awareness process, like all 
these characters are there to help Wiley in his awareness process [laughs].
</font></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CF:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
Most movies presume viewers all have the same experience -- even though it's 
obviously not true. This one is upfront about the fact that everyone will have a 
different experience. </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">RL:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
Yes, it's all about your own subjective experience. Just like life, everything 
is sort of a construct visually, but I believe that we're all in a mutually 
agreed upon reality. Some people go way out there and say there's no reality at 
all, but that seems really egotistical, to think you create your own, alone. I 
think we all create together, just perceiving in slightly different ways. The 
reality is concrete, it's real, but we see it individually. </font></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CF:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
That's a refreshing way to answer academic relativism, or some versions of 
deconstuction. </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">RL:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
Yes, <i>Waking Life</i> sort of rejects all of that, the idea that if all 
subjectivity and society are illusions, then where are you? I wanted to gather 
around, to come to a reemergence of another, more tangible subjectivity and 
responsibility. It's interesting to have gone through it, and it was important 
to confront. But if you think of it politically, and on all other levels, and I 
had to reject it. Like the character who seems like a professor, the teacher, 
says early in the movie, that it's excuses, once you see yourself as just a 
product of all these forces. I feel more connected than that. Everyone's on 
their own subjective path. I always fall back on Ralph Waldo Emerson and 
Thoreau, really staunch individual types, like the Beats. I'm attracted to them.
</font></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CF:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
I'm wondering about the guy in jail, who follows the Ethan Hawke-Julie Delpy 
scene. </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">RL:</font></i></b><font size="2"> I 
didn't want the film to operate on any one level; I wanted it to be light and 
dark, positive and negative, mostly positive and not cynical, but I liked that 
it would have both. To me, he was kind of scary. I grew up in a prison town, in 
Huntsville, Texas, and the idea of people behind bars always got to me, 
festering in their own subjectivity. His rage is so ferocious, but so imagined 
at the same time. That's how it is increasingly, when you put people in cages, 
for things that maybe they shouldn't be there for, because there's other ways to 
deal with them, you're creating a lot of that, super-negative energy that's 
going to come back in other ways. </font></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CF:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
How do you think about the connections between memories and identity, as opposed 
to strictly &quot;experiences&quot;? </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">RL:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
That has always fascinated me. This film that I have coming out next month, <i>
Tape</i>, is all about that, about how an event ten years in the past relates to 
three people in the present, how they remember it differently. The notion of 
memory, and the idea that our minds are constructing the past, that there isn't 
an exact anything. Your brain isn't a videotape, it's a theatrical production, 
and you're redressing the sets, changing costumes, changing emphases. It changes 
over time. No one goes through the world thinking they're bad. This other film,
<i>Tape</i>, involves someone being forced to apologize for something he did ten 
years before. It asks, what that means, to say you're sorry. </font></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CF:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
And of course, it has to do with who you imagine yourself to be in the present, 
based on misremembered events. </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">RL:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
Well, countries misremember their histories, for whatever purposes. And we do it 
individually, casting ourselves as the victims or the heroes. It's dangerous, 
writing your own story. It's not a very healthy way to go through the world, to 
think that how you were treated by your family is who you are. You have to think 
about what's on your mind now, what's the interest for you in maintaining that 
story? What are you focusing on in your life now, because that's really more 
important than what happened twenty-five or thirty years ago, if you really want 
to be responsible about it. But most people don't [laughs]. But they're 
encouraged not to, because then you have a society full of people who are 
damaged, who aren't fully in control, instead of fully politicized. </font>
</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CF:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
This movie will play differently for people who have seen your previous work, 
than it will for people who come in cold. So it works as a &quot;memory&quot; for those 
viewers. </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">RL:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
Right, fever dream! Personally, I just kind of opened it up, and it's about film 
history, too. I just saw my own creations float back in, with something to offer 
this movie. Julie and Ethan, from <i>Before Sunrise</i> -- what they're saying 
is incredibly relevant to <i>Waking Life</i>, it's some of the key thoughts that 
fit into the film. But it doesn't mean anything literally, and you don't have to 
know them to know what's happening in the film. I wasn't too precious about it.
</font></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CF:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
What are your thoughts on the shaky animation style? </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">RL:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
Well, it's the way the computer interpolates the between-strokes. You're doing 
like twelve frames a second, and that breathing is one quality of it. I liked 
the look, it seemed active to me, and we shot it handheld too, so it has an 
extra layer. I've never seen a handheld animated film, much less one that has 
like, thirty different animation styles. So, like the actors are different, so 
are the artists, and it was like granting individual status to these animated 
characters, another contradictory notion in this film full of contradictions. It 
was more real in that way. </font></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CF:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
For the first couple of minutes, you're disoriented, watching it, and then you 
settle into it. </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">RL:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
Yeah, your eye accepts visual stimuli pretty easily. I don't think the ear gets 
used it. I always tell filmmakers, if they're doing low budget, that the brain 
adjusts to whatever, black and white, grainy film, like you're in a dream state. 
If that's the way it's going to look, you just go with it. But your ear is less 
forgiving. If it's a bad soundtrack, or you can't hear dialogue, that's more 
bothersome. Early in the film, there's some pretty radical imagery, like when 
Wiley's walking through Grand Central Station, but there are chandeliers and a 
lot of planes, and some lady behind me was like, &quot;Oh f*ck! Is the whole movie 
going to be like this? I didn't take my Dramamine.&quot; I do think the voice is 
important too, it's specific, you need that little human touch. I think we'll 
always be around. [laughs] And in this movie, it wasn't just the voices, it was 
the atmospheric sounds too. We had the bus go by, kind of the messiness of 
documentary-type sound. Most animated films are just so clean, which makes 
sense, because they're made in studios, controlled environments. You don't want 
a bus going through <i>Shrek</i>, you know! [laughs] Well, I'd like a bus to go 
all the way through <i>Shrek</i>. </font></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CF:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
Speaking of buses, can we talk a little about travel, as it shows up in most all 
of your movies? </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">RL:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
Journeys and seeking do come up in my films, but I don't think about it that 
much. I guess when you're traveling you get those kind of poignant moments. 
Everything is heightened, and I think that's why there's an addiction to travel. 
You're very aware of the culture and yourself. It's an interesting place to be 
in your mind, things often take on a more poetic resonance, and if you're 
seeking, it keeps you sensitive. You can do that and never leave the room: it's 
an operating system for some people. This whole movie's such a journey, he's 
traveling in his mind, and everything he meets is helping him to become aware. 
If you're human, you don't even have any choice. You're kind of on until you're 
off. </font></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CF:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
And that's another question: choice. </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">RL:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
It's one of those questions that you dig into and it's always fascinating. 
Something as random as that little cootie-catcher or whatever you call it, it 
seems to have a fate to it, depending on what number and color you choose. But 
if he had said &quot;seven&quot; instead of &quot;fifteen,&quot; then what? These are really 
fundamental questions you ask yourself at an early age, but you never really 
answer them, you just circle around to it again. Free will, that's a good one, 
that's right up here with God. Depending on your religious views, those 
questions can go hand in hand. I love the athletes who thank God. It's like, if 
you hit a home run, then God was with you but not the pitcher? I'd like to see 
someone once say, &quot;No thanks to God, except for creating the universe. But 
beyond that, we know you haven't done sh*t for about fifteen billion years!&quot; 
[laughs] It seems so basic, for such an important aspect of our lives. To say 
&quot;God&quot; is the Big Mac reason, so generic. There's a lot to dig into there, but to 
really discover an area, you have to dig deep, and it's dark, and there are 
unsafe places. So it's easier not to do that. </font></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CF:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
And isn't it all about storytelling anyway, making sense of what happens to you?
</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">RL:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
Certainly. That's what our brains do, we're very comprehensible, 
pattern-seeking, storytelling creatures. We take limited visual data and create 
sense out of stuff that fundamentally makes no sense. But that's how we're able 
to move on and achieve anything in the physical world, I think, we're able to 
ascribe a lot of meaning to something that maybe has none. Or you have to at 
least acknowledge that, when you search for meaning, that there is none, that 
it's a completely random coincidence, biologically speaking. But whatever it 
takes, to keep us going. Storytelling, that's why we're here. It's 
communicating, a way to share our experience. Art's a tip of the iceberg in 
terms of how we get to know one another. It's the way the tribe breaks out and 
shares culture, it's kind of amazing. And that's the thing, film is the most 
incredible way to communicate, and it's so new. It's so huge. I think we're 
still grappling with that possibility, that you can reach billions. Maybe only
<i>Titanic</i>'s done that. That's why I think that it doesn't make sense when 
filmmakers say, &quot;I only did it for myself and my friends.&quot; If you're in the film 
medium, you have to, on some level, be hoping for a bigger communication.</font></font>
