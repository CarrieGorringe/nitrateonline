            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">CIA agent extraordinaire Nathan 
            Muir's office is all packed up on his last day before retirement, 
            except for the flag displayed behind Plexiglas. Its tattered and 
            burnt condition suggests a story behind it, one full of derring-do 
            that Muir is proud of, but we never learn what it is. He's too busy 
            fighting his own superiors to save Tom Bishop , his errant protégé 
            interrogated in a Shanghai prison and slated to be executed the next 
            day. In the course of Muir's twenty-four hours of mind games, 
            distressed by the agency's greater concern for Chinese trade talks 
            than for the welfare of one of their own, he asks a colleague, 
            &quot;Didn't all this used to be about something?&quot;</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We might ask the same thing about 
            this action-soggy, emotionless film.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Much of the story takes place in 
            flashback, as Muir (Robert Redford), in conference at Langley, 
            recounts his 1975 recruitment of Bishop (Brad Pitt) in Vietnam, his 
            training in Berlin and their role as assassins in 1980's Beirut. &quot;If 
            you leave the reservation,&quot; Muir warns him after an attempt to bring 
            an East German defector across goes sour, &quot;I won't come after you.&quot; 
            The spy biz is a harsh one, he explains, instructing Bishop to never 
            put himself at risk for someone else, never use your own resources 
            and put money away to end up someplace warm – rules that Muir 
            himself will break by the movie's end.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The pleasure lies in watching the 
            cipherous Muir best his desk-bound colleagues at every turn, 
            withholding information as he chooses, and staying at least one step 
            ahead while he tries to grasp what operation Bishop's meddling 
            upset. This is the kind of role that the poker-faced Redford is best 
            at, reminiscent of his young con man in <i>The Sting</i>. It's all 
            heavy screenwriter's contrivance, of course, but the kind that we 
            can give ourselves over to as a guilty pleasure.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ever since Redford directed Pitt in
            <i>A River Runs Through It</i> the notion of two generations of sex 
            symbols in the same film has beckoned, and the pairing makes for a 
            surprisingly textured contrast; Redford is steady ego to Pitt's 
            impetuous id. But the flashback scenes where they're found together 
            are hard going. Director Tony Scott tints these sequences as if to 
            color-code them, and, true to form, he is incapable of trusting the 
            simple drama of two people talking. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">One suspects, given his politics, 
            that Redford signed on to make a very different movie.&nbsp; There are 
            glimmers of something more, suggesting that Michael Frost Beckner's 
            (creator of the television series <i>The Agency</i>) original spec 
            script took a colder view of the CIA and its ideology. But the first 
            nail in the coffin was the hiring of Tony Scott, whose <i>Top Gun</i> 
            boosted Navy recruitment by glorifying its pilots. Never known for 
            subtlety, Scott's sledgehammer style smashes through quiet moments,&nbsp; 
            placing a conversation between the two agents on a rooftop for no 
            other apparent reason than to spin his camera about the scene 
            superfluously in a helicopter. Instead of dramatic tension, we have 
            music scored intrusively to broadcast an event's importance, and the 
            time and its significance is thrown into our faces over the jarring 
            slam of a black-and-white still frame (and the worn countdown device 
            is useless since the film keeps us on two timelines, past and 
            present).&nbsp; The fast paced cutting full of gunfire and explosions 
            that are Scott's trademark makes <i>Spy Game</i> play less like a 
            movie than a feature-length commercial for sports cars or 
            sunglasses. By the time Scott was finished, Redford was playing a 
            role better suited to Clint Eastwood.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Brad Pitt certainly recognized that 
            rewrites were killing the story when he complained publicly, 
            angering studio executives, about the inane lines he was being asked 
            to recite (&quot;Being a grown man, I feel silly saying them.&quot;). 
            Reportedly, even more changes were made after the tragedy of 
            September 11, to be less critical of the CIA.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the film we see, Muir laments 
            that what motivates the agency in 1991 is the globalization of 
            trade, not the good old ideals of yesteryear. In Berlin, he reminds 
            Bishop that their trail of killing and betrayal serve a greater 
            good, but he never identifies it. Scott assumes we know, but I sure 
            don't. The Cold War? Yeah, right. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Although Beckner's original was 
            likely a better script, it is unlikely to have been a great one 
            since it gets so much comically wrong. Why, for example, would Muir 
            and Bishop try to kill a North Vietnamese general in 1975, well <i>
            after</i> the U.S. agreement to withdraw from the conflict? The 
            agency has been forbidden to engage in assassination without a 
            presidential finding – a fact briefly alluded to in the Langley 
            conference room, with the outrageous suggestion that this 
            restriction is quietly ignored.&nbsp; Had the CIA been so actively 
            engaged in the field in Lebanon, as Beckner portrays them, their 
            operations would not have been so eviscerated when suicide bombers 
            struck the U.S. embassy. If they had been this active, they might 
            not have been so blinkered that they missed the fall of the Soviet 
            Union. In the wake of the World Trade Center catastrophe, and the 
            CIA's failure to foresee the threat, we should be <i>more</i> 
            critical of the agency, not less.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's worth noting that the year in 
            which Bishop meets Muir was also the year that Redford made <i>Three 
            Days of the Condor</i>, and his presence here only makes us wistful 
            for that smarter and savvier film. Nathan Muir's capacity to 
            outsmart and manipulate was sorely needed elsewhere – in the suites 
            of Universal's executives.</font></td>
