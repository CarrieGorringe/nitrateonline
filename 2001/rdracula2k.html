            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Vampire
            Rules are usually pretty well fixed -- that's what makes them
            Vampire Rules. Some are well-known (wooden stakes, garlic, and
            crosses tend to repel vampires, sunlight makes them sizzle) and some
            are less so (vampires can't enter your home unless you invite them
            inside, vampires cast no mirror reflections), but they're all
            supposed to be adhered to -- otherwise, those pesky undeads can do
            whatever the heck they want, and mere mortals are left defenseless.
            At the same time, as anyone who's been exposed to <i>Buffy</i> -- or<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span><i>Samurai Vampire Bikers from Hell</i> (1992), or <i>Vampire
            Lesbian Kickboxers</i> (2000) -- knows, it's hard to stay fresh. And
            so, you might sympathize with the challenge faced by anyone looking
            to make a vampire movie these days -- it's all so, well, you know...
            done. Think Max Schreck, Bela Lugosi, William Marshall, Klaus Kinski,
            Nic Cage, Gary Oldman, Kirsten Dunst, Wesley Snipes, even George
            Hamilton, the tannest toothy fiend ever to wander the planet. With
            all this and more, quite literally since the birth of cinema, it
            would certainly seem that there's little <i>new</i> to be said on
            the subject. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            you can't keep a good count down -- into this way-overkilled fray
            leaps yet another vampire flick, carefully timed for maximum suckage
            during this Holiday Season. Based for a minute on the Bram Stoker
            novel, <i>Wes Craven Presents Dracula 2000</i> (which is executive
            produced by the master) is set mostly in London and New Orleans,
            around the time of Mardi Gras last year, with the most famous of all
            vampires again seeking the chick he feels destined to possess. The
            film should be focused on the considerable charms of Omar Epps,
            Jennifer Esposito, Jonny Lee Miller Sean Patrick Thomas, and
            Christopher Plummer as Dr. Van Helsing, but instead, it gives over
            too much screen-time to Gerard Butler's decidedly uncharming
            performance as Dracula 2K.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's
            not a bad performance, just a little tedious, like he's determined
            that glowering will get him more access to the necks of assorted
            young lovelies than any of that wussy-boy seduction stuff. At the
            beginning of the film, Cranky Drac is locked up inside a steel
            coffin in the dungeon-like basement of a London building (the sign
            says, &quot;Carfax Antiquities,&quot; Carfax Abbey being the name of
            the Count's residence way back in Stoker's day, which makes the
            sign, you know, clever and intertextual). It seems that when the
            first Van Helsing mostly killed Dracula, he secured the remains in
            the coffin, where they were intended to stay until a means to
            completely kill him might be found. Clearly, <i>D2K</i> --
            co-written by director Patrick Lussier (former Wes Craven editor,
            notably for all three <i>Scream</i> joints) and Joel Soisson --
            plays fast and loose with the Legend, the Stoker novel, and the
            Vampire Rules, apparently in the service of keeping viewers from
            anticipating every single move that every single character makes at
            every single point. To an extent, this disregard of precedents
            works, but once you do figure out the basic layout, it won't take
            much for you to guess general directions of all that follows. So,
            you won't be surprised to see the present day Dr. Van Helsing,
            Abraham (Plummer) fretting about his legacies, which include not
            only the &quot;antiques&quot; business and those yeechy leftovers in
            the basement, but also a little detail concerning his own blood and
            late rituals with leeches. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Because
            this movie comes tagged with the number &quot;2000,&quot; you can
            also expect that young folks<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>constitute
            a next generation of biters and bitees. The first of these
            introduced is Abraham's assistant Simon (Miller), a sweet enough lad
            with just a touch of a murky past. Details are sketchy, but you do
            learn that he owes the old man big time and so will lay down his
            life for him, which of course he will be called on to do,
            repeatedly. But if Simon is the golden boy, he's more than offset --
            in energy and presence on screen -- by the crew of would-be thieves
            who steal the coffin, thinking that if Van Helsing keeps it so well
            guarded, it must be worth bijillions to someone. This crew includes
            Solina (Esposito) and her boyfriend Marcus (Epps), along with
            Nightshade (Danny Masterson) and Trick (Thomas), and don't you know,
            as soon as they've lugged their loot onto an airplane bound for some
            island, Dracula awakens and eats everyone in sight, including the
            pilot, so the plane crashes. Or more precisely, he turns them all
            into minions. And if nothing else, watching Solina, Marcus, and
            Trick mug about and flip through the air while in pursuit of edible
            napes is something of a treat. Epps and Esposito especially seem to
            be having frightful fun.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            this treat is brief, because, again and again, the film turns back
            to that lugubrious guy, who, you learn soon enough is seeking a very
            specific nape, belonging to one Mary Heller (Justine Waddell),
            living in New Orleans, where she works in a Virgin Records store
            (and hence sports the &quot;Virgin&quot; logo t-shirt a few more
            times than necessary to make the joke stick) and finds herself
            haunted by bloody nightmares and inexplicable sexual longings, all
            involving this Drac fellow, though she doesn't know him yet. The
            reason he wants her is that she's Van Helsing's estranged daughter
            and is also conveniently related to Drac himself, such that the
            incest thing works out nicely, that is, underlines their perversity
            in case it needed underlining, and borrows from Paul Shrader's <i>Cat
            People</i>. Oh, and along the way to hooking up with Mary, Dracula
            gnaws at and so establishes his three-girls harem, with Solina, a
            completely cleavagey reporter who happens to be at the airplane
            crash site (Jeri Ryan), and Mary's roommate, red-haired Lucy
            (Vitamin C). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">By
            the time everyone arrives in the Big Easy -- and the scene is
            crowded with standard-issue Mardi Gras street-revelers, men with
            face-paint and feathers, women without shirts -- you're quite ready
            to have Dracula just exterminate them all, double-quick, so you
            don't have to sit through the rest of it. But then you'd miss the
            film's most outrageous and overreaching bit of business, which is to
            concoct a brandy-new explanation for Dracula's constant sorrow. And
            that is, he somehow is Judas Iscariot, the one person in history who
            carries enough guilt to make an everlasting undead life look <b><i>Très</i></b>
            Hellish. Actually, the film is a little sketchy on these details too
            -- Dracula might be a descendant of Judas, or the spirit of Judas,
            or something else having to do with Judas -- but whatever he is,
            it's clear that he has good reason to be so damn mopey.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            for all that, Dracula's not exactly the type to inspire sympathy --
            he's too single-minded, and not self-parodic like Tom Cruise or full
            of himself like Snipes. Which means that when the
            showdown-that-must-come finally does come, you don't feel like
            there's much at stake. Thank goodness, it takes place in and around
            a rooftop greenhouse, allowing Simon to fight off the Ladies of the
            Night with flowerpots and garden shears. Not quite as fine as the
            finale in <i>Out For Justice</i>, when Steven Seagal beats up
            William Forsythe with kitchen utensils -- rolling pins and frying
            pans -- but it is among <i>D2K</i>'s wittier moments. <o:p>
