            school basketball is most often the province of uplifting films, in
            which talented players struggle with social difficulties, supportive
            coaches, and romantic dilemmas. O offers as object lesson the doomed
            romance between a basketball player, O (Mekhi Phifer) and Desi
            (Julia Stiles), and his difficulties fitting into an all-white high
            school. Though it is similar to other &quot;high school films,&quot;
            it is also radically different: given that it is, essentially,
            Othello set in high school, the uplift is pretty much nonexistent.
            That's not to say that there aren't lessons to be learned here, but
            they are more tragic than typical.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For
            all that, the movie does feature scenes and ideas that are sadly
            familiar, not only to those who are in or have been in high school,
            but also to TV viewers who have seen school shooting
            &quot;aftermaths&quot; (the fact that this phrase has entered the
            general lexicon is depressing in itself). As many viewers know by
            now, Tim Blake Nelson's O had a roundabout route to movie theaters.
            Originally set to be released in 1999, it was shelved by Miramax
            following the shootings at Columbine High School on April 20 (and
            indeed, one scene at the end of O shows anonymous students mourning
            their friends' bloody deaths, in shots that mimic the TV images
            we've seen too often following shootings at high schools and office
            buildings). The public representation of the studio's anxiety was,
            no surprise, that Miramax didn't want to seem to &quot;incite&quot;
            or otherwise appear to &quot;condone&quot; high school violence,
            though, as the director and actors have noted, O is unlikely to do
            any such thing, since it is a very careful consideration of and
            caution against just such horrors, an exploration of how they might
            happen and how they affect their many victims. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now,
            Lions Gate has stepped up to release the movie, as it did last year
            with Miramax's other recent hot potato, Kevin Smith's Dogma. Viewers
            can judge the movie, however belatedly. Written by Brad Kaaya and
            directed by Nelson (best known at this point for his starring role
            in O Brother, Where Art Thou?), O focuses on the travails of the
            lone black basketballer at an all-white prep school in Charleston,
            South Carolina. Odin, known as O, is charming and sexy, and a
            dazzling ballplayer. Not only is he winning awards from the school
            and lavish praise from the coach (Martin Sheen), he's also dating
            Desi, lovely daughter of the headmaster (John Heard). While O and
            Desi know they look fabulous together (check them at the club, on
            display for their fellow students and enjoying it), and are clearly
            fond of one another, they're also quite aware of their interracial
            status. During one interlude, Odin says he wants to lie down
            together because &quot;I just like the feel of your skin next to
            mine.&quot; But as soon as they're up-close, they begin a vaguely
            tense, anxiously jokey exchange concerning the distinction between
            his &quot;player skills&quot; and his role as &quot;black buck&quot;
            dressed up to play &quot;house nigger&quot; at the school where he's
            beloved for his athletic brilliance but also feels alienated. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            is easily the film's most cogent insight, which it hits hard and
            insistently --the ways that longstanding cultural anxieties about
            race in the U.S. continue to affect young people's individual and
            community relationships, just as it affects adults. While the
            violent outcome is part of O's given Shakespearean fabric, its
            particular treatment of the motivation for the violence, and the
            violence itself (especially O's against Desi) are appropriately
            difficult to watch. This is in part a function of the very good
            performances by all involved, and the editing exertions made to fit
            this complicated story into a feature-length running time. For all
            his on-court polish and experience dealing with racism, Odin is
            still a teenager. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">His
            uncertainty about who he is or will be is aggravated by goading from
            his jealous friend and teammate, the coach's son Hugo (Josh
            Hartnett). The boys' friendship is competitive precisely because of
            the way they are treated by adults: Iago's evil is translated into a
            young man's desire for his dad's affection. Moreover, the movie
            makes too much of Hugo's problems awkwardly literal: in seeking his
            father's attention off the court, he's taken to enhancing his
            performance on the court, with steroid injections from a local
            dealer (perhaps predictably, this is the only other black character
            with a speaking part). These elements -- the unhappy children of
            authority figures; the competing boys; the beautiful, naive girl --
            will be familiar to anyone who's seen a typical romantic comedy set
            in high school (say, 10 Things I Hate About You, based on The Taming
            of the Shrew, or even Michael Almereyda's Hamlet, not a comedy and
            not set in high school, but both films star Stiles). And as in these
            other films, unease over physicality -- a combination of sex and
            sports -- leads the kids to act on their complicated desires, both
            spontaneously and in painfully calculated ways. But in O, the
            consequences expose preexisting social tensions that shape the kids'
            experiences, tensions that are, of course, also economic, racial,
            political, and above all, mediated, in television and movies and
            magazines. There's no escape. <o:p>

            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            there may be a possibility for awareness and support from adults.
            Nelson has written in the New York Times that he wanted also to
            represent the ways that &quot;kids are 'older' at a younger age
            now.&quot; Certainly, the adult inclination to &quot;protect&quot;
            kids from troublesome, provocative imagery and ideas -- exemplified
            by Miramax's &quot;rationale&quot; for not releasing O -- is as
            tenuous and impossible to achieve as it is understandable.
            &quot;Kids&quot; have demanding and sometimes frightening lives now,
            for all the &quot;prosperity&quot; so many of them supposedly enjoy.
            Their day-to-day decisions are stressful, their exposure to and
            comprehension of multiple choices (many not available to them, which
            makes for frustration) is sometimes overwhelming. Despite pundits'
            chatter about the &quot;short attention spans&quot; of children and
            teens, it is more often the case that kids experience and process
            information in faster and more complex ways than their elders: it's
            the nature of the world in which they must survive. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For
            the most part (save for some cheesy &quot;metaphorical&quot;
            business where Hugo imagines himself as the hawk that is his team's
            mascot, which is just silly), O respects its young characters and
            potential viewers. Still, many high schoolers -- the very folks
            depicted in the film -- will not be allowed to see it in theaters
            (they will no doubt find ways to see it, and some might even wait
            until it comes to video and/or TV; recall what has happened with
            Kids, Cruel Intentions, or even American Pie). Seeing characters of
            their own age struggling with complex social pressures and emotional
            traumas similar to what they see in movies featuring so-called adult
            characters may be upsetting, but it will not be surprising. At the
            same time, O is apparently and already (before its release) not
            serving as a wholly &quot;correct&quot; educational vehicle.
            Nelson's New York Times piece seems intended as an introduction to
            the movie and explanation of what the director has in mind. Though
            he notes his initial concern about setting the film in &quot;the
            South,&quot; as a location liable to remind viewers of clichés
            about racism, he then expresses surprise, that &quot;The facts, as
            concern the story's racial elements, are far more intriguing than
            the fiction. One irony of American hip-hop culture is that white
            suburban kids strive to emulate the inner city tastes in dress and
            manner of speech that are described in rap music or depicted in its
            videos.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            &quot;irony&quot; works a few ways, but suffice it to say that the
            distinctions between kids' tastes and styles (as promulgated by
            media) have been blurred for a long time. But, as most kids know,
            the assimilation of styles doesn't always lead to understanding and
            empathy. While Nelson says he was happily surprised that the South
            Carolinian setting could be handled in a subtler, less stereotypical
            way than it might have been some years ago, the fact remains that
            race and racism continue to inflect &quot;meanings&quot; of class,
            generation, and gender, however subtly. While Odin and Desi's
            relationship might be perfectly &quot;fine&quot; on its face, it
            raises &quot;issues&quot; that the kids in the film don't
            necessarily &quot;expect.&quot; These are first articulated by
            Desi's father (who presumes O is a sexual predator), and are
            elaborated on by Hugo's increasingly hysterical drive to punish O
            for what he perceives as his friend's many
            &quot;transgressions.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If
            this much is visible in the movie, it also turns out that consumers
            aren't always ideal students, and bring their own ideas to what they
            see, reshaping &quot;product&quot; according to their own needs.
            This seems to have happened in the case of O: the film's website
            features a &quot;Message Board&quot; (this is unconventional in
            itself, as most films and studios don't ask for &quot;feedback&quot;
            or &quot;discussion,&quot; but instead present themselves as
            commodities and bottom-liners before anything else). But the Board
            has been closed down, with this &quot;message&quot; on the site:
            &quot;Unfortunately, some of the messages that have been posted in
            the past month have begun to threaten the purpose of inspiring
            meaningful conversation. Lions Gate does not condone inflammatory
            statements of hatred and flagrant disrespect for those involved in
            making and promoting the film. We apologize for any inconvenience
            this may have caused.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            disclaimer suggests a couple of things: one, while Lions Gate wants
            only &quot;meaningful conversation,&quot; it's not clear who defines
            what's &quot;meaningful&quot;; and two, the movie (or the idea of
            it) has evidently evoked some exchange that is not
            &quot;meaningful,&quot; discussion that is perhaps even vitriolic.
            But it also suggests that the &quot;conversation&quot; on race is as
            pressing as ever.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
