            <i>Hardball</i> begins, Conor O'Neill (Keanu Reeves) is hitting
            bottom, or somewhere thereabouts. A hard-drinking, tough-talking,
            self-hating gambler, he owes money all over Chicago. Everyone is mad
            at him, except his buddy-codependent-enabler Ticky (John Hawkes):
            they spend their non-betting hours scalping tickets outside sports
            arenas or gulping beers at their favorite bar, Sluggers. Conor is so
            consigned to his pathetic existence that when an angry bookie sends
            a couple of kneecap-busters after him, he turns around and smashes
            his own fist through a car window, declaring triumphantly, &quot;No
            one can kick my ass better than I can!&quot; He ends up in jail with
            a bloody hand. You end up with one of those shots that you've seen a
            thousand times: the down-and-out hero behind bars, his head bowed
            and his options few. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Luckily
            for Conor -- but unluckily for anyone who has already watched a
            movie where the (white) adult earns his or her moral salvation by
            helping a bunch of underprivileged kids (say, <i>Dangerous Minds</i>,
            <i>Music of the Heart</i>, <i>The Mighty Ducks</i>) -- he picks up
            the perfect soul-saving gig. He gets to coach a Little League team
            in the Cabrini Green housing projects. The kids' background hasn't
            made them surly though: they're are all very sweet and really,
            they're only looking for a father figure (several have mothers with
            speaking lines, but none have dads). Conor gets the job as a
            cast-off from childhood friend Jimmy (Ed Burns movie survivor Mike
            McGlone), now too rich and obnoxious to be bothered actually
            &quot;giving back to the community&quot; in quite the way he's
            promised to do. Sitting behind his expensive desk, with his designer
            suit and slicked-back hair, Jimmy is thus cast as the unfeeling
            white guy, in place to give Conor the job, but more importantly, to
            make look a lot &quot;better.&quot; Since Conor has already shown
            himself to be unreliable, selfish, and obsessive about this gambling
            thing, Jimmy-the-plot-device does, theoretically, serve a purpose,
            but it's sort of overkill. Conor is <b><i>so </i></b>movie star:
            he's Keanu Reeves with slightly disheveled hair and a slick leather
            jacket.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Conor
            meets Jimmy at the field, gets his bag of bats, balls, and mitts,
            and meets the kiddies, each of whom is just cute as can be and
            conveniently endowed with an identifying &quot;trait&quot; so the
            audience won't have much trouble sorting out who's who: Kofi
            (Michael Perkins) has a chip on his shoulder and is in special need
            of being won over by Coach; his little brother, G-Baby (DeWayne
            Warren), is too young to play ball, and so mostly serves as the
            team's &quot;mascot&quot; and Conor's trash-talking liaison to the
            other boys; Jefferson (Julian Griffith) is adorably sensitive and
            (in case you need a literal marker for his vulnerability) asthmatic;
            Andre (Bryan Hearne) wears a tough-guy sweatband on his head and
            fights with Kofi, but soon is asking Conor to walk him into his
            building at night; and the lanky, phenomenally gifted pitcher Miles
            (A. Delon Ellis, Jr.) likes to wear his walkman on the mound, so he
            can bop to Biggie's &quot;Big Poppa.&quot; <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Some
            ruckus has recently been raised by Chicago Little League coach
            Robert Muzikowski and Chicago youth leader Al Carter, the real-life
            subjects of the inspiration for the film, Daniel Coyle's nonfiction
            book, <i>Hardball: A Season in the Projects</i>. They tell the New
            York Daily News that their upset over the kids' representations:
            &quot;The kids are being portrayed as juvenile delinquents who
            constantly curse. They're actually decent kids who behave
            themselves.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Well,
            actually, the kids in the film do behave themselves (though the
            movie's use of the cursing is irresponsible: apparently, it's very
            funny to see short, cute boys unleash a stream of terrible
            language), and Conor is the delinquent. Besides that, the young
            actors are easily the best part of <i>Hardball</i>. Largely selected
            from local Chicago-area casting calls, they bring warmth and
            spontaneity to the proceedings, help that Reeves always needs
            (think: Sandy Bullock in <i>Speed</i>, or Laurence Fishburne and
            Carrie Ann Moss in <i>The</i> <i>Matrix</i>). As per the requisites
            of the formula, Conor has a hard time at first: he sulks in the
            dugout while the kids play, they distrust him, and he distrusts
            them. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Then,
            one night he sends Jefferson home alone after dark (though the kids
            tell him it's too late and Jefferson asks Conor to walk him home)
            and the poor thing gets beaten up by a couple of punks who steal his
            backpack. This scene relies on point-of-view shots (with Jefferson's
            increasingly labored breathing on the soundtrack), as he peers out
            from a hiding place, then makes a break for his building's front
            door, only to be tackled to the ground, wheezing and gasping. Cut to
            the hospital: Conor comes to visit because he feels really bad. Poor
            guy. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            order to get over it, Conor spends some time chatting up the boys'
            do-gooding Catholic school English teacher, Elizabeth Wilkes (Diane
            Lane). She, like the kids, is at first suspicious of this guy, who
            obviously has neither a clue what he's doing nor much interest in
            whether or not they can read. To prove himself to her, he reads <i>A
            Wrinkle in Time</i> and pronounces it a good book. Dude. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">However
            dubious his skills may be as a lover, Conor is a completely lame
            coach. In a film full of curious conveniences and ellipses, the most
            curious aspect is that it never shows Conor actually <b><i>coach</i></b>
            a lick. He just sits back in the dugout and crosses his arms,
            looking unhappy, until one kid gets on third base during a game, and
            Conor yells for him to run all the way home. And oh yes, he tells
            Miles to go ahead and wear his walkman while pitching: good work,
            Coach. Other than that, the players improve their game on their own.
            And, soon enough, Conor and his players are cheering and hugging and
            high-fiving. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            fact that Conor is white means nothing, of course, except that he's
            one in a long line of white characters who become &quot;better
            people&quot; because they meet adorable, courageous, noble, and/or
            doomed minority characters. <i>Hardball</i> is not shy about this
            point. During an egregiously manipulative sequence, one of the
            players is -- inevitably -- shot by a neighborhood gang on the eve
            of the Big Game. The movie tries to make some bizarre emotional
            sense of this event by intercutting the shooting with the last game
            this character actually plays (moving back and forth in time), in
            order to milk the last little teeny bit of emotion from the moment.
            Worse, this sequence occurs during Conor's speech at the funeral
            service, before an all-black (plus Ms. Wilkes) audience, who tearily
            appreciate it when Conor says that the dead kid's display of spirit
            on that last day &quot;made me a better person.&quot; I know this is
            supposed to be poignant, but frankly, it's despicable. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><i><font size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Hardball</span></font></span></font></i><font size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
            is directed by Brian Robbins, who made the solid, independent hiphop
            documentary, <i>The Show</i>, which features a memorable live
            performance by Biggie Smalls. This may be the motivation for <i>Hardball's
            </i>obvious appreciation for the music that inspires its
            kid-characters and potential kid-viewers (it has a pump-it,
            single-ready soundtrack, including &quot;Hardball,&quot; by Lil Bow
            Wow, Lil Wayne, Lil Zane, and Sammie). Still, how often does a
            mainstream movie take as its anthem a Biggie Smalls song? Still, to
            see the bleachers-full of parents (and Ms. Wilkes, again) putting
            their hands in the air like they'se true playas, is just a little
            too strange.</span></font></span></font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
