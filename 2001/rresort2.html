            her son cast adrift on foreign shores. The package is The Shooting
            Gallery's third installment of independent films collectively
            identified The Shooting Gallery Series at Loew's Entertainment, now
            popping up in seventeen cities for two week runs with this British
            entry as the first of six pictures this Spring. The stranger in a
            strange land is Tanya Krushina (Dina Korzun), a stunning dark-haired
            beauty who arrives in London nearly penniless but promisingly
            engaged to Mark, a no-goodnik no-shownik. Hours, then days later,
            she and her son Artiom are detained by British authorities when she
            inadvertently asks for political asylum. And then her troubles
            really begin.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">They
            are shipped off to a God forsaken bureaucratic wasteland, the
            dilapidated seaside compound housing project cum concentration camp
            Stonehaven, surrounded by guard dogs, a bank of video cameras,
            barbed wire, and a sense of doom. Rising amidst it is a defunct
            amusement park named Dreamland, where life for the many immigrants
            imprisoned there is anything but cotton candy and flights of fancy.
            The roller coaster towers over the area, but the only ride anyone
            gets is the red-tape special. Even trains don't stop there anymore.
            Accordingly, when Tanya learns her papers will be processed, she's
            momentarily elated until she discovers it will take twelve to
            sixteen months. Their barren flat offers limited relief. A settee
            invested with fleas sits opposite a wall decorated with a tropical
            paradise of palm trees, glistening sands, and golden sun. The
            illusion is peeling away, however, and, taking a look out the window
            paints a overcast sky filled with gray clouds of pessimism and
            desperation. The sun never shines in this resort.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Celebrated
            Russian star Korzun is a fresh face for Western audiences, cut from
            an Emily Watson mold, both in looks and passion. Her Tanya is a
            victim of cultural shell shock -- shy, insecure, yet in due course
            determined to find a way out of her predicament as accidental
            refugee. Artiom (Artiom Strelnikov) is a worldly nine-year-old with
            Leonardo DiCaprio eyes, always aware that his mom's never-seen fiancé
            is just a neurotic rat fink. He knows life would have been better if
            they never left home; mom just wouldn't listen. The boy is a prime
            candidate for dead-end juvenile delinquency if not for the attention
            of bingo caller Alfie (Paddy Considine), the manager of a second
            rate amusement arcade, its pinball lights the only brightness in
            this gulag a stone's throw from civilization. Considine, whose
            complex character study as borderline psycho Morell in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">A
            Room for Romeo Brass </i>was one of the best performances barely
            seen by American audiences last year, takes his sophomore outing in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Last
            Resort</i> as a compassionate sod, a loser amongst the lost. And
            while he's ga-ga for the luckless Tanya, he spends an inordinate
            amount of time with the boy, indoctrinating him the ways of the
            western world and keeping him out of mischief with the local
            riff-raff. Tanya's busy trying to earn some money to supplement the
            meager food coupons provided her family, but it's only sleazebag
            Internet porno pimp Les who's earmarking any funds for the scared
            nymph. (Real life pornographer Lindsay Honey, drawing on his own
            dastardly experiences, rounds out this nasty role, dare I say,
            nicely.) On the verge of cybersex damnation, Tanya manages to gather
            up enough courage to salvage her soul and her clothes, in the
            process finding a friend and possible lover in Alfie.<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><u><o:p>

            filmmaker Pawlikowski imbues his small budget love story with plenty
            of hand held <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">cinema verité </i>humanism
            (courtesy of director of photography Ryszard Lenczewski), that zooms
            and whirls about the despondent Eastern European and Russian
            refugees. The director doesn't afford an easy way to categorize his
            story or cinematic approach. Producer Ruth Caleb notes it is the
            idea of escape, both literally and metaphorically, which underpins
            the whole film. Yes, but the director rolls with the ebb and flow of
            his cast and the environment that surrounds them. Pawlikowski
            apparently worked with a bare bones script and developed the story
            on the fly, while shooting. It is quite the nonconformist love story
            -- a new age tale of a very personal relationship set amid a
            mechanically bleak world. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Last Resort</i> opens a raw, albeit often uneventful, window. There's
            nothing but gloom outside, but even those dark clouds have a poetic
            beauty worth watching.<o:p>
