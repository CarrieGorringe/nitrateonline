            group of travelers tremor, nap and nod on a dusty tour bus. The
            driver sleepily persists against the relentless nothingness,
            steering his passengers through the heat of the uninhabitable desert
            nowhere toward their destination. It's night and they have no clue
            where they are. They doze, adjust a walkman, swat an imaginary fly.
            The journey shouldn't take quite this long but no one questions the
            route until the red gashes of dawn pierce the sky. The driver drones
            on he's following the requisite 180 degrees on the compass. But when
            he swerves the bus, the compass doesn't move. The stains, sweat and
            dry mouth garnered over a long, arid night of travel increase...</b><o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            group stumbles across a deserted town, check the gas tanks, which
            are empty, feed the bus with kerosene, believe for one moment
            they're saved - and find they're doomed. The heat intensifies and
            after one member extols the five rules of survival to his
            compatriots and embarks upon a trek through the eternal sands
            (&quot;If I make it I'll be back in five days,&quot; he tells them),
            leaves them to the extremes of not just an environmental nature but
            a more elementally vicious and predatory nature - the human variety.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Soon,
            alliances form, marital cracks become visible, hates and lusts
            emerge and facades are stripped away. Survival is the order of the
            day, and it is decided to perform <i>King Lear</i> as a diversionary
            tactic and form of civilization, when strangely enough, life begins
            to imitate art.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Such
            is the preface to this story of madness, marital discord and mayhem
            - a sort of <i>Lord of the Flies</i> meets Shakespeare. But love it,
            hate it, &quot;The King Is Alive&quot; will generate few maudlin,
            middle ground opinions. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's
            the fourth film from Dogme 95, the Danish collective that includes
            the film's director, Kristian Levring, and filmmakers Lars Von Trier
            (<i>The Idiots</i>), Thomas Vinterberg (<i>The Celebration</i>) and
            Soren Kragh Jacobsen (<i>Mifune</i>). The only American to receive a
            Dogme 95 acknowledgement - Harmony Korine - received an honorary nod
            for his low-tech movie, <i>Julien Donkey-Boy</i>.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            collective espouses a philosophy that purports to retrieve the
            current cinema from the miasma in which it rests by relieving their
            own films from &quot;certain tendencies in the cinema today.&quot;
            The rules rest in a &quot;vow of chastity&quot; that the quartet
            have signed and which basically strip away the technological frills
            of big-studio moviemaking and getting back to basics - the essence
            of story telling and making.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So
            does this Dogme director fulfill his vow? Surprisingly, <i>The King
            Is Alive</i> finds its strength in its technology and visuals. It's
            shot on digital video and the format is artful and artfully
            regenerative against characters who, though essentially supporting -
            Miles Anderson, Lia Williams, the late Brion James and Romane
            Bohringer; powerfully savage - the great Janet McTeer, who brings
            ferocity, honesty and empathy to the film's fullest role; victim -
            Jennifer Jason Leigh, who, after roles in <i>Last Exit to Brooklyn</i>,
            <i>The Hitcher</i> and <i>Georgia</i> meets another kind of maker
            altogether here; and weak - Bruce Davison as a henpecked husband who
            ultimately has the right stuff - live or die by the desert's cruel
            rules.<o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Though
            <i>The King Is Alive</i> is compulsive viewing, it harbors a chilly
            reserve and distance despite the desert's heat, and its characters
            teeter on a highwire of unavailablity and inaccessibility to
            viewers. And if there's no sympathetic voice to follow it doesn't
            matter how much talent is visible. Its characters are not only
            stranded in the desert, they're stranded in a script that, while it
            has a thrilling concept is fatally flawed. It never reveals enough
            history or information about these people to muster empathy for
            their inclusive and wholly unexplained - not eventual - biases and
            actions. Truth is, <i>The King Is Alive</i> is admirable within its
            centric, hallucinatory, innovative visual excitement. But it rarely
            fulfills the vow of story telling.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
