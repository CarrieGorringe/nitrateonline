            the Silver Bear Award for Best Picture at the 2001 Berlin
            International Film Festival, adds new dimensions to a situation
            outlined in Vittorio de Sica's 1948 neorealist classic, <i>The
            Bicycle Thief</i>. In the<i> </i>case of <i>Beijing Bicycle</i>, a
            young man named Guei (Cui Lin) a new &quot;import&quot; from the
            countryside who is desperate to work his way up from poverty, is one
            day's pay away from owning his mountain bike outright when it is
            stolen. As in de Sica's film, this incident spells potential
            disaster for <i>Bicycle's</i> protagonist: he not only can no longer
            work as a bicycle courier, but he must also reimburse the courier
            company for the cost of the bicycle; it was still the company's
            property. He must find it. Having extracted a promise from his
            manager that he can keep his job if he can return the bike, the
            young man goes in search of it. When he finds it, he discovers, to
            his surprise, that the thief, Jian (Li Bin) is not a professional
            criminal, but something else altogether: another teenager, much like
            himself, whose middle-class parents are making painful financial
            sacrifices to put their children through private schools; there is
            very little money left over for luxuries. Jian not only feels
            excluded from a social circle populated by students from wealthier
            families, but he has a crush on one of the girls, the attractive and
            intelligent Qin (Zhou Xin). Eager to feel as if he were truly part
            of the group, Jian somehow finds the money to purchase the courier's
            bicycle at a flea market, unaware of its origins. Not wanting to
            lose all of the privileges he has gained through the possession of
            the bicycle, Jian uses his gang of friends to keep it in his
            possession.</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">De Sica's film
            concentrated upon the search itself, and the psychological toll that
            it takes upon the relationship between father and son; <i>Bicycle's</i>
            main focus is the relationship between thief and owner: both, as it
            turns out, are victims in some way or another. The courier requires
            the bicycle for his very survival, but the teenager does as well,
            though not to the same degree. Although he is rightfully seen as a
            somewhat typically self-pitying adolescent, director Wang Xiao-Shuai
            also persuades the audience to understand the nature of his
            victimization. Surrounded by wealthier classmates, and struggling to
            keep up appearances (under the fear of being shunned and potentially
            prevented from meeting his parents' high social and economic
            expectations), his motivation for possessing the bicycle is
            understandable, though no less wrong.</font></p>
            <font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">The
            tone of each film is also different. De Sica's film, although
            cynical about human nature, is also filled with a sentimentality
            born of post-war outrage, an eulogy for a world where whatever
            respect individuals had for the common good was possible. Bicycle
            creates a world that observes all of the players at a
            &quot;scientific&quot; remove, thus allowing the audience to see all
            possible points of view.</span></font><!--webbot bot="Include"
