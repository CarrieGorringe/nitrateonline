            is a movie star. This won't surprise anyone who's seen him perform
            -- on stage, in music videos (<i>Get at Me Dog</i>, <i>Slippin'</i>),
            or in films (<i>Belly</i>, <i>Romeo Must Die</i>) -- but for those
            who think that he's just another superstar rapper trying to cross
            over, <i>Exit Wounds</i> might be news. Certainly, he's renowned as
            a hiphop artist with his dead dog's name tattooed across his back
            and a cinematic sensibility: His lyrics are vividly confessional and
            angst-filled, his post-performance backstage near-collapses (from
            sheer exertion and asthma) are legendary. And in 1998, he became the
            first hiphop artist to have two number one albums in one year (<i>It's
            Dark and Hell is Hot</i> and <i>Flesh of My Flesh, Blood of My Blood</i>).
            His fans are devoted and they appear to be growing in number. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now
            DMX has made an unusual transition, from a rapper with street cred
            to a mainstream movie star. The question will be, how long does he
            hold on to both positions -- Will Smith's status as the perennial
            Fresh Prince is one thing, but it's hard to be Ice T, as he knows
            better than anyone else. So here comes thirty-year-old DMX (born
            Earl Simmons), on a track to something resembling crossover
            celebrity, though that's not to say that he's going to be drawing <i>Klumps</i>
            numbers just yet. Appearing on Leno recently to promote the new
            flick, X was charming, completely at ease on that big fat couch. And
            in his role in Andrzej Bartkowiak's new high-octane, ultraviolent
            action flick, DMX is the most riveting thing on the screen. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">That's
            saying something, because he has competition. Maybe not particularly
            in the form of the film's nominal star, Steven Seagal, now into --
            what is it? his sixth comeback film? -- playing another renegade
            &quot;peace officer,&quot; or in Seagal's comic sidekick Tom Arnold,
            not exactly stretching as an eager-to-please,
            anger-management-challenged TV personality. But the film, even more
            so than<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bartkowiak's
            debut feature, <i>Romeo Must Die</i>, this film offers pretty much
            nonstop furious action, mostly having to do with cars (crashing,
            flying through the air, exploding into flames, rolling over and
            over, being decapitated, or whatever you call it when the top is
            sheared off), and guns of every persuasion. Not to mention the many
            co-stars in this twisty-turny bad-cops-gone-worse plot, all solid
            and appealing performers. Sad to say, Seagal is not doing the same
            caliber martial arts work as he once did (remember <i>Above the Law</i>?
            ouch!). But he's is completely up to snuff in that aspect that, over
            the years, he has made all his own -- the scowl. And here he does it
            at every possible opportunity, in slow motion and in fast-cut action
            scenes, during car chases and fight scenes, when he's firing his
            very powerful gun and when he's being yelled at by his very angry
            police captain. No doubt about it, Seagal is a King of Pain.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            ornery Detroit cop Orin Boyd (and who wouldn't be ornery with a name
            like that?), Seagal has good reason to scowl. He's one of those
            showboaters, who is so good at what he does (taking out entire
            battalions of bad guys with a single gun and a few swift kicks to
            crackable body parts) that in the midst of an event, everyone just
            backs out the way and lets him do it. Of course, while he may be
            saving the Vice President's life, as he does in the introductory
            scene, Boyd is also creating havoc, which means that afterwards,
            some authority type (here, the sublime Bill Duke) has to chew him
            out for being a troublemaker who doesn't know how to follow the
            rules. This time around, Boyd's demoted to a &quot;war zone&quot;
            precinct, where, he soon learns, most of his fellow cops are wildly
            posturing macho pricks: their &quot;hazing&quot; process involves
            tasering newbies at full volume, a test that Boyd naturally passes
            brilliantly, earning him the respect of the well-muscled head cop,
            Strutt (Michael Jai White) and the enmity of a couple of
            standard-issue swaggerers, the tough-talking Montoni (David Vadim)
            and the former KKK member Useldinger (Matthew G. Taylor). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            his run-ins with these manifestly bad cops suggest, there's serious
            trouble afoot, namely drug dealing, else why would Seagal -- or
            rather, Boyd -- have been assigned to this precinct? Luckily, even
            with his contrary &quot;lone wolf&quot; reputation preceding him,
            Boyd wins the trust of his precinct chief, Annette Mulcahy (Jill
            Hennessy, reprising her stern-but-vulnerable affect from <i>Law
            &amp; Order</i>), a former Internal Affairs officer with a nose for
            corruption, or so she says. Boyd convinces her to condone his
            investigation: this decision is apparently reached via a series of
            hilariously unconvincing winks and flirtatious scowls, when he
            interrupts her dinner with a wimpy &quot;let's not talk about
            police-work&quot; date at a fancy-pants restaurant. Put off for
            about a nanosecond, Mulcahy sends Wimpy Date off to the men's room
            so she can hear what Boyd has to say, which isn't much, but he sure
            blusters and poses well. With a flourish that's strange even for
            Seagal, Boyd shows that he's a man's man in any situation, snarfing
            food from Wimpy Date's plate. This is enough for Mulcahy, and she
            sends him forth with her blessing to do Good Work. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">On
            this mission, Boyd is all business, with some time out for a couple
            of those Seagal-movie requisite scenes where he takes out crews of
            woefully under-prepared no-necks with attitude. Aided by his very
            nice new partner George (Isaiah Washington), Boyd digs up what looks
            like a humungo drug operation, under the auspices of the coolest of
            cool cats, Latrell Walker (DMX), and his yellow-Humvee-owning buddy
            T.K. (Anthony Andrews). As far as Boyd can figure, Latrell has some
            strong but unexplained connection to a young fellow in prison, Shaun
            (played by X's fellow Ruff Ryder, Drag-On), and so much money it's
            ridiculous. A young black man who can afford an $850,000 car and a
            closet full of incredible designer outfits? Obviously, he's into
            something illegal. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            this minimal plot summary suggests, <i>Exit Wounds</i> is full of
            clichés that it displays proudly. It is what it is -- a Steven
            Seagal formula flick dressed up so a hiphop-martial arts crowd might
            appreciate it, and even tolerate Seagal. If you're not into that
            sort of violence -- which is used here for dark comedy as well as
            producer Joel Silver's typical testosterone-driven titillation --
            then it may be something of a grueling experience. But for all that,
            <i>Exit Wounds</i> offers a few unexpected change-ups. For one
            thing, it has an unusually integrated (black-white) cast. And for
            another, as the trailers give away, the enigmatic Latrell is an
            attractively unconventional hero. He's seductive, sensitive,
            determined, and knows his way around the internet as well as
            Motown's back alleys. Seagal may make a few more comeback films
            before he's done. But Dark Man X has arrived. <o:p>
