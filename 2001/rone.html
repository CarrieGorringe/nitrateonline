            review by <a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 23 November 
            2001</i></font><p><font face="Verdana" size="5">I miss who you were</font></p>
            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">There's one good thing to be 
            said for <i>The One</i>. It puts to rest any lingering doubts as to 
            whatever happened to Doug Savant, formerly Matt, The Gay Guy on <i>
            Melrose Place</i>. For here he appears, uncredited as far as I can 
            tell, as an LA cop, his head smooshed by two motorcycles wielded by 
            the villain Yulaw (Jet Li). I can't even imagine what it must have 
            been like: he's stopping some guy on the street, when said guy 
            proceeds to lay out a couple of motorcycle cops, grab their bikes, 
            and hit poor Matt, whomp!, one on each side of the head, like he's 
            getting his ears boxed. It looks painful. Then again, the ignominy 
            of being one of several anonymous corpses in the latest Jet Li opus 
            can't be very pleasant either. Ah well, it's a living. </font></b>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This must be the thinking behind <i>
            The One</i>, which, as an SF flick, doesn’t bear up to logical 
            scrutiny any better than its most obvious precursor, <i>Time Cop</i>. 
            Still, even if you expect such cinematic junk from Mr. Double Van 
            Dammage, you may have been hoping that Li would not fall into 
            similar habits. Alas and alack: in <i>The One</i>, Li falls hard, 
            playing not one but two characters, the aforementioned bad guy 
            Gabriel Yulaw (whose name may have something to do with the fact 
            that he takes the law as his own to break and make), and Gabe, the 
            really nice Buddhist (apparently added to the plot after the Rock 
            dropped out to play the Scorpion King instead of the One). Gabe 
            works for the LA Sheriff's office, which means that he also has 
            access to fighting and shooting expertise. Good thing, too, because 
            Yulaw is one tough cookie. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Technically, the double role allows 
            for digital effects and wirework choreography by Corey Yuen (who 
            also worked on Li's <i>Kiss of the Dragon</i>), so that Jet Li can 
            do battle with Jet Li. To differentiate, one character conveniently 
            has a hugely significant wedding band tan-line, the other just a 
            snarly expression, and each adopts a particular fighting style, 
            circular Ba Qua for good Gabe, a more straight-on punching technique 
            for bad Yulaw. This moral dynamic gets a somewhat tiresome workout 
            in <i>The One</i>. The script, by ex-<i>X-Files</i> writers Glen 
            Morgan and James Wong (who also directs), has the doubleness 
            premised in the notion that we exist not in a universe but in a 
            multiverse, wherein parallel universes, not necessarily operating 
            within the same timeframes, are populated by parallel versions of 
            the same people -- it's like a whole bunch of Kirks and Anti-Kirks, 
            all living different but also vaguely similar lives. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film includes some alternate-universey 
            in-jokes: in one, Al Gore is US President, in another, Gabe has long 
            blond hair, in yet another, he's married to a man. Since no one 
            really knows what might happen if the alternate selves ran into one 
            another, or how each universe affects the others, travel between 
            them is highly restricted, and if you're caught messing about, 
            you're zapped off to prison in the dreaded Hades Universe, where 
            it's dark and scary and inmates rip each other's guts out. Though 
            this might sound interesting, you know you're in trouble when the 
            first thing you get in a movie -- pre-credits -- is a simplistic 
            narration in a big-boomy voice explaining what you're about to see. 
            The set-up is obvious: someone will be traveling illegally and 
            someone will be trying to stop him. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yulaw is the illegal traveler. A 
            former multiverse policeman himself, he's now flitting about the 
            multiverse, killing off his parallel selves (123 at the current 
            count) in order to suck up their energies and become The One. The 
            multiverse cops and administrators don't know exactly what will 
            happen after Yulaw has achieved his goal: will the entire multiverse 
            system collapse? Will some giant black hole swallow all life forms? 
            Will Yulaw himself implode or will he, as his adversary can barely 
            bring himself to say, &quot;become a god&quot;? Yulaw, for, uh, one, is 
            willing to take the risk.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That justifiably agitated adversary 
            is Yulaw's former partner, the exceedingly weary Roedecker (Delroy 
            Lindo), on the trail for two years (and 123 murders, or suicides, or 
            whatever you'd call them, given that Yulaw is eliminating versions 
            of himself). For some reason, he blames himself for Yulaw's 
            rampaging (as soon as you hear this sad story, you know that 
            Roedecker is not long for this multiverse). When a temporarily 
            detained Yulaw taunts him, &quot;You miss me?&quot; Roedecker can only hang 
            his head and say, &quot;I miss you who you were.&quot; Bingo. <i>This</i> is 
            the film's big idea, the one it never explores -- the relations 
            between multiple selves and between selves who know one another in 
            multiple dimensions: how might such relations shape you, even if you 
            don't know (as seems to be the case here, in our universe) that they 
            exist? How is time (linear? nonlinear?) a factor in travel between 
            universes, in the way you understand yourself as somehow stable from 
            moment to moment? And what about all those lurking SF paradoxes that 
            accompany the possibility of encountering alternate selves? </font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Perhaps needless to say, these are 
            questions that <i>The One</i> does not engage. Rather, it goes for 
            the reductive action-plot, jumping from the clearly complicated 
            Yulaw-Roedecker relationship to the less messy one, between good 
            Gabe and Roedecker's younger, more aggressive new partner, Funsch 
            (Jason Statham, who seems to be wearing the same black leather coat 
            he wore in <i>John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars</i>: apparently, in 
            the near future, cops' costume options will be limited). Both 
            Roedecker and Funsch are eager to capture Yulaw, who is now 
            superhumanly strong and speedy, but they're also loathe to kill him, 
            because there's only one other Yulaw left in the multiverse, and 
            they honestly don't know what would happen if <i>that</i> were left 
            to be The One, either. Best to keep both alive, but in separate 
            universes, so they can't hurt each other. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Good Gabe's introduction to the 
            whole business comes in a series of odd intuitive bursts: he &quot;feels&quot; 
            bad Yulaw's presence before he sees him (one more possibility for 
            investigation of what's at stake in this parallel universes idea... 
            wasted). Because Gabe has also been getting stronger and speedier 
            over the past two years, while the Yulaw Energies have been 
            narrowing to just he and bad Yulaw, he and his lovely veterinarian 
            wife T.K. (Carla Gugino) think this might be more of the same. By 
            the time they figure out what's going on, Yulaw has gotten past 
            Gabe's fellow deputies, and, despite Funsch's best protective 
            efforts, the two Jets will be locked in a super-showdown. The 
            supposed climax isn't nearly as amazing as it should be. Jet is a 
            fabulous fighter, but he's not much of an actor, and too much of the 
            camerawork in this scene consists of facial close-ups: he growls, he 
            contorts, he grimaces, he (or his stunt double) shows the back of 
            his head <i>a lot</i>, but what you want to see -- his body in 
            serious kicking and chopping action -- is not so much in evidence.
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is more the pity, because the 
            movie, for all its inability to push difficult philosophical 
            questions, relies instead on physical acrobatics and abuses for its 
            thematic substance. That is, the many ways that bodies are beaten 
            and battered, medicalized and manipulated, provide the film with its 
            most alarming and ultimately thoughtful images, and not only when 
            Yulaw and Gabe are bending each other's limbs into impossible 
            positions. Perhaps the most excruciating scenes take place when the 
            multiverse travelers jump blast from one place to another: they 
            don't get that chi-chi beam-me-up-Scotty shimmer. No. Their bodies 
            shatter into thousands of traumatized shards, then land hard, 
            gasping and writhing, while medics in white hazmatty-looking outfits 
            run insta-tests to make sure the internal organs are in their right 
            places. This seems a point worth making: bodies are frail.</font></td>
