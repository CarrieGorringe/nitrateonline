            review by <a href="../carrie.html" target="_top">Carrie Gorringe</a>, 26 January
            2001</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>At one point in his pre-Oscar
            career, you might recall, Nicolas Cage made an infamous, because
            genuine, meal from some bugs in the 1989 film, <i>Vampire's Kiss</i>.
            Now, as the co-producer of <i>Shadow of the Vampire</i>, he gives
            Willem Dafoe the privilege of indulging in some <i>outré</i> dining
            of his own. <i>Shadow</i> is a fictionalized account, a conceit, if
            you will, concerning the backstage history surrounding director F.W.
            Murnau's creation of the classic vampire film <i>Nosferatu: A
            Symphony of Horrors</i> (<i>Nosferatu: eine Symphonie des Grauens</i>,
            1922, usually referred to simply as <i>Nosferatu</i>; the full title
            simply differentiates it from Werner Herzog's 1979 remake). This
            version of events suggests Stanislavskian methodology run amok: in
            order to give <i>Nosferatu</i> its unparalleled on-screen atmosphere
            of terror, Murnau (John Malkovich) creates an inadvertently Faustian
            bargain with his lead actor, Max Schreck (Dafoe). Murnau forces
            Schreck to live the part of the undead twenty-four hours a day (to
            the point of locking him in the castle at night and making him sleep
            in a dirt-filled coffin!). This is obviously not a good idea since
            Schreck, visually speaking, is already half-way there (with his
            pallid complexion and sinister, scimitar-shaped ears that seem less
            like ears than outcroppings of his bald head, he is not the type of
            person one wants to encounter anywhere, never mind the proverbial
            dark alley). As the production is delayed due to a lack of funds,
            and as poor Schreck begins to lose touch with reality, believing
            that he really <i>is</i> Nosferatu, the balance of power on the set
            shifts from director to actor, bats lose their heads (see the <i>outré</i>
            dining experience listed above) and the lives of the crew are as in
            as much peril as the film's completion date (there is, of course,
            even more irony, however unintentional, in the madman's off-screen
            surname: &quot;schrecklich&quot; means &quot;dreadful&quot; in
            German. But, for all of Schreck's horrifying appearance and
            comportment in <i>Nosferatu</i>, he was an
            &quot;undistinguished&quot; actor and person off stage, according to
            Murnau historian Lotte Eisner; the fact that Schreck appeared in at
            least one of Murnau's later films indicates that rumors of his
            vampirism were groundless, at least where Murnau was concerned).</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In order to comprehend the logic,
            if you will, behind this film's plot, a little back story is useful.
            Murnau, perhaps the most famous of the German Expressionist
            filmmakers, had a unique gift for combining subtle, fluid camera
            movement and psychologically &quot;expressive&quot; symbolism with
            images that are, for lack of a better term, both
            &quot;psychologically&quot; and &quot;artistically&quot; composed at
            once. Working in 1920s Berlin, during the pre-Nazi era known as the
            Weimar Republic, Murnau was, arguably, the &quot;master&quot; of his
            coterie). (his other works include masterpieces such as <i>The Last
            Man</i> (1925) and <i>Sunrise</i> (1927) – the latter being his
            only American film and the one responsible for garnering the first
            Best Actress Oscar for Janet Gaynor). His death in a car crash in
            1931 restricted only his output, but not his long-lasting reputation
            or influence among film scholars and filmmakers (I'll leave it to
            the more adventurous to dig up Kenneth Anger's more salacious
            account of Murnau's demise, as well as Eisner's denunciation of
            Anger's &quot;venomousness&quot;).<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Given this synopsis, there might be
            an expectation that something is really at stake (pun fully intended
            ) in this film. This would be a wrong assumption. Once the exquisite
            Art Nouveau-inspired, sepia-tinted opening credits pass by , <i>Shadow
            of the Vampire</i> is both silly and sanguinary, but can't even take
            the fatuousness and violence, along with its provocative premise,
            and do anything interesting with them. Too often, the film plays
            like a how-not-to manual on filmmaking, and the reasons are
            elemental, hence devastating to the film's effectiveness. Once the
            pretentiousness and so-called shock value are stripped away from the
            film, there is nothing more here than the gritty aftertaste of camp,
            but <i>Shadow</i> doesn't possess the possibility of reaching the
            unabashed mania of <i>Rocky Horror</i>. <i>Shadow</i> seems to
            disdain an ironically populist mentality in favor of subtextual aims
            as explained by Merhige in an interview for a recent edition of the
            on-line magazine <i>IndieWIRE</i>: the film is an examination of the
            ambiguous distinction between reality and fantasy, especially in
            art, although he doesn't quite explain why this topic is relevant to
            the film. While the obvious redundancy of such an exploration comes
            immediately to mind, one might be more charitable and assume that
            Merhige is recalling Murnau's talent for melding the realistic and
            the fantastic into a mystical whole (a gift which is especially
            evident in <i>Tabu</i> (1931), his final film, a visually sumptuous
            quasi-documentary he made with filmmaker Robert Flaherty), as well
            as the folly of artists who believe that the two states of existence
            can be maintained as disparate units, and that they can be
            manipulated with impunity. Instead of a new take on an old theme,
            Merhige and screenwriter Katz rely to an almost unhealthy extent
            upon trying to blend the immorality of the Weimar artistic milieu to
            ramp up the on-screen proceedings by employing the usual clichés,
            and it fails miserably (this from a director so fond of
            heavily-freighted symbolism, as in his 1991 film, <i>Begotten</i>);
            instead, you get the usual chomping on body parts and the blood
            dripping from arms due to hypodermics that have had too much contact
            in a narcotic sense of the term so characteristic of the horror
            genre and/or social exposé film respectively; the stiff close-ups
            of wickedness in Weimar terms (and even the lightning-fast edits
            are stiffly composed), tend not to produce repulsion and fear as
            much as contempt and laughter, despite a visual treatment of
            violence which can best be described as lustful (calling it
            &quot;obscene&quot; would grant it a much greater power to shock
            than it actually can). <i>Shadow</i> is clearly attempting to
            readdress the well-worn topic of ontology by filtering it through
            blackly humorous sensibilities, but this is a point that <i>Shadow</i>
            does not effectively make, for the most simple of reasons: because
            it is caught, most likely unintentionally, within those same
            well-worn theories through its own incompetence.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">More critically, however – and
            inexplicably – <i>Shadow</i> doesn't bother to provide much in
            historical context or insights into the characters' psyches. The
            audience gets little more on these subjects than an introductory
            titlecard, from which they are supposed to glean every single aspect
            of the historical backstory behind the film and thus to marvel at
            the filmmakers' inventiveness and sophistication; There is just one
            slight problem with this approach from a purely practical point of
            view: Murnau's name is no longer of the household variety; under the
            circumstances, the film really can't be perceived as anything more
            than a snobbish parlor game for graduates of <i>Film Studies 101</i>.
            Merhige and Katz seem to have forgotten the essential rule in
            blending black comedy and horror, as expressed by horror master
            James Whale (Ian McKellan) in 1998's <i>Gods and Monsters</i>:
            success never lies in alienating those in the audience &quot;who
            aren't in on the joke&quot;. Unfortunately, and ultimately, the joke
            ends up being at <i>Shadow's</i> expense. It wants to have a mass
            audience (at least, one might hope so; generally speaking, most
            producers don't go into cinema hoping to commit fiscal suicide) and
            a sense of the arcane all at once. More succinctly, the film wants
            to have it both ways and ends by having neither.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But perhaps the most shocking
            aspect of <i>Shadow</i> is its ability to take considerable talent
            and slowly but surely bleed the life from it. Since Murnau was gay,
            Merhige and Katz seem to think that it's an inspired idea to place
            Malkovich in the position of portraying the director as a Teutonic
            screaming queen of the worst sort, with no redeeming qualities, and
            certainly no empathy for his crew as they suffer to realize his
            &quot;vision&quot;. Dafoe's acting skills are buried under, rather
            than enhanced by, makeup which is one of the best examples of the
            craft ever created; the audience is more fascinated in a
            how'd-they-do-that fashion with the peerless work of makeup designer
            Ann Buchanan and makeup artist Katja Reinert than on Dafoe as an
            artist. Throughout the film, the combined and considerable talent of
            the two men are degraded to the point where there is nothing more
            for them to do than hiss and tear at each other alternately (thus
            making them both this year's hands-down winners of what Pauline Kael
            once dubbed the Klaus Kinski Scenery-Chewing Award). The wonderfully
            tart comedian Eddie Izzard and poor old Udo Kier (who, ever since <i>Barb
            Wire</i>, seems to have gotten into a rut playing the role of a
            passive, loyal factotum) come off best of all, but that may have to
            do with their rather more marginal roles. They should feel blessed.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">All things ludicrous are assisted
            by the dialogue, which has a stench even ranker than that of any
            two-week-old corpse. Malkovich is the least fortunate of the lot: as
            the central character, it is his futile goal to try and pump life
            (and credibility) into inanities such as &quot;Thank God for an end
            to all this [studio-bound] artifice,&quot; and, &quot;If it's not in
            the frame, it doesn't exist!&quot; . In another scene, Murnau is
            seen berating Schreck for eating the film's cinematographer rather
            than the script girl, to which Schreck responds in lugubriously
            sardonic tones, &quot;I'll eat <i>her</i> tomorrow.&quot; It's
            supposed to be a uproariously arch exchange, and, it just might have
            been, had the film been on a more secure footing at that point, but
            by the time the exchange appears, it comes too late to salvage
            anything. You don't know whether you're laughing with them or at
            them. Meanwhile, everyone else on-screen quivers in disbelief, an
            attitude which the audience cannot eventually help but assume. <i>Shadow
            of the Vampire</i> is a curse to all who wasted valuable money and
            time on a product that should have had a stake hammered through its
            heart at pre-production.</font>
