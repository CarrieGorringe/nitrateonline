            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>I
            just love those stories in <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>. The
            in-depth, behind-the-scenes, tear-it-apart exposés, perhaps about
            some unscrupulous penny stock promoter finally imprisoned. Or a
            legendary financial tycoon with a deep, dark secret now public
            embarrassment. The other day there was a piece about how the
            continuing stall-out of over-ambitious Internet and computer
            companies was jump-starting the repo business in California. Then,
            especially over the last year or so, the weekly sad sack tale of the
            latest dot.com fiasco. These are indeed fickle and cyclical times. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Startup.com</i>
            follows that type of disaster story, perhaps without the picayune
            nit-picking detail of an ace reporter, but with the same skewered,
            sour-tasting, light-headed effect. It certainly wasn't the intention
            of directors Chris Hegedus and Jehane Noujaim to write a virtual
            obituary of govWorks.com when their project started in 1999. With
            the guidance of legendary filmmaker D A Pennebaker, they paint a
            refreshingly frank picture of open-eyed optimism, Machiavellian
            aspirations, loyalties strengthened by inflated dreams then
            subjugated by harsh economic realities, and friendships ultimately
            reborn. This fascinating feature delivers a personal get-well card
            that even in the abyss of financial collapse, the movers and shakers
            of one such next-great-website can scavenge personal victories from
            the ashes of fiscal defeat.<o:p>

            a way, yes. Kaleil Isaza Tuzman and Tom Herman where childhood
            buddies with alternating strengths in financial and marketing know
            how and as a savvy technologist. Co-director Noujaim, a graduate
            from Harvard University in Visual Arts, was Tuzman's roommate who
            coincidentally quit her job as a producer for MTV at the time Tuzman
            traded in a secure position with a brokerage firm for the imagined
            pot of gold at the end of the Internet rainbow. Hegedus, a partner
            with (and later wife to) Pennebaker since the mid-1970s,was anxious
            to explore the world wide web revolution. She had been trying to
            find the right entrepreneur to latch her video equipment to, before
            hooking up with Noujaim—through mutual friends—only days after
            &quot;filming&quot; had started. Both filmmakers saw the opportunity
            to get in from the start with the two young visionaries. Two
            partnerships were born.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">With
            Pennebaker, Hegedus had already collaborated on the five-hour
            documentary <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Energy War</i>,
            co-directed by Pat Powell, which explored the Congressional battle
            over President Carter's 1977 proposal to deregulate natural gas.
            Other documentaries, about automobile romantic John DeLorean and
            noted choreographer Bessie Schonberg, followed, as well as music
            videos by Pennebaker and Hegedus. Of course if you just mention the
            name Pennebaker you have to remember his two classics in cinema
            verité: <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Don't Look Back</i>
            (a bookend in my DVD collection), the marvelous 1967 portrait of Bob
            Dylan as he visited England during his last acoustical concert tour;
            and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

            and Jimi Hendrix.<o:p>

            maroon-robed college graduates toss their caps in the air of
            sanguinity. Moments later we are introduced to Kaleil as he packs
            his belongings late one night from his soon to be former cubicle at
            Goldman Sachs. Asked what he's going to do (forget Disneyland), he
            smugly responds &quot;Start an Internet company.&quot;<o:p>

            stop? New York City's Silicon Alley. The road to young fortunes.
            Kaleil and Tom have a simple marketing strategy in the earlier days
            of their company. Ask strangers at a local pizza parlor what they
            think of various names for their enterprise (the initial frontrunner
            was Next Town). As chief executive officers for a million dollar
            startup, these boys coul barely pay for their dinner. Yet they
            shoestrung together enough money to jet out to Silicon Valley in
            search of venture capital. Investors were biting at the bit back
            then. No one saw the trouble ahead. The Nasdaq was moving higher
            every day.<o:p>

            shot on digital video by Noujaim) from dramatically low vertical
            angles, only showing Kaleil and Tom. One can only assume this
            nostril view was predicated by the money people's desires to remain
            invisible to the camera and not be distracted by the filmmakers.<o:p>

            paying municipal parking tickets. Employees, at one point numbering
            more than 250, participate in revivalist pep rallies
            (&quot;Incidentally, we're going to make a lot of money.&quot;),
            even if the workload is grueling. Tom always takes the weekends off

            relationship with his girlfriend Dora and her one-sided marital
            agenda and hopes for a pet. An hour into the film, silent partner
            Chieh Cheung becomes a thorn in the govWorks rosebush, hardballing
            Tom and Kaleil for a $700,000 ransom. On the lighter side, an item
            on tv's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

            of $50 million. Trying to maintain focus, Tom brings the employees
            up to his parent's Camp Interlochen for a weekend retreat to listen
            to the silence in the New Hampshire woods. Despite the refreshment,
            internet financing is starting to sour as the stock market began its
            now legendary collapse in the spring of 2000.<o:p>

            infrastructure and misguided daydreams by the end of 2000, govWorks
            bled through $60 million during its 19-month existence. Compressed
            into 103 minutes, S<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">tartup.com</i> is a compelling rags-to-riches-to-rags tale, with a
            lifelong friendship on the ropes as the contestants do battle. You
            really have to admire the two principals for exposing themselves to
            the cameras for 400 hours. That S<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">tartup.com</i>
            works is because of their candidness. Noujaim, Hegedus, Pennebaker,
            and their obviously exhausted crew provide a terrifically insightful
