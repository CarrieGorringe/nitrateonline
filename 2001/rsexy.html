            gangster Gal (Ray Winstone, <i>Nil by Mouth</i> and <i>The War Zone</i>)
            has a good life. He's been working at forgetting his criminal days
            back in London, so dark and fast-paced, by spending his leisure time
            at his swanky hacienda, baking in the Spanish coastal sunlight, set
            off in the middle of the proverbial nowhere. When she's in view, he
            likes to gaze lovingly at his charming and genuinely warm
            ex-porn-star wife DeeDee (Amanda Redman). Otherwise, he lies out by
            his blazingly blue pool, his tanned skin stretched tautly over his
            well-fed belly. At night, he and DeeDee go out to eat and drink
            expensive wine with their longtime friends and fellow East London
            expatriates, Aitch (Cavan Kendall) and Jackie (Julianne White). Not
            working agrees with Gal, and at this point, he's not inclined to
            think much beyond that. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And
            then, crash. Everything changes. At first, it's just a large, heavy
            metaphor that crashes into Gal's new, sedate life. During the first
            scene in <i>Sexy Beast</i>, Gal is sunning and his slender young
            pool boy, Enrique (Alvaro Monje), is cleaning up, when a boulder
            comes tumbling down the hillside right into the pool. Gal and
            Enrique are understandably stunned. Still, making its entrance under
            the Stranglers' rather ripping song, &quot;Peaches,&quot; on the
            soundtrack, the big rock is a momentary disruption, a surprising
            disaster that can be fixed. The next crash that comes into Gal's
            sweet life is not so easily repaired. His former associate Don Logan
            (Ben Kingsley) arrives, sent by slick-haired crime boss Teddy Bass
            (Ian McShane), who wants Gal's expertise for one more elaborate bank
            job, to crack a place that's &quot;impregnable,&quot; or more
            poetically, as Don puts it, &quot;f*cking futuristic.&quot; Gal
            doesn't want to come out of retirement. Don won't take no for an
            answer. The tension mounts. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">All
            this layout of the film's basic conflict, while cleverly shot and
            edited (the back of Don's bald head riding in the car on the way to
            and from Gal's home reminds you that he is a boulder of sorts), does
            nonetheless resemble the premise of a most familiar story: reluctant
            criminal is called back for a last, usually disastrous gig, during
            which he must prove himself and learn/teach a valuable lesson about
            just how bad crime is. But <i>Sexy Beast</i> has a twist.
            screenwriters Louis Mellis and David Scinto, and first-time feature
            director Jonathan Glazer (who has made music videos for Radiohead,
            Massive Attack, and Blur, as well as some Guiness commercials) have
            come up with something slightly different, namely, Don. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Granted,
            psycho villains per se are not news. But that's sort of the point
            with Don -- perversely, he's hyper-aware of his ordinariness, his
            conformity to expectations of the people around him who submit and
            look away when he's in the room, like you're told to do when a mad
            dog approaches. And so he feels pressured to be extraordinary, to
            outdo himself, to perform the next mission absolutely perfectly. If
            on the one hand, Don is a predictable thug, thoughtless, demanding,
            prone to violent &quot;solutions,&quot; on another, Don comes into
            his irrational and strange own. He's so wrapped up in himself
            (indicated in his &quot;social&quot; manner, which tends not to
            acknowledge the person to whom he speaks), that he is unable to
            conceive of himself in relation to other human beings, except as a
            force, a means of intimidation. And in this way, he's not only a
            character in himself, but a kind of indirect commentary on media
            versions of psycho killers: he's not charismatic, there's no clear
            reason why he behaves the way he does. He just is. That's what makes
            him terrifying, that there is no explanation for him. That and the
            fact that he is perversely able to turn those around him into
            reflections of himself, so afraid and anxious that they return his
            methods with like methods. They become him. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Your
            introduction to Don suggests just how harrowing it might be to be
            his &quot;acquaintance.&quot; He rides along in the car when Aitch
            and Jackie have fetched him from the airport, stoic and apparently
            blissfully ignorant of the fact that his two companions are so
            petrified of him and so angry at him (and temselves, for being
            unable to deal with him) that they can't speak (while
            &quot;Peaches&quot; plays again on the soundtrack, just in case you
            haven't yet picked up the idea that Don is a boulder hurtling toward
            Gal). When they arrive at Gal's place and Don emerges from the car,
            he doesn't notice -- or pretends not to notice -- the tension
            hanging so heavy in the dry desert air. Everyone else pretends not
            to notice as well. And his mission is already in motion: having
            invaded their world, he's now sucking his quarry into his own world,
            a world of terror and uncertainty, where the only constant is the
            treat Don embodies. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            movie poses Don as a kind of walking question. It's not only about
            how to deal with catastrophe, though that's certainly a piece of the
            question. The other piece has to do with Don's own self-awareness.
            Surely, he must understand his effect on people: for a time, he
            plays this intimidation business like an instrument. Don is not a
            brute -- he tries out a few rudimentary schemes that can't possibly
            pan out. He tries reasoning with Gal at first (&quot;Talk to me, I'm
            a good listener,&quot; he says, clenching his jaw and leering at
            Gal, to indicate that he's anything but), but as soon as he
            encounters resistance, Don turns into a dog with a bone. He tries
            cajoling (he confides that he's once had sex with Jackie, as if
            opening up to Gal will change his mind, bring him back into the
            camaraderie that Don imagines they once shared), insulting
            (&quot;Retired! You're revolting, you look like a leather man... a
            fat crocodile&quot;), then threatening (roaring into Gal and
            DeeDee's bedroom late at night, he yells at them, &quot;I won't let
            you be happy! Why should I!?&quot;).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">When
            all these approaches don't work -- Gal remains adamant about his
            retirement, refusing to be unmanned -- Don spins into a frenzy,
            gnawing on his own vulnerability and striking out at Gal's.
            Maintaining a veneer of manliness is the concern for all the
            gangsters, including Gal and the guys back in London. Every one of
            them is past his prime, but none save Gal can let go of the history
            they've shared. Gal's has given up his past, and the early scenes of
            his serene, slightly strange, isolated, and willful retired life
            suggest that he's vaguely drifting toward a future, happy in his
            marriage, complacent in his lack of effort. But if the gangsters
            look back and Gal looks forward, Don is ever stuck in the present,
            so tightly tuned to his immediate need and desire that he can't
            imagine other moments in time, consequences, or alternative
            possibilities. This constant sense of urgency and immediacy makes
            Don fragile, simultaneously a comic extreme and desperate live wire,
            recognizable and horrifically unknown. <i>Sexy Beast</i> loses some
            of its juice when he's not on screen, but when he is, the wreckage
            he embodies feels irreparable. <o:p>
