            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;There's nothing more toxic or 
            deadly than a human child.&nbsp; One touch would kill you, &quot; explains 
            Monsters Inc. CEO Henry J. Waternoose (Coburn) to his employees, as 
            he admonishes them to take more care when at work.&nbsp; Unfortunately, 
            the employees are a high risk for having that experience, since 
            their job descriptions require them to play upon the traditional 
            childhood fears of monsters lurking in the closet.&nbsp; Monsters, Inc. 
            is the only power supplier to the city of Monsteropolis, and the 
            source of that power lies in the screams of human children.&nbsp; 
            Operating from a &quot;scare floor&quot; arrayed with rows of interchangeable 
            closet doors that are really time portals, the monsters hurtle 
            themselves through sometimes incredible distances and regions to 
            reach their nightly &quot;targets&quot;.&nbsp; Once they arrive,&nbsp; they must eke out 
            the loudest scream possible:&nbsp; the louder the scream, the more power 
            it generates.&nbsp; Without those screams, they, and their city, would 
            die.&nbsp; Unfortunately, a wrench has fallen right into the clockwork, 
            threatening the monsters' supply of safe, clean power:&nbsp; just as 
            Monsteropolis is experiencing an energy shortage, most contemporary 
            children have become so jaded that the concept of monsters leaping 
            through closet doors with snarls and growls poised on the tip of 
            their lips inspires no more than a yawn. Now the monsters are under 
            pressure to – pardon the expression – obtain more charges from their 
            charges.</font></b></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">With loud screams 
            at such a premium, it's not surprising to discover that Monsters, 
            Inc. offers considerable incentives to inspire them.&nbsp; James P. 
            Sullivan (Goodman), &quot;Sulley&quot; to his friends, is an eight-foot high 
            monster, swathed in what looks like a turquoise-fuschia pile of 
            Orlon straight out of the reject pile, has a congenial attitude, and 
            an indefatigable ability to generate horrific ear-splitting screams, 
            thereby making him the most valuable of Waternoose's employees. 
            Sulley is on track to win the award for producing the greatest 
            number of screams, but he isn't going to win easily. Randall Boggs, 
            a chameleon who is ferocious in both demeanor and jealousy, is 
            obsessed with toppling Sulley's reign regardless of the time, effort 
            and lack of morality required to accomplish the task (Although 
            Randall leaves much of the dirty work to his sniveling assistant, 
            Fungus – voiced by Muppeteer-turned-director Frank Oz -- he is more 
            than willing to deliver the <b><i>coups d'état</i></b> personally).
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><font face="Verdana" size="2">One 
            night, Sulley discovers the extent of Randall's attempts to 
            overthrow him.&nbsp; While cleaning up some paperwork for his one-eyed 
            friend and scare assistant, Mike Wazowski (Crystal), Sulley 
            discovers that Randall's portal is still sitting in its docking bay, 
            instead of being in storage.&nbsp; Curiosity brings him in contact with 
            the object of Randall's constant torments, a three-year-old girl 
            (Gibbs) who, upon meeting Sulley, resists all attempts to stay in 
            her bedroom.&nbsp; Finally running out of options, Sulley reluctantly 
            takes her back to his apartment, knowing that she will suffer severe 
            punishment if she's caught (Waternoose's attitude toward children is 
            merely a restating of official policy in Monsteropolis). He involves 
            Mike in his scheme to get the child, who is given the name &quot;Boo&quot;, 
            back through the portal before the Child Detection Agency (Monsteropolis' 
            anti-child SWAT team) detects her presence -- or her absence.&nbsp; 
            Sulley and Mike's attempts lead to a great deal personal stress – 
            Mike interrupts his date with the love of his life, a sultry Cyclops 
            named Celia (Tully) -- slapstick chaos, pathos and peril, especially 
            when it becomes obvious that Randall is not the only one at 
            Monsters, Inc. with desperate ambitions.&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Visually, 
            the film is peerless. <i>Monsters, Inc.</i> establishes new 
            benchmarks in computer animation. Both in part or as a whole, the 
            Pixar team has created a new and cleaner visual style, one that 
            eliminates many of the problems inherent to designing and generating 
            computer-animated images.&nbsp; These achievements are especially evident 
            when considering the major difficulty that animators have faced, 
            whether working with pen and ink or with pixels:&nbsp; the ability to 
            generate realistic-looking human characters.&nbsp; (In both <i>Toy Story</i> 
            and <i>Toy Story 2</i>, all of the human figures looked more 
            toy-like than the toys themselves, with a bloated, &quot;bubble&quot;-like 
            appearance).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the character Boo, lead animator Dave DeVan has 
            edged even closer to the realization of that goal.&nbsp; DeVan, a Pixar 
            veteran who also worked on the designs for Woody and Buzz Lightyear, 
            has depicted a child who is a persuasive facsimile of her human 
            counterpart.&nbsp; She cries, she laughs – but, more importantly, and 
            most of the time, she looks like she is actually a part of the 
            scenes in which she appears: in other words, her body doesn't stick 
            out awkwardly from the background.&nbsp; As usual, Pixar has maintained 
            its already high standards in creating the overall visual concept of 
            the rest of the cast: the use, placement and movements of fur, 
            eyeballs and claws have been managed with what seems to be almost 
            instinctive perfection.&nbsp; <i>Monsters, Inc.</i> with a wonderful and 
            bizarre blend of the monstrous and the entertaining.&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">After viewing <i>
            Monsters, Inc.</i>, it's evident that The Pixar teams have also made 
            amazing leaps in constructing action sequences.&nbsp; This methodical 
            reconsideration of how to make things – and monsters – move in a 
            grand scale has resulted in animation that makes the eyes pop, as in 
            the scene in which Sully has to ride a sled down a mountain.&nbsp; The 
            overall effect is pictured from Sulley's point of view, and every 
            aspect of it – from the mad descent to the rendering of the 
            snowflakes – is so perfect that your eyes are transfixed in awe at 
            the artistry – not to mention the computing power -- required to 
            create them.&nbsp; The real proof of genius, however, lies in the film's 
            finale.&nbsp; It is set in the &quot;door vault&quot; where all of the closet doors 
            of Monsters, Inc are stored, before being whisked along over miles 
            of overhead conveyor belts to their intended place.&nbsp; The setup is an 
            obvious borrowing from the &quot;baggage-room&quot; sequence in <i>Toy Story 2</i>, 
            but one that has been expanded in complexity well beyond anyone's 
            expectations.&nbsp; Sulley and Mike must pursue Randall over, under and 
            through the doors in a massive warehouse.&nbsp; Since the warehouse holds 
            5.7 million doors, the journey takes on some extremely vertiginous 
            aspects for the audience, whose point of view becomes more of a 
            roller-coaster ride than watching a film.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The script for <i>
            Monsters, Inc.</i> is pure Pixar: lots of wit and hilarious chaos.&nbsp; 
            But&nbsp; screenwriters Stanton and Gershon have taken advantage of Billy 
            Crystal's presence to fill the script with lots of opportunities for 
            screwball humor.&nbsp; The dialogue and situations&nbsp; bubble over with 
            persuasive wit and pathos without falling into either smugness or 
            sentimentality, but the manic humor, best embodied by the sly and 
            snappy one-liners which have been given, wisely to Crystal, and the 
            constant mad dashes down the hall of Monsters, Inc., tend to keep 
            the pace buoyant.&nbsp; When Mike and Sulley, for example. smuggle a 
            disguised Boo back into Monsters, Inc. in an attempt to send her 
            back to her room.&nbsp; Accidentally encountering Waternoose in the 
            company lobby, Mike quickly, with false casualness and nervous 
            mugging, flippantly explains that her appearance is part of the 
            annual &quot;'Take an Obscure Relative to Work' day.&quot; Also present is the 
            trademark Pixar approach to &quot;in&quot;-jokes:&nbsp; subtle, almost throwaway, 
            gestures scattered sparsely throughout the film&nbsp; (For example, the 
            name of the sushi restaurant where Mike and Celia go to pitch woo is 
            named &quot;Harryhausen's&quot;, a tribute to special-effects master Ray 
            Harryhausen, best known for his work on 1963's <i>Jason and the 
            Argonauts</i>).&nbsp; The screenwriting duo also provide a steady flow of 
            well-proportioned sentiment into the film, as the relationship 
            between Boo, Mike and Sulley develops, emotional gooiness is not 
            allowed much of an opportunity to seep into the proceedings. Even 
            the potentially sensitive issue of causing children endless 
            nightmares about monsters in the closet has been treated with care;&nbsp; 
            the writers always keep the fear factor to a minimum and enclose it 
            within lots of humorous situations (The other monsters' foul-ups are 
            a great source of humor.).&nbsp; Besides, there's no opportunity for fear 
            when you're laughing too hard and running to keep up.&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Is <i>
            Monsters, Inc.</i> flawless?&nbsp; Well,&nbsp; without giving too much away, 
            some might think that the film's storyline relies too heavily upon 
            certain traditional, hence well-worn scenarios.&nbsp; From a 
            retrospective glance, however, the use of familiarity really ensures 
            a secure base upon which to balance, and expand upon, an almost 
            inexhaustible amount of inspiration and talent.&nbsp; The end result is 
            indisputable proof of the filmmakers' ability to pick and choose 
            impeccably. </font></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
            Monsters, Inc</i>. is a perfect addition to Pixar's film library – 
            or anyone's, for that matter.&nbsp; The film sets new and higher 
            standards for the visual &quot;look&quot; of future computer animation.&nbsp; 
            Coupled with a great script and Pixar's innate ability to match a 
            character with just the right actor (Goodman and Crystal's duo 
            establishes an unbreakable and persuasive rapport from the very 
            beginning), <i>Monsters, Inc.</i> is a delight.&nbsp; These monsters in 
            this closet are no illusion, but they might appear to be 
            considerably less scary.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
            <a name="ForTheBirds" target="_top"></a>
            Monsters, Inc.</i> is preceded by a Pixar-produced short, <i>For the 
            Birds</i>, a simple tale about a flock of little birds who dislike 
            each other a lot, but discover that they dislike a goofy-looking 
            bird far more.&nbsp; They gather together and attempt to rid themselves 
            of this interloper, with embarrassing consequences.&nbsp; <i>For the 
            Birds</i> is a side-splitting illustration of how combustible the 
            mix of hostility and hubris can become.</font></td>
