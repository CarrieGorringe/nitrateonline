            review by <a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 28 September
            2001</i></font>
            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Everywhere he looks, Howie 
            Blitzer (Paul Franklin Dano) sees traffic, a frightening emblem of 
            the speed and ferocity of life. As he walks along a bridge over the 
            Long Island Expressway, he pauses to peer over the railing, 
            imagining the death that each car might represent, remembering those 
            who have died there -- Harry Chapin, Alan Pakula, his own mother. 
            &quot;It's taken a lot of people,&quot; he sighs. &quot;I hope it doesn't get me.&quot;
            </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This first scene in Michael 
            Cuesta's <i>L.I.E. </i>(named for the Expressway) introduces Howie 
            as a thoughtful kid, aware of his lack of control over a world that 
            rushes by daily, and unsure what he might do about it. While you'd 
            probably call it a coming of age film, <i>L.I.E. </i>doesn't follow 
            the usual route, from complacency to crisis to salvation and some 
            kind of wisdom. Instead, it offers glimpses of Howie's developing 
            self-awareness as it comes in fits and starts. Here, &quot;salvation&quot; is 
            a myth, and the best Howie can do is survive, which he does, with a 
            fourteen-year-old boy's innate grace and lucidity. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Given that his mother died just 
            months ago, Howie is reasonably jittery about abandonment. Also 
            reasonably, he's not inclined to discuss his feelings with his 
            contractor dad, Marty (Bruce Altman), who's busy distracting himself 
            with a busty woman Howie sees primarily as Not His Mom, and looking 
            for quick, shady-deal-type money. This gets him in trouble with his 
            seedy associates and the cops too, leading to his arrest. Because no 
            one tells Howie where his dad has disappeared to, he assumes he's 
            been abandoned again. It makes a grim sense in the world where he 
            lives. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">An aspiring writer, Howie sometimes 
            shares his poems with his best friend Gary (Billy Kay). He also has 
            a crush on Gary that he can't articulate, or really, even 
            acknowledge. The film treats this with respect rather than 
            titillation: at one point, the boys are wrestling, the way boys do, 
            and as they suddenly find themselves in position to kiss, they gaze 
            at each other for a moment. The exchange is full of longing and 
            possibility, and in another movie, say, a teen romance, it would 
            lead to swelling strings on the soundtrack. In <i>L.I.E.,</i> 
            however, the moment passes, as it so often does in life. Neither boy 
            can act on his desire, because it's too raw and unspeakable. </font>
            </p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With their buddies, though, Gary 
            and Howie act out like a lot of other bored and worried kids, 
            scarfing pizza, hanging round convenience stores, and trading sex 
            stories (one kid claims he sleeps with his sister, then is nonplused 
            when Gary suggests he should be using a condom to avoid pregnancy). 
            At night, the crew of four heads off in search of little thrills, 
            mostly gained by burgling homes in their suburban neighborhood, 
            Suffolk County's Dix Hills. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's on one of these excursions 
            that Howie literally runs into the man who will change his life, Big 
            John Harrigan (the superb Brian Cox), an aging ex-Marine and 
            long-time local who has friends in the police department as well as 
            in the drug and sex &quot;underworld.&quot; Despite this collision, during 
            which John attempts to stop the robbery but ends up with only a 
            handful of Howie's pants fabric, the boys abscond with a set of 
            John's prize pistols, which bothers him no end. Big John tracks them 
            down and demands the guns' return (the symbolism is too heavy here, 
            and indeed, such is the film's tendency throughout). </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Unbeknownst to Howie, Gary already 
            knows John, having turned some tricks for him and slept with him as 
            well. To Howie, John initially looks ominous: he really is big, in a 
            physical sense, as well as the way that his self-assured presence 
            seems to fill up a space. When John suggests that Howie might 
            perform a sexual service for him, the boy is taken aback, but then 
            begins to tease John, coming to a sudden and also uncertain 
            comprehension of his own sexual power. In order to maintain some 
            semblance of control over the situation, John pulls back, then takes 
            pity on Howie when first, his father and then Gary, disappear.
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Even as the power dynamic between 
            them shifts continually, John and Howie come to a tenuous mutual 
            trust. Howie's openness to experience, and his aggressive pursuit of 
            affection and attention, make him a more nuanced kid than you 
            usually see in movies. His interest in sex and awkward seduction of 
            Big John are the likely reasons behind <i>L.I.E.</i>'s otherwise 
            inexplicable NC-17 rating. While an adult's deviant longings might 
            be standard movie fare, a boy's desire is clearly unnerving, as kids 
            are supposed to have no such desires, and certainly, no apprehension 
            of their bodies as erotic. Howie's lust and curiosity are so 
            innocent, so childlike, and so natural, that they can't help but be 
            troubling to those adults who forget how sexually charged their 
            childhood experiences could be. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But if this exploration of Howie's 
            desire is the movie's most daring aspect, its eventual punishment of 
            the complicated pederast Big John is its most banal. Delivered by a 
            spurned boy-lover at film's end, this creates an unnecessary and 
            too-tidy &quot;cause-and-effect&quot; trajectory. Worse, it jams up the 
            movie's earlier, subtle evocations of all the confusions and 
            catastrophes that make life resemble freeway traffic. </font></p>
