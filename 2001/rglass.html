            like to think that Leelee Sobieski is an intelligent person as well
            as a talented actor. While the latter point is obvious, the former
            is a matter of me hoping for the best, because even intelligent
            people, we all know, can be sucked up in the entertainment biz.
            Still, it seems that maybe, intelligence might be helpful in the
            struggle. <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Why
            do I care about Leelee Sobieski's struggle? Probably because she's
            done very good work (and a lot of it for someone so young),
            including a couple of high school romances (though, to be fair, she
            was the mean girl in <i>Never Been Kissed</i> and the dead girl in <i>Here
            on Earth</i>, so that, in both cases, she avoided turning into the
            glowing prom date), a couple of interesting chances (Mimi Leder's <i>Deep
            Impact</i> and John Dahl's upcoming <i>Joy Ride</i>, in which she
            makes The Girlfriend role quite bearable), as well as a very famous
            lulu (Stanley Kubrick's <i>Eyes Wide Shut</i>). Not to mention the
            fact that she's been compared to Helen Hunt more than once. And yet,
            she appears to be riding out the usual teen-movie-star silliness
            with a modicum of dignity and some manifest respect for what she
            does -- her performances are consistently complicated, so that her
            characters are young, hopeful, and ready to be dazzled, but also, at
            some level, too experienced and weary already, the way that a lot of
            young people feel these days. <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I
            guess this is what I like most about Leelee Sobieski -- she looks
            like she can hold more than one idea in her head at one time. And
            so, despite the thundering bad buzz for <i>The Glass House</i>, I
            went to see it on opening day, hoping that Leelee would pull it out.

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Alas,
            she doesn't. But she is really up against it. <i>The Glass House</i>
            is a painfully predictable non-thriller, where rebellious high
            schooler Ruby (Sobieski) is subjected to some mighty harsh behavior
            modification. But unlike, say, Disturbing Behavior, where the point
            of the kids' abuses by their parents is made so very outrageously
            that you can root for the kids who are being so tortured and maimed,
            <i>The Glass House</i> pretends to be &quot;realistic,&quot; a
            thriller of the type that Hitchcock might make, or perhaps more
            accurately, that Hitchcock wannabes like Brian De Palma or Robert
            Zemeckis might make. It adopts a faux-elegance like <i>What Lies
            Beneath</i>, and unsurprisingly, comes up with equally tortured
            plotting and characterization. You keep wondering why no one in the
            movie is paying attention to what is perfectly evident to you. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">From
            jump, Ruby and her brother Rhett (<i>Jurassic Park III</i>'s very
            able Trevor Morgan) are in for trouble. He's pretty much a
            nonentity, a plot device so she has someone to save in order to
            become a better person. But she starts off as a bad girl, lying to
            her parents so she can go out cruising, drinking, and smoking dope
            with her girlfriends. After one of these excursions, Ruby comes home
            to learn that her really nice, really lenient parents have been
            killed in a car wreck (a wreck that, very strangely, Ruby then goes
            on to see in flashbacks whenever tensions rise: just how she knows
            what happened is never addressed, though it's possible she's just
            imagining the crash and the chaos and the fear on her mom's face).
            The scene where the cops tell her about the accident is grim,
            capturing the emotional hell she's in -- the camera swims around,
            taking her point of view, then fades to white as the cops hover over
            Ruby's passed out body. When she wakes, it's funeral time. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It
            couldn't be clearer that the girl is suffering from all kinds of
            guilt and anxiety, but what do the well-intentioned adults in the
            film do? They send Ruby and Rhett off to live with the smarmy
            &quot;guardians&quot; designated by her parents' will, a will that
            they apparently wrote a long time ago, when said guardians lived
            next door and everyone was feeling peachy-close. Now Erin and Terry
            Glass (Diane Lane and Stellan Skarsgard), look very suspicious: they
            might as well be wearing white-and-blue nametags that say,
            &quot;Hello, I'm the villain.&quot; Though the kids do have a
            perfectly pleasant and apparently concerned Uncle Jack (Chris Noth),
            they're sent to live in Malibu with the wealthy-seeming Glasses, and
            guess what? They live in a glass house. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Within
            days, the observant Ruby notices that her foster parents have all
            kinds of problems, exacerbated because the walls inside the house
            are windows. So, when she hears them fighting late at night, she can
            also look up from her floor below to see the scene too. It works
            both ways. Because she and Rhett are sharing a bedroom, when Ruby
            steps out into the hallway to change into her pajamas (apparently a
            bathroom is not handy), she's suddenly aware of Terry staring down
            on her, observing. Later on, Terry takes her out to dinner and then
            reaches across her chest, to put on her seatbelt -- or so he says.
            Ruby knows better. The icing on the cake is Erin's drug addiction,
            which Ruby spots when she finds her foster mom looking pretty
            &quot;cooked&quot; on the sofa, a needle sticking out of her arm. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">All
            this yucky stuff understandably perturbs Ruby. And the film invites
            you to worry for her, giving you glimpses of Terry and Erin when
            they're acting jumpy or seedy. He's got some big money deal that's
            gone south, and the kids have some large inheritance... the pieces
            are coming together. Finally scared enough to act, Ruby calls her
            dad's lawyer for help, never suspecting that Mr. Begleiter (Bruce
            Dern, as creepy and snuffly as he's ever been, and distinctly
            untrustworthy) might be in cahoots with the Glasses. Meanwhile,
            Rhett's been bought off, now content to play with his cool new video
            games till all hours, oblivious to everything that's going on. So,
            when Ruby musters up the gumption to talk to a counselor (Kathy
            Baker, in the movie for about four minutes), Rhett pretends
            everything's fine, and so Ruby's back at square one. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Blah
            blah blah. Ruby figures out that the adults who are supposed to look
            after her are useless at best, actually plotting to kill her at
            worst. At first glance, this makes a lot of sense as the basis for a
            teen horror movie: adults who aren't your wonderful, always
            laughing, and permissive parents, are the enemy. Okay, so this
            simplifies the parent-child relationship, in a kind of <i>Hansel and
            Gretel</i>-ish way. But if the theme is primal, the symbols are
            hammering: the house, the knife that plays a crucial role at film's
            end, and Terry's Ferrari, are all over-the-top, making it
            increasingly hard for Sobieski to do what she does well, which is to
            act like a real person in a real situation. It's distressing to see
            her in this film, because you know she has better things to do with
            her time.&nbsp;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            the end, <i>The Glass House</i> can't manage its own metaphors, and
            ends up tripping all over itself in order to give them a coherent
            context. What would make Terry so dastardly? Gangsters! He owes
            money to the wrong people and they show up occasionally, slamming
            him against walls (glass, of course) and murdering his associates in
            cold blood. And what would make Ruby sit still long enough for the
            movie to run at feature length? Ah, yes! Drug her, so that she lolls
            about in bed for days, like a dame in a 1940s <b><i>noir</i></b>-ish
            melodrama, until finally she pulls herself together just in time to
            foil the bad guys. By that time, however, you may be snoozing
            yourself. <o:p>
