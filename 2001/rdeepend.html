            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>
            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 17 August
            2001</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The dominant color -- or rather,
            the dominant, pervasive idea -- in David Siegel and Scott McGehee's <i>The
            Deep End</i> is blue. From the ominous presence of Lake Tahoe to the
            oppressively huge Nevadan sky, from characters' clothing and cars to
            the walls that seem to close in on them, every scene includes some
            shade of blue.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While it surely conjures up all
            kinds of longstanding cultural and emotional associations, this
            color motif is also a rather clever way to underline <i>The Deep
            End's</i> generic roots and disjointed timing: it is most definitely
            a throwback <i>film <b>noir</b></i>, but is also so acutely
            contemporary in its anxieties, that it's impossible to label as only
            that. Like many classic <b><i>noirs</i></b>, the movie follows a
            protagonist who takes a terribly wrong turn from which she never
            recovers, a turn that then takes the narrative into such peculiar
            and &quot;unrealistic&quot; directions that you can't help but be
            hyper-aware that you're watching a movie.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This despite the fact that <i>The
            Deep End</i> expends some energy inviting you to believe that
            Margaret Hall (Tilda Swinton) is an &quot;ordinary&quot; person, or
            at least an &quot;ordinary&quot; mother, who will do whatever it
            takes to protect her family. Her fierce intensity and unshakable
            resolve are movie conventions, the kind of attitudes that you
            examine closely in movies that put characters in extraordinary
            situations -- finding their ways in and out of these situations
            makes them extraordinary as well. First clue: Margaret lives in an
            incredibly expensive, stunningly designed house <b><i>on</i></b>
            Lake Tahoe, caring for her three kids and her father-in-law (Peter
            Donat), while her Navy officer husband is away at sea. No
            &quot;ordinary&quot; person lives in that house or lives that
            isolated, wearying life. It costs her. When Margaret wants a
            cigarette, she sneaks off to a room in a corner of that big house,
            by herself, and smokes it by the window, waving the smoke outside
            with her thin hand, like she's a teenager breaking the rules. This
            detail lays out her sense of alienation in her own home.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But if her self-awareness is
            limited at the start of <i>The Deep End</i>, it soon comes roaring
            to the surface, in a series of events that rupture her household and
            so, her sense of secure identity. And in this way, she's like a lot
            of obviously contrived movie characters, an element among many
            elements, encouraging you to think and rethink your own position,
            but not really making her own concrete. You may sympathize with and
            even marvel at her, but you never quite identify with her, at least
            not in the standard understanding of the term. What happens around
            and to and because of her is all too weird to be absorbed as
            &quot;ordinary&quot; or even very possible, experience. Instead, you
            watch as your jaw drops wider and wider, your brain wheels spin
            faster and faster. And you keep wondering, <b><i>when</i></b> will
            this woman do the right thing? Until you begin wondering, <b><i>can</i></b>
            she?</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As it happens, she can't. And
            that's because Margaret is Walter Neff -- Fred MacMurray's
            hopelessly in-over-his-head insurance guy from <i>Double Indemnity</i>
            -- reimagined as someone's mother. The first time you see her, she's
            already in trouble, and the film hasn't even started, really. She's
            leaving the bright sunshine behind and descending, quite literally,
            into a Reno nightclub called The Deep End, and everything around her
            -- the walls, the fish tanks, the bottles behind the bar -- shimmers
            blue. Menacing, pulsing blue. (And it's probably just coincidence
            that the last movie made by Derek Jarman, Swinton's longtime
            director, was <i>Blue</i>.) Looking lost and pale against this
            watery background, Margaret seeks out the club owner, one Darby
            Reese (Josh Lucas), whom, she has recently learned, is sleeping with
            her adolescent son Beau (Jonathan Tucker). She tells him to leave
            her Beau alone. Darby laughs at her.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As you soon learn, it took
            something of a sledgehammer cue for Margaret to realize that her son
            has developed into a sexual being: on the way from the club one
            night, he was in a nasty car wreck, a scene shown only in fragmented
            flashback, that focuses on Margaret's speedy fear and then relief,
            when she finds Beau alive in the ambulance. And then she gets mad.
            Margaret's crazy &quot;solution&quot; -- to confront the &quot;bad
            guy,&quot; restrict Beau's activities, and keep the entire matter
            secret from her husband (who, she says, &quot;wouldn't
            understand&quot;), and all on her own -- tells you a great deal
            about her. She's a hardcore mom, but she's also without options (at
            least in her own mind), and she hasn't thought through the possible
            consequences. And these are, no surprise, a major bitch.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The trouble that begins in that
            first scene in the club almost immediately expands to overwhelm
            Margaret's life; much of it takes place in broad daylight, with that
            glistening lake in the background. Margaret wakes the morning after
            her meeting with Darby to find his body in the lake. Assuming that
            she must protect Beau (whom she thinks is the killer, without even
            asking him a simple question at any point), Margaret hides the body
            in the lake. It gets worse: when she learns that she's dumped him
            with his car keys in his pocket, she goes back to the lake, strips
            to her white underwear and dives in, picking through his pockets
            while his misshapen, bluish face looms at her in the water. She
            returns home to make sure the kids get off to whatever
            extracurricular activities they have scheduled. She does everything
            she's supposed to do. And then some.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">On top of all this, which takes
            some time and a clear emotional toll, Margaret is approached by a
            blackmailer, Alek (Goran Visnjic). Now, a little late, she learns
            that Darby was hooked up with gangsters, and he owed money, and now
            they want the money from her, also assuming that Beau is the killer
            (in gangster debt-math, you assume your victim's obligations). Alek,
            who ends up being a fairly sympathetic guy himself, brings some
            incentive: a graphic sex tape starring Darby and Beau. This scene,
            as Margaret watches the tape, might be the most chilling in the
            film. The camera cuts from the grainy video to Margaret's ghastly
            pale face, and you can only guess what she's thinking. There's
            nothing here that she can repair or make better, and it has nothing
            to do with the body or the blackmail. Rather, it's about her son
            growing up. Beau is an adult, he likes sex, and she's suddenly been
            left behind.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And... she can't reach her husband.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is perhaps the creepiest and
            most abstract problem in the film -- the absent-present husband. The
            fact that she cannot bring herself to tell him about Beau's
            sexuality (the fact that he has sex, even more importantly than with
            whom) is a metaphor for her inability to be intimate or trusting
            with him in any way. He &quot;won't understand.&quot; That doesn't
            mean that Margaret does. But she wants to, or thinks she does. And
            that's what saves her, sort of.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Based on Elizabeth Sanxay Holding's
            novel <i>The Blank Wall</i>, already the basis of a 1949 <i>film <b>noir</b></i>,
            <i>The Reckless Moment</i>, directed by Max Ophuls and starring Joan
            Bennett, <i>The Deep End</i> is the second feature by Siegel and
            McGehee, whose <i>Suture</i> (1993), offered a witty deconstruction
            of the very idea of stable identity. <i>The Deep End</i> works a
            similar set of problems, with less intellectual game-iness, and more
            attention to the emotional pain and pleasure that come with such
            deconstruction. At the same time, it sticks to its <b><i>noir</i></b>-ish
            guns, fully appreciating and also tweaking the genre's improbable
            plot turns and gorgeous visuals.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The complicated twists involve
            Margaret's efforts to raise an impossible amount of money
            (impossible, even though she does live in that swank house), her
            changing priorities, and her increasingly passionate relationship
            with Alek. They develop a taut and provocative rhythm in their
            non-romance, evolving initially from Margaret's realization that her
            son has sexual desires and experiences, both like and unlike her
            own. Her self-conception mutates radically by the end of the film:
            she is a faster, braver, and more brutal thinker than she had
            imagined.</font></p>
