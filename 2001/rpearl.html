            review by <a href="../kj.html" target="_top">KJ Doughton</a>, 25 May 2001</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Remember the little
            anti-bootlegging slogan, &quot;Home Taping Is Killing Music,&quot;
            that used to brand record covers? For movies like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Pearl
            Harbor</i>, a statement in the credits such as, "Director Michael
            Bay Is Killing Film," would be a welcome public service. Bay is a
            one-time music video and television commercial director who has
            taken the montage-heavy, headache-inducing styles of those mediums
            and applied it like a wrecking ball to such past popcorn hits as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Armageddon</i>,
            <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Rock</i>, and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Bad Boys</i>.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">His films jerk you around with fast
            cuts, slick stunts, recycled dialogue, and an all-style,
            no-substance gloss that coats them like snot. Meanwhile, his
            attempts at characterization have all the layering, nuance, and
            dynamics of an Idaho spud field. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Pearl Harbor</i> is the kind of movie where a lover sent abroad to fight
            a war scribbles home ditties to his sweetie like, "It’s cold here,
            but I find warmth thinking of you." It’s the kind of movie where
            two military leaders argue with dopey exchanges like the following:</font></p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">&quot;If
              I were the Japanese, this is what I’d do.&quot;<o:p>
              </o:p>
              </i></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">&quot;Well,
              that’s not exactly hard evidence, is it?&quot;<o:p>
              </o:p>
              </i></font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s the kind of celluloid drivel
            where an experienced fighter pilot tells a cocky, young trainee, "You
            remind me of myself fifteen years ago." It’s the kind of painfully
            derivative wordfest where a dyslexic soldier having his vision
            tested by a military nurse declares "I mix up my letters sometimes,
            and might never be an English teacher, but you don’t dogfight with
            manuals!" It has the familiar image and rapport of a swaggering
            military upstart brown-nosing an admiring superior, before being
            told, "Flyboy, that’s bullshit. But it’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">good</i>
            bullshit."</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Pearl
            Harbor</i> is bullshit. And it’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">not</i>
            good bullshit.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ben Affleck plays Rafe McCawley, a
            young whippersnapper growing up on his dad’s Tennessee farm, in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Pearl
            Harbor</i>’s opening scenes. Rafe horses around in a cropdusting
            plane with abused neighbor boy Danny Walker (Josh Hartnett),
            fantasizing that he’s a badass war pilot shooting down those "nasty
            Germans." Bay serves up overbearing music and lovingly shot
            panoramas of golden wheatfields typically reserved for SUV,
            cigarette, and life insurance advertisements. The Marlboro Man would
            be right at home in this idealized land where people run in slow
            motion and appear in soft focus.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A few frames later, the two pals
            have grown up, joined the air force, and risen to the top of the
            fighter jock heap, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Top Gun</i> style. It’s 1941, when the military would apparently let
            two teenagers like Rafe and Danny aim expensive aircrafts at each
            other, "chicken"-style, during a mid-air practice flight, before
            veering off at the last millisecond to avoid a collision. Meanwhile,
            their admiring peers applaud such daring. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">These
            guys have cajones!</i> Alec Baldwin’s Commander Jimmy Doolittle is
            less impressed. "That’s not training," he chastizes. "It’s a
            stunt. You guys are reckless and irresponsible." It goes without
            saying that Baldwin’s military brass will take Rafe under his
            wing, secretly won over by the youngster’s fearless enthusiasm. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">This guy’s got cajones!</i> It’s not long before Doolittle requests
            that Rafe assist the English in the escalating overseas fight
            against Germany. Before his departure, however, Affleck’s air ace
            is wooing a military nurse named Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale).
            Although he flunks a vision test on account of some pesky dyslexia
            which he fears will jeopardize his eligibility to fly into battle,
            sympathetic Evelyn takes pity on the lovable hunk and passes him. "My
            father was a pilot," she says. "I’ve seen what happens when pilots
            lose their wings." Besides<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">,
            this guy’s got cajones!</i></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Until this point, Pearl Harbor is
            an entertaining hodgepodge of war cliches. There’s a clever bit
            involving air force recruits hoping to "get lucky" with their dates
            by rubbing clove oil on their eyes to induce sympathy-getting
            crocodile tears. "If I were to go to war tomorrow," says a weeping
            fighter jock to his date, "I’d want to remember back to this
            special time together." Touched by this phony emotional disclosure,
            she promises, "Tonight I’m yours." Less amusing are long, sluggish
            scenes of Rafe and Evelyn pondering the future with the following
            gag-inducing foreplay:</font></p>
            <blockquote>
              <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">"</i><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">What’s
              gonna become of us, Rafe?"<o:p>
              </o:p>
              </i></font></p>
              <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal">"</i><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Well,
              the future isn’t exactly in our hands, is it?"<o:p>
              </o:p>
              </i></font></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Not since Affleck courted a
            bikini-clad Liv Tyler in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Armageddon
            </i>by sliding animal crackers across her exposed midriff has there
            been such a schmaltzy cringefest of teenybopper-friendly romance.
            But wait – wasn’t <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Armageddon</i> the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">last</i> movie
            that Michael Bay directed?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It gets worse. Rafe is shot down
            during his fighting foray with The British Eagles, and thought to be
            dead. After mourning the brave soul, what is a best friend like
            Danny to do but bed his old mate’s girlfriend? Pretty soon, Evelyn
            is won over by Danny’s charms, and lets him deflower her in what
            appears to be a parachute storage shed. With silky, curtain-like
            chutes whipping in the wind like something out of a Victoria’s
            Secret commercial, the two bland lovers get it on with such
            bloodless, calculated detachment that they make porn performers look
            sincere by comparison.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s no stretch of the
            imagination to figure out that Rafe is still alive, having been
            picked up by a French fishing boat in occupied territory and unable
            to get word of his survival back to the home front. Predictably, the
            long-missing soldier trades punches with Danny in a bar after
            finding out that the woman-stealer has impregnated Evelyn. "Rafe,
            you’re the only family I got," pleads Danny. "When you left, I was
            never so lonely." Male bonding and forgiveness ensue, just as
            Japanese planes are gearing up to pelt Hawaii with bombs and
            bullets.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And what of the movie’s
            centerpiece battle, a spectacle alleged to have brought <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Pearl
            Harbor</i>’s budget beyond the $120 million mark? Unbelievably,
            the film’s recreation of December 7, 1941, in which Japanese
            submarines and carrier-based planes attacked the U.S. Pacific
            fleets, is so impersonal and unfocused that it had this reviewer
            nodding off. Bay attempts to pull off the same sense of dramatic
            urgency that Steven Spielberg mastered in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Saving
            Private Ryan</i>, or James Cameron aced with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Titanic,</i> both of which tackled similar historical tragedies but
            stamped them with a passionate, visionary touch. In attempting to
            depict the fight that demolished eight American battleships,
            destroyed 200 American planes, and killed or wounded 3,000 military
            personnel, Bay gives us nothing more than an onscreen video game.
            You might marvel at all the money up there making things blow up
            real good, but it’s doubtful that you’ll become emotionally
            involved with any of it.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The acting is wooden, but it’s no
            fault of the talents involved here. Bay and producer Jerry
            Bruckheimer, who always makes sure his movies look great, even if
            they flunk every other test of good cinema, have pulled together an
            attractive trio of leads to pull teenagers through the box office.
            Beckinsale, familiar to indie film connoisseurs from Walt
            Whitman’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Last Days of
            Disco</i>, has the thankless role of a barely human tailor’s dummy
            who spends most of the movie running around looking for her two
            uniformed suitors. Newcomer Josh Hartnett looks lost amidst all the
            explosions and overproduced set pieces, but Affleck anchors his hero
            role with a laid-back, confident charm. He seems comfortable in
            leading man shoes, even as he is forced to shoot down planes in sexy
            hula shirts and mouth lines like, "Flying is the only things I’ve
            ever wanted to do."</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To make sure that moviegoers leave
            the theater in a "feel good" mode, Bay lets Rafe and Danny bomb
            Tokyo during a retaliatory Japanese air attack. It’s a bit of
            patriotic payback that seems phony and even insulting in an age
            where audiences seem perfectly able to handle the ugly realities of
            war pitched to them by <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">…Ryan,
            Platoon</i>, and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Full Metal
            Jacket</i>. Instead, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Pearl
            Harbor</i> gives us Alec Baldwin smiling at his flyboys, big cajones
            and all, and proclaiming, "We might lose this battle, but we’re
            gonna win this war."</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">People often point fingers at <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Star Wars</i> for bringing on the decline of contemporary cinema.
            Puritans that grew up with Coppola, Altman, and Scorsese trash Lucas
            and Spielberg for creating The Age of the Blockbuster. However,
            I’d challenge the notion that Lucas had any idea his vision of
            wookies, light sabers, and heavy-breathing men in black masks would
            reap the financial rewards that have made him the icon he is today.
            In their own ways, weren’t Star Wars and Jaws every bit as
            renegade and daring as more "respectable" films like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Nashville,
            The Godfather</i>, and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Mean
            Streets</i>?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The real finger, preferably the
            middle one, should be reserved for hypemeisters like Bruckheimer and
            Bay, who study a film like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Titanic</i>,
            put out an inferior variation of its "history-meets-commercial-appeal"
            formula, then slam it down our throats with nonstop ads on every
            prime time television show and daily newspaper in the country. In
            the end, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Pearl Harbor</i>’s
            onscreen bombing attacks aren’t nearly as offensive as the attack
            that its creators have waged on their audience.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
