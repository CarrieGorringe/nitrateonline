            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Paula Nechak</a>, 13 April 2001</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>I never thought I’d ever agree
            with Mel Gibson on anything, let alone his opinion on one of his own
            films. But by clipping the quip "boring as a dog’s ass" onto the
            collar of Wim Wenders’ latest misadventure, <i>The Million Dollar
            Hotel</i>, Gibson’s hit the bull’s eye. The aging Aussie
            heartthrob stars in the film, which is produced by Icon, his company
            banner and heck, I even admire him a bit because he’s cut off his
            own nose to spite his film’s face (and fate) by brave-heartedly
            bashing it. OK, so he retracted, or at least put the remark into
            some semblance of context after "story by" credited rocker - U2’s
            Bono – who thought up the murky mess (with writer Nicholas Klein),
            went ballistic over Gibson’s blurb about the unreleased final
            product.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But sure enough, <i>The Million
            Dollar Hotel</i> may wear the mantle of being the first Mel Gibson
            movie to go straight to DVD and video after a few under-whelming
            festival screenings, thereby proving the superstar’s prophecy to
            be true.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Indeed a dog’s ass may be far
            more stimulated than "The Million Dollar Hotel," which is as tedious
            as a blank canvas fobbed off as art, despite some prototypical
            Wenders mood and noirish shades and tones. It’s a flagrantly
            undernourished story idea with little originality of character or
            insight.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With a yellow flag of a cast that
            includes Jeremy Davies, Milla Jovovich, Amanda Plummer, Tim Roth,
            Harris Yulin, Donal Logue, Gloria Stuart, Julian Sands, Jimmy Smits,
            Peter Stormare, Bud Cort - and Gibson, wearing a body brace to keep
            his character’s scarred torso erect, the film is certain to
            screech into teeth-grating territory simply by virtue of such
            acquired-taste thespians.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But grate, predictably, they do,
            playing down-and-outers forced (by the injustice of the system and
            the inaccessibility of medical insurance) to hole up in a fleabag
            hotel on the seamy side of Los Angeles. And one (or more) of them
            holds the key to the recent murder/death of another million-dollar
            tenant.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Into this fray of despair, grime,
            woeful love, illness and secrets limps Detective Skinner (Gibson),
            an FBI agent intent upon closing the case in a weekend in order to
            join a fiancée already warming the sheets at some exotic locale.
            Skinner has been hired by Stanley Goldkiss (Yulin) to learn which of
            the sorrowful inhabitants has pushed his son, Izzy (an uncredited
            Tim Roth), from the neon-bathed roof that harbors their decaying,
            forsaken lives.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Key suspects include hyperactive
            Tom Tom (Davies), who is mourning for the love of the elusive Eloise
            (Jovovich) and Native American, Geronimo (Smits), who was the dead
            man’s roommate.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The screenplay dwells too-lovingly
            upon the idiosyncrasies of the characters, each of who is annoyingly
            full of tics, quirks and inner demons. And by never introducing us
            to the dead man, instead waiting until the film’s final moments to
            unveil the solution to the mediocre mystery that warranted his
            murder, we’re distanced from the requisite emotional involvement
            or connection to his demise.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is a juvenile romance with the
            great unwashed, tightrope walking on the edge of self-destruction,
            eccentricity and obsession. It works in the autobiographical
            writings of Charles Bukowski because a profound understanding of the
            duality of human nature as well as humor sears his pages, but <i>The
            Million Dollar Hotel</i> is sloppy, an attempt at atmosphere and
            tone that neglects basic rules of form, structure, content and
            logic. It’s a good case in point for never again allowing a rock
            star, used to writing in succinct lyric rhyme, to try and translate
            that rhythm to the more intricate, demanding scope of the cinema.
            The blank space between the lines can’t be filled by Wenders’
            trademark visual style and the result is a film that thuds with
            inertia. Its resume of clichéd, kooky, loveable losers,
            unscrupulous power players and preying media dogs make this a long
            stay at one deadly dull hotel.<span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"></o:p>
