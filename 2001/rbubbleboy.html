            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The other morning I saw Carol
            Ann Demaret, mother of the original &quot;bubble boy,&quot; on <i>The</i>
            <i>Today Show</i>. She appeared with her son's doctor, and she looked
            stern as she explained her concern that the new film <i>Bubble Boy</i>
            would defile the experience and memory of her son, who suffered from
            an immune deficiency so severe that he spent his brief life (twelve
            years) in a germ-free, plastic environment. Though she hadn't seen
            the film, Mrs. Demaret had seen a trailer on TV, and was appalled to
            see the titular character bouncing down the street in his bubble,
            being hit by a bus, and generally being the butt of repeated
            slapstick assaults. In defense of the film, director Blair Hayes
            called it a summer comedy with a &quot;great heart,&quot; in which
            the bubble boy is the hero.</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Having seen the movie, I can say
            that Hayes is not lying. Bubble boy Jimmy Livingston (Jake
            Gyllenhaal) is easily the most sympathetic and definitely the least
            unpleasant character in sight. And herein lies the irony of the
            anti-<i>Bubble Boy</i> campaign mounted by Mrs. Demaret and the <b>Immune
            Deficiency Foundation</b>: when it comes to being offended by this
            movie, they will have to take a number. Written by Cinco Paul (who
            played a school counselor in <i>Dude, Where's My Car?</i>) and Ken
            Daurio, in slavish imitation of the Farrelly-Tom Green-<i>Jackass</i>-Andy
            Dick bodily-function humor model, <i>Bubble Boy</i> has nothing but
            mean things to say about everyone. And I mean, everyone. While Mrs.
            Demaret has been understandably dismayed by Disney's demonstrated
            lack of concern for her feelings (the company has refused to meet
            with her or to include a note on where to get information on immune
            deficiency in the film's closing credits), the company's stance
            makes basic marketing sense: she's generating free publicity for <i>Bubble
            Boy</i>. All this week before the film's opening, CNN has been
            airing her complaint alongside press junket footage of the very
            sweet-looking Gyllenhaal,<b> </b>also defending the film's
            &quot;heart.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This much-mentioned heart, however,
            is less visible in the actual film than other body parts, namely,
            penises and breasts. <i>Bubble Boy</i> spends only a few minutes on
            Jimmy's presexual life, via his voice-overed recollections of the
            &quot;big birds&quot; (nuns) hovering over his teeny,
            plastic-encased self and a couple of short scenes where his mother
            (Swoosie Kurtz) feeds him cross-shaped protein cookies, windexes his
            bubble, and reads him stories where every character who steps
            outside his bubble dies instantly. But such preliminaries only set
            up the focus on sex jokes. I suppose that there are cases to be made
            for the metaphorical possibilities here, and the &quot;burgeoning
            sexuality&quot; premise is hardly new, borrowed from the notoriously
            sentimental TV movie starring John Travolta, <i>The Boy in the
            Plastic Bubble</i>(1976), but <i>Bubble Boy</i> is at base just
            another teen-boy-on-a-road-trip-to-find-true-love movie. The immune
            deficiency angle is just that, an angle.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The object of Jimmy's affection is
            his next-door neighbor, vivacious, none-too-bright blond Chloe
            (Marley Shelton). They share a brief montage of precious teen-love
            moments, she on the outside of the bubble, he on the inside (they
            dance, play guitar, sunbathe, and watch their favorite TV show, <i>Land
            of the Lost</i>, which is, of course, mightily symbolic for Jimmy's
            own predicament). All the while, Jimmy's mom ferociously vacuums in
            the background. Fickle Chloe loves Jimmy, but she needs a boy she
            can &quot;hug,&quot; so she chooses the nearest one, an idiotic and
            wholly unattractive &quot;rock musician&quot; named Mark (Dave
            Sheridan), who tells Jimmy about his plans to deflower his bride and
            smokes a cigarette in the &quot;clean room&quot; where Jimmy's
            bubble is housed, but other than that, seems harmlessly mean and
            stupid. You see how the politics of this &quot;outrageous&quot;
            comedy are completely conventional: Chloe's prince is the really
            nice boy next door and mom is the villain (to a dreadful extent:
            it's eventually revealed that she has lied about Jimmy's condition
            since he was four years old and miraculously recovered his immune
            system: he's been living in a bubble because mom's crazy, not to
            mention anti-Semitic).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's only after Chloe and Mark
            leave for Niagara Falls, where they will be married in three days,
            that Jimmy decides he must follow, to tell her that he loves her and
            stop this unholy alliance. A lot of shlocky business occurs on the
            road: this is where Jimmy's mobile bubble is hit by a few vehicles
            and he encounters a series of pathetically obnoxious caricatures.
            The first is a busload of &quot;Bright and Shiny&quot;
            Christian-like cultists, led by Fabio. He also meets an ancient cab
            driver (Joseph Patrick Cranshaw) seeking his lost love named
            &quot;Poonanny,&quot; and Slim (Danny Trejo), a Latino biker, who
            advises Jimmy to pursue Chloe at all costs, because he lost his true
            love (named &quot;Wildfire&quot; and memorialized by the song on the
            soundtrack), and has regretted it ever since.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Slim gives Jimmy a ride on his
            motorcycle to Las Vegas, where they plan to win enough money to get
            Jimmy to Niagara Falls. This, um, doesn't pan out. And so, Jimmy
            meets some more oddballs, including a Hindi ice cream-and-curry
            vendor who suffers the indignity of running over a cow with his
            truck and having its guts sprayed all over him more than once; an
            absolutely horrific stereotype of an Asian strip club barker (who
            thought this was funny?); and a train-car full of circus freaks
            (including Beetlejuice as the Pinhead and Geoffrey Arend as
            Flipperboy), whom Jimmy inadvertently rescues from their abusive
            boss, Mr. Phreak (Verne Troyer), thus earning their undying loyalty,
            and of course, sense of identification. I think this identification
            has something to do with that &quot;great heart&quot; the filmmakers
            keep talking about: everyone Jimmy meets feels out of place somehow
            and seeks a way to fit in, even with that one special someone. But
            where exactly is it that they might want to fit in? And by whom
            might they want to be accepted?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Of course, these can't be
            considered serious questions in the context of a Farrelly-wannabe.
            But the context itself (which is all about wanting to fit in, isn't
            it?) raises relatively more interesting questions. And one of them
            is not &quot;Is there no limit to the ugliness of bodily function
            comedies?&quot; Finding and pushing beyond such a limit is precisely
            the concern of such comedies: as soon as you find it, it's become a
            non-limit, by definition of the genre. And so, you might be moved to
            think more carefully about what's at stake in the genre, what it has
            to do with the present moment, whom it's riling and why, and to whom
            it is appealing. For the one thing that is absolutely clear is that
            these many similar films would not be falling all over themselves to
            get into theaters if they were not making mad money.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The pretend answer -- as massaged
            by Hayes, above -- is that such films service viewers who feel
            reassured in seeing an outcast and loser succeed, which I guess
            means getting the girl: she's a prize, you know, nothing more. But
            what kind of a prize is she, exactly? Chloe can't speak her mind
            (mainly because she doesn't seem to have one), and yearns for
            something she can't quite put her finger on. Just so you know where
            that finger should be, the movie provides a scene where Chloe, bored
            and fretful in some Niagara Falls cabin, channel-surfs and comes
            upon a series of bubble images -- a Mr. Bubbles commercial, another
            for Bubble-icious bubble gum, and Don Ho singing &quot;Tiny
            Bubbles.&quot; She cocks her head and she looks like she's suddenly
            got an idea. Ouch.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"></o:p>
