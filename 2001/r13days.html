            review by <a href="../joe.html" target="_top">Joe Barlow</a>, 12 January
            2001</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>What is it about John F. Kennedy
            that inspires epic films? Thirty-eight years after the untimely
            assassination of one of America's most beloved presidents, people
            still can't get enough of JFK and his story. In his death, Kennedy
            has become something of a symbol for the American spirit of freedom
            and indomitability, and his deeds -- like the man himself -- have
            become the stuff of legend. That probably says as much about
            America's dire lack of contemporary heroes as it does the continuing
            intrigue of the Kennedy mythology. But no man is perfect, and Roger
            Donaldson's <i>Thirteen Days</i> paints Kennedy less as an
            archetypal American patriot than a frustrated, worried man
            struggling with the biggest problem of his (or indeed, of any man's)
            career: the Cuban Missile Crisis.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Donaldson and actor Kevin Costner
            are no strangers to political thrillers; the pair worked together on
            1987's <i>No Way Out</i>, one of this reviewer's favorite suspense
            movies (in my review for <i>The DVD Journal</i>, I compared the film
            -- favorably -- to Hitchcock's best work). And Costner, of course,
            has already parlayed his Kennedy infatuation into one hugely
            successful work, Oliver Stone's thoughtful <i>JFK</i>. But the great
            strength of <i>Thirteen Days</i> is the way that the supremely
            intelligent screenplay keeps the action focused squarely on the
            human drama of the story, rather than the ghastly events unfolding
            around the world. This lends an intimate feel to the proceedings,
            which suits the film well.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kenny O’Donnell (Costner) is a
            top political advisor to President Kennedy (Bruce Greenwood).
            Although kept busy with his job, O'Donnell is a devoted family man
            with nothing more worrisome in his idyllic life than his son's
            less-than-glowing report card. Things soon change, however, when
            American reconnaissance detects large stockpiles of Soviet nuclear
            missiles in Cuba. When Kennedy's demands for the immediate
            dismantling of the weapons fall on unresponsive Russian ears,
            Kennedy imposes a trade blockade around the island, an act which
            brings the world to the brink of nuclear war.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The performances here are
            consistently strong, though the film unfortunately proves, as did <i>Robin
            Hood: Prince of Thieves</i>, that Kevin Costner can’t do a
            convincing accent to save his life. Still, what he lacks in vocal
            diction, Costner more than makes up for in sheer screen presence.
            He's both friend and spiritual brother to John Kennedy and his
            little brother Bobby (a show-stealing performance by Steven Culp
            that has to be seen to be believed), and provides the strength and
            wisdom that the situation requires. Kenny, unlike most of the other
            characters in the story, recognizes the need to contain the
            situation as much as possible -- witness, for example, his request
            for American pilots not to report any enemy attacks to their
            supervisors. Kenny wisely recognizes that such reports would force
            Kennedy to respond in kind with violence. &quot;Sparrows,&quot;
            explains O'Donnell. &quot;That's all that hit your plane. Sparrows,
            not bullets.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Thirteen Days</i> is a skillful
            piece of filmmaking that reveals Donaldson's desire to educate his
            audience as well as entertain. The movie introduces each new
            character with a subtitle explaining his or her title and function,
            thereby ensuring that viewers born long after the events depicted
            here will still be able to follow the story with ease. Historical
            weight is given to the proceedings via black and white insert shots.
            And as previously stated, extra power is given to the story's
            performances and drama by depicting our protagonists not as super
            heroes but as men worried about their actions and plagued with
            self-doubt, as anyone would be.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Cuban Missile
            Crisis was the most dangerous chess game the United States has ever
            played, and <i>Thirteen Days</i> depicts every move with the respect
            and attention it deserves, often with haunting results. It’s a
            chilling indication of human nature, for instance, that while
            Kennedy celebrates the continuing peace between the two nations at
            the conclusion of the film, many of his advisors are already
            planning how to best use their new political clout to further their
            own careers. That says it all, really.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
