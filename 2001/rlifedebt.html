            </font></p>
            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;You see yourself. You see 
            yourself.&quot; As you hear these words in Stephanie Black's <i>Life and 
            Debt</i>, you see a montage of touristy images: lovely Jamaican 
            hotel room linens, a balcony view of a perfect beach, perfectly 
            tanned foreigners, even a wedding between a couple of tourists set 
            against a backdrop of perfectly blue surf. Everything is so pretty, 
            just as you'd expect when you've paid good money for your vacation 
            package. </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But by the time this 
            travel-brochure-ish sequence appears, some 15 minutes into the 
            documentary, it's hard to feel impressed by the luxury you're 
            looking at, much less hear Jamaica Kincaid's accusatory narration 
            (adapted from her 1987 nonfiction book about her own island home, 
            Antigua, entitled <i>A Small Place</i> and read in the film by 
            Belinda Becker). For by now, you've seen a little too much evidence 
            that globalization -- with help from the International Monetary 
            Fund, the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), 
            U.S. corporations and &quot;free trade&quot; policies -- has decimated 
            Jamaica's economy. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">By now, you've seen the dire 
            discrepancies between fine vacation haven Montego Bay -- blue sea, 
            white sand, drinks with umbrellas stuck in them -- and Kingston, 
            where Jamaican sweatshop workers provide tax-free labor, at $30 U.S. 
            a week, for companies like Tommy Hilfiger and Hanes; or between once 
            successful dairy, chicken, and banana farmers, now ruined by U.S. 
            powdered milk and chicken imports, and Chiquita and Dole produce. As 
            the film recounts, the Chiquita debacle included a police rout of 
            workers attempting to strike in 1993, during which 23 people were 
            killed. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you're a tourist, however, you 
            see no such disturbances. Death, poverty, misery -- these are what 
            the &quot;visitors' industry&quot; is designed to cover over. When you're on 
            vacation, you're &quot;allowed&quot; to be ignorant; this is the privilege of 
            privilege. The irony in this case is that tourism is one of 
            Jamaica's few remaining viable -- even thriving -- industries (along 
            with coffin manufacturing and guard-dog training). And so, <i>Life 
            and Debt</i> makes the connections for you, refusing to let you off 
            the hook. The narrator describes how the sewage system works (or 
            rather, doesn't, dumping waste into the ocean) or how the beef 
            industry has been ruined by cheap frozen &quot;patties&quot; shipped in from 
            the States. Such information rather puts a damper on the sights you 
            see from the tour bus window you see on the way to the hotel, 
            passing Baskin-Robbins and McDonald's and Burger Kings, and an 
            assortment of &quot;natives&quot; who, as Kincaid describes them, are 
            &quot;squatting by the side of the road... hanging out with all the time 
            in the world.&quot; But as former Jamaican Prime Minster Michael Manley 
            (elected on an anti-IMF platform in 1976, then forced, by lack of 
            alternatives, to sign agreements anyway, in 1977) explains, they're 
            only idle because they're put out of work by years of brutal 
            international tax and tariff structures and labor laws. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Much like Black's previous 
            documentary, 1990's <i>H2 Worker</i> (a look at the exploitation of 
            Caribbean sugar cane workers, which occasioned her first encounter 
            with Jamaican cultures), <i>Life and Debt</i> argues its case 
            aggressively, never even pretending to be &quot;objective.&quot; Shot in part 
            by brilliant U.S. cinematographer Malik Sayeed (<i>Clockers</i>, <i>
            Belly</i>), <i>Life and Debt</i> juxtaposes harsh TV footage of 
            rioting and poverty-stricken neighborhoods with shots of street 
            markets and art, reggae musicians and Rastamen talking politics and 
            spirituality. Through judicious editing, it sets up an &quot;imaginary 
            conversation&quot; between the outraged Manley (who died shortly after 
            the interview from which his comments are culled) and the imperious 
            Stanley Fischer, speaking for the IMF. He deploys standard 
            diplomatic double-speak: &quot;In an IMF Program, there'll be some 
            assumptions about the way interest rates will go,&quot; that is, these 
            assumptions -- and interest rates -- will be imposed on the 
            borrower, in order to best serve the lending institution, and no one 
            is precisely responsible, because all the language is passive.
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To make its case, the film also 
            includes a brief history lesson, with archival footage and political 
            speeches, intercut with scenes showing the devastating results of 
            the accumulating national debt (at present, Jamaica owes $4.7 
            billion to various lending agencies). The history lesson is 
            necessarily elliptical and referential, but harrowing nonetheless. 
            Queen Elizabeth announces the island's independence in a ceremony 
            that has nothing to do with the land and people she's affecting; and 
            in 1976, newly elected PM Michael Manley asserts Jamaica's new 
            policy, asserting, &quot;The Jamaican government will not accept anybody, 
            anywhere in the world, telling us what to do in our own country. 
            Above all, we're not for sale.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sadly, this speech, made some 25 
            years ago, now refers to a momentary effort to resist the 
            overwhelming force of globalization, and the very real decisions 
            made by people in power. What you see now is a sad, terrible 
            picture, not the way you want to see yourself reflected at all.
