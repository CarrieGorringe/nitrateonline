            review by <a href="../kj.html" target="_top">KJ Doughton</a>, 28 December 2001</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>&quot;You were found next to a
            1953 Ford, hypothermic, unconscious, at a quarry by a cliff,&quot;
            says an iceberg of a psychiatrist (Hope Davis) to confused mental
            patient Bill (Denis Leary), as he is jarred awake from a lengthy
            sleep. Bill’s mind is awash in flashbacks: visions of an admiring
            fiancée, a dying father, and a bout of booze-swilling behind the
            wheel of his pickup are all dancing in his scrambled noggin.
            Meanwhile, he blathers on about being frozen and groomed for some
            kind of cryogenic government experiment that will culminate in his
            death via lethal injection. Is Bill a delusional, psychotic nutcase,
            or is he really onto something? Such is the setup of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Final</i>,
            a movie that sounds like a futuristic thriller but plays out more
            like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">My Dinner with Nurse Ratched</i>.</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With Leary in the lead role, one
            might expect the film’s undercurrent of sarcastic humor, revealed
            in a scene where Davis’ bloodless professional leaves Bill’s
            dreary cell after a tense therapy session and he responds, &quot;See
            you later – I’ll be down by the pool!&quot; One might also
            expect the typically overbearing Leary to be a scenery-chewing live
            wire in this role, clawing at his cell walls like a caged animal.
            Refreshingly, Leary is relatively controlled as Bill, who comes off
            a more sedate Kyle Reese, the future-born, misunderstood hero of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Terminator</i>. He appears to be delusional, convinced that 400
            years have passed since he was put into deep freeze by the
            government. Ann, however, tells him otherwise. &quot;You’re a ward
            of the state of Connecticut,&quot; she insists. &quot;If you don’t
            cooperate, you’ll be here indefinitely.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What follows is a series of
            confrontations between the distant, guarded Ann and the impulsive,
            extroverted Bill, as he pieces together his jumbled fragments of
            memory during the duo’s one-on-one therapy sessions. Is the guy
            out to lunch, or does he have reason to fear an insidious plot and a
            &quot;final injection&quot; to end his life?</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This type of subject matter
            typically lends itself to a suspense framework, as in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Silence
            of the Lambs</i>, where the two-character quid pro quo sessions
            offered a contrast to the violence and tension that drove that
            classic thriller. But the way Scott presents it, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Final</i>’s
            redundant, stiff, colorless meetings between Bill and Ann are staged
            at such a leisurely pace that we’re waiting for someone to shut
            them up and provide some real tension. As we wait, and wait…and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">wait</i>
            for Final’s denouement during a premise that’s more interesting
            than its two ever-present characters, Scott continues to serve up
            stagy, talky interactions until we really don’t care anymore.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Final
            </font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">was produced as part of The
            inDigEnt Project, a digital filmmaking collective financed by The
            Independent Film Channel. The project’s goal – to produce ten
            feature films for under $100,000 each – was realized by Scott and
            nine other filmmakers including Richard Linklater, whose celebrated <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Tape</i> is a more successful example of inDigEnt’s resulting output.
            The volatile emotions that permeated that three-character hotel room
            exchange seemed better fit to this sparse, unpolished style of
            filmmaking than the mind-bending, &quot;What’s real and what’s
            not&quot; vibe that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Final</i>
            strives for.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"></o:p>
