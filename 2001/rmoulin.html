            review by <a href="../carrie.html" target="_top">Carrie Gorringe</a>, 25 May 2001</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>It is 1900. As anyone familiar
            with the nearly two-year ups-and-downs of the production that is now
            <i>Moulin Rouge</i> knows, the basic situation revolves around an
            emotionally wounded writer named Christian (McGregor) looking back
            upon his life a year earlier, when his world existed of the Moulin
            Rouge nightclub, his pursuit of a beautiful, ambitious courtesan
            named Satine (Kidman) and his friendship with artist
            Toulouse-Lautrec (Leguizamo). Unfortunately for poor Satine, love
            cannot save her from a five-pronged dilemma: her love for Christian,
            an obsession with becoming a star, a duke (Roxburgh) who is obsessed
            with her to the point of murder, the devil's deal that the owner of
            the Moulin Rouge, Harold Zidler (Broadbent), has made with the Duke
            in order to secure the nightclub's future, and one final,
            inevitable, condition that arbitrarily threatens to bring the usual
            disaster upon the whole intricately-balanced situation and everyone
            within its orbit. All of this is set to music derived from sources
            as diverse as the Police, David Bowie and within the sensual,
            colorful moral putrefaction of the <i>fin-de-siècle</i> world in
            which the Parisian upper class, unaware that their social and
            financial security would be decimated by 1920, went slumming for the
            last time. Perhaps the best title for this illusion/delusion-fuelled
            film might have come from a line from an R.E.M song: &quot;It's the
            end of the world as we know it//And I feel fine&quot;.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">By way of a disclaimer, I have to
            confess that I went into a screening of <i>Moulin Rouge</i> as a
            longtime connoisseur of musicals, and with an open mind, despite
            reports that the film had generated a 50-50 cleavage right down the
            middle of critical opinion at Cannes. I left the screening both in a
            state of admiration and profound disappointment. The film is
            supposed to be a hybrid, so to speak, of the
            &quot;old-fashioned&quot; musicals made between 1929 and 1957 and
            modern music videos. Through this combination, Luhrmann hoped to
            transfuse new life into a moribund cinematic form. After two years
            and $58 million, the immediate reaction to the film is amazement at
            Luhrmann's ability to capture history in a manner that is both lush
            and visually confident, and not without a good deal of help.
            Production designer Catherine Martin – Luhrmann's wife –
            establishes this atmosphere immediately with an exquisite visual
            balance of glitter and decay, one that is richly augmented by the
            super-saturated reds achieved by cinematographer Donald M. McAlpine.
            Despite some rather vertiginous moments with shots that induce a
            sense of whiplash rather than admiration, McAlpine and Luhrman
            balance them with gorgeous long takes that never detract from their
            subjects (one in particular is on a par with the famous dolly shot
            down and through a rain-drenched upper-story window in <i>Citizen
            Kane</i>: Luhrmann's version takes the camera up from the Moulin
            Rouge's stage near the end of the film and concludes the shot at
            medium-close-up range outside the window of Christian's garret). The
            lead actors work their parts for every ounce of raw, overworked
            emotion, have passable singing abilities and, since they are fine
            actors and this <b><i>is</i></b> a Baz Luhrmann film, after all
            (describing his delightful <i>Strictly Ballroom</i> and a grand,
            modern translation of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i> as &quot;emotionally
            torrid&quot; is an understatement), it seems as if the director had
            achieved his ambition of realizing a new form of the musical genre.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Luhrmann, however, has made some
            strategically erroneous assumptions in building a better musical
            format. In interviews with the director, both the interviewer and
            the interviewee have often been discussing Luhrmann's goals in terms
            of scientific improvement for the musical (&quot;interface&quot;
            both as a noun and a verb, for example, have made their way into
            print), suggesting perhaps an inherent inferiority in the musical
            genre, and Luhrmann is not wrong in making that conclusion (film
            genres don't tend to expire and stay dead despite occasional
            attempts to revive them without containing some serious structural
            flaws and/or extreme cultural irrelevance). Attempting to explain
            away the flaws in <i>Moulin Rouge</i> by pegging them to McGregor
            and Kidman's &quot;amateur&quot; status as musical performers is, at
            the very least, grossly simplistic (Gene Kelly and Fred Astaire may
            have been peerless dancers, but their singing voices were, to be
            polite, somewhat limited in range): Kidman had some ballet training
            as a child and McGregor's role requires only limited dancing (there
            are no &quot;Slaughter on Tenth Avenue&quot; or &quot;Broadway
            Melody&quot; sequences here, and, thanks to the above-mentioned
            camera work, the actors are merely part of the scenery, not its
            chief focus). The real source of the problem lies in Luhrmann and
            co-screenwriter Pearce's failure to comprehend how similar
            modern-music videos are to the &quot;old-fashioned&quot; musical:
            not only is the success of both driven by the exclusivity of the
            stars attached to the project in question, but also by the way in
            which the exclusivity of the material controls the audience response
            to it. Both forms rely upon powerful music, and (especially) upon
            intricate camera angles, editing and set design to create a sense of
            illusion that takes the audience &quot;into&quot; the work. If the
            overall composition of the components is effective, then the
            illusion holds (it's hardly surprising that film genre historians
            like Jane Feuer use the term &quot;entertainment&quot; to describe
            this phenomenon in musicals of making a carefully-constructed format
            seem like a spontaneous act). In short, the &quot;difference&quot;
            between music videos and traditional musicals, in terms of the
            structural elements and the goals each pursues, is really
            non-existent.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In addition, not only is Luhrmann's
            &quot;cure&quot; for the musical flawed because his assumptions
            about what ails the genre are incorrect but his belief in creating a
            new-and-improved musical format by combining the old style with
            modern music causes <i>Moulin Rouge</i> to collapse under the weight
            of an overbearing postmodernist sensibility. There is one
            significant difference between traditional musicals and videos, and
            it has a serious effect upon the credibility of <i>Moulin Rouge</i>.
            It lies in the relationship of performers to composers. After the
            advent of rock music in the 1950s, the balance of fame between
            songwriters and singers was upset in favor of a style in which those
            who wrote music were generally all but eclipsed in public awareness
            by performers (it might be argued that singer-songwriters like
            Carole King (from the late 1960s' to the present) and Carly Simon
            are exceptions to the rule, but, even though they write their own
            material, and it has been performed by others, the material does
            not, in the latter instance, sound as &quot;authentic&quot;, with a
            few exceptions – such as Aretha Franklin – because the music is
            so integrated with the public images of King and Simon). This loss
            of balance explains why Tony Bennett and Ella Fitzgerald, could put
            their individual stamps on the same songs by writers like Cole
            Porter or the Gershwin brothers, with both singer and songwriter(s)
            sharing equal credit for the recording's success, but the idea of
            anyone but Madonna singing &quot;Like a Virgin&quot; (one of the
            more egregious combinations of the ironic and the anachronistic in <i>Moulin
            Rouge</i>), is patently ridiculous; not only are the names of the
            individuals who wrote it relatively unknown to the general public,
            but the song is too much an entrenched part of Madonna's history as
            a performer to be ripped out of context in the name of so-called
            genre renewal. Thus, the entire film gives off an air of
            uncertainty, as if Luhrmann and co-screenwriter Pearce can't figure
            out whether they want to resurrect the musical or sabotage it. While
            it's fun on certain levels to play deconstruct-the-text as a test of
            musical and historical knowledge, the constant
            tongue-through-the-cheek wrenching on the film's characters and
            narrative, and an excessive reliance upon this uneasy
            anachronism-plus-renewal-equals-regeneration-via-ironic-subtext
            equation, take an irreparable toll on the film's legitimacy.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In perhaps the worst irony of all,
            Luhrmann and Pearce managed, while working on the script for <i>Moulin
            Rouge</i>, to forget the most important preconditions of all in
            formulating a script: consistency and relevancy, both of which
            Luhrmann had already mastered. His &quot;new and improved&quot;
            version of <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>, despite first impressions, was
            effective, not only for the movie-star presence of Leonard DiCaprio
            and Claire Danes, but also because the director correctly understood
            the common elements between the world of L.A. gangs and
            Shakespeare's play: passion and revenge always transcend both
            temporality and exclusivity. By contrast, <i>Moulin Rouge</i> has no
            relevancy, either for the present or the past. It is, instead, a
            beautiful mess, emphasizing can't-can't rather than the can-can.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
