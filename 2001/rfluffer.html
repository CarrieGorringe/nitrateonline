            review by <a href="../emma.html" target="_top"> Emma French</a>, 16 November

            <font size="2" face="Verdana">Wash Westmoreland's prior stint as a 
            gay-porn director, for both financial and educational purposes, has 
            produced a compelling and provocative new feature film, <i>The</i>
            <i>Fluffer</i>, on which he served as writer and co-directer (along 
            with Richard Glatzer). One of Westmoreland’s porn films, <i>The 
            Devil's Bottom</i>, was the first ever adult film, gay or straight, 
            to be included on the <i>LA Weekly</i> Best Films of the Year list, 
            and his break-out into the mainstream is promising. </font></span>
            </b></p>
            <p style="text-align: left">
            <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">The 
            film opens with a misunderstanding, as Sean (Michael Cunio), a young 
            ingenue newly arrived in Los Angeles, borrows <i>Citizen Kane</i> 
            from the video store only to discover he has been loaned a gay-porn 
            film called <i>Citizen Cum</i> by mistake. Westmoreland’s porn 
            industry training is put to good use in the opening sequence of <i>
            Citizen Cum</i>, which is strikingly erotic, whilst avoiding any 
            explicit images, and which successfully fetishizes its star, the 
            anti-hero Johnny Rebel (Scott Gurney), for the viewer from the 
            outset. Significantly, this is also the first and last time in which 
            sensuality can be found in the porn film sequences and shoots, which 
            are subsequently sterile, disconcerting and faintly ludicrous.
            </span></p>
            <p style="text-align: left">
            <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">
            Sean’s ensuing obsession with Johnny Rebel leads him to procure a 
            job as cameraman at Men of Janus, the production company which has 
            an exclusive deal with Johnny. Much of the film’s considerable 
            humour rests on the early porn movie scenarios, always an easy 
            source of laughs but presented here with freshness and originality. 
            A city slicker dominates two hapless dungareed rustics, a pool 
            cleaner does some unpaid overtime with his boss and the actors steal 
            Viagra between scenes to maintain the illusion of arousal. Men of 
            Janus (Janus being, as the boss explains, ‘the god of entrances and 
            exits’) produces such vintage movie titles as <i>Tour De Ass</i> and
            <i>Tranny Get Your Gun</i>.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: left">
            <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">Both 
            Sean and the reprehensible yet magnetic Johnny invite empathy 
            throughout, despite their complicity in the many tragic events the 
            story narrates. The capacity of Johnny’s girlfriend Babylon (Roxanne 
            Day) to convey innocence and goodness even when dressed in 
            pseudo-bondage stripper costumes is remarkable. Sean’s immersion 
            into the sleazy world he is experimenting with occurs with 
            disturbing and insidious imperceptibility. His job description 
            rapidly expands into “fluffing”: helping the porn stars out when 
            they have difficulty maintaining arousal. Encouraged by Johnny to 
            experiment with crystal meth at an industry party, the hilarity of 
            Sean’s wired description of Hitchcock’s <i>Vertigo</i> as ‘pure 
            porn’ temporarily masks the sinister nature of his transition from 
            classic movie buff to fluffer and criminal accomplice.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: left">
            <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">On 
            potentially dangerous ground with both their morality tale plotting 
            and their undeniably heavy use of symbolism, the directors somehow 
            make it work. Sean removes the batteries from his kitchen clock in 
            order to fuel his remote control for pausing <i>Citizen Cum</i> 
            lovingly at every body shot of Johnny Rebel. The frozen clock, 
            eternally trapped at the same moment, remains a motif throughout the 
            film, until a new clock faraway finally chimes the next minute for 
            Sean, relieving him of his emotional stasis. The protagonists’ 
            descent into emotional betrayal, drugs and loss of selfhood is 
            enacted with considerably more plausibility and directorial 
            restraint than the orgiastic downward spiral in <i>Boogie Nights</i>.</span></p>
            <p style="text-align: left">
            <span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">
            Black and white flashbacks to Sean’s childhood and the inevitable 
            introduction of a childhood abuse subplot are less successful. 
            Though the motivation is clear, the equally tired plot device 
            involving characters crossing the border to Mexico in this as in 
            other movies produces little more than a sense of gratitude to 
            Ridley Scott for driving Thelma and Louise into the Grand Canyon 
            instead. However, even the handling of these elements is far less 
            crass than the treatment they receive in many Hollywood studio 
            pictures. Indeed, the film throughout merits particular praise for 
            its subversion of traditional cinematic narratives: unrequited love, 
            coming of age and crimes of passion follow unpredictable courses in 
            an intelligent and compassionate movie.</span></td>
