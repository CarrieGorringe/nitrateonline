            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 20 April 2001</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The characters in <i>The Low
            Down</i> all look like they've just fallen out of bed. They're
            bleary-eyed. They wear clothes that can be easily laundered and then
            tossed down anywhere, without having to be pressed or hung-up. Aidan
            Gillen's character, Frank, who works in a small shop in London that
            makes props for TV shows, has hair which has a standing-on-end
            quality that looks as if it hasn't been brushed or combed for days.
            It's not as if he hadn't meant to; he just hasn't.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The characters also speak in
            ellipses. &quot;It's, um,...poky, isn't it?&quot; says Ruby (Kate
            Ashfield), the realty agent who shows Frank an apartment that turns
            out to be in less than stellar condition. &quot;Come in, and
            we'll...discuss,&quot; says John (Tobias Menzies), who works
            alongside Frank making props, and who has slept-in and forgotten
            that he was supposed to go and do something with him. At other
            times, the characters speak loudly, brashly, coarsely, they
            interrupt each other, cajole, evade.... They come across like --
            good grief! -- genuine, grade-A, recognizable human beings.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jamie Thraves, who wrote and
            directed the film, has made it in a loose, neo-improvisational style
            that is meant to give the proceedings an &quot;authentic&quot; feel,
            while leaving a way open to incorporate such devices as when the
            film freeze-frames the moment where one character looks at another,
            and vice-versa, and falls in love. Some of the conversational scenes
            are filmed in a very up-close, suspended way that brings to mind the
            opening-credits sequence for Michelangelo Antonioni's <i>Zabriskie
            Point</i>, except that there was a particular reason why the
            sequence was filmed that way (to show that an &quot;open&quot;
            discussion doesn't necessarily mean that people are connecting with
            each other, and could even be driving them further apart), and
            Antonioni didn't make the rest of the film that way. Here, it could
            be the result of the filmmakers simply using fast, compact equipment
            (which also happened to squash the visual depth-of-field), partly so
            they can exercise better control over the material, which focuses on
            characters who started out with some promise but have now become
            almost completely marginalized.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">John, whose friendship with Frank
            goes way back, started out as an artist but has gotten himself into
            a self-perpetuating pattern that has all but effectively sabotaged
            his chances at having a future. He arrives at work habitually late,
            says that his car has broken down, again, while wearing newly-bought
            shoes which are not inexpensive. Tobias Menzies gives John the
            pitiable but nonetheless maddening quality of someone who's
            careening into trouble but won't listen to anybody telling him to
            stop, deflecting criticism while asserting his wrongheadedness and
            unwillingness to relent. Placed in charge of painting a huge human
            hand carved from synthetic material, John proceeds to use yellow
            rather than flesh-colored paint on it -- it's an &quot;artistic
            prerogative,” he explains, as if hoping that someone will validate
            his idea and lend it, and him, some credence. Frank and Mike (Dean
            Lennox Kelly), who runs the shop, can't decide on letting John go if
            he feels this strongly about doing things his way, because they know
            that, left to his own devices, John will flounder haplessly and
            vanish. John is dependent on these two guys, and they know it, even
            though he continually drives them to distraction.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Frank, in the meantime, has taken
            up with Ruby, who, as played by Kate Ashfield, has a sweet quality
            as well as a keen sensibility which is endearing. They don't so much
            fall into a relationship as become inexorably drawn into one. They
            both say up-front what caused their last relationships to break up,
            and then, certainly enough, the same things start happening that
            caused their last break-ups to occur. What ostensibly makes Aidan
            Gillen's character seem appealing -- his way of smiling quietly and
            observing things with an even look, as if he's calm and self-assured
            under the surface -- is in fact what betrays his biggest weakness,
            which is his consistency at becoming disengaged from what's going on
            around him. In one scene, Frank and Ruby decide to go down to the
            corner pub for a drink, but, partway there, Ruby comments on a
            window that Frank left open in his second-floor flat, a window which
            faces the street where a group of guys stand on the corner, talking
            and hanging-out. Frank becomes convinced that he has left himself
            open to being robbed blind, and can't take another step forward.
            Yet, when he and Ruby go back to the apartment, Frank can't go back
            out again -- he's sure that the guys they passed on the corner will
            think that they came back because they thought they would rob
            Frank's flat. It doesn't matter whether the guys noticed Frank and
            Ruby coming or going at all, or whether it makes any difference what
            they think -- Frank becomes paralyzed over the thought that he did
            something that would cause anyone else, for whatever reason, to
            believe he had &quot;thought badly&quot; of them, while, at the same
            time, reconfirming his idea that he can't do anything without
            messing it up.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The reason Frank had contacted Ruby
            at the realty office in the first place was because he was thinking
            of moving into a better neighborhood: the one where he lives now
            actually used to be worse than it already is, and there are other
            things, too, such as the girl who materializes in the street in the
            middle of the night, continually calling the name of a man who lives
            next door but never responds to her summons. When Ruby shows Frank a
            flat in a reconverted townhouse that's in a better neighborhood,
            though, Frank becomes ambivalent -- &quot;too posh&quot; is his
            reason for not taking it.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In a scene near the beginning of
            the film, the circle of friends who form the center of the story are
            recovering from a night where each of them had that one extra drink
            that they shouldn't have had, and now they're feeling the
            consequences of it. In the middle of all this, Mike unashamedly
            announces, &quot;I can honestly say that I love feelin' this
            s**t....&quot; It would be easy to say that there is the explanation
            for Frank's problems all along, that Frank has simply resigned
            himself to being a screw-up and to being perpetually disappointed in
            life. What makes the difference with this film -- and in Aidan
            Gillen's portrayal of Frank -- is that it shows us something
            further. We can see how Frank can, in fact, perfectly enjoy having
            something good in life when he has it -- watching Ruby sleep next to
            him in the early-morning hours, or seeing her putting on her makeup
            for the day. But we also see what makes him decide to let his life
            go in the other direction, and how that decision will end up
            affecting how he spends the rest of his life. Being down in the
            dumps is someplace that has taken on a familiar geography to him
            and, therefore, is comfortable and even reassuring in its
            consistency, even if it is making him miserable. It is a way of
            making sense of his life and of the world; moving on to something
            new, and better, is unknown and, therefore, too terrifying to submit
            to. Frank does end up moving to a better apartment by the end of the
            film, but he is still looking up to see when the sky is going to
            fall on him again.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="5"></o:p>
