            rugged isolation of a new world deemed the &quot;Second French
            Republic&quot; – Newfoundland and Dog Island in the year 1849 - is
            as pervasive a character as its human counterparts in Patrice
            Leconte's extraordinary enigma of a movie, <i>The Widow of
            Saint-Pierre</i>. This forsaken landscape and township is a bleak,
            bleary, barren place, dank with winter's stain and as impossible to
            shake of its old world repression as the cold that cuts its
            inhabitants to the quick. </b><o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Here
            the visage of the ravishing Madame La (Juliette Binoche) inflames
            and infuriates the staid governing bodies. Madame's husband (a
            thankfully thawed Daniel Auteuil) is the town's military captain and
            he is a proud, furiously driven-by-justice type A who contradicts in
            private by passionately loving his headstrong wife and refusing her
            nothing - not even the body and soul of a condemned-to-death killer
            named Neel Auguste (Emir Kusturica, the Bosnian director of <i>Underground</i>
            and <i>Black Cat, White Cat</i>, in a complex and compelling turn). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Madame
            La is certain she can salvage Neel's blackened heart by freeing him
            from his prison chains, and, under her husband's tolerant and
            trusting gaze, reform him and deliver him back into the embrace of a
            skeptical society still propelled by France's laws and mandates; one
            of which includes the impending arrival of a guillotine with which
            to sever Neel's bearish head from his massive frame. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">What
            the mayor and officials of the town never expect is that Madame La's
            plan for salvation is blissfully successful. Neel indeed turns his
            life around under the tent of her friendship and initially wary
            citizens who once threw stones slowly learn to accept his presence
            among them and ultimately to admire him, thus rebelling against his
            conviction and angering the powers that be. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There
            is certainly deeper political motivation at the core of &quot;The
            Widow of Saint-Pierre&quot; and viewers might access it in varying
            ways depending upon their conservative or liberal leanings.
            Leconte's unwillingness to provide a comfortable or easy conclusion
            to the machinations of the minds and thinking of Madame La, La
            Capitaine and even Neel, only deepen the eventual tragedy of the
            story and wield it a bit sturdier and more complicated trajectory
            than the genre-confining &quot;period romance&quot; oeuvre it has
            been relegated to in ads and trailers. This unease allows a wariness
            to grow, on the part of the viewer, as we tensely wait for her plan
            to fail and for Neel to fall back into his primitive state of
            violence. Leconte even complicates issues by taunting us with a
            subdued longing that lingers between Madame La and Neel as their
            fingers touch during a reading lesson, and which is never requited
            or acknowledged, only silently, passively understood. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            humaneness of the film is in the fact that every one of these
            probably very calculated moves is almost indecently compassionate
            and designed to laud the effects of sheer goodness over the
            injustice of pre-determined prejudice and fear. And yet each
            tempered measure is stated as silently as the longing that evolves
            between its characters. It's an effect that bypasses rational
            thought and pierces a more primal place in the body. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">The
            Widow of Saint-Pierre</span></i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
            also stands as a select composite of Leconte's existing body of work
            – certainly more than as a piece of dressed costume drama.
            Contained partially within its chilly realm is the quiet palette of <i>Monsieur
            Hire</i>, Leconte's statement on fantasy, illusion, identity and the
            harsh shattering of reality. And there are elements of the fiery
            romantic passion of <i>The Hairdresser's Husband</i>. More, the
            disembowelment of rigorous social mores and confines so well
            displayed in <i>Ridicule</i> obviously affect the tone. Even the
            de-saturated look, and the use of Auteuil, remind of Leconte's
            black-and-white love story, <i>Girl on the Bridge</i>. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></span></font></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>But
            this is a more mature work than any of them. In its understatement
            it relies upon our -- and the character’s -- innate wisdom to make
            it work. It requires patience and demands constant tending to catch
            the subtleties that abound. And in Binoche, Auteuil and Kusturica,
            Leconte has found actors who have never been easy to read. They lend
            layer upon layer of paradox to a film already beset with
            contradiction and intangibility and ultimately, which remains as
            complicated and labyrinthine as human nature itself.</font></span><br>
