<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the mid-1970s, fifteen-year-old William
Miller (Patrick Fugit) bluffs his way into a Rolling Stone magazine assignment
covering the up-and-coming band Stillwater on a chaotic and exuberant American
tour. Along the way he becomes sort-of friends with guitarist Russell Hammond
(Billy Crudup) and is dogged by his liberal but apprehensive mother Elaine
(Frances McDormand), advised by legendary rock journalist and then-editor of
rival publication Creem Lester Bangs (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and ministered to
by angelic groupie Penny Lane (Kate Hudson). Recently, a veteran rock disc
jockey nattering on about one thing or another expressed regret at not liking <i>Almost
Famous</i> more than he did: “I dunno,” he said almost sheepishly, “it
just didn’t move me.” Exactly: although positioned by its studio,
DreamWorks, as the 2000 Oscar force to be reckoned with, and possessed of a
strongly autobiographical and thus heartfelt script by Jerry Maguire director
Cameron Crowe (update: he did win an Academy Award for writing it), there’s an
unfortunate and dramatically fatal emptiness to the proceedings, a vacuum where
the real debauchery should be. That’s not to say the film suffers from
avoiding explicit sensationalism, only that its failure to properly acknowledge
the debilitating effects of the sex and drugs that complemented and often
dissipated the music—thereby doing a profound disservice to the heady (and
hedonistic) mood of the period. This is particularly true of the Penny Lane
character: as warmly benevolent as Crowe’s memories are, the world of 1970s
rock, when individualism was only beginning to be absorbed by insensitive
corporate structures, had far grungier casualties than this movie even hints at.
Still, the “Tiny Dancer” scene is among the most transcendent uses of a rock
song in all the movies. The DreamWorks DVD edition of <i>Almost Famous </i>includes
the fictitious Stillwater’s “Fever Dog” video, vintage Rolling Stone
articles and an HBO production featurette.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Brendan Fraser continues to show considerable
comedic talent as the lovelorn lead character in this remake of the 1967 film
comedy, only, instead of Peter Cook in then-fashionable Carnaby Street gear, up
pops Elizabeth Hurley—usually wearing, you guessed it, red clothing—as the
incarnation of the Horned One, who bargains with Fraser's character to grant him
the chance to meet the girl (Frances O'Connor) he yearns for, in exchange for,
you know, his immortal soul. But whereas the earlier film was inventive and
genuinely anarchic, the remake is tame, reticent, and uninspired. The biggest
surprise in <i>Bedazzled</i> is Hurley's performance, which is unusually
muted—somebody should have helped her put some glint in her acting, here.
Along with Fraser, there is some good supporting work by Paul Adelstein, Miriam
Shor, Orlando Jones, and Toby Huss, who appeared in a series of MTV promo spots
where he did a dead-on parody of Sinatra during his 'Fifties “breezy”
period. The CBS/Fox DVD includes separate commentary tracks from director Harold
Ramis and star Elizabeth Hurley with producer Trevor Albert; production
featurettes on the film itself and the costume design; and a stills gallery.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the wake of the social phenomena surrounding
the summer 1999 release of <i>The Blair Witch Project</i>, former mental patient
Jeffrey (Jeff Donovan) leads a group on his commercialized Blair Witch Hunt in
and around Burkittsville, Maryland -- only to find the group caught up in more
sinister and deadly doings. A clever idea gone frustratingly awry, <i>Book of
Shadows</i> takes a genuinely interesting idea and grinds it in to an
aggressively unpleasant film, as if its makers were trying to distance
themselves from the entertainment juggernaut they created by purposefully
sabotaging the sequel (some surmised that author Thomas Harris did the same
thing with the novel version of <i>Hannibal</i>). On paper, Joe Berlinger would
appear to be perfect for the director’s chair, having made the tremendously
affecting documentaries <i>Brother’s Keeper</i> and the pair of cable films
about the mysterious deaths of a group of children in the Paradise Hills section
of rural Arkansas. And he harnesses the same sense of wilderness dread for <i>Blair
Witch 2</i>. Yet the performances are spotty, and the generally rushed feeling
of the entire production (which was in fact made quickly) contribute to an
overall sense of confusion and distraction -- fatal qualities in the successful
building of suspense. And the contributions of co-writer Dick Beebe give the
film a strong strain of sensationalism; he’s a veteran of the reborn “Tales
from the Crypt” on the same cable network that made the Paradise Hills films,
and the scriptwriter of that underrated 1999 remake of producer William
Castle’s <i>House on Haunted Hill</i>. So the temptation to speculate that
they were working at cross purposes is strong. Artisan Entertainment’s DVD
edition features a commentary track from Berlinger and, in a novel marketing
scheme, the film’s music soundtrack on the flip side of the disc.</font><span style="font-family:Verdana"><o:p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In one of those parallel
political universes straight out of a 1960s paperback thriller (given a
contemporary sheen), charismatic and culinarily-inclined president Evans (Jeff
Bridges) nominates hard-working senator Laine Hanson (Joan Allen) as his next
vice president, only to find her past coming under unwanted scrutiny in a sordid
sex scandal orchestrated by crusading conservative GOP Representative Shelly
Runyon (Gary Oldman). <i>The Contender</i> was written and directed by former
Los Angeles area film critic Rod Lurie, whose taste for the political arena (his
first film, <i>Deterrence</i>, is about an American president wrestling with
nuclear war) was cultivated by a father who was an editorial cartoonist. Frankly
and pointedly Democratic and liberal, the film nevertheless presents a complex
chess match of Captiol corridor politics, and while some critics complained that
the whole affair was a bit stuffy, it is this very dignity and restraint that
reveals these dogged infighters as the hardnoses they are; “what the people
want” and “what the nation needs” serve here -- as in real life -- to mask
unbridled individual ambition. Allen is a superb balance of human frailty and
professional toughness as the beleaguered senator, and Bridges is a hoot as the
deceptively folksy chief executive. Listed also as an executive producer on the
project, Oldman was reportedly unhappy with the final edit of the film, and
that’s a pity, as his performance is typically chameleonlike and the movie as
a whole is thought-provoking, absorbing, and all too likely. The generously
appointed DreamWorks DVD features commentary from Lurie and Allen, deleted
scenes, production notes and an “HBO First Look” production featurette.</font></p>

failed attempt at trash. Adrien (Lori Heuring), who works on the staff of an
upper-class country club during the summer, is befriended by Brittany (Susan
Ward), who introduces her to all her rich, spoiled, fabulously jaded friends and
at least one potential boyfriend. Little does she know that Adrien is an
outpatient from a mental institution; on the other hand, is Brittany using
Adrien as part of some sort of demented gamesplaying? The filmmakers look like
they're playing to that part of the moviegoing public that clasped <i>Cruel
Intentions</i> to its heart, but the film turns out to be immensely
disappointing. Surprising, considering that this was directed by Mary Lambert,
who pulled off this sort of thing before, spectacularly, in 1987's <i>Siesta</i>;
she gets some good performances, here, but other parts of the film look like she
was simply telling the largely interchangeable cast members where to sit and
stand without knocking over something or tripping on the furniture. The Warner
Studios DVD includes commentary from Heuring and Ward; production notes; deleted
scenes; cast interviews; a music-only track; publicity gallery; and
behind-the-scenes footage.</span></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">An absurd force meets a logical object in this
popular comedy from the <i>Austin Powers</i> franchise director Jay Roach. Ben
Stiller plays tightly-wound compulsive embellisher Greg Focker, whose urge to
impress girlfriend Pam (Teri Polo) leads him to absurd misadventures with her
insanely shrewd father (Robert De Niro). A smug and episodic comedy with the
rather wide mean streak that’s become <i>de rigeur</i> of late, <i>Meet the
Parents</i> nevertheless shattered industry expectations by becoming a surprise
fall hit during it’s theatrical release. The title also generated $21.41
million in VHS/DVD rental spending receipts in it’s opening week, second only
to the record set by <i>The Sixth Sense</i> ($25.86 million). Not
insignificantly, that’s nearly twice what moviegoers spent on the most popular
theatrical release that weekend -- Brad’n’Julia in <i>The Mexican</i>.
Success, however, is relative: the film takes many of the comedy of cruelty
parameters forged by the unfortunate genre touchstone <i>There’s Something
About Mary</i> and produces a story at once familiar and distracted, an episodic
and escalating series of gags which play together about as well as a sub-par
episode of “Saturday Night Live.” The DVD edition of the film features both
DTS and Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtracks, separate commentary tracks from Roach and
the pairing of Stiller and De Niro (who, admittedly, has a pretty good nose for
comic projects), deleted scenes, and outtakes.</font></p>

Zellweger as a woman who, following a traumatic experience, travels to meet the
handsome TV soap opera doctor (Greg Kinnear) upon whom she has been long
smitten. Zellweger's performance -- and some brilliant work, especially in the
closing scenes, by Morgan Freeman -- almost manage to overcome director Neal
LaBute's usual pervasive misanthropy over the world in general (and the non
L.D.S. Church world in particular), although he nonetheless manages to get the
last word in on Zellweger's character, at her expense. LaBute directed, but did
not write, the picture; and Aaron Eckhart's performance, as Betty's
uncategorically loathsome husband, almost causes you to want to take back
whatever good things you may have said or thought about his work in <i>Erin
Brockovich</i>. The generously appointed Columbia/TriStar DVD includes two
separate commentary tracks (one with director and key cast, the other with
director and key crew); deleted scenes; segments of the fictitious “A Reason
to Love” soap opera; a theatrical trailer; six television spots; and promised
hidden bonus features.&nbsp;</font></span></p>

spectacularly (and ludicrously) awry, causing a group of astronauts (including
Val Kilmer) to become stranded on the surface, while another (Carrie-Anne Moss),
stuck in orbit, tries to figure out how to get them back. Do they meet any
little green beasties? Not to worry, nothing even remotely that interesting
occurs. Riddled with scientific implausibilities along with dramatic ones, the
picture achieves the rare feat of being both unbelievable and uninteresting. To
paraphrase Dorothy Parker: if you watch this, take your knitting; if you don't
knit, take a book. The Warner Home Video DVD pressing includes deleted

coach to lead the football team at a previously all-white, but newly
desegregated Virginia high school; in addition, he must contend with the team's
previous coach (Will Patton) being reassigned to being the team's assistant
coach. Both Washington and Patton do exemplary work, as is the staging by the
film's director, Boaz Yakin, but the story (based on real-life events) unfolds
in an unfortunately predictable way, and there are other serious flaws with the
film, as well. The action appears to be taking place in the early 1960s, but
it's actually taking place during the early 1970s, yet there's nary a reference
to Vietnam, the draft (which was rescinded in 1971), the drug culture, or the
unfolding scandals that would plague President Nixon's second term in office --
issues which were very much on everyone's mind, in one way or another, at the
time, and which seriously undercuts the film's credibility as a whole. (None of
the kids even sport what Pauline Kael accurately termed “suburban hippie”
haircuts.) Audience reaction was fiercely spilt over Hayden Panettierre's
appearance as the young daughter of Patton's character, raised without a mother
but also obsessed with football: personally, I had no problem with the young
girl's performance, but have a look and see what you think. Disney’s DVD
edition features commentary tracks from the real-life coaches portrayed in the
film as well as Yakin in conversation with producer Jerry Bruckheimer and writer
Gregory Allen Howard; a half-dozen deleted scenes; and two exclusive
featurettes.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This English, Welsh, and Yiddish-language film
starts off as decorous, full of dark, handsome hues, and almost completely
devoid of dramatic interest, despite its intriguing setting, an enclave of
first-generation Jews descended from Eastern European immigrants and living in
the middle of a coal-mining community in Wales during the early years of the
twentieth century. Solomon (Ioan Gruffudd) falls for a pretty lass named Gaenor
(Nia Roberts), but he can't bring himself to tell her he's Jewish, and she can't
bring herself to tell her that she's now with child. Their families keep them
apart. They get away, make-up in the burnt-out shell of a church, then become
separated again. Nobody has any fun. Gaenor is admonished, as she is being sent
away to relatives, “Be good. I know you will” (the fact that the poor girl
is, by now, big as a house doesn't leave her much choice). By the time Solomon,
bloodied, broken, and delirious, sets off on-foot across frozen land to be with
his Gaenor, you may think the film has gone a little delirious itself. The
Columbia TriStar Home Video DVD edition has no extras.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Dex (Donal Logue) is an overweight
thirty-two-year-old schoolteacher in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Afflicted with a
permanent case of bedhead, a dog named Astro and a stone slacker mentality
(“doing stuff is overrated,” he believes), Dex is also shrewd enough about
life to reference both Thomas Aquinas and Steve McQueen in his normal course of
affairs. In fact, it’s the essence of the latter, sort of a fundamental
Steveness, that is at the heart of Dex’s credo. This works fine for him until
Syd (Greer Goodman) comes along and turns Dex into just another lovesick
single… Ottawa native Logue, who’s currently starring opposite Megyn Price
in the genial if derivative Fox series “Grounded for Life,” won the Best
Actor prize at the Sundance festival for his chipper playing of Dex, and in fact
every frame of <i>The Tao of Steve</i> is infused with a cheerfully
self-deprecating air that is as bracing as it is unusual. Goodman is the sister
of director Jenniphr Goodman (no, that’s not a typo), and the fact that
they’re both Santa Fe regulars gives the film a veracity that, along with
Logue’s performance, lifts the film above its TV movie-ish aesthetic to a
place of accurate cultural insight. Columbia TriStar Home Video’s Dolby
Digital 2.0 encoded DVD edition features a commentary track with cast and crew.</font></p>

<p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Has anybody noticed that
slasher movies seem to be making a comeback? Just what the world needs now.
Anyway, this picture is set a film school, where a bunch of students are
competing for, I kid you not, the Hitchcock Award for best student film of the
school year. This film has the distinction of having an elaborate murder
sequence near the beginning that turns out to have absolutely nothing to do with
what's going on in the rest of the movie; and the killer's motive for carrying
out the other murders turns to be just about the most ridiculous thing since
Margaret O'Brien said, “Oh, Marmmy, it's just a little cold....” before
keeling over from pneumonia in <i>Little Women</i> (1949). There is,
fortunately, a cameo by Rebecca Gayheart (the only reason to see the 1998
original, <i>Urban Legend</i>), and appealing performances by Jennifer Morrison
(her character's student film, though, looks highly unappealing), and Marco
Hofschneider, the brilliant lead performer in <i>Europa Europa</i>, as an
aspiring Slavic cinematographer. Esoteric note: the film was originally slapped
with an NC-17 rating by the Motion Picture Association of America, possibly
because of some of the action in the opening scene of the film (the current
version is rated R, so the kiddies can watch). The Columbia TriStar DVD features
a commentary track from director John Ottman (who both edited and scored Bryan
Singer’s <i>The Usual Suspects</i>); a production featurette; deleted scenes
with commentary; cast/crew biographies; and a gag reel. The film is also
available in a two-pack with its precursor, <i>Urban Legend</i>. <o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Another
serving of crime drama/serial killer tripe, with jazzy visuals and pumped-up
music and sound. But <i>The Watcher</i> is worth having more than a passing look
at for James Spader's portrayal of a police detective who has collapsed into a
wreck of his former self after a previous case he was assigned to went all, all
wrong, and who attends to solving a new case -- very similar to the one that
demolished him -- with a sudden, indefatigable zeal. Spader can reveal more
about a character by doing something seemingly small -- a look, a phrasing of
some dialogue, the way he moves or holds himself in a scene -- than most actors
can do with twice the activity. This is especially true considering the stunt
casting in the movie of none other than Keanu Reeves, who plays a wanted killer
that nobody has a description of and can therefore move among the public at
will. Reeves gets everything, everything wrong, but he doesn't single-handedly
destroy the film: the filmmakers do that, with an ending so totally stupid that
you may start shouting at the screen the same thing Groucho Marx said to Zeppo
in <i>Horse Feathers</i>, “I'd horsewhip you if I had a horse!” Perhaps as a
reaction to this, the Universal DVD edition sports only DVD ROM-accessible
screensavers and “thematic wallpaper” as available extras.</span></font></p>

Douglas as Grady, a once promising, but now blocked, writer who teaches at the
University of Pittsburgh and is settling, further and further, into a
comfortable funk; Tobey Maguire as James Lees, a gifted young writer who looks
like he always has one ear tuned to a melody that nobody else can hear (he also
turns out to be a transient, and a habitual liar); Robert Downey, Jr. as a
publishing house editor who arrives in town to check on Grady's long-overdue
manuscript, at the same time when James crashes at Grady's house with a possibly
brilliant manuscript of his own in his backpack. Amiable, disorganized at times
(some of the performances, like Katie Holmes', appear to have been reduced, for
some reason, in post-production), but highly enjoyable. Downey, in particular,
appears to be taking enormous pleasure in creating a polymorphously perverse
character out of his part (he gives two of the best comic performances of the
year in this film and in James Toback’s <i>Black and</i> <i>White</i>). The
DVD features cast and crew interviews and Bob Dylan’s music video for

great John Agar (<i>Tarantula</i>, <i>Revenge of the Creature</i>, <i>Miracle
Mile</i>, ex-husband of Shirley Temple) gives one of the most unexpectedly raw
leading performances in any low-budget American 1950s sci-fi movie as scientist
Steve March (all the scientists in these movies are named Steve
something-or-other). After a spaceship lands on a nearby mountain, Steve goes to
investigate, only to be inhabited by a floating space brain with eyes named Gor,
a renegade uh…, space brain on the run. With Gor’s personality, Steve
becomes a narcissistic maniac, dropping planes from the sky and generally
wreaking havoc while laughing heartily and flashing cool black-irised eyes. Gor
also develops a lewd interest in Steve’s girlfriend Sally (Joyce Meadows). Can
Gor be stopped? Of course… Right up there with <i>Donovan’s Brain</i> and <i>Fiend
without a Face</i> (the latter recently re-released by the Criterion Collection)
in the roster of great evil-brain movies of the period, <i>The Brain from Planet
Arous</i> was directed with a kind of leaden panache and deceptive simplicity by
Austrian native Nathan Juran, a former engineer and art director whose other
films include <i>Twenty Million Miles to Earth</i>, <i>The Seventh Voyage of
Sinbad</i> and <i>First Men in the Moon</i>. Image Entertainment’s crisp DVD
edition is from the collection of legendary collector Wade Williams, and the
disc features a theatrical trailer (there’s a VHS release that dates from
1997). Oh, and if this is sounding perhaps subliminally familiar, a clip from
this film is one of the snippets from genre movies in the opening credits of
“Malcolm in the Middle.”<o:p>

small Normandy town in 1962, Mina (Carole Bouquet) begins an affair with
Matthias (Charles Berling) while her out-of-work husband Georges (co-director Gérard
Depardieu), grabbing the only job available, spends a lot of time out of town
supervising the construction of a large bridge. Although he disapproves,
Mina’s 15-year-old son Tommy (Stanislas Crevillen) can’t really argue with
his mother’s obvious happiness. The story is altered considerably from the
source novel (the title of which translates as &quot;A Bridge Between Two
Shores”) in service to Bouquet’s character -- not too surprising, given her
long-time real-life relationship with Depardieu. Only the actor’s second
directorial effort (after 1984’s <i>Le Tartuffe</i>), <i>The Bridge</i> is an
actor’s film, quiet, deliberate and methodical. His co-director and composer,
Frédéric Auburtin, is an actor too (he was the young priest in Maurice
Pialat’s 1987 drama <i>Under Satan’s Sun</i>), which goes a long way towards
explaining the rejection of melodramatic incident in favor of logical character
development and consistent story arc. As Lisa Nesselson said in her excellent
Variety review, “<i>The Bridge</i> shines as a potent weepie with all the
weepiness stripped away.” Winstar’s VHS edition is priced to rent, while the
letterboxed DVD has no booklet but features filmographies, a trailer and a
weblink.</span></font></p>

seductive lure of Aryan paramilitary groups for alienated and disenfranchised
white middle-aged men is given a by-the-numbers treatment in Showtime’s
distasteful, exploitative <i>Brotherhood of Murder</i>. Lowbrow fodder, which
aired on the cable channel in late 1999, is from the true story of mid-1980s
supremacist crime spree. Yet it is devoid of the kind of incendiary fire that
marked <i>American History X</i> and will be greeted as the simplistic tripe it
is. Just back from an unspecified military stint, working-class father-to-be Tom
Martinez (William Baldwin), temporarily down on his luck, is lured into a white
power group run by the quietly forceful Bob Mathews (Peter Gallagher). Falling
for Mathews vision of empowerment, Martinez becomes enmeshed in The Order,
pulling a series of heists that escalate from adult video stores to armored cars
to murder (a group member was convicted of killing Denver-based radio talk show
host Alan Berg). Increasingly disenchanted with their actions, Martinez becomes
a reluctant FBI informant to bring them down. Baldwin has a lock on these
directionless lunkheads, Gallagher keeps an admirably straight face as the apple
pie-loving, interracial porno-watching crackpot, and Kelly Lynch is subdued as
Baldwin’s long-suffering wife. Tech credits are TV clean, and the bare-boned
DVD edition features something called “HiFi sound.” <o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In a sleepy West African village, corrupt and
stupid French police chief Lucien Cordier (Philippe Noiret) is literally kicked
around by lawbreakers, colleagues and loved ones alike. He responds to this
treatment by casually murdering those who have hounded him, while cruelly
manipulating his cheating wife (Stéphane Audran) and lusty lover (Isabelle
Huppert). Legendarily ambiguous and more than a little surreal, <i>Coup de
Torchon</i> (literally, “Clean Slate”) is based on influential pulp novelist
Jim Thompson’s “Pop. 1280,” boldly -- and shrewdly -- shifting the
horribly casual racist action from a small town in the American south circa
1910. As in Hitchcock’s <i>Psycho</i>, director Bertrand Tavernier here
presents a harmlessly eccentric hero who performs increasingly amoral deeds --
and then dares the audience to root against him. The digital transfer of the
disc is typical of the attention to detail lavished on each and every Criterion
Collection release, with the unrelenting heat of the village coming through in
every frame. Although there is at least one reel change marker and a
split-second tear in the film at one point, this is the cleanest Tavernier’s
film has looked in twenty years. The dual-layer disc’s added-value elements
include a forty-seven-minute interview with the raconteurish director (who
answers every possible question about the writing, casting and filming of the
picture), an alternate ending -- which Tavernier narrates -- the U.S. theatrical
trailer and new, improved English subtitles. </font><span style="font-family:Verdana"><o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">“You can’t fight in here, this is the war
room!” says ineffectual President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers, in one of
three roles) near the climax of this bleakly uproarious adaptation of Peter
George’s novel, <i>Red Alert</i> (co-scripted by satirist Terry Southern),
about a nuclear war mistakenly begun when American military officer Jack D.
Ripper (Sterling Hayden) goes off his nut. Between this and the film’s jaunty,
smug subtitle -- <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">How I Learned to Stop
Worrying and Love the Bomb</i> -- the aim of Kubrick’s scabrous satire on the
futility of war is clear. Co-starring George C. Scott as General Buck Turgidson
and Slim Pickens as Major T.J. “King” Kong. The third <i>Strangelove</i>
disc to date (MGM’s was first, followed by the Warners disc in the
poorly-received Kubrick boxed set), Columbia TriStar Home Video’s DVD edition
-- this release is exclusive to the format -- is the one to have: the four-page
booklet has an uncredited but hugely informative thumbnail essay on the film’s
production and the extras include two original production documentaries, an
original advertising gallery, and a vintage, split-screen interview sequence
with Scott and Sellers (who does an incredible verbal tour of London via local
dialects, a bit worth the purchase price all by itself). Unfortunately, the disc
doesn’t include the legendary, climactic pie fight sequence in the war room,
which scholars and buffs alike have been hungry for since the film’s initial
release. Still, this is one “Special Edition” with extras that are truly
special.</font><span style="font-family:Verdana"><o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jean-Marc Barr as a morgue worker who has been
around dead bodies too long and no longer is able to interact normally with
living ones. He joins up with a girl (the splendid Élodie Bouchez, of <i>The
Dreamlife of Angels</i>) after meeting her in a very unusual way, and they later
form a trio with another guy (Martin Petitguyot) whom they first meet after he
tries to throw himself into the river. French director Didier le Pêcheur's film
comes off like a cross between the current wave of nihilist chic in European
cinema crossed with one of John Updike's 1960s-1970s novels about mate-swapping
in the middle class gone perverse. Bouchez's character keeps hanging in there,
trying to reestablish Barr's ability to express &quot;tenderness&quot; without
having to resort to all the games and gimcrackery, but it's obvious to us that
she's embarked on a lost cause. The film has at least two things going for it:
it moves swiftly, and you <i>never</i> know what to expect next. First Run
Features’ VHS tape is priced to rent, and the DVD includes a photo gallery --
but no booklet.</font><span style="font-family:Verdana"><o:p>

font-family:Verdana">On a very hot summer’s day in the Bedford-Stuyvesant
section of Brooklyn, a neighborhood simmers with economic frustration and racial
unease, until an act of violence sparks a riot. The subject of passionate debate
since its debut at the 1989 Cannes Film Festival, <i>Do The Right Thing</i> is
director Spike Lee’s best film to date and now receives the royal treatment
from the Criterion Collection in this stunning two-DVD package. Disc one is an
absolutely gorgeous transfer of the film itself, with an optional commentary
track from Lee, cinematographer Ernest Dickerson, production designer Wynn
Thomas and actress Joie Lee (Spike’s sister and costar). Disc two, entitled
“The Supplement,” features St. Clair Bourne’s sixty-minuted production
documentary; Lee’s new video intro to the film and a tour of the Bed-Stuy
locations with producer Jon Kilik; a video of the press conference that followed
the Cannes screening; Public Enemy’s “Fight the Power” music video (which
Lee directed); behind-the-scenes production footage (also from Lee);
storyboards; trailers and TV spots; and a new video interview with editor Barry
Brown. When all is said and done, perhaps the most striking aspect of the film
above and beyond the combustible subject matter is the hothouse of future talent
represented by the cast: in addition to being the movie debut of Rosie Perez,
the roster includes Danny Aiello, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Richard Edson,
Giancarlo Esposito, Samuel L. Jackson (listed as “Sam”), Bill Nunn and John
Turturro. Despite the ever-changing trappings of pop culture that have rendered
the music and clothes in the film instantly outdated, the Big Questions of the
film are eternal, and Lee’s righteous anger remains both palpable and probing.
Although certain other titles from his oeuvre have become available recently on
DVD (including the often-overlooked <i>Get on the Bus</i>), with the passage of
years <i>Do the Right Thing</i> is looking more and more like his defining
work.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The luminous Wendy Hiller (Pygmalion) stars in
the British gem <i>I Know Where I’m Going!</i> as Joan Webster, a headstrong
young woman who journeys to the Scottish Hebrides with every intention of
marrying an older man, only to be gradually and gracefully seduced by dashing
local Torquil MacNeil (Roger Livesy) and the almost mystical properties of the
farflung island. The rediscovery of the Michael Powell/Emeric Pressburger canon
continues with a splendid remastering of a sublime film, presented in a lavish
and generous DVD package from the Criterion Collection. There’s a real cult
following for this previously hard-to-see film, as evidenced by the disc’s
added value elements: fan Nancy Franklin provides a tour of the locations via a
photo essay, film historian Ian Christie provides an audio essay on the
commentary track, and no less than two documentaries trace the production and
impact of the film. The velvety black and white transfer was supervised by
original cinematographer Erwin Hillier, and Powell’s widow, Thelma Schoonmaker
Powell (yes, the editor who cut many of Martin Scorsese’s best films) offers
home movies and still photos from her husband’s extensive archives. <i>I Know
Where I’m Going!</i> joins the Powell/Pressburger collaborations <i>Black
Narcissus</i>, <i>The Red Shoes</i> and Powell’s controversial solo outing <i>Peeping
Tom</i> in the Criterion catalogue, with <i>Tales of Hoffman</i> next on the
release schedule (Kino on Video also has an imminent Powell/Pressburger release,
1940’s comedic thriller <i>Contraband</i>, which was originally released in
the states as <i>Blackout</i>). All titles are highly recommended. </font><span style="font-family:Verdana"><o:p>

font-family:Verdana">Around the United States, in such bucolic suburbs as Orange
County, California, Littleton, Colorado and New Orleans, Louisiana, there are
groups of married men and women -- mostly older and, truth to tell, not all that
good-looking -- who, uh, swing. They’re swingers. As in barbecues and cookouts
and pool parties that culminate with wanton wife-swapping and lumpy group sex.
Through interviews, party tips and more intimate footage than any mortal can
stand, David Schisgall’s <i>The Lifestyle</i> profiles a handful of the
scene’s denizens. There’s a born-again Christian, a couple that runs a
“clothing optional” bed and breakfast, a couple who sell racy greeting
cards, and a couple who model their swinging after the water ceremony in Robert
A. Heinlein’s “Stranger in a Strange Land.” This would be unbearably sad
if it wasn’t so downright hilarious, and Schisgall’s journalistic restraint
(although there are a few brief explicit sequences) is matched only by the
fearless way in which he ingratiates himself into the scene, covering
conventions and trade shows that seem to center around something called
“Lifestyles ’97.” Winstar’s DVD pressing doesn’t have a booklet or
chapter headings (there are sixteen of the latter if you’re counting at home),
but the numerous extras include deleted interview footage (yes, that’s
jargon-slinging porn star Nina Hartley in one sequence), additional background
on swinging and even an exhaustive roster of websites, if that bed and breakfast
has captured your imagination. Co-executive producer James Schamus co-wrote not
only <i>The Ice Storm</i> (which is also tangentially about wife-swapping) but <i>Crouching
Tiger, Hidden Dragon</i> as well. <o:p>

font-family:Verdana">On the very day of her twentieth birthday, the attractive
and seemingly normal Daantje (Kim van Kooten) is visited by her long-lost
brother Martin, who films her constantly with a video camera. Presented entirely
as the video diary of his stalking/seduction process, <i>Little Sister</i> shows
how Martin systematically ruins Daantje’s life in an effort to confront a
terrible secret from their past. Unsettling yet involving, the verite
directorial calisthenics of director Robert Jan Westdijk predate the handheld
video style of <i>The Blair Witch Project</i> by a number of years -- the
production date, in fact, is the same year as that wacky Scandinavian quartet
dreamed up something called Dogme 95. Mixing recognizable elements from Michael
Powell’s <i>Peeping Tom</i>, Jim McBride’s 1960s cult classic <i>David
Holzman’s Diary</i> and Steven Soderbergh’s <i>sex, lies and videotape</i>, <i>Little
Sister</i> is a modest but essential building block in understanding how video
has forever changed the aesthetics of the traditional feature-length film. Taken
from the unintentional double entendre given to a decoy to frighten birds away
from crops, <i>Scary Man</i> is a forty-five-minute, tongue-in-cheek documentary
from directors Eugenie Jansen and Albert Elings about brave Dutch men and the
imaginative methods they employ to guard against the infestation of sparrows,
geese, crows, swans, magpies and seagulls. “You can’t shoot through the
fruit,” explains one warrior, and this sentiment sums up the gentle absurdity
of the enterprise. Fans of Errol Morris’ early work will feel right at home
with this sly, deadpan doc. Each subtitled tape (there are no DVDs at present)
is available separately from Facets Video (facetsvideo.org), one of the small
handful of distributors committed to making exciting work from around the world
available to the American collector.

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Say, kiddies, it’s time once again for
everybody’s famous put-upon clay figure… Mr. Bill!!! A sadistic and hugely
popular mainstay of the original “Saturday Night Live,” Walter Williams’
brief live-action vignettes featured the title character and his dog Spot in
various scenarios (at the circus, in court, going fishing, building a house,
etc.), aided and abetted by Mr. Hands and more often than not pulverized by the
malevolent Sluggo. Now, Williams has dusted off some eighteen of those Super-8
and 16mm shorts, supplementing the first-ever Mr. Bill disc with a multitude of
extras that include a commentary track with Mr. Hands, storyboards, various
games (including “Name That Ooooo!”), and even G-rated versions of the films
just for the kiddies. But the true keeper of the set is the lavish
twenty-four-page booklet, offering not only elaborate instructions on the extras
but a brief and fun tutorial in using your DVD player’s remote as well. Oddly
enough, all that’s missing is the original “SNL” laughtrack, which would
have gone a long way towards explaining the novelty of this silly yet pivotal
series.</font></p>

font-family:Verdana">The golden age of Hollywood’s studio system in the 1930s
and 1940s was marked by an enduring tension between the creative and business
sides. Among the handful of directors who actually flourished in the
factory-like atmosphere of the era was George Cukor, whose legendary facility
with even the most difficult actresses and fealty towards the material he
directed is reflected in a career that includes such key films as <i>What Price
Hollywood?</i> (1932), <i>Sylvia Scarlett</i> (1936), <i>The Women</i> (1939),
uncredited chunks of <i>Gone with the Wind</i> (1939), <i>The Philadelphia Story</i>
(1940), <i>Gaslight</i> (1944), <i>Adam’s Rib </i>(1949) and the 1954 remake
of <i>A Star is Born</i> (this only scratches the surface of the recognizable
titles; the list of his important work is far too long to reprint here). Robert
Trachtenberg’s On Cukor, made by New York’s Channel Thirteen (WNET) and
Turner Entertainment for the American Masters series, profiles Cukor in his own
words and those of his admirers. The parade of stars and industry insiders
interviewed include the ubiquitous Peter Bogdanovich, Mia Farrow (Cukor’s
goddaughter), Angela Lansbury, Jack Lemmon, Shelley Winters, Claire Bloom, Fay
Kanin, Jeanine Basinger, David Denby, Richard Schickel and Cukor himself
(although not, unfortunately, Katharine Hepburn, with whom Cukor made ten films
over five decades and is generally credited with discovering). The film is a
terrific blast of old Hollywood, as well as a stirring tribute to the
quintessential actor’s director. Winstar has made <i>On Cukor</i> available in
both the VHS and DVD formats, with the latter thankfully including that complete
filmography (with awards), weblinks and even additional interview footage.<o:p>

font-family:Verdana">On the primitive South Seas island of Pago Pago, party girl
Sadie Thompson (Joan Crawford) casts her passionate spell on tortured preacher
Alfred Davidson (Walter Huston, Anjelica’s grandfather), who is determined to
save her from her wanton ways during an unexpected layover. The overheated
melodramatic results are played out against taboo rhythms of hot jazz and the
incessant beating of the falling rain. Following her triumphant appearance in
MGM’s Oscar-winning <i>Grand Hotel</i>, Crawford was loaned out to United
Artists to follow in the footsteps of Jeanne Eagels’ stage portrayal and
Gloria Swanson’s silent film turn as the sluttish Sadie. Under the direction
of Lewis Milestone (himself fresh off the twin triumphs of <i>All Quiet on the
Western Front</i> and <i>The Front Page</i>), this overheated version of W.
Somerset Maugham’s novel (adapted by playwright Maxwell Anderson) features an
unusually restless camera and some atmospheric sets. Unfortunately, the extreme
melodrama of the performances renders the film more of a camp item than a
balanced studio gem (also, for all the movement and sense of place it’s pretty
talky). Still, little-known studio titles such as <i>Rain</i> are welcome on DVD
(there’s a tape edition as well), and after a grainy start Image
Entertainment’s pressing settles down into a better-than-average transfer,
although it seems a little on the dark side and the exteriors are a bit fuzzy.
The DVD contains no extras. <o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While recovering from a broken leg suffered
while getting a little too close to the race car he was taking a picture of,
once-peripatetic and now fidgety photographer J.B. “Jeff” Jeffries (James
Stewart) is forced to watch the world through binoculars and the lens of his
camera. At first only casually eavesdropping on the comings and goings of those
who live in the apartments that ring the central courtyard outside his window,
Jeff gradually becomes convinced the sinister Thorwald (Raymond Burr) has
chopped up his wife and lugged her away in suitcases. Aided and abetted by
socialite gal pal Lisa (Grace Kelly) and insurance company physical therapist
Stella (Thelma Ritter), Jeff discovers the truth about Thorwald and lives to
tell about it. The most prominent of the five Alfred Hitchcock films kept out of
circulation for many years (the others were <i>Rope</i>, <i>The Man Who Knew Too
Much</i>, <i>The Trouble with Harry</i> and <i>Vertigo</i>), <i>Rear Window</i>
is also the crown jewel of the recently released Best of Hitchcock Volume One
boxed set (which also includes <i>Shadow of a Doubt</i>, <i>Rope</i>, <i>The Man
Who Knew Too Much</i>, <i>Psycho</i>, <i>Topaz</i>, <i>Family Plot</i> and a
bonus disc featuring four of the 17 episodes of “Alfred Hitchcock Presents”
directed by the master of suspense). This pristine restoration by Robert A.
Harris and James Katz (the latter of which was responsible for bringing the film
back into circulation two decades ago) is supplemented by the original
production featurette “<i>Rear Window</i> Ethics: Remembering and Restoring a
Hitchcock Classic”; a conversation with screenwriter John Michael Hayes; a
poster and production gallery; a theatrical trailer; the re-release trailer
narrated by Stewart; production notes and a DVD-ROM feature that promises online
access to the original script. A must-have for any serious DVD collection, <i>Rear
Window</i> is among the handful of enduring Hitchcock films and the perhaps the
most accessible introduction to his work for the young or uninitiated
viewer.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In contemporary Antwerp, teenaged Rosie (Aranka
Coppens) has just been placed in a reform school for girls. Through flashbacks,
the events leading up to her incarceration are revealed. As it turns out, her
mother Irene (Sara De Roo), who refuses to let the Belgian adolescent call her
“Mom,” considers the girl a nuisance. Along with her good-looking boyfriend
Jimi (Joost Wijnant), Rosie constructs a complex fantasy life on which hard
reality slowly intrudes. Debuting director Patrice Toye counts Krzysztof Kie&#347;lowski’s
canon and Terrence Malick’s <i>Badlands</i> as strong influences, so Rosie not
only plays with time in a provocative, assured manner but also has an authentic
feel for the tumultuous emotions of adolescence. Coppens gives a focused,
authoritative performance as the troubled teenager, one of those naturalistic
turns that indicate an intuitive understanding of the camera that may or may not
translate into a career. New Yorker Video’s release is exclusive to VHS
(priced to rent), and is letterboxed, sort of -- the tape caught has a black bar
along the bottom where the subtitles are printed but no corresponding stripe
along the top.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I think they shave [their heads] so no
one can grab their hair when they fight,&quot; says one Swedish hospital worker
to two others, regarding why skinheads shave their heads bald. Initially, the
idea of neo-Nazis in seemingly mild-mannered Sweden seems as incongruous as when
the mother of one, Sören, expresses disbelief that her son would be taking
&quot;those&quot; things hanging on the walls of his room seriously. Sören
(Simon Norrthon) is invited by a doctor at the hospital, Jacob (Etienne Glaser),
to come by and talk to him whenever he feels troubled. Jacob is not only Jewish,
but came to Sweden when he was a child to escape the Nazis, but Sören doesn't
categorize him as one of the &quot;foreigners&quot; he and his friends despise,
but as a true Swede, just like one of them. Suzanne Osten directed this film
right after making the excellent <i>Good Evening, Mr. Wallenberg</i>, about the
Swedish diplomat who worked ceaselessly to smuggle hundreds of people out of
Nazi-occupied Warsaw. This film is a little looser, more elaborate (it cuts
between three time periods in its storyline), but no less energetic than the
previous film. It does seem to suggest that the real causes of neo-Nazism, and
why people would embrace such a philosophy so fervently, may be ultimately
unknowable, but the talk -- with Norrthon's Sören seething and restless, as if
his thoughts and feelings were making him feel too tight in his own skin, while
Glaser's Jacob calmly tries to find fissures in his arguments -- is good talk,
and the film includes some quietly devastating moments in hindsight (such as a
comment from a bystander, &quot;There'd be no racism if there weren't any
immigrants.&quot;). This First Run Features Home Video release is exclusive to
videocassette. <o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There’s an old New Yorker cartoon that
features two men ascending up a winding road to a tiny windswept village perched
on a precarious mountain peak. “What this place needs,” one confides to the
other, “is a film festival.” This comes to mind watching <i>The Stars’
Caravan</i>, a marvelous and unheralded documentary about the universal power of
the cinema. “I’m a projectionist and proud of my occupation,” says our
protagonist, a native of Kyrgyztan. “I’m glad to give people happiness.”
But times have changed, and with his country’s independence came the cessation
of funds to travel through the mountains bringing such fare as the Russ Tamblyn
cheapie Motor Gangsters to more remote villages. Still, there are a few
dedicated souls who brave the elements to carry the projector and reels on
horseback to the far reaches of the mountain plains (a magnificent and inspiring
image). At barely an hour long, <i>The Stars’ Caravan</i> is a modest,
beautiful discovery from writer-director Arto Halonen that illustrates the
appeal of the movies better than any weekend gross from an American multiplex.
Winstar’s release is available on VHS and DVD, and is a unique and enthralling
story in any format.</font><span style="font-size:10.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Following the death of their master, Gouken,
fighters Ryu (who looks a bit like Tom Cruise) and Ken return to Japan to avenge
their honor. If that sentence means anything to you, these five new discs from
Anime distributor Manga Entertainment (who also released <i>Ghost in the Shell</i>
and the Macross titles) will be at the top of your wish list. Timed to coincide
with the tenth anniversary of the <i>Street Fighter II</i> video game
phenomenon, the stories expand on the core characters, adding adventures that
can loosely be summed up as a quest to find the best brawlers in the world.
Sure, for the uninitiated these are merely cartoons, but for the faithful this
is a revered world of honor and action (“if you are a die hard Street Fighter
fan, you can't not like this movie,” says one user posting on the Internet
Movie Database). As bright and crisp as the animation is, one is struck
primarily by the muscular sound mix, which combines majestic music with a
multitextured field of thumps and tinkles as the warriors do their business.
While the <i>Street Fighter II V</i> quartet DVD’s each contain seven
half-hour episodes (eight on volume four), supplemented with Manga previews and
fan club info, the <i>Street Fighter Alpha</i> disc also sports numerous cast
and crew interviews (“I’m not very good at games,” director Shigeyasu
Yamauchi reveals modestly), a production featurette, the Japanese credits and a
trailer. All discs feature the ability to play the movies either dubbed or
subtitled, and include attractive and informative four-page booklets. The
preview copy of <i>Street Fighter Alpha</i> had a Manga merchandise brochure
included (they can be reached at manga.com). It’s difficult to see how the
true fan can go wrong with any of these releases.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Following a world war that lasts three decades
and a subsequent global plague (the Wandering Sickness), earth’s survivors are
pulled from their barbarous existence by an organization called Wings Around the
World, run by idealistic aviator John Cabal (Raymond Massey). The most expensive
British film to date when first released in April 1936, Alexander Korda’s
production of <i>Things to Come</i> is pivotal in the history of science fiction
films. Beginning in 1940 and positing the futuristic world of 2036, the movie
was adapted from his novel, <i>The Shape of Things to Come</i>, by the
70-year-old H.G. Wells himself (who was said to be very unhappy with the
finished product), with direction and design by William Cameron Menzies -- who
later won a special Oscar for “the use of color and the enhancement of
dramatic mood” in <i>Gone with the Wind</i> and even later directed and
designed the 1950s genre classic <i>Invaders from Mars</i> (how’s that for a
resume?). One of those high-profile films in the public domain that suffered
from extremely poor copy quality over the years, Image Entertainment’s new DVD
transfer (which claims to be from “the original 35mm studio masters”)
isn’t great by any means, but when compared to some of the truly awful video
copies in circulation it does go far in restoring a nearly forgotten genre
classic to something resembling its former glory. <i>Things to Come</i> is
released as art of Image’s ongoing Wade Williams Collection (see <i>The Brain
from Planet Arous</i>, above). </font><span style="font-family:Verdana"><o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Twelve-year-old
jazz piano prodigy Miles (commercial veteran Christopher George Marquette) and
saxophonist Tyrone Pike (Gregory Hines, never better) share three things: a
passion for music, the neurological disorder Tourette Syndrome (hence the title,
which Pike coins to befuddle a school bully) and a stormy relationship with the
boy’s mom (former “thirtysomething” regular Polly Draper, whose warm and
fuzzy script was inspired in part by the life of her husband, Michael Wolff, who
was Arsenio Hall’s former talk show bandleader). You don’t have to love jazz
to fall under the spell of this uplifting fable (peopled with indie and music
all-stars), but you will have to fight for tickets with those who’ve already
heard about the film’s authenticity (in this fairytale yet profane New York,
people are “cats” and music is “smokin’”). Using Miles’ words, <i>The
Tic Code</i> (winner of three awards, including best film, actor and actress at
the 1998 Giffoni Children’s Film Festival in Italy) is “fierce.”<span style="mso-spacerun:

Discs” from Elite Entertainment, which uses the format to recreate the
drive-in experience from days gone past (finally! someone's managed to figure
out how to use this newfangled technology!). You get two cartoons (including one
of Max and Dave Fleischer's wonderfully demented &quot;Betty Boop&quot; opuses);
concession-stand advertisements (including <i>Let's All Go to the Lobby</i>,
recently inducted into the National Film Registry); assorted goodies such as a
promo for Pic, a mosquito repellent (much needed at some drive-ins, but if the
bugs konk out when they smell it, what does it do to people?) -- and a double
feature, to boot! <i>Attack of the Giant Leaches</i> (1960), with the immortal
Yvette Vickers (if Yvette Vickers were standing in front of the camera reading
from a phone book, it would still be good enough reason to see her); and <i>The
Screaming Skull</i> (1958), a modern-day Southern Gothic with some
not-ineffective scares near the end. Plus, the disc features both a normal
soundtrack and one recorded in &quot;Distorto&quot; sound, which plays back the
program just the way it would sound if you were hearing it over an old-style
drive-in speaker. What more could you ask for? Additional Drive-In Disc editions
are also forthcoming.<o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The
quintessential 1960s exploitation movie, Roger Corman’s <i>The Wild Angels</i>
stars Peter Fonda as Heavenly Blues, the leader of a California chapter of the
Hell’s Angels motorcycle club. When his gangmate Loser (Bruce Dern) is killed,
the crew drapes his coffin with a swastika and goes on a wild rampage of
destruction. Directors Monte Hellman and Peter Bogdanovich worked on this
touchstone of harmless bad taste, which counts among its costars Dianne Ladd
(she and Dern are the parents of Laura Dern, who was born the year after the
movie came out), Dick Miller, Michael J. Pollard and Nancy Sinatra as Blues’
woman Mike. Unavailable in its widescreen Panavision glory until this satisfying
MGM “Midnight Movies” DVD presentation, <i>The Wild Angels</i> is an
inadvertently brilliant evocation of 1960s style and counterculture -- including
gas for twenty-six cents a gallon -- and climaxes with Fonda’s rightfully
famous, if barely articulate, plea for tolerance and understanding: “We
don’t want nobody telling us what to do, we don’t want nobody pushing us
around… We want to be <i>free</i>, we want to be free to <i>do</i> what we
want to <i>do</i>. We want to be free to <i>ride</i>, we want to be free to <i>ride</i>
our <i>machines</i> without being <i>hassled</i> by <i>The Man</i>! And we want
to get loaded, and we want to have a good time!”</span></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The
wildly successful DVD format has been called “film school in a box,” and
nowhere is that description more fitting than in this collection of interviews
with Hollywood filmmakers. Available from Winstar Home Video individually or
together in this mammoth boxed set, each disc presents an hour-long interview
with its subject, supplemented with generous clips from pertinent works and a
separate filmography, awards list and weblink. Although never less than
engrossing, the volumes do have their flaws: each disc was made by the deeply
conflicted and artistically compromised American Film Institute, with the cheesy
production values -- the music is wretched -- and bombastic narration typical of
their later Life Achievement Award programs (here’s how irrelevant those
schmoozefests have become: can anyone name this year’s winner? No? It was
Barbra Streisand). And don’t trust either the text or documentation for the
last word on each career, as there are more than a few mistakes (Milos
Forman’s debut feature is <i>Black Peter</i>, not <i>Black Pepper</i>, while
actor Frederic Forrest’s first name is misspelled) and the narration is often
downright mawkish (David Cronenberg is described as an “authentic auteur”).
But the worst sin of all involves the clips themselves: how useful is a clip
from <i>Nashville</i> to a Robert Altman interview or a sequence from <i>The
Last Temptation of Christ</i> to a Martin Scorsese seminar if they’re
presented fullframe instead of letterboxed in something approximating their
proper aspect ratios? That said, the box is an invaluable resource for the
scholar and casual fan alike, with numerous behind-the-scenes anecdotes and
historical information -- particularly for senior filmmakers such as John
Frankenheimer, Norman Jewison, Garry Marshall and Sydney Pollack. The vintages
of each edition vary, from roughly 1995 to 2000. The best? Terry Gilliam, John
McTiernan (<i>Die Hard</i>) and Martin Scorsese. The worst? Let’s just say
it’s doubtful there’s currently much of a market for career overviews of
Adrian Lyne or Rob Reiner -- yet. And those missing in action include Francis
Coppola, Curtis Hanson, Ridley Scott, Steven Soderbergh, Michael Mann, James
Cameron, or even one woman (Joan Micklin Silver, Martha Coolidge or even
Streisand would’ve fit perfectly in the set). For the record, the directors
profiled are Altman, Wes Craven, Cronenberg, Clint Eastwood, Forman,
Frankenheimer, William Friedkin, Gilliam, Ron Howard, Norman Jewison, Lawrence
Kasdan, Spike Lee, Barry Levinson, Lyne, Marshall, McTiernan, Pollack, Reiner,
Joel Schumacher, Scorsese, Steven Spielberg and Robert Zemeckis. Individual
discs can be found online for $9.98, with at least one etailer offering the set
for $179.98. &nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
