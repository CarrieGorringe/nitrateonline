            this Ismail Merchant-James Ivory interpretation of <i>The Golden
            Bowl</i>, one of Henry James' most unwieldy novels, manages to be
            simultaneously magisterial and dull. Much like the story, the
            composition appears to be about acquisition -- as the characters
            seek to satisfy their rapacious appetites, the film delivers scene
            after scene of exquisite particulars, to the point that you might
            feel vaguely overwhelmed by the time the two hours-plus running time
            is done. Repeated wide-screen images of grand gardens and fabulous
            artwork, Italian palazzos and British manors are magnificent and the
            filmmakers's attention to period (1903-1909) detail in costumes,
            food, furniture, and even transportation (sublime trains, quaint
            buggies, putt-putting cars) would make Martin Scorsese proud. <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">All
            these visual perfections also intimate <i>The Golden Bowl's</i>
            weakness, however, which is its lack of perspective, or perhaps more
            precisely, its narrow perspective. Working from James is always
            something of a bear, of course -- his characters obsess over nuances
            and innuendoes that readers hopefully recognize as trivial, or at
            least deleterious <b><i>as</i></b> obsessions. Merchant and Ivory,
            and their regular screenwriter Ruth Prawler Jhabvala, have
            experience with translating James to the screen, having worked
            together on <i>The Europeans</i> (1979) and <i>The Bostonians </i>(1984).
            But their latest adaptation, while laced through with graceful
            moments, translates much of the novel's coy phrasing into literal
            representations and its characters into awkward embodiments of
            era-bound sentiments. The Ververs and their consorts are all four
            turned into indelicate types, constrained by cumbrous dialogue (much
            of it lifted directly from the novel), fussy performances, bad wigs
            and facial hair, and episodic plotting. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Set
            at the turn of the century, <i>The Golden Bowl </i>takes up one of
            James' favorite topics -- the vulgarity of Americans in Europe.
            Here, American expatriate Charlotte (Uma Thurman) is anxious about
            her status (as are most all of James' heroines), for compared to the
            folks she runs with, she's positively &quot;poor.&quot; She's also
            in love with an Italian prince named Amerigo (Jeremy Northam with an
            unconvincing Italian accent), and as the film opens, their affair is
            ending (for the time being), because he is also relatively
            &quot;poor.&quot; Though he's inherited the Palazzo Ugolini, he
            can't afford to maintain the place. To make ends meet, he's dumping
            Charlotte (who's very distraught at his decision) and marrying the
            fabulously wealthy Maggie Verver (Kate Beckinsale), who also happens
            to be a childhood friend of Charlotte. As soon as you see the
            reputation-obsessed Amerigo and the Amerigo-obsessed Charlotte, you
            know trouble will brew. The film ensures that you know this, by
            matching their betrayal to come with a story that Amerigo is telling
            Charlotte, of some ancestors who engaged in an affair -- a wife and
            her son-in-law, discovered in bed together and punished severely by
            her husband/his father. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            where the Italian story is about sexual lust, the vulgar Americans
            tend to be more interested in material lust -- they want to own
            everything: art, houses, people, information. And so it happens that
            Charlotte exhibits (again and again) a melodramatic possessiveness
            toward Amerigo. At the time of his wedding to Maggie, Charlotte is
            all atwitter with ostensible love and devotion, but really, she's
            scheming to &quot;have&quot; him, as she once did. They agree to
            pretend they never knew one another. The precise reason for this
            decision is never clear, though a meddlesome family friend named
            Fanny (Anjelica Huston) -- there are a lot of Fannys in James
            novels, usually social boors and bad news for the folks they think
            they to want to help -- suggests that it's because Maggie is naive
            and pure and needs to be protected. Charlotte and Amerigo adopt this
            rationale and repeat it to one another like a mantra, whenever they
            worry they're doing the wrong thing. This is, of course, one of
            those Jamesian contortions of motive that will inevitably be
            revealed and ruin everything. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And
            so, when Maggie dispatches Amerigo to fetch Charlotte, ignorant of
            their past liaison, she has no idea that she's aiding and abetting
            in the rekindling of their passion; or perhaps better, of their
            habit, for Charlotte, as played by Thurman, appears to have very
            little passion in her, just increasingly mannered behaviors. Upon
            being fetched, Charlotte convinces Amerigo take her shopping for a
            wedding gift for Maggie. At a small shop they find the titular bowl
            (made of crystal and gold), which Amerigo discourages his companion
            from buying because he spots the flaw in it immediately. Charlotte,
            being the American, misses the crack, and it follows that she can't
            see the trouble she will be stirring with her next move, which is to
            hook up with Maggie's father, the significantly named Adam Verver
            (Nick Nolte). <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Adam
            is introduced on screen with the title, &quot;America's First
            Billionaire&quot; (this is the level of overstatement to which the
            film resorts repeatedly, not trusting its audience to follow even
            the simplest plot points). Maggie is initially pleased with the
            match, for it ostensibly frees her up to spend more time with her
            husband and baby boy (a prop here, nothing else). But it turns out
            that the pairs break off in other ways: cut to a few years later,
            the camera opening on an opulent party at some muckety-muck's
            palace, where Amerigo and Charlotte are keeping one another company,
            while Maggie is at home taking care of her reportedly ailing father.

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Tongues
            wag, as they must, but if everyone in their circle knows Charlotte
            and Adam's marriage is one of convenience, gossips are left guessing
            about <b><i>whose</i></b> convenience. Obviously, Charlotte gets to
            be rich, well-dressed, and admired by many, and Adam gets a pretty
            young thing to adorn his arm as he globetrots in search of the
            finest art treasures, which he's collecting in order to bestow on
            the world as his great legacy (he's planning his &quot;great
            work,&quot; a museum built to house his collection in &quot;American
            City&quot; -- James-speak for the Vulgar Urbanworld that is the
            U.S.). Yet the willfully naive Maggie also benefits from the union,
            for once she and Adam figure out that they really do like one
            another's company more than anyone else's, they feel less guilty
            when abandoning their spouses <b><i>together</i></b>. So crass, so
            willful, so artless are the Ververs that they just can't abide by
            the old world rules. This allows them to resist knowing anything
            about Amerigo and Charlotte's relationship: they prefer to think
            it's as platonic as their own. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            film offers up their ignorance as exquisite pain -- they're so
            beautifully appointed, that their emotional shenanigans don't seem
            nearly so rough and tumble as those on, say, <i>Jerry Springer</i>.
            But they're playing the same games, wanting to possess each other
            and the spotlight that comes with recognized and successful
            power-tripping. And so the four of them gather occasionally in
            sitting rooms, posing for each other, going on about how fortunate
            they all are that they get along so well. Eventually, such
            self-congratulatory chatter gets tedious, and that's when the drama
            kicks in, repressed and prolonged and very meaningful. <o:p>

            and the prince probably come off worst, but that's only because they
            try too hard to be manipulative, and they're so bad at it. Maggie,
            the much-protected <b><i>naif</i></b>, ends up making the meanest
            and most effective manipulation, and she gets what she wants. This
            makes her perhaps the most European of the Americans, because she
            leaves Charlotte dangling in a very discomfitted state. Dreading her
            return to the States as one of Adam Verver's &quot;treasures,&quot;
            Charlotte has a nightmare vision composed of old-time movie clips of
            workers and miners and traffic. She wakes in a sweat, hand to her
            forehead. By this time, you are likely to be feeling her pain. And
            oh my dear, it's just too much. <o:p>
