            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Les Mayfield's <i>American
            Outlaws</i> rehashes a national mythology that has long been
            thoroughly hashed. The story of the Missouri-based James Gang -- or
            more precisely, the James-Younger Gang -- has been told many times,
            from its beginnings in old-tyme dime novels, poems, and songs,
            through to radio, television, and of course, movies. The saga's
            appeal is no secret: these guys were charming criminals who made
            headlines, stole money from rich folks, rode horses and carried big
            guns, and perhaps most importantly, maintained solid, manly, family
            values. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The latest retelling of their saga
            is a lot like many other movies. A lot. It focuses on Jesse James
            (Colin Ferrell, whose charismatic turn in last year's Vietnam War
            era rehash, <i>Tigerland</i>, earned him a place on several
            &quot;Faces to Watch&quot;-type lists). The movie begins at the end
            of the Civil War, and Jesse and his friends, though weary from
            battle, remain enthusiastic about &quot;killing Yankees.&quot; The
            camera opens on Jesse and his crew -- his brother Frank (Gabriel
            Macht) and their childhood friends, Cole and Bob Younger (Scott
            Caan, looking more like his father every minute, and Will
            McCormack), and their pal, the Comanche scout Tom (Nathaniel Arcand)
            -- as they ride through an open field, their flag held high, just
            hankering for a fight. They get one, and you get to see some fancy
            riding and shooting, and a few bodies jerking back and falling, like
            they used to do in old-school Westerns. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mostly, however, the scene is
            designed to introduce you to the primary players, all referred to by
            name and typed by their actions. Jesse is the <i>primary</i> primary
            player. You know this because, once those Yankees start firing on
            the rebels -- with a canon <i>and</i> a gatling gun, those cheaters!
            He decides to take matters into his own hands. He gets this peculiar
            smile on his face whenever he decides to do that, and his buddies
            can only roll their eyes and sigh and hope for the best. That Jesse,
            he's got a mind of his own! In this opening scene, he tells Frank
            he's going to &quot;distract&quot; the enemy soldiers so Frank can
            get a clear shot at 'em, then he takes his horse's reins in his
            mouth, sets off at a dead run across the field directly into the
            opposing force, with two pistols blazing. The dumb Union army shoots
            and shoots and shoots, missing every time. Jesse is unstoppable.
            Frank kills the weapons operators and then the James and Younger
            boys -- and oh, yes, Tom too -- can ride on outta there, feeling
            triumphant and happy about that pile of dead enemies they're leaving
            behind. It's grand, being so proficient at killing, and it's pretty
            darn All American too. And they congratulate each other on being so
            gifted, a couple of times.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still, all good things come to an
            end, and within minutes, the boys learn that the war's over and they
            have toad on back home to Liberty, Missouri. Again, Jesse's
            established as the good boy: he wants to return to his old life,
            farming and whatever. It's never quite explained how Tom fits into
            this &quot;going back home&quot; scenario, as we might assume he has
            his own family and another life somewhere, one that may even have
            been disrupted when the white folks decided to &quot;settle&quot;
            Comanche land, but why worry about it? Tom is the crucial
            &quot;diversity&quot; member of this American gang, the one with
            about three lines. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still, this being the James-Younger
            Gang story, it's not long before the boys run into more trouble and
            have to form that very gang. It turns out that the railroad's coming
            through Liberty, and the owner, Thaddeus Rains (Harris Yulin), is
            buying up all the farms that lay in his way. So no one mistakes his
            intentions, Rains has employed the Pinkerton Detective Agency to
            assist in the buying-out process: they accompany Rains's point man,
            one Rollin Parker (Terry O'Quinn, who will forever live in my heart
            as The Stepfather), as he travels from farm to farm, handing out
            contracts to be signed, or else. Lucky for Ma James (Kathy Bates:
            and what has happened to <b><i>her</i></b> career?), Jesse and Frank
            arrive back in town just before the railroad men come round to her
            farm. They're chopping wood, tinkering with the wagon, and recalling
            the good old war days when they could shoot down Yankees like the
            dogs they are, when -- as if on cue -- Parker appears. Even better,
            he brings along Allan Pinkerton Himself (Timothy Dalton), with a
            couple of detectives acting all mean and smug, like they have some
            Manifest Destiny to push their way Westward. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And here, honestly, lies the film's
            greatest insight into the nature of national mythologies. They are
            so flexible! So democratic! (In fact, if you go to the film's
            official website, you can enter a contest to win a stay at a Dude
            Ranch: you too can feel the power of being an American Outlaw.) In
            another version of this legend, the railroaders might be the heroes,
            braving the odds, ensuring communication and travel across the
            United States, bringing progress to the ignorant masses. But in <i>American
            Outlaws</i>, they are the villains, and the spirited Jameses and
            Youngers, et. al., are the good guys, dedicated to protecting the
            underdog farmers against them pushy fellas with the smoke-puffing
            Iron Horses. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And they are mighty pushy. After
            the Jameses refuse to sell their land, the Youngers have an
            off-screen run-in with the railroad men. Suddenly, Cole's about to
            be hanged in the town square the next morning. (Throughout this
            movie, things happen very fast, but not because it's well-paced.
            Quite the contrary: it feels like <i>American Outlaws</i> has been
            edited with a pair of garden shears, with scenes cutting off
            abruptly and connections between them left to you to figure out.
            Then again, it's not like the narrative is hard to follow or
            anything: there's a bad guy, shoot him!). To protect their land,
            their heritage, and their shooting-and-drinking buddy Cole, the boys
            must organize -- they take on Cole's barely teenaged brother Jimmy
            (Gregory Smith), and a couple of other young men feeling
            disenfranchised by the railroad (Ty O'Neal and Joe Stevens), and the
            gang is born. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Their first official outlaw act is
            to bust Cole out from under the hangman's noose, in broad daylight,
            just like Robin Hood's men did, when Robin Hood was played by Kevin
            Costner. One of these new gang (honorary) members is Jesse's girl,
            Zee Mimms (Ali Larter, looking just like she's stepped off a <i>Cosmo</i>
            cover, so fresh and so clean is she). While the guys have been off
            having all their fun at war, she's been stuck home, watching a
            series of hangings in the town square, so she knows how they work
            and can help in the planning. Just so you know that she's a worthy
            girl, she warns the guys at their decision-making meeting, they all
            better be men enough to listen to a woman. The camera cuts from her
            determined face to Jesse's impressed one, and, quick as you can say
            &quot;Spanky and Alfalfa and Darla,&quot; Zee's inducted into the
            gang. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">From here, the legend just grows
            and grows, including a bit more motivation. This comes in the form
            of the railroad men's ridiculous decision to start blowing up
            farmers' homes. Frustrated that none of the locals will tell Cole's
            whereabouts after his escape, they resort to dynamite. One of the
            film's most colossally corny scenes begins with Jesse and Frank
            riding home in a hurry from a celebratory hoedown<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>(silly townsfolk: imagining they've beat the railroad, just
            twenty-five minutes into the film). As soon as they arrive, the
            house blows up. And then, on perfect cue, Ma stumbles out the door,
            her hair mussed and her face sooty, so that she can collapse in
            their arms and -- with a little gasp -- die. Well, the poor kids
            just don't have a choice now, but to rob banks and train depots.
            Along the way, they become local heroes, because they, unlike those
            greedy Easterners in their bowler hats and silk suits, know how to
            give back to their community, literally giving their neighbors cash
            money. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p style="text-indent:0in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The rest of
            the film is comprised of a string of robberies and shoot-outs and
            slow-motion shots of the boys riding their horses during dusty days,
            dark nights, and rainstorms. While Pinkerton spends some months
            calculating how to trap them, you also see repeated scenes of Rains
            chewing him out, sputtering and fuming and demanding that he
            &quot;Do something!&quot;, just like those short-tempered captains
            do in cop movies. There are also a few &quot;comedic relief&quot;
            scenes where Bob Younger expresses his jealousy that Jesse gets all
            the handsome outlaw press (he looks better in the Wanted Posters
            sketches, anyway), and a couple showing Zee pouting back home, since
            Jesse and the guys have gone off on their robbery spree without her.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Eventually, Jesse realizes that all
            he really wants is to be like everyone else -- not an outlaw at all,
            but a farmer with a wife and kids and maybe a couple of horses. And
            then he's arrested while on his honeymoon in Florida, specifically,
            while he's smooching with Zee, all wet and sleek in the pretty blue
            water, just like a Chris Isaak video (I'm imagining that the facts
            are more or less correct, but jeepers, this film's plot just drags
            on and on, with no discernable rising and falling action). The gang
            stages yet another daring escape from a train that's carrying Jesse
            to Washington DC, where he's to be tried in a federal court, and you
            might think for a minute that you've dropped into <i>Wild Wild West</i>,
            minus Will Smith. I confess, I was sorely missing Will Smith.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
