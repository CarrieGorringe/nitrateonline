            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Kandahar</i>,
            the new film by Iranian filmmaker Mohsen Makhmalbaf which had its
            premiere at the Cannes Film Festival last May, Nafas (Nelofer
            Pazira), an Afghan woman living in Canada, tries to come to the aid
            of her sister, who is still in Afghanistan and has threatened --
            rather dramatically -- to commit suicide, there, during the last
            solar eclipse of the twentieth century. Nafas dons a traditional <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">burka</i></b>,
            the dark-olive garment covering her from head to toe with but a
            small amount of netting to see through, and slips into the country
            across its northern border with Iran, attempting to reach her sister
            prior to the eclipse, which, at the start of the story, is to take
            place in three days' time.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Nafas becomes ill along the way,
            and is taken to a clinician. Since contact between men and women is
            strictly forbidden, the male clinician (Hassan Tantaï) must relay
            instructions to his patient by way of a third party, such as a young
            boy or girl. A curtain partitions the patient from practitioner, but
            there is a small hole cut in the curtain, which allows the clinician
            to examine an eye or the mouth, using light reflected from a
            hand-held mirror. The clinician who treats Nafas, it turns out, is
            an African-American, living in the country by choice; he doesn't
            have professional training, and no medicines to dispense. (He treats
            one of his patients by giving them a fresh loaf of bread.) He also
            has to wear a false beard, of the proper length, because he can't
            grow one of his own.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">He's one of several who respond to
            Nafas' request to help her across a desolate landscape which is
            stark and alien, and which reminds one how Westerners take for
            granted the way they can move around with relative ease. Everyone
            turns out to be distrustful of everyone else, and they're constantly
            checking their stories, lest they're stopped by either bandits or
            the <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Muhjaheddin</i></b>,
            who roam at will. A man with several wives and many children stands
            and repeatedly speaks praise for Allah while he is divested of his
            motor vehicle, and his family of their possessions, by robbers, so
            as not to provoke the criminals in any way into shooting them all
            dead. A young boy is ejected from a seminary because he can't read
            well enough to recite the Koran, and the teacher is too stern to
            help him: the boy ends up scavenging off a corpse and selling
            whatever valuables he finds. A man who lost a hand because of a
            landmine repeatedly pesters two foreign-aid workers to give him a
            pair of prosthetic legs, even though he still has two perfectly good
            legs of his own and the aid workers are trying to help many, many
            others who have already lost one of theirs: the man doesn't want to
            go away without anything to show for his efforts; the aid workers
            end up giving him a pair of old, temporary prosthetic legs, just to
            stop his haggling. (Red Cross helicopters fly in overhead and drop
            pairs of artificial limbs, which float down on tiny parachutes.).<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's not entirely clear, at first,
            why Nafas keeps asking people for to guide her to Kandahar, where
            her sister resides -- surely the aid of a small compass and map
            would suffice -- until it dawns on you that the locals would best
            know which roads were heavily mined and which ones would be safe to
            travel on. The film's narrative is wobbly and awkward at times, even
            though it is based on fact: Nelofer Pazira -- who is strikingly
            beautiful when she reveals her face -- emigrated with her family to
            Canada but stayed in touch with a female friend who remained behind
            in Afghanistan; she would later make an attempt to rescue her friend
            when conditions in the country became increasingly harsh towards
            women, driving her friend to the brink of despair. Pazira's attempt
            came to the attention of Makhmalbaf, who would later make a covert
            trip into Afghanistan to see for himself what conditions were like.
            Denied permission to film in Pakistan, Makhmalbaf ended up making <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Kandahar</i>,
            using digital equipment (which gives the film's images an
            astonishing amount of clarity and depth), on the Iran-Afghanistan
            border, recruiting most of the cast from refugees who had fled into
            Iran seeking asylum, and even so, the film was still made at great
            personal risk to the director and crew.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Makhmalbaf isn't working on the
            same level of artistry as the great East Indian director Satyajit
            Ray, whose films continue to speak to audiences nearly a
            half-century after they were made. But whatever flaws <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Kandahar</i>
            may have as a narrative piece seem secondary after a while to the
            profound level of misery conveyed through its images, which is hard
            to shake. With the gruesome stories only now emerging of terror and
            carnage inflicted by the Taliban on the Afghan people, this may only
            be the tip of the iceberg.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"></o:p>
