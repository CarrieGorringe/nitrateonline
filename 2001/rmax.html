            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>
            review by <a href="../gianni.html" target="_top">Gianni Truzzi</a>, 5 October 2001</i></font><p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The world that Max Keeble, a 
            seventh-grader in his first week at Curtis Junior High, inhabits is 
            a far distance from the rural idylls of the old <i>Our Gang</i> two-reelers. 
            The explosive opening typifies the kind of over-the-top 
            precociousness granted to suburban twelve-year-olds as Max (Alex D. 
            Linz) battles the evil ice-cream-man (Jamie Kennedy), as if&nbsp; James 
            Bond drove a BMX mountain bike instead of an Aston Martin. But just 
            as we despair that we are to be subjected to ninety minutes of 
            pandering wish-fulfillment, Max wakes up in his bed. This was just 
            Max's fantasy -- the kind we all had as children but would never 
            admit to.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yet Max's world is no more 
            realistic than the idealized innocence of Spanky and his friends. 
            Truer to our times, it functions within the jaundiced facetiousness 
            of <i>Malcolm in the Middle. </i>His father (<i>Revenge of the Nerds</i>' 
            Robert Carradine), suffers daily humiliation from the boss, forced 
            to dress up as a lobster or a large slice of cheese, while his 
            mother (<i>Saturday Night Live </i>alumnus Nora Dunn) is a Martha 
            Stewart junkie. Like any kid on his first day at a new school, Max 
            wants to be thought &quot;cool.&quot; His friends, however, definitely aren't. 
            Natalie (Zena Grey) is a diligent student who plays the clarinet, 
            and Robert (Josh Peck) is an iconoclastic, smooth-faced Abe Vigoda 
            look-alike who wears a bathrobe over his clothes (hence his 
            nickname, &quot;Robe&quot;) and &quot;smells like diapers.&quot; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Max dreams of Jenna, the pretty and 
            popular ninth-grader, but he's a perfect puny target for the school 
            bullies that reign in the halls. Unlike the surly louts of the real 
            world, Curtis Jr. High's bullies are dastardly evildoers that would 
            feel at home in an action-hero comic book. Troy McKenzie arrives at 
            school each day with the name of his intended victim on his shirt, 
            determined to administer the &quot;world-wide-wedge&quot; to every frail 
            student. Another, a double-breasted young Michael Milken, steals 
            other kids' lunch money masked by the euphemism of ”investment.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What would a kid flick be without a 
            sociopath principal? Mr. Jindraike (Larry Miller, of <i>Best In Show</i>) 
            is an ambitious, amoral buffoon, determined to impress the 
            superintendent. with a winning football team of hyper-pituitaried 
            Eastern European &quot;exchange students.&quot; Furthermore, the new football 
            stadium threatens an animal shelter (what else?) where Max 
            volunteers. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Max's trials are interrupted when 
            he learns that his father has a sudden job change, and that they are 
            moving. A new school in a new town means the rare chance to wreak 
            vengeance on everyone who did him wrong before he leaves. After all, 
            he won't be around to suffer retribution -- or will he?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Despite a lunacy that teeters on 
            expressionism, what <i>Max Keeble</i> draws on most is the popular 
            television series of the 1980's, <i>The Wonder Years</i>. Linz is a 
            fair copy of Fred Savage (small, smart and handsome, the kid has a 
            future), and he and his friends present the same boy-girl-nerd 
            triangle. What's missing is the humanity of the adults that made <i>
            Wonder Years</i> so special. Except in a couple of rote scenes 
            between Max and his father, the grown-ups are all cartoons.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yet <i>Keeble</i>'s flippancy is 
            redeemed by its core of issues that pre-teens genuinely face:&nbsp; the 
            desire to be accepted or popular, and facing the consequences of 
            your actions. The film doesn't run from or hide its moralistic 
            message, but the absurdity is an effective lubricant. Moreover, the 
            antics of Max and his friends are, with some exception, within the 
            bounds of what a child can do. One might object that a 
            twelve-year-old isn't likely to know how to operate heavy machinery 
            or ride an ostrich, but at least they don't become miniature 
            paramilitary Schwarzeneggers. <i>Keeble</i> uses its license, but it 
            doesn't shred it.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Better films than <i>Keeble </i>
            have been made on these themes, most notably 1980's <i>My Bodyguard</i>. 
            But the bitter truth is that today's kids watch <i>Malcolm In The 
            Middle </i>or <i>The Simpsons</i> (whether they're meant to or not), 
            and are comfortable with their knowing irony. Hal Roach's precocious 
            child actors wouldn't know how to function within the world of the
            <i>Recess</i> cartoons where <i>Ferris Bueller</i> bravado has 
            seeped down to the grade school set. Max Keeble is a good kid, a 
            sound influence and someone with whom parents can feel&nbsp; comfortable 
            letting their middle-school children while away an afternoon.</font></td>
