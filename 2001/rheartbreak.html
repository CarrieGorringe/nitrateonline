            <i>Simpsons</i> writer and executive producer David Mirkin's
            predilection for wickedly witty cartoonishness is only slightly
            tempered in his live-action movies. Both <i>Romy and Michele's High
            School Reunion</i> and, now, <i>Heartbreakers</i>, feature
            outrageously outfitted female protagonists who connive and pratfall
            their way through ridiculous romantic comedy plots, only to come to
            a realization that traditional values -- say, happy heterosexual
            coupledom -- are the key to fitting in with the rest of the world. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            <i>Heartbreakers</i>, the cost of fitting in is initially too much
            for both Max Conners (Sigourney Weaver) and her daughter Page
            (Jennifer Love Hewitt). Expert, longtime con artists, their basic
            scam is premised on the fact that Max refuses to conform to any
            expectations of good wifedom or patient femininity. She's a
            go-getter and she's also been angry for years, ever since her one
            true love left her pregnant and alone. Now all men are not to be
            trusted and deserve to suffer the vengeance she will wreak upon them
            (this is a story that she repeats often, much to Page's visible
            dismay, she being the result of that pregnancy). In order to get
            where she wants, Max has perfected the art of looking like she fits
            in to whatever crowd she's manipulating. This typically means she
            pretends to subscribe to conventional notions of commitment and
            family harmony. <o:p>

            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Over
            the years, Max has trained Page to work with her, and now that the
            girl is filled out with all kinds of &quot;dangerous curves&quot;
            (as the film's promotional poster terms them), she has become a most
            valuable asset. The usual scam runs something like this: Max marries
            a wealthy mark (preferably one whose money isn't entirely legal, so
            he's easily manipulated), and on the morning after a frustrating
            non-consummated wedding night, Page seduces the mark into a
            compromising position, so that, in the final step, the mark
            sheepishly coughs up a healthy divorce settlement as Max sits
            stoically at the lawyers' table, sunglasses on and handkerchief at
            the ready. <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Just
            as they complete a scam of this sort involving chop-shop-owner Dean
            (Ray Liotta), Page decides that she's had enough. At twenty-one, she
            feels ready to go out on her own. Upset at the impending loss of her
            partner and child, Max convinces her that they must make one more
            big score, and they head down to Palm Beach where the rich fish
            gather. There they decide to take an aging, chain-smoking tobacco
            tycoon, William Tensy (Gene Hackman), with terrible breath and worse
            teeth. Though Max is put off by such stomach-turning hideousness,
            she comes up with yet another new persona, the Russian Ulga, who
            wears spectacular furs and speaks with a riotously bad accent: see
            especially, Ulga's attempts to refuse Tensy access to her hotel room
            because, she wails, &quot;Ayi em nyekid!&quot; or to dazzle him with
            a bizarre, balalaika-accompanied rendition of &quot;Back in the
            USSR&quot; (which, in her pronunciation, becomes &quot;beck en de
            USSR&quot;). <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meanwhile,
            Page is falling in love with someone, the incredibly laid-back,
            incredibly generous Jack (Jason Lee) who happens to be a millionaire
            himself. Of course, falling in love with a potential mark is exactly
            the wrong thing to do in her line of work, and so, conflicts arise,
            as mom attempts to set her straight, while ensuring that her own con
            with Tensy is on track (in this, Max must outsmart Tensy's fiercely
            protective maid, crisply played by Nora Dunn). Max and Page's
            friction entails some potentially touching mother-daughter moments,
            which the film is mostly smart enough to twist up as comedy.<o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like
            <i>Romy and Michele</i>, the goonily pleasurable <i>Heartbreakers</i>
            evinces a rudimentary feminist sensibility, in that the girls are
            strong and self-confident, and engage in the kind of broad, crazed,
            physical comedy that's not often granted to women on screen. As
            gifted as Hackman is, the Tensy scenes tend to be repetitive
            (hacking and wretching, hacking and wretching), but that's all
            right, because it is Hewitt and Weaver's adventure. Hewitt reveals a
            sophistication and good humor that you might not have imagined her
            to have (though, if you watch the <i>I Know What You Did Last Summer</i>
            films carefully, I think you'll spot her precise and funny timing).
            And Weaver again shows that her sense of self and her sense of
            comedy are equally sublime. </font></o:p>
