            <p><font face="Verdana" size="5">With you as the hero</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Attica. For many people, the
            word is most familiar as the chant initiated by Al Pacino's frantic
            bank robber in <i>Dog Day Afternoon</i>. But Attica is most
            definitely a place, the infamous New York State Penitentiary. And it
            most definitely has a history, one that is painful, complex, and
            very hard to sort out, in large part because the state government
            has sealed all records concerning the events until 2026.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The story of Attica begins long
            before 9 September 1971, when 1200 inmates staged an uprising to
            protest impossibly hard conditions. Correctly told, it would include
            accounts of the terrible conditions that drove the men to fight back
            with such fervor and determination. But most people first heard of
            Attica when, on that fateful day, the inmates took over
            &quot;D&quot; yard, and took 39 guards as hostages, in order to
            prompt negotiations with State officials, via an impartial team
            composed of journalists, clergy, lawyers, and activists. Four days
            later, when negotiations broke down, Governor Rockefeller ordered
            policemen to retake the prison; they fired some 2200 rounds in six
            minutes, leaving thirty-nine people dead and eighty wounded. When it
            came out that ten of the dead were guards, the State told the press
            that inmates had slashed their throats. Needless to say, when it
            came time for the inmates to go to trial for their apparent crimes,
            they faced a hostile jury pool. What's more, they faced unfair and
            illegal tactics by New York's prosecuting and district attorneys.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Euzhan (<i>A Dry White Season</i>)
            Palcy's <i>The Killing Yard</i> recounts one of these trials, that
            of Shango Bahati Kakawama (Morris Chestnut, in a thoughtful
            performance that should quiet fears that he's just a pretty boy).
            Born Bernard Stroble, Shango was self-educated and politicized
            during his time inside, becoming a somewhat notorious
            &quot;jailhouse lawyer,&quot; who helped fellow inmates with their
            cases. And, as the film has it, he's ornery and outspoken enough to
            alarm prison and state officials, who make it their business to
            convict him of the murders of two white inmates during the uprising.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Establishing both high drama and
            the high stakes of the uprising, the movie opens with a brief,
            pre-credits black and white flashback to the &quot;yard,&quot;
            giving a glimpse of chaos and violence, punctuated by the relentless
            shooting that ended or forever changed so many people's lives. This
            ghastly scene cuts to a comparatively quiet one: three men are
            hunting deer, in color, in some woodsy wonderland. The <i>Deer
            Hunter</i> parallel is hard to miss: the auspiciously named lawyer
            Ernie Goodman (Alan Alda) has a moment, peering through his gun
            sight. His vision blurs, his hands shake, and, even as his friends
            urge him to &quot;Shoot!&quot;, Ernie collapses, crumpling to the
            ground in an understandably frightened, shaking heap. While this
            moment signals Ernie's lesson to be learned, it also sets up the
            movie's ongoing preoccupation with his &quot;condition&quot; (later
            diagnosed as transient global amnesia, a possible precursor to
            stroke), which makes him even more valiant and selfless and
            wonderful than he would otherwise have been.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ernie, of course, will take
            Shango's case, and he will endure the verbal abuses of not only the
            New York State authorities and attorneys, but of his own client,
            during his pursuit of justice. But the film is steadfastly focused
            on Ernie's understanding of events, his coming to terms with
            Shango's difficult background. The lawyer is aided in this
            coming-to-see-the-light process by his assistant, Linda (Rose
            McGowan). Initially, Linda is a bit of a well-behaved fireball,
            dressed up in '70s rebel-girl-wear (bellbottoms, colorful t-shirts),
            and standing up for Shango even when he behaves rudely (!) during
            interviews and consultations. For some unexplained reason, the
            famously &quot;liberal&quot; lawyer Ernie needs to be taught to
            accept this in a client, though you would think that he might have
            run into it once or twice before, in previous cases. But be that as
            it may, Ernie is feeling alone in Buffalo, and not a little
            oppressed himself by the opposing team's scammy tactics
            (intimidating witnesses, suborning perjury, losing or manufacturing
            evidence), and so he soon accepts the advice of Linda and her fellow
            &quot;kids,&quot; volunteers for the Attica Defense Fund, working on
            the many Attica cases.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Linda is actually a more important
            figure in Shango's life than you might guess from her brief
            appearances in the film. Eventually, a final epigraph informs us,
            she will marry Shango and bear his children. Here, the romance is
            translated into a couple of longing looks, a moment when their hands
            touch, and a sorrowful embrace occasioned by Ernie's collapse in the
            courtroom. Theirs is the subsidiary story. In this telling, Shango's
            trial is more about Ernie's education and his admirable efforts to
            defend his client against obviously bogus charges than it is about
            Attica or its prisoners. While it clearly recalls Norman Jewison's <i>The
            Hurricane</i>, <i>The Killing Yard</i> is even more troublingly
            rudimentary in its melodramatic race politics. Where Rubin Carter
            was saved by a loving and committed black boy and his white
            guardians, here Shango is saved by Ernie, a noble Atticus
            Finch-wannabe who bonds with his client by sharing his own tales of
            hardship (anti-Semitism he suffered as a child) and persisting with
            the trial even when his friends and doctors tell him he must stop,
            or risk his life.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>The Killing Yard</i>'s
            fictionalized, fit-into-a-two-hour-timeslot structure no doubt
            leaves out much of the complexity of Ernie and Shango's
            relationship, and it opts for soapy emotional shorthands more than
            once. But it almost seems afraid to delve too deeply into Shango's
            life, which is reduced here to a list of convictions (for assault,
            murder, etc.) rattled off by his lawyer. Perhaps it's too difficult
            to imagine a perpetually angry black man as the hero of his own
            story. Maybe this is why the film so clumsily introduces Shango's
            mother, Ma Stroble (Eleanor McCoy), who literally shows up on the
            sidewalk outside Ernie's hotel (the lawyer has apparently not sought
            her out), then tells him over diner coffee that her son is a
            &quot;good boy.&quot; For the rest of the film, Ma sits silently in
            the audience section of the courtroom, taking Linda's hand to signal
            a dramatic turn of events (usually, when the slimy prosecutors do
            some dastardly wrong). Once she's served her purpose, namely, to
            show that the scary black man has a sweet mother who loves him,
            she's reduced to background.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still, the film means well, and in
            its braver moments, allows Shango a couple of preemptive-strike-type
            speeches, acknowledging that the liberal white do-gooder character
            too often gets the attention in such commercial vehicles. Indeed,
            such speeches call out the film itself for its distressing racial
            machinations. When Shango meets Ernie for the first time, he asks if
            he's supposed to be just another chapter in Ernie's autobiography,
            &quot;with you as the hero and me as the poor oppressed
            nigger.&quot; He also notes that &quot;when this is over,&quot;
            Ernie gets to go home to his nice home and wife, while Shango goes
            back to prison. But such insights seem obligatory. It's not long
            before Shango undergoes the predictable humbling revelation: after
            seeing Ernie perform a particularly deft move in the courtroom, the
            defendant turns to Linda and says, &quot;If I was half as smart as I
            pretend to be, I wouldn't be in this mess.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">You can't help but feel that the
            man's intelligence wasn't the only or even the primary factor
            getting him into &quot;this mess,&quot; but <i>The Killing Yard</i>
            makes its point. Both Ernie and Shango come to respect one another,
            and perhaps more importantly, to feel responsible for one another.
            And for all the film's clichés, Chestnut's performance grants
            Shango an undeniable dignity. When he enters into his
            &quot;partnership&quot; with Ernie, in his own defense, it's clear
            immediately that he knows all too well the system's built-in
            discriminations and cruelties, while Ernie still believes -- wants
            and needs to believe -- that the system &quot;works.&quot; Though
            Shango's acquittal proves Ernie right, you also know that there are
            many other cases that prove otherwise. This is the most important
            reason for remembering Attica.</font>
