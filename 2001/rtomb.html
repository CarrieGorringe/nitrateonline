            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Recently
            on the TV news magazine <i>Dateline NBC</i>, an interview with
            Angelina Jolie was introduced as if it would provide rare insight
            into this provocative, sensational celebrity. And dear Angelina
            delivered. The awkwardly edited fragments of her conversation with
            Ann Curry showed her defending her much-gabbed-about her sexuality
            (with husband Billy Bob Thornton and with &quot;women&quot;) and
            dissing the press for making such a big deal about the time she
            kissed her brother on the mouth at the Academy Awards (her brother,
            she reported, is suffering emotional distress from the overkill).
            Then, she actually teared up on camera when asked why she wears a
            vial of Billy Bob's blood around her neck. And when Curry leaned
            forward with her finger stuck out as if to put it on that vial,
            Jolie pulled back with a start, as if from poison. No touching! <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Such
            devotion, such vulnerability. It was awful. But still, I was glad to
            see Jolie on TV, and I frankly don't care a whit about her vial.
            She's perpetually compelling to see, whether in her signature
            harried mode (which she nailed in HBO's <i>Gia</i> and for which won
            a Best Supporting Oscar, in <i>Girl, Interrupted</i>), or in her
            cooler vein (<i>Hackers</i>, <i>Foxfire</i>). Newly happy, she says
            that she's wrestled with her demons and feels ready to deal with the
            world. It's too bad that this dealing includes shilling a movie
            whose marketing campaign features a game called the &quot;Taco Bell
            Quest&quot;. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            movie is<i> Lara Croft: Tomb Raider</i>, directed by Simon West (the
            man responsible for <i>The General's Daughter</i>). Of course, Jolie
            plays the brilliant, imperturbable, long-legged, short-pantsed Lara.
            Fabulously wealthy, super-lean, and almost unnervingly confident,
            she's a raider of tombs and photojournalist (though, aside from a
            brief mention of this last, there's no sign that she works at
            anything resembling a real job). She's crafty, she's slinky, she's
            seductive as hell. But mostly, Lady Croft is Angelina Jolie playing
            a character who's based on a character who is best known for kicking
            ass in a video game and allowing all kinds of excitingly slippery
            identification. This is a great trick: where no one actually wants
            to look like those thuggish cretinous shooters in <i>Doom</i>, a lot
            of <i>Tomb Raider</i> players want to be Lara Croft and f*ck Lara
            Croft, usually at the same time. If the movie's Lara doesn't much
            resemble the video game version, that's okay too. Jolie brings her
            own devices. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            movie's Lara is introduced in mid-battle. The shadows loom, the
            soundtrack kicks, the guns blaze -- and suddenly, Lara's dashing and
            leaping, somersaulting and diving, locked in dire combat with a
            giant killer robot. After a few minutes of these exertions, our girl
            literally pistol-whips the robot into submission, its limbs
            flailing, her face set in grim determination. And then it turns out
            that this contraption -- so gleaming, so vrooming and menacing -- is
            named Simon. And Simon has been programmed by Lara's employee, the
            computer-geek-boy Bryce (Noah Taylor). Indeed, this snazzy opening
            beat-down scene is part of her in-house training program, which she
            coolly undertakes in the lower floor of her estate mansion. How
            pro-mo is that? Lady Croft gets to play something like a character
            in her own life-size video game. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It
            turns out that she plays a lot of games, I suppose because she has
            nothing better to do, being so rich and well-educated and privileged
            in every conceivable way. She raids a few tombs, fights off
            mysterious intruders, and mows down a platoon of stone monkeys
            zapped to life by an ancient force. Observes one competitor, she
            does all this not for the money, but for the &quot;glory&quot;
            (apparently this is a good thing). But then, she can afford to take
            such an attitude, living in a huge mansion and being looked after by
            her devoted minions, Bryce (who lives in an Airstreamer on the
            estate grounds) and her kevlar-vested butler Hillary (Chris Barrie).
            Her leisure time is similarly high-energy: she spends it whipping
            about London streets on her <i>Dark Angel</i>-ish motorcycle,
            practicing her bungee-ballet, and tearing up whenever she visits a
            memorial on her estate that marks her father's disappearance way
            back in 1985. This lingering dedication to her dad jumpstarts the
            plot, such as it is, involving a clock that he's left hidden in the
            mansion for her, a secret key to some kind of universe-altering
            power, and a group of mean men called the Illuminati, who naturally
            want to locate said key and alter said universe. Their version of
            the plot is dull and takes a long time to be explained: they drone
            on about clocks ticking and planets aligning in a way that explains
            nothing so much as really, they just like to hear themselves talk. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Lara
            has other concerns. She wants to find out what happened to her
            father, Lord Richard Croft (played by Jolie's dad Jon Voight in a
            couple of flashbacks and then in a corny <i>Contact</i>-like
            father-daughter reunion scene, during which she... tears up). To
            achieve this goal, Lara faces off with Illuminati member and clearly
            feminized Manfred Powell (Iain Glen), who indulges in dialogue so
            bad that even Lara notices. (In a bizarre effort to scare her, he
            offers up this gem: &quot;My ignorance amuses me,&quot; which
            inspires the usually dour Lara and Bryce to spend a jolly minute
            imitating him and yucking it up.) Not that it matters, but Manfred
            is assisted by Alex West (Daniel Craig), Lara's tomb-raiding
            colleague who's sold out for -- horrors! -- money. It turns out that
            Lara's dad has in fact left her that secret key, which will recharge
            a sacred (broken) triangle, which in turn allows its possessor to
            manipulate time. And well, everyone wants in on the action. (The
            actual effect for this plunging in and out of time dimensions looks
            like a similar idea in one of <i>Star Trek's</i> original
            Kirkisodes, where the Enterprise crew leaps back and forth in time
            through a tunnel -- lucky for Lara, she does not meet Joan Collins).

            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Soon
            enough, everyone is looking for the pieces of this triangle and
            gallivanting around the globe, from the Angkor Wat tombs in Cambodia
            (where Lara takes time out to commune with monks) to the boonies in
            Siberia (where she communes with huskies -- the girl <b><i>is</i></b>
            incredible, what else can I say?). But really, who cares about such
            exotic and expensive-to-shoot backdrops? Let's be real: the main
            reason for the film's travelogue sections is to show off Lara's
            superswank wardrobe and her beauteous body: when in Siberia (which
            is actually Iceland), everyone else is bundled up in parkas and
            sweaters, but Lara's long coat flaps open to show her, um,
            tight-fitting T-shirt. Sure, she's able to leap off waterfalls like
            the Fugitive, outrun cascading explosions, decipher cryptic clues
            given to her by pretty little &quot;native&quot; children, and
            easily outsmart her male competitors at every turn. But catch those
            spandex pants! <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And
            so, it seems that the movie-Lara is not so different from the
            video-game-Lara after all. It's not so simple as sex appeal; shoot,
            Julia Roberts has that. Lara has something different. The simplistic
            reading of her appeal is, according to the film's press kit, that on
            the one hand, she's a straight boys' ideal object of lust, and on
            another, she's a straight girl's role model. Sounds good, but this
            formulation only gets it half right, omitting the shifting (and
            queer) viewer positions that drive both the game and the
            film-viewing. In fact, <i>Tomb Raider The Movie</i> doesn't fudge on
            this question, but comes right out loving the ambiguous sex and
            sexuality of Miss C. Consider the calculated flawlessness of the
            scene where Lara rides/steers a giant ramrod that's supposed to
            connect exactly with a tiny point on a magical mystical statue, in
            order to release the statue's long-stored amazing power. As the men
            around her watch in awe, Lara directs the point accurately and with
            the appropriate amount of force, so that the ramrod hits and boom!
            the little hole in the statue emits a gushing shower of well-lit
            &quot;power.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            spectacular image of androgynous, self-stimulating sexual excess
            speaks directly to the wonder and threat of Lara Croft, so adept at
            masculine and feminine wiles, and every wile in between. She can
            play all the parts: that's why you love her. The story is boring,
            the characters are lifeless, and the CGI effects are too often
            unimpressive (especially the climactic exploding-tomb scene, which
            is just dreary). It's not enough to make the film work, but Angelina
            Jolie as Lady Croft is a most special effect.</font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><o:p>
