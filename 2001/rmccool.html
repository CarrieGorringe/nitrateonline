            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>&quot;Liv Tyler IS Jewel!&quot;
            is how the ad copy for &quot;One Night at McCool's&quot; might have
            read if the movie were brought out 45 years ago. &quot;She's out for
            men -- ANY men -- and ANY MAN will do!...&quot;</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the film, Jewel is involved with
            not one, not two, but three men at the same time: Randy (Matt
            Dillon), a well-meaning bartender (at the titular establishment) who
            doesn't have very much but ends up being bilked out of everything he
            has; Carl (Paul Reiser), Randy's cousin, a lawyer and
            upper-middle-class family man who takes one look at Jewel and starts
            having all sorts of dirty little thoughts that have been stopped-up
            in his head start coming out; and Dehling (John Goodman), a widower
            and police detective who is investigating a murder that occurred on
            the same night that Randy first met Jewel, and who, when he sees
            Jewel for the first time, immediately decides that the young lady is
            a &quot;victim&quot; and is in need of his rescuing. Jewel, of
            course, is in reality the classic sort of femme-fatale who sizes men
            up at first glance and then manipulates them in whatever way she
            wants to.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The original screenplay, by the
            late Stan Seidel, has possibilities, such as the way it shows the
            escalating bing-bang-boom effect that one of the men's interactions
            with Jewel has on the second or third man the next time she meets up
            with either of them, and then back again. But the film that has been
            made of it, directed by Harald Zwart, never seems to be able to find
            the right shaping, pace, or mood. Everything seems flattened-out,
            and it ends up reaching for anything to get a laugh: a wizened
            barfly burping into the camera, sniggering depictions of Randy's
            second hand shop-style living arrangements, Paul Reiser shinnying
            down a street wearing full bondage gear, and a gun fight set to the
            Village People's recording of &quot;Y.M.C.A..” (This being a black
            comedy, though, the bullets are for real.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film is most fatally
            compromised by the miscasting of Liv Tyler, who is supposed to be
            playing the kind of red-hot mama who has steam gushing out of every
            pore and can cause men to fall at her feet just by walking past
            them. Tyler is a nice, appealing girl, but she is not Rita Hayworth
            or even the young Lana Turner (or even Elizabeth Shue careening her
            way, like a car with a split axle, through &quot;Palmetto&quot; a
            few years back).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">John Goodman, arguably one of the
            very best actors we've got today, brings a wonderful lovelorn
            quality to his role. And Reba McEntire, currently knocking 'em dead
            on Broadway in the revival of &quot;Annie Get Your Gun,” turns up
            as a psychiatrist to whom Reiser's character spins out his long tale
            of woe -- and she's a bit of a wow here, too, in a role which
            essentially requires her to do very little, but with which she
            nonetheless does a lot.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Michael Douglas (who also
            co-produced the film) appears as a sleeze to whom Matt Dillon's
            character confides his story to (in a bingo parlor -- the setting
            alone is supposed to provoke hilarity), and his function in the
            story isn't revealed until almost the very end. Once he swings into
            action, though, he swings right back out of it -- and you're again
            reminded of how a better director could've made something more
            satisfying out of this than what has ended up here.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
