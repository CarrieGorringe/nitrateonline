            doubt, there's something intriguing about seeing Jason Isaacs in a
            dress -- a little green sequined number -- given that his last U.S.
            movie outing was as the awful British colonel chasing down Mel
            Gibson in <i>The Patriot</i>. But delightful as it may be to see the
            ever-engaging Isaacs just so, it doesn't go nearly far enough to
            excuse sitting through the rest of <i>Sweet November</i>. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            problem is not that Isaacs isn't wonderful, because he is, as well
            as funny and sharp. The problem is that he's playing Chad, the Gay
            Neighbor character. Chad is carefully designed as a way to
            &quot;flesh out&quot; the irresistibly quirky and delectable Sara
            Deever (Charlize Theron). Silly me -- I had imagined that the Gay
            Neighbor was already <b><i>passé</i></b>. But here he comes again,
            a device most useful in movie romances (or even thrillers -- recall
            the Gay Neighbor in <i>Single White Female</i>), as support and
            offset for his zany gal pal, so that she looks positively wonderful
            next to him, open-minded and generous, yes, but also relatively
            conventional (that is, straight), properly attractive in her dresses
            and properly behaved compared to him. Then again, the Gay Neighbor
            may actually be the least clichéd element in this particular movie,
            which lifts from many sources, ranging from old Bette Davis movies
            to <i>Love Story</i>, where women are sacrificed so that their men
            might learn important life lessons. <o:p>

            <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Perhaps
            most unfortunately, <i>Sweet November</i> -- based on a Sandy Dennis
            movie of the same name -- is opening just months after last year's
            woeful <i>Autumn in New York</i>, because the two plots are very
            similar, and because <i>Autumn</i> was such a flat-out terrible
            movie. There are a few differences. In <i>Autumn</i>, Winona Ryder
            has no Gay Neighbor. And Sara doesn't make ugly hats. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Rather,
            Sara is some kind of professional animal person. She has a van with
            dogs painted on it, and I think she grooms pets, or walks them, or
            saves them from the street and finds them new homes. This is
            essentially her plan for Nelson Moss (Keanu Reeves), whom she meets
            when they're taking a test to renew their drivers' licenses. He
            tries to cheat off her, but she gets busted instead. Unable to drive
            her van and furious with him for being such a jerk, she nags Nelson
            until he agrees to give her a few rides around town for the month
            until she can take her test again. Why she decides to adopt and fix
            Nelson is unclear, except that he is so plainly in need... of
            something. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Nelson
            is an egomaniacal, money-obsessed advertising exec (sort of the same
            guy Nicolas Cage played in <i>The Family Man</i>), established in <i>Sweet
            November's</i> first few moments as a jerk of gargantuan
            proportions: rude, careless, and mean to his co-workers and his
            girlfriend. It doesn't take long before he's fired and dumped, turns
            of fortune that leave him vulnerable to Sara's charms. These include
            her quaint wardrobe (she wears scarves, big sweaters, little
            dresses, and clunky boots, like Drew Barrymore in <i>Mad Love</i>)
            and just-too-adorable game-playing (she blindfolds Nelson in her
            apartment and giggles when he falls over the furniture). That said,
            it's clear in that Hollywood way that her charms are primarily based
            on the fact that she is glamour girl Charlize Theron in thrift-store
            drag -- stunningly beautiful meets endearingly peculiar. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">One
            of Sara's enchanting idiosyncrasies is that she takes in lost men
            for a month each and transforms their lives (apparently, sex with
            her is amazing!). Nelson, she informs him, is &quot;November.&quot;
            Soon enough -- and quite ridiculously -- this grumpy guy falls in
            love with her and decides to change his life to be compatible with
            hers. At this point, the expected other shoe drops, and Sara informs
            Nelson that she can't marry him. You've seen this much in the
            trailer, where she's looking very pale, red-eyed, and ill as she
            says this, and thankfully, the advertising campaign has not been coy
            about the film's basis in tragedy. It appears that the central
            lesson to be learned by Nelson, before he can go on his way after a
            month of sex and eating ice cream with Sara, has to do with having
            respect for one another person's choices. Unfortunately, there are
            quite a few more clichéd moments to get through before that lesson
            is complete. Though director Pat O'Connor has revealed a light touch
            in the past (in 1995's <i>Circle of Friends</i>), this film is more
            on the order of 1997's <i>Inventing the Abbotts</i>, perhaps less
            unwieldy but equally predictable. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            order to sustain its fiction that a month of trysting with Sara
            Deever is heaven on earth, <i>Sweet November</i> must overlook that
            Sara's own choices actually do affect other people -- say, Chad, who
            is as painfully loyal as can be -- in order to make you feel all
            right that these choices are all about Nelson's life education. And
            as we know all too well, there's nothing like a dying girlfriend to
            teach men a thing or two about priorities. One sign of Nelson's
            learning curve is that he decides to quit hanging out with his
            colleague and supposed best friend, Vince (<i>Ally McBeal's</i> Greg
            Germann, typecast as a sniveling weasel-guy), and tells a super-rich
            snoot/potential new employer (Frank Langella, only wasting his time
            in one scene) that he &quot;doesn't like&quot; him. Nelson's moment
            of transformation is as corny as they come. He tells off Mr. Snoot,
            lays down his napkin, and strides valiantly from the upscale
            restaurant: outside, the camera looks up at him, so that he looks
            tall and free and grand! Oh, hoorah. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">His
            decision to dedicate himself to a happy, loving life with Sara
            reflects all the usual solidly &quot;decent&quot; values -- he<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The fact that Nelson can only make such a decision because he
            is wealthy enough to not have to work for a while -- a long while --
            is only incidental. He's a better man because of his love for this
            quirky girl, who is, it turns out, just a means to that end. <o:p>
