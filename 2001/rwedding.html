            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 26 January
            2001</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>I found myself thoroughly
            enjoying the serene quality of the romantic scenes involving
            Jennifer Lopez and Matthew McConaughey in <i>The Wedding Planner</i>.
            McConaughey shows an easy, assured, and even beautifully felt
            quality in this picture that I have not seen him display in the
            past, while there's a warm, graceful quality to Lopez's work that is
            most welcome after the dour, intimidated-looking performance she
            gave in the thoroughly grotesque <i>The Cell</i>, where she was
            pursued or menaced during one awful-looking scene after another by<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>polymorphously perverse creatures whom you either couldn't
            see very well or didn't feel like you really wanted to have a good
            look at.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Here, Lopez plays Mary, who designs
            and adroitly organizes and coordinates even the most fiendishly
            complicated formal wedding ceremonies while, of course, not having a
            man of her own in her life. She meets Steve (played by McConaughey),
            a pediatrician, and they seem to have the right chemistry together.
            Then she meets the bride, Fran (Bridgette Wilson-Sampras), for whom
            Mary has arranged to create a forthcoming wedding, and Fran's fiancé<span style="mso-bidi-font-weight:bold;mso-bidi-font-style:italic">
            -- </span>Steve. Complications ensue.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Or, they're supposed to. The film
            leaves absolutely no doubt from the beginning that Mary and Steve
            will somehow end up together in the end. The problem is that there's
            not very much mystery as to how they will do so. The film is set up
            on a handful of very predictable plot points with not much of
            anything in between, so the filmmakers vamp madly to try to,
            unsuccessfully, take up the slack. There is Massimo, who is played
            by Justin Chambers with a comic Italian accent that is not only
            tiresome to listen to but is supposed to clue us in to the fact that
            he's all wrong for Mary, yet he is continually flung at her by
            well-meaning family and friends in an attempt to match her up. At
            one point, contrivances send Mary galloping off through the Napa,
            California countryside on a runaway horse, only to be rescued by
            Steve; when he brings her back, in what looks like a compromising
            position on Steve's saddle, the other characters just sit there
            staring dumbly into space. (Imagine what Billy Wilder would have
            done with a scene like this: &quot;Saddle-sore, my dear?&quot;) On
            several occasions, Fran repeatedly warns her mother that she will
            not be allowed to sing at her wedding: this is comic only because
            Fran's mother is played by Joanne Gleason, who's not only an
            excellent actress but was justly celebrated for her performance
            on-Broadway in Stephen Sondheim's musical <i>Into the Woods</i>.
            (Gleason is just barely in the movie, as it now stands, and there
            are also tiny, tiny appearances by Kevin Pollak and Kathy Najimy, in
            roles that look like they might have been much longer during an
            earlier incarnation.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Then there is the scene involving
            Krazy-Glue and a gag with a statue that wasn't funny when it was
            used fifteen years ago in <i>The Goonies</i>. One of the endearing
            qualities of Lopez's character is that she is prepared for any
            occasion, whether it's mending things with glue or rectifying
            mishaps that are caused by it. I was mostly glad that Lopez wasn't
            being chased by any serpent-haired demons while watching her gently
            free Matthew McConaughey's hand from the piece of statuary to which
            it had become affixed.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
