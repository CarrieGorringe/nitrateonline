            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>No Man's Land</i> opens with
            a shot of a Bosnian relief patrol trying to break through the
            stalemate of trench warfare though a nighttime attack on a Serbian
            hilltop position. The attack fails and the survivors retreat to the
            trench. When two Serbian soldiers enter the trench in order to do a
            recon mission, gunfight breaks out. After the gunfire has stopped,
            all that remains is one wounded Serbian soldier, and two wounded
            Bosnians, one of whom is trapped in a horrendous, and seemingly
            insurmountable, situation. The Bosnian soldier, Ciki (Branko Djuri),
            and the Serbian soldier, Nino (Rene Bitorajac), alternate between
            gaining an advantage over the other and exchanging empathy along
            with cigarettes. During the uneasy course of their trench-based détente,
            a French sergeant (Georges Siatidis) who is attached to a United
            Nations peacekeeping detail, takes the initiative and tries to halt
            the rapidly degrading conditions that are unfolding in the trench,
            finding his way blocked at every turn by both the military and UN
            bureaucracy. Assisting the sergeant is a Christiane Amanpour wannabe
            (Katrin Cartlidge) who at first seems more interested in feeding
            scoops into the insatiable maw of her twenty-four-hour news network
            than in providing in humanitarian assistance. The head of the UN
            peacekeeping forces, a presumably updated, but no less intolerable,
            version of Colonel Blimp (Simon Callow) seems more interested in
            playing all types of games with his secretary than in solving this
            particular crisis. While on the telephone with the officer, the
            sergeant is told that he must obtain approval from some of his
            superior officers before talking to the General, and this may take
            some time; several of them are at a conference in Geneva on media
            relations! Playing to the media, rather than discovering and
            controlling the root causes of the problem, is perceived by those at
            the top to be the best way to proceed; it's certainly less bloody
            and controversial -- or is it? As the UN peacekeeping bureaucracy is
            prodded and threatened into doing something, the situation in the
            trench swings wildly from near-destruction to uneasy camaraderie and
            back again.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Before directing <i>No Man's Land</i>,
            director Danis Tanovic worked as a frontline cameraman in the
            Bosnian army, and the difference between the look of <i>No Man's
            Land</i>, and the typical Hollywood version of war (Steven
            Spielberg's recreation of the events at Normandy in <i>Saving
            Private Ryan</i> being the most remarkable exception to date) is
            immediately apparent . Like the great photographers of World War Two
            -- such as Robert Capa and Abe Rosenthal -- Tanovic and his
            cinematographer, Walther Vanden Ende, freeze the images of war into
            cold relief. The audience is never allowed to avoid the point that
            those images have been bought with gallons of blood (even in
            Rosenthal's famous picture of the American flag being raised on
            Mount Suribashi after the miserable battle to regain Iwo Jima, the
            image of heroism contains both strength and weariness, reaction and
            action).</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">No Man's Land </font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">also
            incorporates, as expected, the now calcified, if accurate,
            observation that war is an insane act, usually undertaken at the
            first act of provocation by politicians who are greedy, insecure,
            sadistic, ideologically fanatical, or all of the above, but takes
            the argument into a more detailed, hence psychologically tidy,
            realm. On the surface, <i>No Man's Land</i> is to the war in the
            Balkans what Remarque's book, <i>All Quiet on the Western Front</i>,
            and Kubrick's film, <i>Paths of Glory</i>, were to the depiction of
            World War I: a scathing indictment of the destruction of life by
            thoughtless generals, and of bureaucratic corruption. But Tanovic is
            also interested in the microcosm of war and how it is instigated on
            an individual level, when tribal identity morphs into chauvinism and
            when multiplied within a given populace, is as much to blame for
            warmongering as the inflammatory rhetoric of any number of
            politicians and generals. Remarque's book, and Lewis Milestone's
            1930 adaptation of it, use a right-wing schoolteacher as a singular
            symbolic representation of this mindset, but Tanovic's recasting of
            this symbolism - allowing the same words of hate to pour forth from
            both sides on a wider scale- makes the hatred appear less an
            exception than a rule; no one is an innocent here. It's hardly an
            original observation on the state of human psychology in the midst
            of combat, but <i>No Man's Land</i> cuts through any sense of
            redundancy by coating a traditional anti-war narrative framework
            with sardonic humor and an outcome that is kept in flux until the
            final frame. As one soldier explains to the other the difference
            between a wartime optimist and a wartime pessimist, the explanation
            at first might seem trite; the setting, and the circumstances under
            which it is spoken, are not at enough of a historical distance for
            comfort. The twentieth century has seen one too many &quot;wars to
            end all wars,&quot; and any illusions of the potential for human
            perfectibility can't be rectified by filtering it through the morass
            of outrage and pity. To paraphrase eighteen-century English
            politician David Burke, the heedless and naïve pursuit of a
            well-meaning, &quot;better&quot; way to conduct political life does
            not automatically lead to liberty; rather, the refusal to
            contemplate possible outcomes of attempting to create utopias might
            just lead to greater evils than the ones just eradicated.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The source of Tanovic's attitude,
            and, consequently, the film's attitude toward war, is immediately
            traceable to the often sad conditions that have been central to the
            development of Central European history. Always cursed by geography,
            a problem which has been abetted by totalitarian and/or incompetent
            leadership, Poland, Hungary, et al. have all too frequently been the
            battleground and/or plaything of whatever set of conquerors have
            been on the march at any given time; consequently, attitudes towards
            war and oppression in these countries are reflected in the countries
            that make up that region as a blend of anger, black humor and
            detachment -- a useful mentality for surviving the inevitable. There
            is no potential for optimism while living in this state of ironic
            flux. In <i>No Man's Land</i>, the pitiless nature of truth must win
            out if humanity is to conquer its own worst tendencies.</font></o:p>
