            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In novelist Edith Wharton’s
            world of upper class New Yorkers, an invitation to dinner is as
            potentially dangerous as stepping into a pit of quicksand. The
            latter is actually preferable because it is quicker and painless.
            People who get out of line with the social order in her books are
            just as doomed as mobsters who flaunt the authority of a don.
            Wharton’s villains in many ways seem even more formidable because
            the psychological and economic tools they use can break a person’s
            spirit and resolve just as effectively as a gangster’s bullet.
            With this in mind, it’s no wonder wiseguy specialist Martin
            Scorsese adapted Wharton’s <i>The Age of Innocence</i>.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Unlike Scorsese, Liverpool-born
            writer-director Terrance Davies is better known for more sedate fare
            like <i>The Neon Bible</i>. Nonetheless, his adaptation of
            Wharton’s <i>The House of Mirth</i> is visually opulent with a
            strong hint of menace. Davies understands Wharton’s tricky themes.
            Nonetheless, he puts himself in a position as delicate as that of
            his heroine. He is only partially successful at making a gripping
            film about cold, despicable people.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Lily Bart (Gillian Anderson) has a
            clear eye for the expectations of 1905 New York society and would
            like nothing to do with them. Nonetheless, she has been raised in a
            refined manner but doesn’t have the financial resources to keep
            herself afloat. At the mercy of her parsimonious aunt and a society
            that frowns on women working, Lily has little choice but to
            eventually find a suitably wealthy husband.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Understandably, she finds the task
            as odious as it is essential. Her heart is drawn toward the defiant
            Lawrence Selden (Eric Stoltz). Selden doesn’t mind having to work
            for a living (as a lawyer) and is willing to sneak off with her for
            clandestine meetings. Still, he’s not what her benefactors would
            condone. She makes advances toward an amiable, but hopelessly dull
            fellow named Percy Gryce (Pearce Quigley) whose fortunes could
            settle her gambling debts. Sadly, both seem to instinctively sense
            the match would be phony. Matters are not helped when the seemingly
            proper, but completely devious Bertha Dorset (a delightfully
            venomous, if underutilized Laura Linney) meddles into Lily’s
            plans.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Lily is understandably upset by
            Bertha’s actions and the fact that her extramarital affairs and
            other affronts are tolerated. To Lily’s relief, she discovers that
            Bertha has not been as discreet with her offenses as thought. Lilly
            manages to get her hands on a series of letters where Bertha flatly
            admits to running into another man’s arms because she is bored
            with her husband. Such ammunition could help Lily restore her
            reputation when her finances start to shrivel and when an
            “investment” brokered by a less than honest stock dealer named
            Gus Trainer (an effective, if cartoonish Dan Ackroyd) turns out to
            be something more sinister. As she starts having to work a series of
            jobs for which she has no aptitude (including making hats), Lily
            refuses to make the letters public. She finds the task as revolting
            as it is tempting, and she has no desire to hurt the recipient of
            those compromising epistles, Lawrence Selden.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The often-gorgeous settings in the
            film are both an asset and a hindrance. Bulldozers conquered the New
            York described in the book a long time ago. Contemporary Glasgow
            proves an adequate substitute, but the production sometimes seems
            homogenously pretty. We have to get a stronger sense of class
            differences to make Lily’s decent believable. Other characters
            declare her lodgings squalid, but we never see anything to match the
            description. Davies also seems to linger on the surroundings a bit
            too long. There’s a long sequence in the middle where the camera
            pans around a room where the objects have cloths covering them,
            indicating the residents plan on being gone for some time. After a
            few seconds little more can be gained from the shots, but yet they
            drag on.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To be fair, Davies does coax
            consistently solid turns from his cast, some of whom aren’t known
            for period dramas. Anyone who has seen Anderson in <i>Playing by
            Heart</i> or <i>The Mighty</i> knows that Agent Scully on <i>The
            X-Files</i> is hardly the limit of her talents. While the quality of
            her performance is hardly surprising, it is still impressive and is
            one element that helps prevent the <i>The House of Mirth</i> from
            becoming a stiff literature lesson. Toward the end of the film, she
            gives Lily a firm backbone that makes her gloomy end hit home. She
            chastises the other performers with a firm sense of authority, and
            one begins to root for her even if her cause is clearly doomed.
            Because she has a sense of propriety that the other characters in
            the film can only claim to have, she elicits as much admiration as
            sympathy.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thanks to Anderson, <i>The House of
            Mirth</i> comes close to capturing Wharton’s keen eye for
            psychological cruelty and other evils, but one still wonders if her
            vision is difficult, if not impossible, to capture on screen.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="5"></o:p>
