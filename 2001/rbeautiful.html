            (Susan Lynch) is living with a psycho. That much is clear in the
            first few minutes of Bill Eagles' <i>Beautiful Creatures</i>. The
            film opens with the camera looking out on a set of railroad tracks,
            as if you're speeding along on a train, while Susan and her
            boyfriend Tony (Iain Glen), coo at one another off-screen. &quot;I
            love you Dorothy,&quot; he murmurs, &quot;you totally gorgeous
            creature.&quot; She responds in kind, lovey-dovey and sweet. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Suddenly,
            while you're still watching the train tracks ahead of you, the
            conversation turns. Now Tony's angry that Dorothy has misplaced his
            golf clubs -- that's right, his golf clubs. She defends herself,
            claiming she hasn't touched them. He's increasingly ballistic. And
            then the railroad tracks cut to a second image, also in motion:
            Dorothy is rushing through the train cars, running from her raging
            lover, who's shoving objects and people out of his way in his rush
            to catch her. Finally, she finds a place to hide, a bathroom. He
            storms outside the door, slams a train conductor in the face. She
            cowers inside the cramped compartment, waiting until the train stops
            and she can no longer hear him outside. She steps out, apologizes to
            the recovering conductor, and heads on her way. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Okay,
            you can see that this guy is unpredictably and brutally violent. And
            so you have to ask, what is she doing with him? <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            movie never comes up with an adequate answer to this question. In
            fact, it refuses to give you much of anything that's conventionally
            logical or emotionally satisfying, instead delivering crazy
            coincidences, characters making unbelievably bad decisions, and
            preposterous plot devices. You soon learn that Tony's not only a
            straight-up pig, but also a junkie. he abuses Dorothy and her loyal,
            not very bright dog Pluto (played by Storm) -- and you <b><i>know</i></b>
            that abusing a dog always gets an audience's sympathy. To its
            credit, <i>Beautiful Creatures</i> takes a refreshingly
            non-psychobabbly approach to Dorothy's predicament; it doesn't
            contemplate the hows and whys, but rather presents it as a currently
            appalling situation that has somehow sneaked up on her. Though
            bright and resourceful, she's (temporarily) stuck in a wholly
            recognizable situation (whenever women are abused, someone asks why
            they don't leave, as if the solution is so simple). Dorothy needs a
            push. The film provides her with a big one. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">That
            push's name is Petula (Rachel Weisz), a bleached blond
            Marilyn-Monroe-look-alike. After rescuing Pluto from her apartment
            (where Tony has string him up and doused him with red paint,
            apparently to give her a terrible scare), Dorothy happens on an
            alley where she sees Petula being throttled by her own ineptly
            gangsterish boyfriend, Brian (Tom Mannion). Coming off her own
            prodigiously bad situation, Dorothy doesn't think twice, but grabs a
            bit of nearby scaffolding and whomps Brian on the head, knocking him
            cold. Since neither of the women can drive Brian's car, they
            literally drag him down the street to Dorothy's apartment, where he
            goes into convulsions and dies on the bathroom floor, eyes all
            bugged out and bloody-rimmed. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            the face of such disaster, Petula and Dorothy remain composed. They
            finish the haircut that Dorothy has been giving to Petula, then plan
            how to dispose of the body and leave town together. The plan
            includes Petula going back to work the next day, where she is
            employed by Brian's imperious, extra-nasty older brother Ronnie
            (Maurice Roeves), and perhaps more to the point, escaping detection
            by the Detective Inspector Hepburn (Alex Norton), corrupt and smug
            as they come. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There
            are lots of things wrong with <i>Beautiful Creatures.</i> Its humor
            is dark and gruesome, its dialogue awkward and silly, and its male
            characters idiotic. Wearing a rather inflammatory sort of
            &quot;feminism&quot; on its sleeve, it's not a &quot;good&quot;
            movie in the ordinary sense, and is frankly more annoying than
            thought-provoking. But in that sense, it's not unlike many of the
            dick-obsessed movies that precede and obviously motivate it, say, <i>Trainspotting</i>,
            <i>Fight Club</i>, <i>Lock, Stock &amp; Two Smoking Barrels</i>, or <i>Snatch</i>.
            But quite unlike those movies, Eagles's does not grant an inch of
            pleasure in its violence. Whether committed by men or women (or even
            the dog), the film's many acts of dismemberment, stabbing, shooting,
            chewing, and beating are repulsive.<o:p>

            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            is also dissimilar to another film to which I've heard it compared:
            it is not a &quot;Scottish <i>Thelma &amp; Louise</i>.&quot; This
            promo-soundbite doesn't do justice to the ambitious, if not exactly
            realized, aspirations of <i>Beautiful Creatures</i>. For one thing,
            it's less glossy and celebratory than Ridley Scott's anthemic movie,
            and for another, there's no road trip in it. And really, the women's
            lack of mobility is crucial here. Not only are Dorothy and Petula
            penniless (and so can't even buy bus tickets) and unable to drive
            (they eventually learn by trial and error on a stick shift, in
            scenes depicting the usual fits and starts), but, it turns out,
            Brian has hidden Petula's passport. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></span></font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">To
            be sure, such symbolism is heavy-handed, but it does make clear what
            <i>Beautiful Creatures</i> is and is not. It's not an action movie,
            it's not about redemption or revenge, and it's not even very
            pleasant to watch. It is, however, a heady, if somewhat harsh and
            narrowly focused, deconstruction of all those popular boy movies
            that have their cake and eat it too, that decry violence and
            misogyny but also encourage viewers to get off on them. <i>Beautiful
            Creatures</i> reflects, to borrow from Madonna's recent single, what
            it feels like for a girl and then some.</font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><u></o:p>
