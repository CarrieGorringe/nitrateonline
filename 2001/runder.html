            catastrophe is the natural human environment. We find ourselves
            attacked by unforeseen forces come to harm us, even though we are
            innocent of any wrongdoing.&quot; With these ominous words, Henry
            Hearst (Gene Hackman) ends a speech he's been making for a room full
            of people in tuxedos and gowns. He's a well-known man-about-town,
            doing his bit to solicit relief funds for victims of Hurricane Lucy,
            which has just blown through Puerto Rico... but there's something
            else afoot. For all his philanthropic grandeur, Henry is &quot;under
            suspicion.&quot; And at this particular moment, he's under he
            watchful eye of his old acquaintance and sometime friend, Police
            Captain Victor Benezet (Morgan Freeman). The camera angles are low,
            the sound of forks tinging glasses fades out, and -- while Victor's
            eyes hold fast on their target -- Henry pulls back, until he's out
            of focus and artfully spooky. Catastrophe, yes. We can feel it
            coming. Even though we are innocent of any wrongdoing.</b> <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><i><font size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Under<b>
            </b>Suspicion</span></font></span></font></i><font size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
            is peppered with such overwrought moments. But such occasional
            melodrama hardly explains why the film's theatrical release schedule
            was so abruptly halted last year, after it had opened in only a few
            theaters, or why it has suddenly been relegated -- as of this past
            Tuesday (January 2) -- to what is essentially a straight-to-video
            status. Such a fate is usually reserved films made by unknowns, that
            never found distribution deals, or that feature girls in panties
            being chased by men in ski masks (though to be fair, this last also
            shows up in box office winners). Clearly, <i>Under Suspicion</i>
            does not fit any of these categories, as it stars and was
            executive-produced by heavy-hitters Freeman and Hackman, directed by
            Stephen Hopkins (<i>Lost in Space</i>, <i>The Ghost and the Darkness</i>),
            and was indeed picked up by Lions Gate for distribution. It's hard
            to tell exactly what happened, why the film is now at Blockbuster
            rather than the multiplex or even the art house theater, though we
            can surmise it has to do with money. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></span></font></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">First,
            we might examine the plot for signs of terribleness. But the basic
            storyline actually looks fine, even if it is a bit artificial in a
            &quot;hothouse&quot; way, concerning rich U.S. citizens in an island
            setting -- granted, it's Puerto Rico, technically still the U.S.,
            but it's set up here to look all exotic and anxiety-making. The film
            takes place during a carnival, which means that though it's intently
            focused on an extended conversation between Henry and Victor, it
            includes repeated insert shots of celebratory street musicians in
            poofy-sleeved shorts and people dancing in bright colors. Henry is a
            super-rich scuzball with a young-but-disenchanted trophy wife,
            Chantel (Monica Bellucci, also currently appearing in Tornatore's <i>Malena</i>).
            He's bitter, and we'll find out why; he calls her &quot;a beautiful
            woman who moves through life unchallenged,&quot; which suggests that
            she'll run into some challenges before the film is over. The film
            opens in their posh home, where a long hallway -- filmed so that it
            looks really, <b><i>really</i></b> long -- separates husband and
            wife, as he observes and then approaches her. She's so lovely, so
            untouchable, as she checks herself in the mirror in her fine black
            gown. They're about to embark on a big night out, but when he tries
            to nuzzle her neck, she puts him off. Uh-oh. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Not
            much else happens before the plot begins to thicken, after a
            fashion. On his way to the soiree, Henry is picked up by his old
            friend Victor, who takes him down to the cop station for &quot;a few
            questions.&quot; As those of us who watch cop movies know, this
            means a lot of questions, but Henry is arrogant enough at first to
            imagine that he'll be cut loose in minutes. Well, these minutes drag
            on. And on. Henry starts to chafe. He says mean things to Victor's
            young cohort, Felix Owens (Thomas Jane, last seen battling sharks
            with LL Cool J in <i>Deep Blue Sea</i>), calling him &quot;Opie,&quot;
            until the kid threatens to throw punches. It would seem that the
            tension is rising. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At
            this point, it may be useful to say a little about that thickening
            plot, which unfolds in the form of the conversation between Victor
            and Henry, with occasional interjections from Felix. (This structure
            comes straight from <i>Under Suspicion's</i> source, Claude Miller's
            <i>Garde A' Vue</i>, which Hackman saw back in 1981, and has been
            wanting to remake ever since. Freeman's company, Revelations
            Entertainment, financed the film.) Recently, as it happens, Henry
            found a dead girl in the park, while he was jogging. He alerted the
            police, but now they're thinking that he may have been the murderer
            -- of this girl and one who turned up dead previously. The cops
            inform Henry that they believe the girl's body has been posed, as if
            for a picture. Hey! Henry's hobby is photography! And so now the
            cops come at him with their suspicions, putting together all kinds
            of clues to form a story that -- judging from the film's visual
            evidence, anyway -- is true. Sort of. Then again, maybe not. Accused
            of raping and killing this sweet young girl in her soccer uniform,
            Henry is understandably upset. So is Victor. He presses further --
            the cops have learned that Henry hasn't slept with Chantel in two
            years, that he goes to the other side of the tracks to buy time with
            bleached-blond, very young-looking prostitutes. (Or, as Victor puts
            it, &quot;I'm talking about street-hookers, needle-users,
            crack-heads! Not high class call girls, curb-crawlers, for God's
            sake!&quot;) As Victor relates these apparent facts, Henry blanches
            for a moment, and then the film cuts to a shot of him, his face
            sweaty, engaged in mid-from-the-rear thrust with this prostitute.
            Victor's comment: &quot;Why here, like this? In the dirt?&quot; My
            comment: Icky. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still,
            it's not entirely clear what's going on. Interestingly, Victor
            appears in these flashbacks -- or are they imaginary scenes? --
            lurking in corners or emerging from shadows, prompting Henry to
            answer questions while he's scuttling about on the street, in back
            rooms, or amid the trees where the dead body has been found. All
            this intrusiveness breaks up Henry's narrative -- or is it Victor's?
            -- and does encourage you to think some about how the story is being
            told, by whom, and for whose benefit. There's not much in this film
            that's subtle, but it does actually have something thoughtful to say
            about the ways that we perceive and assume truth, or the ways we
            might be convinced of some untruth because of our own anxieties.
            What you see can be -- and usually is -- deceiving.<o:p>

            <p><i><font size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Under
            Suspicion</span></font></span></font></i><font size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
            stresses this point in numerous ways, with two-way mirror shots,
            videotaped interview scenes, and the repeated exchange of menacing
            glances. While Henry is visibly coming undone -- literally, Felix
            pulls off his toupe during one brief, rather physical altercation --
            Victor will have a lesson to learn as well, because, well, he thinks
            he knows what's going on. It's not hard to guess that his
            presumptive manner will be a problem, especially when you hear what
            he has to say. Victor prides himself on being an excellent reader of
            appearances, and always right; as he tells Henry, he gives away that
            he's lying by the way he directs his eyes, &quot;turned down and to
            the left,&quot; or again, &quot;That old carotid artery's pumping
            like gangbusters!&quot; (It may seem that Victor's a tad excitable,
            but he has his reasons, as revealed by Henry's provocations -- the
            straight-up cop has had two failed marriages, and feels more than a
            little badly about this.) Suspicions and accusations fly back and
            forth during Henry and Victor's verbal sparring, and the movie
            suggests that guilt -- for both of them -- has more to do with
            appearances and self-doubts than with actual events or culpability
            for same. Through all this, Hackman and Freeman give assured and
            compelling performances, though the revelatory finale is predictably
            catastrophic. But if the film's plot-puzzles end up being a little
            less than mysterious, I still haven't come up with a completely
            satisfying reason for the film's strange trajectory to video.</span></font></span></font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
