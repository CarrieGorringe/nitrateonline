            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The opening sequence of Jonnie
            To and Wai Ka Fai's latest film, <i>Full Time Killer</i>, is a
            classic set-piece for establishing action: a lean young man, clad in
            slick black leather, trench coat swirling around him, enters a train
            station, selects a target, coolly lifts his revolver, kills the
            victim, turns around and makes his getaway in a swift but relaxed
            manner, indifferent to the fact that he hasn't even bothered to
            conceal his identity. Tok (Andy Lau), is a hit man on the rise,
            renowned for his reckless and extravagant gestures (see above), all
            of which are borrowed liberally from his favorite action films. His
            other obsession revolves around O (Takashi Sorimachi), a hit man
            whose retiring nature are entirely at odds with his profession; his
            main interest is collecting Snoopy figurines from each of the
            countries that he has &quot;visited.&quot; O is at the top of his
            game, the one with the highest fees, and Tok is eager to depose him
            as soon as possible, although his motivations may not be entirely
            financial. There's also an Interpol Police Inspector (Simon Yam),
            who wants to arrest both of them. A showdown between Tok and O is
            inevitable, after one of them discovers the common link between them
            that the other has known from the first frame.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Directors To and Wai (the latter
            also co-wrote the screenplay), borrow liberally from the common
            elements between American gangster and western films, as do many
            Hong Kong filmmakers. There are countless films that revolve around
            the concept of the established gunfighter, tired of living up to his
            professional reputation, but who must face a young upstart who won't
            allow him to walk away (the most typical being Henry King's 1951
            classic, <i>The Gunfighter</i>, in which Gregory Peck is endlessly
            harassed by Stephen MacNally). Yet, Killer also addresses the
            contemporary issues now influencing organized crime in Hong Kong.
            The film's title is the first clue that not all is as it used to be;
            like the Italian Mafia's loss of influence and power to their
            Russian counterparts, the old-style Hong Kong gangsters and their
            codes of honor have been overthrown by more ambitious and ruthless
            types, such as the Chinese Triads, who specialize in greater and
            more indiscriminate forms of violence. O and Tok are the obvious
            symbolic stand-ins for this shift, and they, like other workers,
            have now fallen prey to the mob equivalent of
            &quot;restructuring&quot;(without the severance pay). There is no
            sense of loyalty or identity, and no protection, however limited it
            might have been in the past; they have become contractors in both
            the definition of their employment and the conditions under which
            they work. The sequences of exquisitely choreographed violence in <i>Full
            Time Killer</i> cannot even compare to the level of sadism in <i>Ichi
            the Killer</i>; the staccato-like editing style, when coupled with
            the insouciant slinging around of black witticisms by the
            protagonists (antagonists?) renders the violence more cartoon-like
            in sensibility; just like Wile E. Coyote, the two protagonists will
            get up again to undergo more madness in the next scene. The
            directors keep this madness going until the very last minute, until
            a pull-all-the-stops-out finale caps this funny, intentional and
            otherwise, &quot;Chop Socky&quot; film.</font></p>
