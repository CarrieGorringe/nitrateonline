            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Playwright/Director David Mamet
            (<i>State and Main</i>) has now returned to familiar genre
            territory, namely, the aging master thief sent out to make One Last
            Score before flying (or, in this case, sailing) off to a
            well-deserved retirement in the Tropics, well under the radar of law
            enforcement. In <i>Heist</i>, Joe Moore (Gene Hackman) and his
            beautiful young wife, Fran (Rebecca Pidgeon), have just pulled off a
            major robbery and are ready to collect their share and sail off. Not
            so fast, says their slimy fence, Bergman (Danny De Vito), you have
            to do one more job for me, and include my dimwitted nephew, Jimmy
            Silk (Sam Rockwell), in your team. Provided everything goes well,
            I'll give you your share from both jobs and everyone can sail into
            their respective sunsets. No cooperation, no shares. Joe's longtime
            cohorts, Bobby Blaine (Delroy Lindo) and Pinky Pincus (Ricky Jay)
            think this comes under the heading of A Really Bad Idea, but, out of
            loyalty (not to mention a lack of choice), they stick by Joe. The
            plan involves the hijacking a plane and stealing the gold while the
            plane is still on the runway, a relatively simple situation for
            criminals with their skill level. As usual in these cases, however
            the loveliness of theory is intersected by the ugliness of
            reality…How many unpredictable forces and incidents might lead to
            failure?</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mamet, who directed and wrote the
            screenplay, keeps everything moving briskly. His pacing is
            immaculate: strong action sequences followed by The problems lie in
            his dialogue, which, despite its trenchant analysis, always seems
            somewhat forced and excessively arch; it's infinitely quotable, but
            somewhat self-consciously so (when asked what makes the world go
            around, Joe replies, in typical Mamet fashion, &quot;Love…love of
            gold is what makes the world go around.&quot;). The acting is so
            flawless that the actors seem to just melt seamlessly into their
            roles. Most notably, Pidgeon (a.k.a. Mrs. Mamet) is more relaxed and
            sexy than she has been in previous roles with her Jean Seberg look
            (no doubt a resemblance deliberately chosen by her husband to
            emphasize her character's amoral streak). She is all subtly icy
            insouciance and, despite her perky appearance, a convincing <b><i>noir</i></b>-ish
            femme fatale; she makes you believe that she could sell anyone for a
            nickel. <i>Heist</i>, on the other hand, is not an entertainment
            sellout.</font><o:p>
