            review by <a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>, 28 September
            2001</i></font>
            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Way back in 1989, Arye Gross 
            popped into my cinematic vision in the dreadful dramedy <i>The 
            Experts</i>, opposite John Travolta and his future wife Kelly 
            Preston. Unforgettably bad, regretfully, because here it is, back in 
            my mind and in the first sentence of this review. Travolta and 
            Preston have married and made some horrible films (I walked out on
            <i>Battlefield Earth</i>. Why didn't you?). As for Gross, well he's 
            been below my radar screen ever since, working his way from 
            innocuous comedies (<i>Coupe de Ville</i>, <i>Shaking the Tree</i>) 
            to low grade sex spoofs (<i>Hexed</i>), through more than 30 other 
            features. But the former comic sidekick has really grown up with <i>
            Big Eden</i>, a funny coming-of-age romantic romp set in the Montana 
            timberwoods, a thousand miles from nowhere. Gross's hair may be 
            thinning and there's his uncanny resemblance to Paul Reubens, but he 
            shines in this quaint, gay reshaping of the <i>Northern Exposure</i> 
            sensibilities, a sure fire audience pleaser.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Unless you're homophobic. In 
            which case I don't ever want you to read my reviews again. Shame on 
            you! Oops, let me get back on track. Sorry, but some things just 
            tick me off.</i></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Director-screenwriter Thomas 
            Bezucha's small but powerfully vibrant debut feature comes after a 
            stint as a creative service director in New York. He fashioned his 
            semi-pseudo-autobiographical fable as a yearning for &quot;what you 
            want,&quot; and not what you know, which presumably would parallel his 
            fantasy to toss his corporate life &quot;to teach art in an elementary 
            school in mountains.&quot; His friends responded that he was crazy. &quot;Are 
            you nuts? You're gay! You can't move to Montana.&quot; Well, thankfully, 
            he did, if only for a month in the fall of 1999, to shoot his film. 
            While he didn't stay, he did capture the essence of that special 
            Midwestern small town camaraderie, chock full of amusing, lovable 
            characters (a great supporting cast), set amid the landscape of a 
            Shakespearian comedy of errors. What's not to love in the nooks and 
            crannies of the ice-capped mountains, luscious evergreens, and 
            pristine lakes (all wonderfully captured by cinematographer Rob 
            Sweeney) of Big Eden, Montana, sister city to Cicely, Alaska.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Big Eden </i>stars Gross as 
            modest Henry Hart, a New York artist on the cusp of stardom. On the 
            eve of <i>Navigations</i>, an important gallery event showcasing his 
            work, he instead plots a course back home to his fictional homestead 
            to care for his grandfather Sam (George Coe), who has just suffered 
            a debilitating stroke. The trip west is just as much an escape from 
            impeding celebrity and his hectic Big Apple lifestyle as it is for 
            Henry (&quot;cute, available, and unattached&quot;) to step back, relax, and 
            perhaps enjoy a relationship he's been dreaming of for 18 years. A 
            handful of years in therapy apparently have been unsuccessful in 
            exorcising the belief that there is more than best friendship 
            waiting between him and his high school buddy Dean Stewart (Tim 
            DeKay), who succumbed to marriage, fatherhood (two boys), and his 
            own disillusionment. Recently divorced, his timely availability 
            brings Henry hope that love will blossom among the pines. Yet 
            whatever their bond holds, the two men can't seem to rise above 
            their fleeting, frustrating moments of sexual intimacy together. 
            Dean just isn't gay, despite his best attempts.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Which proves beneficial in the long 
            run, but frustrating in the early goings, for Pike Dexter (Eric 
            Schweig) the lumbering, long-haired Native American who runs the 
            local general store. He can't expose his feelings for Henry for fear 
            of disrupting Henry's buoyant expectations with Dean. And he's just 
            as timid as a toadstool behind that troubled brow. His approach to 
            Henry's heart is ultimately through the man's stomach, propping open 
            his copy of <i>Joy of Cooking</i>, then scouring the Internet and 
            gourmet magazines for salivating delicacies that he painstakingly 
            prepares and delivers daily to Henry and his ailing grandfather. 
            Henry has been mistakenly assuming that the meals have been cooked 
            up by local matchmaker, Widow Thayer (Nan Martin), as part of the 
            mating ritual she has planned for the eligible prodigal son. She 
            surrounds him with a bevy of local winsomes, not realizing his 
            sexual proclivities. When the truth is outed, she just brings in 
            some local meat as a peace offering, disguising the event as a 
            &quot;chess club.&quot; She's a hoot.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Having stayed on for six months, 
            Henry has spent his day tending to Sam and helping teacher and 
            family friend Grace Cromwell (Louise Fletcher) at the school house, 
            while she has offered back her own two cents on life as she sees it 
            in their small burg. But he's restless for New York, and still in 
            the dark about the Indian in the cupboard.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Then there are the seven dwarves. 
            The local redneck town slackers who spend night and day glued to the 
            porch and inner sanctum of Dean's store, helping themselves to 
            endless cups of cappuccino and offering mannerly advice to the 
            lovelorn storekeeper. What a charming bunch! Honest!</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Pretty soon the whole town is 
            rooting for Pike and Henry to finally connect their sidelong 
            glances. Safe to say, this fable has a gloriously happy ending. 
            Smile, damn you. SMILE!</font></td>
