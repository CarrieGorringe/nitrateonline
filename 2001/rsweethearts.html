            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Truly, Julia Roberts leads a
            charmed life. While this observation will surprise no one, it
            apparently bears repeating, by any and every media outlet within
            reach of whoever it is that handles her publicity. Even when things
            have gone wrong, she comes out looking fantastic. And things have
            gone wrong: a child of divorce whose father died of cancer when she
            was only ten, Roberts knows something about hardship. And hey, in
            her later life, she's also endured difficulties: the divorce from
            too-school-for-school Lyle Lovett, the nasty non-communication with
            brother Eric, <i>Hook</i>. And oh yes, the break-ups. She's had a
            few of those, involving her beautiful male counterparts, all of
            which <i>Us</i> magazine, et. al. likes to trot out when the time is
            right, that is, whenever she has another break-up. Is there another
            person on the planet whom you don't actually know, whose romantic
            history you do know so intimately as Julia Roberts?</b> <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If that history seems like too much
            information to you, imagine how it feels for her. (And this is the
            game you most love to play, isn't it? imagining how anything feels
            for her…) As Roberts noted during her recent appearance on
            Letterman -- when she was supposedly promoting her new romantic
            comedy, <i>America's Sweethearts</i> -- her most recent split, from
            Benjamin Bratt, is attracting way too much attention. Yes, the
            timing is creepily convenient: just as <i>America's Sweethearts</i>
            was opening and just as <i>Time</i> magazine was anointing her the <i>Best</i>
            American Movie Star (whatever that might begin to mean). With this
            cosmic convergence of circumstances, Julia is again everywhere, even
            more everywhere than usual, on every tabloid cover, on TV, in gossip
            columns, forever wearing that sleek Oscar dress, on Ben's arm,
            beaming like she's fit to burst. Whoa: it turns out that the couple
            wasn't quite so happy as they looked. The <i>People</i> magazine
            version is this: he wanted her to settle down, she wanted to make
            the most of her hot iron of a career. Still, Julia told Dave (and
            why would she lie?), they parted amicably. She added, so graciously,
            that Ben's a good man, just not her man anymore. What a trooper. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And what good timing. It's like a
            movie. In fact, it's a lot like <i>America's Sweethearts</i>, a
            supposed send-up of the movie business written by co-star and
            producer Billy Crystal (he plays a super-publicist named Lee) and
            Peter Tolan (also his co-writer on <i>Analyze This</i>), and
            directed by the severely out-of-practice Joe Roth (who directed <i>Revenge
            of the Nerds II</i> many moons ago, and then headed Disney for six
            years -- suffice it to say, he has some bones to pick). But the
            send-up is doggedly unclever in its attention to the vagaries of
            fame, insecurities of famous people, and artifice of Hollywood
            romance. Taking aim at too-familiar targets (absorbed movie stars,
            obsequious attendants, cutthroat publicists, and snarfling movie
            junketeers), the movie makes a standard moralistic point: selfish
            people will get their comeuppance (oh, yes, the movie industry has a
            moral order). And so what if the end of the film actually
            re-subscribes to all the bullshit that the rest of it has been
            making fun of? True love, you know, it triumphs over everything. We
            do believe in you, Julia. We do. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The sweethearts of the title do not
            technically include Roberts, but she is the number one sweetheart
            (we know that without being told). The movie's sweethearts are the
            Most Fabulous Gwen (Catherine Zeta-Jones) and her estranged husband
            Eddie (John Cusack). Roberts is Gwen's longtime assistant and
            supposedly &quot;mousy&quot; sister Kiki, but you know there's not a
            moment, even during brief flashbacks when she wears her
            much-publicized &quot;fat-suit,&quot; that Roberts looks remotely
            unlike her relentlessly superb self. This self, or rather, Kiki, is
            the girl with whom Eddie finally falls in love, after Gwen dumps him
            for the unconvincingly swaggering, bizarrely accented (&quot;Iee'm
            not eenvited to the honket!!??&quot;), and brazenly talentless
            Hector (Hank Azaria). There's no reason for their sudden romance,
            except, of course, that she's Julia. To motivate this turn of
            events, the movie offers two Kikis, the past frumpy one and the
            current less frumpy one who's lighter by sixty pounds and thus,
            inevitably, newly confident and newly beautiful. How could Eddie not
            adore her? She's so perky, so lovable, so sweet. She's so Julia. <o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The ostensible comedy attending
            this romantic roundelay is broad and mostly physical, staged at a
            press junket in the Nevada desert, where every attendee will be
            stranded. Evidently, such stranding guarantees that they will be won
            over by the spectacle of Gwen and Eddie smiling at one another in
            support of their final film together, an SF-action-thriller-romance
            called <i>Time Over Time</i>. (A brief clip reveals that Eddie's a
            time-traveling cop in a silly future-suit and Gwen, I think, is in
            need of rescue -- there's something to be said here about the <i>America's
            Sweethearts</i>' imitation insight into the inanity of Hollywood
            titles and plots, but why bother?) The studio is in a panic because
            no one has seen <i>Time Over Time</i>: it's unfinished and has been
            absconded with by the eccentric, &quot;arty&quot; director, Hal
            (Christopher Walken), who's reportedly still editing, locked away in
            the Unabomber's cabin, which he's had flown in and deposited on his
            own expansive lawn. And so, Lee is pressed into assembling an
            all-stops-out junket for this grand unseen product. Though he acts
            as though he has the utmost contempt for his job and the idiots he
            deals with daily, Lee -- aided by his know-nothing minion (Seth
            Green, a.k.a. Oz, and why oh why did he quit his day job on <i>Buffy</i>?)
            -- agrees to do the junket, under threat of losing that same job.
            The thinking is that if <i>Time Over Time</i> makes a gazillion
            dollars like the other nine films starring Gwen and Eddie, Lee wins.
            Something.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This illogical logic sounds
            screwball-ready, but the movie never gets beyond being a series of
            jokes. While the critically-maligned <i>Scary Movie 2</i> takes a
            similarly scattershot approach to plot, in <i>America's Sweethearts</i>,
            the pay scale is higher and the jokes are more or less on topic,
            that topic being the movie biz. <i>America's Sweethearts</i> feigns
            an insider's look at the odious monsters who run said biz (Stanley
            Tucci's studio head is so devoted to making money that he's gleeful
            when Eddie threatens suicide) and the mealy-mouthed moo-cows who
            dress up said biz (the members of the press are slavering
            hangers-on, asking the same dreary dull questions again and again,
            except for Larry King, who plays himself, pelting Gwen with
            &quot;hardball&quot; questions about her affair with &quot;a very
            handsome young Spanish fella&quot;).</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But <i>America's Sweethearts</i>
            doesn't go inside anything. And why should it? Everyone knows the
            score: movie stars are only into glitz and surface, and you<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>-- self-conscious consumer -- pay cash money to see their
            glitz and surface. This is what movie stardom is all about, what
            Julia is all about. Indeed, this is what is most smug and annoying
            about <i>America's Sweethearts</i>: for all its professed
            behind-the-scenes-ness (newsflash: junkets are boring and
            uninformative, celebrities are narcissists, and reporters are
            dupes), it still lets the celebs come out on top, as jolly good
            sports (Zeta-Jones, who, according to a gushing Larry King during a
            &quot;real life&quot; interview on 21 July, is nothing like Gwen,
            but just oh so down-to-earth), self-aware clowns (Crystal, whose Lee
            is a couple of times apparently fellated by Gwen's ferocious
            Doberman Pinscher), or really nice movie stars -- <i>best</i> movie
            stars -- like Roberts.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And so here you are again, within
            the perfect circle that is Julia. Repetition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>At film's end, Kiki and Eddie enact their final-clinch in
            front of a crowd of applauding, awestruck reporters, like Julia
            Roberts (playing Julia Roberts as a superstar) did with Hugh Grant
            (playing Hugh Grant as an ordinary person) in <i>Notting Hill</i>.
            Of the many bad ideas in <i>America's Sweethearts</i> (Eddie almost
            falling off a roof in front of that same crowd of reporters, Eddie
            and Hector duking it out in a restaurant in front of that same crowd
            of reporters, the reporters playing themselves in front of that same
            crowd of reporters), this one stands out. It's unlikely that Julia
            -- who, as Kiki, has actually just shown some backbone in preceding
            scenes -- would be waiting around in the background to be saved by
            her movie-star beau, no matter how pretty he is. Then again, her
            life is charmed.</font>
