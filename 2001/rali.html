            likely, you've heard everything you need to hear about Muhammad Ali,
            especially recently, what with all the publicity for Michael Mann's <i>Ali</i>.
            Outrageous and outsized, he's one of the most famous figures of the
            20th century, and surely one of the most incessantly documented and
            represented. As if to increase the noise level, over the Christmas
            holiday, ESPN found footage to make up 25 hours of programming, and
            then played it a few times, to form an incessant loop of Ali-ness.
            There you see him again and again -- in stills and archival fight
            footage -- mouthing off with Howard Cosell, boxing with Joe Frazier,
            George Foreman, and Sonny Liston, watching Billy Crystal do a
            decidedly strange compression of his life by acting out Ali and
            various contenders. It was a weird and wild (and lengthy) array of
            moments, yet somehow it was hard to look away. Ali embodies a kind
            of car-wreck charisma -- arrogant and self-conscious, beautiful and
            fierce, even on twenty-year-old tape, he can take your breath away.</b>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            ability to mesmerize makes Ali who he is, or more accurately, who
            everyone wants him to be. He's a cipher and a screen onto which
            viewers might project themselves. Even now that he's been embraced
            by the mainstream, Ali's story is a rife with as much controversy as
            deference, and plenty of people still hold him in contempt for his
            loud resistance to the Vietnam war and his sometimes compromised
            allegiance to the Nation of Islam. So, the fact that Mann and
            Fresh-Prince-turned-mega-movie-star Will Smith even imagined
            bringing this story to the screen made headlines. How could they
            pretend to convey Ali's brilliance? How could a movie do justice to
            the complexity or the hugeness of the man? <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For
            all the hype and all the expectations, <i>Ali</i> is unexpected.
            Knowledgeable, evocative, and occasionally excessive, the film jumps
            right into its big subject and bold concept and never looks back. It
            begins with a breathtaking sequence. Muhammad Ali, then Cassius
            Clay, jogs in a hooded sweatshirt along a snowy city street,
            followed briefly by a cop car, from which a white officer asks,
            &quot;What you runnin' from, son?&quot; Clay keeps jogging,
            unbothered because he's so used to such careless cruelty, but you
            can't help but realize the pervasive whiteness of his world -- it
            begins t explain his drive. Intercut with this scene, dated 24
            February 1964, are repeated shots of Sam Cooke on stage, singing an
            incredible medley over the cuts -- &quot;Somebody Have Mercy,&quot;
            &quot;It's All Right,&quot; &quot;Bring It on Home to Me,&quot; and
            more -- the camera barely keeping up with him as fans swoon. Cut
            again, to lay on the speed bag, his face close, his punches rhythmic
            and rapid; cut to Sonny Liston beating Floyd Patterson; to the child
            Ali, watching his father, Cassius Clay, Sr. (Giancarlo Esposito),
            paint a white Jesus for a white church; to young Cassius stepping to
            the back of a bus, past a newspaper with a headline on the lynching
            of Emmett Till; to Clay grown, standing in the back of a Muslim
            meeting room, as Malcolm X (Mario Van Peebles) declares, &quot;We
            don't teach you to turn the other cheek.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">With
            these deft strokes, <i>Ali</i> begins to lay out (and admittedly,
            reduce) the many complex factors that made Muhammad Ali &quot;the
            greatest&quot; -- champion boxer, commercial goldmine, and man of
            conscience -- however troubled and erratic he was in any of these
            roles. Cooke continues to sing over shots of the young, magnificent
            Clay in the gym, watched over by his fast-talking cornerman Bundini
            Brown (Jamie Foxx), friend and photographer Howard Bingham (Jeffrey
            Wright), and trainer Angelo Dundee (Ron Silver), all intent on
            getting this kid, already an Olympic gold medallist, ready to take
            on Liston. Cut once more, as the song closes, to the Clay-Liston
            weigh-in, as Ali advises the champ that he is going to &quot;fly
            like a butterfly, sting like a bee.&quot; So insistent, so
            confident, so fantastic, Clay was already a self-aggrandizing
            loudmouth, offending old-school sportswriters with his lack of
            &quot;respect.&quot; Rumble young man rumble. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Exciting
            and nervy, this first set of images, at once urgent and
            impressionistic, stands as a kind of fair warning. This movie will
            be no standard biopic. It won't give you a series of facts, it won't
            show you how Ali came to be, it won't explain or even
            &quot;represent&quot; him in any usual way. Selecting a particular
            time period -- the tumultuous ten years between Clay/Ali's first
            heavyweight title triumph in '65 and his amazing
            &quot;rope-a-dope&quot; performance to recover that title in Zaire,
            during 1974's &quot;Rumble in the Jungle&quot; (thrillingly
            documented in Leon Gast's <i>When We Were Kings</i>) -- the film
            doesn't pretend to tell the &quot;whole&quot; story of the man or
            his times. Instead, it throws moments at you, a lot of them, almost
            all scored with period music (though the &quot;inspired-by&quot;
            soundtrack cd features popular new acts, including R. Kelly, Alicia
            Keys, and Moby) and all coming with a speed that makes them
            imprecise. It presumes you can fill in blanks. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Just
            so, <i>Ali</i> doesn't so much introduce characters as it lets them
            loose in mid-action: trainers, friends, and family members (Ali had
            five or six kids during this decade -- out of 9 total -- but the
            film barely acknowledges them) are more illustrative background
            elements than developed characters. Sometimes, this is a
            surprisingly effective strategy: Foxx as Bundini is especially
            scrappy and alive in the role, so that the smidgen of screen time he
            has turns electric. In other cases, as with Paul Rodriguez playing
            Ali's doctor, Ferdie Pacheco, there's nothing to be done but show up
            in the frame (perhaps, you think, his dialogue was lost in
            cutting).&nbsp;<span style="mso-tab-count:2">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Occasionally,
            the movie lapses into a more ordinary, episodic cadence, as it
            &quot;reports&quot; on events. He wins the title; he receives his
            Muslim name from Elijah Muhammad (Albert Hall); he seduces and
            marries first wife Sonji (Jada Pinkett Smith); Malcolm (Mario Van
            Peebles, in an underdeveloped role) and Martin (LeVar Burton, in
            this single moment, that is, no role) shake hands on a TV in the
            background of a shot where Ali is doing sit-ups in the foreground;
            Malcolm is assassinated; Ali is convicted of &quot;refusing
            induction&quot; (&quot;Ain't no VC ever called me nigger&quot;); his
            lawyer, Chauncy Eskridge (solid Joe Morton), represents him all the
            way to the Supreme Court, which overturns his conviction and grants
            him conscientious objector status; etc. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still,
            despite this storytelling (call it &quot;cramming&quot;) impulse,
            the film maintains a kind of audacious subjectivity. It's not that
            it takes Ali's point of view, exactly (though it's his more than
            anyone else's); it's more that it filters all this history, so
            well-known and yet so abstract, though a haze of riotous conscience.
            The movie makes clear that he adores himself, and also that he
            tramples all over many hearts, including the women he loves and
            leaves, including Sonji, Belinda (Nona Gaye), and Veronica (Michael
            Michele), and the friendship with Malcolm that he forsakes in order
            to keep tight with Elijah Muhammad (bad choice, the movie argues, as
            the Nation goes on to exploit Ali). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Of
            course, the boxing scenes -- brutal, up-close, and metaphorical too
            -- expose much of this internal turmoil as externalized and
            choreographed professional battling. Mann and DP Emmanuel Lubezki
            concoct a dazzling arrangement of wide and extremely tight shots,
            and used a mini handheld camera that allowed them to get in between
            fighters and create a grainy whoosh in the image. Also of course,
            the film doesn't really challenge boxing, as ideology, sport, or
            commercial/exploitative business, it also never lets you forget that
            Ali came to his greatness amidst entrenched racism. And this is the
            film's own bit of greatness, that it presents U.S. racism without
            apologizing, explaining, or looking away from this legacy. It's
            ugly. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            for the seeming Ali-ness attained by <i>Ali</i> -- it's a mixed bag.
            Smith really trained, boxed, and studied Islam, yes yes, and he
            abstained from sex with Jada. All that, no matter how true, has long
            since turned into marketing strategy, repeated for ESPN, <i>GQ</i>
            and Jay Leno, playing the game much as Ali himself might have played
            it (though certainly not so vividly as he has). In the film, Smith
            is working hard in the role -- and god knows he owes us all for
            making <i>The Legend of Bagger Vance</i>. And if he never transforms
            himself into Ali, or what viewers want him to be, he achieves a
            poetically licensed otherness, and a truly strong performance.
            Perhaps most strikingly, Smith's most effective scenes, despite
            Ali's notorious verbal dexterity, involve no dialogue, just the
            camera (sometimes way too tight for regular comfort levels) on his
            face and utterly expressive body. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Though
            the film obviously reveres Ali, and omits many details, it also
            offers enough shading to allow you to imagine his emotional and
            ethical struggles (as well as his enormous ego). It probably helps
            if you know a little something about Muhammad Ali before you walk
            into the theater, for instance, that he is a devoted member of the
            Nation, that he knew and quarreled with Elijah Muhammad as well as
            Malcolm; struggled with the rush and privilege accompanying his
            celebrity; cheated on three of his four wives; felt exploited by
            managers and promoters, including Elijah's son Herbert Muhammad
            (Barry Shabaka Henley) and Don King (Mykelti Williamson); venerated
            his longtime friend Howard Cosell (well played by Jon Voight under a
            heap of makeup); and resisted the draft when he was reclassified 1-A
            in 1966, after he failed the aptitude test in 1964 and was declared
            by the government to have an IQ of 78. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Running
            about two and forty minutes, the movie makes room for these many
            parts of Ali's life by not dwelling on any of them. Instead, it
            grants glimpses, as in a brief hotel room scene, when second wife
            Belinda confronts him about his rather public affair with
            about-to-be-third wife, Veronica. Or as when Ali goes running in
            Kinshasa, Zaire, accompanied by passionate well-wishers. He comes
            upon a mural depicting his crazily superhuman stature, his
            reputation and his value for them, in that it envisions him fighting
            off Mubutu's oppressive regime much as he fights off George Foreman
            or giant bees with stingers. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So
            much of the movie is most focused on Ali's early, U.S.-based career,
            so this moment, as he suddenly sees outside himself, to how others
            might see him, galvanizes him, and not so indirectly, comments on
            the costs of U.S. self-importance. While the film ends, literally
            freezes, on his victorious Rumble, it never backs off its
            consideration of the era's politics -- the racism and jingoism, the
            classism and misogyny -- which are everywhere visible, in Ali's
            detractors but also in his own behaviors. Mann is a famously earnest
            filmmaker, and here again he leans on a few signature techniques to
            make his principled points, hugely foregrounded faces to denote
            contemplation or revelation, handheld camerawork to indicate chaos.
            But the film is finally larger than such devices and the emotional
            manipulations they might attempt. But more importantly, it is
            premised on its inability to contain Ali. The bravest thing <i>Ali</i>
            does is to gesture toward, wonder at, and celebrate Muhammad Ali,
            and then let go of him.</font><o:p>
