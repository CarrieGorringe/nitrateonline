<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Alejandro Amenabar is intense. His dark hair 
is cropped close to his head, his dark eyes look directly into yours, and his 
slight frame shifts restlessly on the hotel suite sofa. But he also has an 
obvious gentleness about him, as well as a seductive excitement about movies. 
Born in Santiago, Chile, the twenty-nine-year-old writer-director-composer grew 
up in Spain, and attended Madrid's Complutense University. By 1992, he was 
already winning awards for his short films and videos. His first feature, <i>
Tesis</i> (<i>Thesis</i>), released in 1996 and starring Ana Torrent, follows a 
young cinematography student working on her doctoral thesis, as she finds some 
archival footage that turns out to be a snuff film, establishing his affection 
for suspenseful, scary movies. </b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With his second film, 1997's <i>Abre Los Ojos</i> 
(<i>Open Your Eyes</i>), starring Eduardo Noriega and Penelope Cruz, Amenabar 
mixed science fiction, romance, and suspense, in a plot involving a young man in 
a cryogenic sleep, trying to sort out in his dreams just what has happened to 
him. The film, which screened at Sundance in 1998, won the attention of Tom 
Cruise, who, with his producing partner Paula Wagner, developed it for a U.S. 
version, directed by Cameron Crowe, and starring Cruise and Cruz. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Amenabar's new film, <i>The Others</i>, is also 
concerns the mounting terror of a young -- and very pale -- mother named Grace 
(Nicole Kidman), living alone in a mansion on the Isle of Jersey during the 
final days of World War II. Anxiously awaiting her long-absent soldier husband's 
(unlikely) return from the front, she devotes herself to caring for her two 
young children (Alakina Mann and James Bentley). As the children have recently 
developed a deathly allergy to sunlight, Grace must keep her curtains closed at 
all times. When a trio of servants shows up at the house, offering to help get 
the house in order, Grace accepts. And so begins a frightening journey toward 
her self-knowledge. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>Cynthia Fuchs: </b></i>How would you 
describe the thematic connections between <i>The Others</i> and <i>Open Your 
Eyes</i> [<i>Abre Los Ojos</i>]? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>Alejandro Amenabar: </b></i>I would say 
that both films are very similar thematically and philosophically, and they ask 
the same kind of questions. But from an external point of view, the stories and 
styles are completely different. When I wrote my first film, I could see that I 
could have some input, apart from the plot and the tricks, that I could create 
suspense and raise questions. I imagine an audience's point of view. I try to 
work on both levels.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>What are the questions that 
you like to raise? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>AA: </b></i>I'm trying to bring things 
down to a human level. I don't like to give big morals in films. though I like 
to have a personal position in the story. I like to ask questions that are big 
to me, but have an audience ask them of themselves, in their own way. So, in the 
case of <i>The Others</i>, it has to do with death, and how religion gives 
meaning to death and the concept of destiny, and how it responds to not really 
knowing. I would say that my position is agnosticism, and it should be the same 
for the characters at the end of the film. It's about not having big answers for 
everything, but questioning ourselves. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>The structure here is less 
fragmented than in <i>Open Your Eyes</i>, but also considers a fragmented 
existence, across different times. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>AA: </b></i>It is a different style in <i>
The Others</i>, not as much jumping in time. It's not that I think it's a bad 
technique, but I wanted to do something different. in <i>Open Your Eyes</i>, I 
think I had to do it. Otherwise, it would have been three completely different 
movies. It was confusing. I remember one day on the set, Penelope [Cruz] saying, 
&quot;Ah! Now I think I got the idea!&quot; [Laughs] In the middle of the shoot! I thought 
then that next time, I wanted to do something simpler, with just three actors, 
in one set. Something more linear. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>Here the point of view gives 
you depth. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>AA: </b></i>Yes. The point of view mostly 
belongs to one character, Grace. And in <i>Open Your Eyes</i>, the one point of 
view always comes from one character. That's an important concept for me. It's 
hard for me to adopt a position of God, seeing what my characters do, and hiding 
some parts. I prefer to work from one character's point of view. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>I kept thinking as I was 
watching about the concept of &quot;otherness,&quot; and how you define yourself in 
relation to those who are not you. And how does religion give you a specific 
structure for that relation? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>AA: </b></i>Exactly. I was brought up in 
Catholicism. And religion gives you the answers. I think it's not good to think 
that we have the answers. That's what I'm trying to say through this story. For 
me, it's a journey for Grace and her children toward light, as a form of 
knowledge. And the War -- it's Grace who cannot accept and realize this other, 
outside War, which has to do with her own war, her own reality in conflict with 
her beliefs. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>And those beliefs disallow 
the existence of ghosts? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>AA: </b></i>Yes, but actually, religion 
-- including Grace's -- has always had a base in ghosts. And for me the tricky 
thing was to make that work on the opposite level. Because she believes in her 
religion, she can't accept the supernatural thing. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>How did you come up with the 
particular setting, and especially the time, the end of the Second World War?
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>AA: </b></i>When I start to write, I 
always need to know the beginning and the end, mostly the end, because I need to 
know the journey for the characters. And then I need to come up with the middle. 
It's important how you set up the story, that's what makes it surprising, or 
honest or dishonest. It's not what happens, but how it happens and how you set 
it up. I wanted to use this setting because I used to read these novels from the 
'40s and the '50s, second-hand most of them. I wanted to get that sense back, 
the mystery of those novels. And I wanted to get back to the style of the 
suspense films of the '40s and '50s, that feeling that I can't feel nowadays in 
many horror pictures. Also, because I think that for a woman living in this 
jeopardy, it was harder in those times. And the war -- as an idea -- was 
important, even when I wrote the film in Spanish and thought about placing it in 
South America. I needed the husband to go to war and come back. And when we 
decided to set it in England, it made sense to set it during the Second World 
War, and especially in these Islands, which were the only British territory 
occupied by the Nazis. There was a whole sense of guilt on those Islands, 
because of the &quot;nice&quot; relationship between the English and the Germans. And it 
is a story about guilt, more than anything else. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>How would you describe the 
&quot;pleasure&quot; of being scared, and how it's different in your film, compared to 
current horror films? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>AA: </b></i>I think the difference is in 
how you approach the audience, and trying to connect with the audience. I think 
for better or worse, I'm trying to do exactly the opposite of what you see in 
most horror films today. Start with the special effects: in other films you 
might be seeing ghosts flying around. It doesn't disturb me. So I tried to work 
in a more realistic way and play with primary fears, and very simple elements, 
the things I was scared of when I was a child. I tried to adopt the role of a 
child when I was writing. And I tried to put the audience in that position. Or 
the sound, for instance; I think that nowadays, the levels of sound in many 
mixes are completely unbelievable and insane. So we tried to make a very quiet 
film, and use silence as a way to create suspense. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>What do you think is the 
pleasure that we take in fear? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>AA: </b></i>For me, it's one extreme 
feeling. It's fun when you are completely safe, but I had a lot of creepy 
feelings; I was a very easily scared boy. The experience in movies can be so 
extreme that we can learn from that. To me, it's the best to express many of my 
concerns, obsessions, or even paranoias. It's an easy way as well, because it 
works as mathematics. Scaring people can be easy. [Laughs] The tricky thing is 
to integrate it with a plot. It's not like comedy, which to me seems very 
difficult. For me it's the perfect vehicle. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>In many horror films -- and 
yours is a good example -- the anxieties stem from family dynamics, wanting to 
understand or possess or protect your family members. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>AA: </b></i>Yes. And family is a very big 
concept in Spain. I was brought up in a very nice and strong family. But what I 
wanted to explore in this film was the dark side of the family, which is not 
against love. But this dark side of love is very interesting. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>I was also intrigued that 
there wasn't a direct &quot;explanation&quot; or rationale for what happens. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>AA: </b></i>I think there is a physical 
level of explanation, and also a spiritual or emotional one. We talked about 
having Nicole doing a long speech at the end of the film, or to show the whole 
thing in flashback. But we decided not to, and that this was more elegant and 
simple, a more economical way to end. Many questions are answered. But 
especially with all the religious stuff -- hell, heaven, purgatory -- I wanted 
to leave many open questions. I want to leave something for the audience to ask 
themselves. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>But the film doesn't explain 
her actions, or demonize her. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>AA: </b></i>You're right. That is left to 
poetry. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>You also compose the scores 
for your films. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>AA: </b></i>For me, it's fun, and 
something I started with my short films, and even as a child, playing with 
keyboards. But for me it helps to set the tone and the mood. Many directors can 
do that by talking to a composer. I think that I would be such a pain in the ass 
trying to work with a composer, so I prefer to do it myself. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>So as you're conceiving a 
story, how or when does the music come in?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>AA: </b></i>Actually, I'm singing all the 
time [laughs]. And that's a problem, as I'm walking down the street, just put a 
soundtrack to my whole life! But I think it helps e to develop many ideas, 
because I can't write music. I used to have a little recorder that I would use 
to record melodies. But then the hard work comes after the final editing of the 
film. For this film, I had to spend lots of hours, because unlike other 
composers, I don't know how to write music. I have to try to listen to 
everything first, and put the music into my computer, then transfer it to a 
score. I play with samples, and try to reproduce what I hear in my head. In the 
case of this soundtrack, I focused on soloists. In many horror films, the music 
is so great, and so well-orchestrated and perfect, but then again, it just 
doesn't scare me. I thought that a solo cello would be good. Most of it is very 
simple. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>How was it to work with the 
kids?&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>AA: </b></i>It was good. [Laughs] I was 
very scared, because I don't have kids and I've never worked with kids before. I 
think Hitchcock used to say something like that, &quot;Never work with horses or 
kids.&quot; And one of the problems we have with kids nowadays is that they don't 
read too much. So we needed young kids who could understand the nature of their 
characters, and their souls. And these kids are very smart. I tried to get along 
with them as soon as possible, to establish with them a relationship based on 
respect. So they knew they came to work, basically, and I was feeling sad for 
them, because they couldn't be exposed to sunlight, to keep their skin as white 
as possible. Of course they were in makeup, but they had to stay pale. So when 
they went out, it was at night, like little vampires. [Laughs] They're very 
nice, and they behaved like brother and sister. And though it was difficult, the 
allergy was an excellent metaphor for this story, the journey toward light.
</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CF: </i></b>That journey for Grace looks 
harrowing, and Nicole Kidman appears in most every scene. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>AA: </b></i>For her, the freakiest thing 
was -- and she insisted, and I thought she was right -- that she performed 
always the character from the inside, from her heart. It must have been hard for 
her. She has children. When the character went into hell, she also went into 
hell. Once, she said, &quot;I bled for this film,&quot; and I can believe it. As a 
director, the best I could do was support her. And I tried to give her freedom 
to create the character, and to make Grace hers. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>The plot is so precise, too, 
as each scene is interlocked with another scene. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>AA: </b></i>Yes, the cast and I we were 
very aware, considering the nature of suspense, not to give away too much in any 
one scene. So, that had to do with what I was shooting as well as what they were 
doing. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>I'm also interested in the 
use of the servants as a way to create tension. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>AA: </b></i>The servants don't move in a 
very precise period. But we thought that Mrs. Mills [Fionnula Flanagan] had to 
be someone who could stand up in front of someone like Grace. But in this case, 
women are much stronger than men in the film: men are dominated by women. You 
can see this in the relationship between Mrs. Mills and Mr. Tuttle [Eric Sykes], 
the gardener. The whole class concept is there, but not as strong, probably. 
Once you are inside the house, it is difficult to realize at what time you are 
or even where you are. It has more to do with human level. And these two women 
start to become sort of friends. </font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>CF: </b></i>How did you think about 
Grace's &quot;development,&quot; given that, at some level, she must remain so 
undeveloped, so ignorant about herself? </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i><b>AA: </b></i>There are so many 
explanations about that! [Laughs] To me, again, it's about religion and miracle. 
How she perceives what happens has to do with miracles and with God, her belief 
that &quot;God is with me,&quot; like when her husband comes home. She believes, &quot;God is 
helping me.&quot; For the children, they see that their mother has tried to do 
something, but she does not achieve it. For Grace, it's like trying to get it 
out from her mind, but the girl doesn't want to get it out. </font></p>
