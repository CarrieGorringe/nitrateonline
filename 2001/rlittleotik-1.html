normal"><span lang="EN-GB">Little Otik</span></i><span lang="EN-GB"> is the
            latest surreal offering from the Czech writer/director Jan Švankmajer.
            In a blend of live action and animation, it tells the curious story,
            based upon Czech folklore, of a childless couple who, in their
            desperation, convince themselves that a tree trunk is their baby.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>In an ingenious twist, the mother nurtures the stump until it
            does take on a fearsome and voracious life of its own as Little
            Otik. Unfortunately, the film does not live up to its early premise
            and promise.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></b></font></p>
            <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span lang="EN-GB">The
            opening scenes, powerful and hallucinatory, effectively lull the
            audience into a suspension of disbelief. The pressure upon the
            couple, Bozena (Veronika Žilková) and Karel (Jan Hartl) to secure
            their genetic inheritance is everywhere, and Bozena’s obsession
            with other people’s children is delineated well. By the time Karel
            digs up the anthropomorphic trunk at their new cottage and presents
            it to his wife, the viewer is inclined to believe that this really
            could be mistaken for an infant, as she lovingly bathes and dresses
            it. It is rarely clear at which points Bozena knows she is faking
            her<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>“pregnancy” and
            “labour”, and when she is truly experiencing the sensations. By
            the time Karel comes to collect her from her cottage hideout, where
            she is pretending to be in hospital giving birth, the deception has
            become all too real.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
            have successfully given life to a grotesque wood-child that suckles
            jerkily at her breast with twig limbs and a hideous knothole mouth.
            The scene marks a high point in both the animation and the
            narrative.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span lang="EN-GB">Once
            the couple returns to their city apartment, carefully hiding their
            monstrous progeny under wraps, both their lives and the film rapidly
            go south. The claustrophobia of the setting is oppressive, with its
            nosy neighbours, child-molesting cleaner and the object of his
            affections, a watchful young girl, Alzbetka (Kristina Adamková in
            her first big screen outing) who soon works out the couple’s
            terrible secret. Both the girl and the young couple make unusually
            unattractive film leads. The neurotic maternal instinct of Bozena
            becomes a crass parody of both infertility and motherhood.
            Weak-chinned, bespectacled Karel is hopelessly inert and pathetic,
            despite his recognition that they have spawned a murderous and
            unnatural beast. Alzbetka’s amusing detective work is replaced,
            once she solves the mystery, with a blind devotion to Little Otik,
            for which she is willing to sacrifice her parents, that is ugly and
            implausible. Rejection of psychological veracity for magic realism
            is difficult to manage in either film or literature without
            alienation of the audience, and the project fails here.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span lang="EN-GB">Such
            a black farce merits a swifter pace, and the film becomes overly
            repetitive in both its plotting and imagery. There are sporadic
            funny moments: spoof TV advertisements for products including “the
            inferno”, an iron that irons itself, and Little Otik’s
            consumption of a fatally persistent social worker, but they are too
            few. An unpleasant oral fixation invades the film at every turn.
            Thematically coherent at first in the context of the baby’s
            prodigious appetite, repeated close-ups of the little girl’s mouth
            as she eats or reads her fairy tale aloud are simply unnerving.
            Though the film mercilessly pillories the old man, Mr. Zlabek, who
            lusts after Alzbetka, endless shots from his perspective of her
            naked thighs simply implicate the audience in his desires. One
            wonders what point is being made by such moments, and then one stops
            caring.<o:p>
            </o:p>

            </span></font></p>
            <p style="text-align:justify"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span lang="EN-GB">Švankmajer
            himself appears to have tired of his theme by the end, as Little
            Otik is locked in a cellar, with few glimpses permitted of him as he
            grows, our final moments with him enacted off-screen. The cartoon
            fairy tale that punctuates the narrative issues too many spoilers to
            the audience. It is a superfluity rather than an enhancement of the
            action. Though this film has interesting and thought-provoking
            qualities, its contempt for both human and wooden life leaves the
            audience as hungry for some meat on the bones of its characters as
            Little Otik.</span></font><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana"><o:p>
