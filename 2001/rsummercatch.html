            review by <a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 24 August
            2001</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>As I was watching the
            aseptically insipid <i>Summer Catch</i>, I confess, my mind
            wandered. And I got to thinking, has Freddie Prinze, Jr. ever made
            an unarguably good movie? I couldn't come up with one. I actually
            rather like <i>I Know What You Did Last Summer</i>, but I know many
            people who don't. Prinze hasn't had visibly good luck -- or taste --
            when it comes to picking projects, say, <i>Wing Commander</i>
            (1999), <i>Head Over Heels</i> (2000), or (double blecch) <i>Boys
            and Girls</i> (2000). Some might argue that <i>She's All That</i>
            (1999) was okay, and Rachel Leigh Cooke emerged pretty much
            unscathed, with a career, but Prinze's part really did suck.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still, I have hope. Not because he
            heroically bleached his hair for <i>Scooby Doo</i> (due out next
            year) and not because he's affianced to Buffy. And certainly not
            because he's the coverboy for <i>Cosmo Girl!'s</i> &quot;Sexiest
            Guys&quot; issue (September 2001). I don't really have a good reason
            to have hope, only that he might be jammed up by this &quot;Freddie
            Prinze, Jr. movie&quot; stage (and let's hope that is very, very
            soon), past playing the cute-puppy romantic lead that he's always
            paid to play, then I think he might have something else to offer.
            He's never so lame as the roles and the movies he's in, and so, I
            have hope. Against the odds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In <i>Summer Catch</i>, his newest
            film, Prinze plays another sweet <b><i>naif</i></b>, this time a
            hometown boy makes good. Ryan Dunne has lived his entire life in
            Cape Cod, helping his dad Sean (Fred Ward) with his
            gardening-landscaping business and pitching baseball. A gifted
            pitcher, Ryan's got a bit of an attitude problem, stemming from
            several traumas (his mom's primarily among them). When he gets
            scared, he gets mean and surly, mouths off and picks a fight. And
            so, he's been kicked off a college team, and has a bit of a rep for
            being &quot;difficult.&quot; And then, he gets his big chance.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As <i>Summer Catch</i> begins, Ryan
            is embarking on a life-changing adventure: he's been selected to
            pitch in the &quot;elite&quot; Cape Cod summer league, where all the
            promising college players play, hoping to be discovered by major
            league scouts. As he explains in his voice-over narration, Ryan is
            eager to be great and incidentally, to escape Cape Cod's confines
            and his working class background. And so he spends the night on a
            pitcher's mound, imagining that this will help him &quot;focus&quot;
            on what's coming. Then his local-yokel friends (Gabriel Mann and Jed
            Robert Rhein) show up, with beers and perky town slut Dede (Brittany
            Murphy, fondly remembered as Tai from <i>Clueless</i>, a seriously
            talented actor who is <b><i>still </i></b>awaiting her break-out
            role). Ryan screws up: after having sex with Dede on the mound, he
            oversleeps the next morning, and arrives for the first day's
            practice late <b><i>and</i></b> wearing her orange thong underwear.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ha ha. The fatherly coach (Brian
            Dennehy) gives Ryan an appropriately hard time, but the movie,
            directed by first-timer Mike Tollin, has set its tone, irrevocably.
            Pitching supposedly means everything to Ryan, and yet he can't help
            but mess up, repeatedly. Almost instantly, Ryan is immersed in a
            competitive enmity with spiky-haired, ice-wearing, bad-boy-affecting
            super-pitcher Eric Van Leemer (Corey Pearson), who boasts that he
            turned down $2 million from the Detroit Tigers, hoping to secure a
            better deal after a summer's worth of wowza mound performances. At
            the same time, Ryan is suffering from fear of failure, not to
            mention fear of turning into his brother Mike (Jason Gedrick), who
            used to play ball and is now a bartender in the local bar where the
            players hang out (cozy), condemned to live in Cape Cod forever, with
            dad down the street, drinking beers and watching tv, when he's not
            pulling weeds for rich folks.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">You will no doubt recognize a
            certain <i>Good Will Hunting</i>-ness here, along with familiar
            elements of any inspirational sports movie. Borrowing from what's
            come before is, of course, common practice, but in this case the
            lifts tend to overwhelm everything else, indicating <i>Summer
            Catch's</i> general lack of imagination. Exhibit A: the film's
            emphasis on boy bonding. Ryan's buddies include the outwardly
            goofball but inwardly sensitive catcher, Billy Brubaker, a.k.a. Bru
            (Matthew Lillard) and enthusiastic ken-doll outfielder Miles
            Dalrymple (Marc Blucas). In a very minor subplot, Miles prefers
            &quot;fat girls,&quot; and so the rest of the team spends many
            minutes making &quot;fat girls&quot; jokes (as does the film, when
            Miles meets one such local girl and she crashes the bedframe when
            she leaps on him, inciting audience chortles and groans). The most
            irritating aspect of this business is that the film invites you to
            laugh at these mean jokes throughout, then pretends to make you
            think again at the end, when Miles publicly declares his desire for
            &quot;fat girls.&quot; It's <b><i>his</i></b> confession that
            solicits cheers, from the guys and from anonymous &quot;fat
            girls&quot; at the bar, so grateful to have such a champion!</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But like I say, this is minor
            stuff, a way for the movie to get cheap laughs and not take
            responsibility for them. It's clearly focused on the conventionally
            beautiful characters, in particular Ryan's &quot;summer catch,&quot;
            gorgeous rich girl Tenley Parrish (Jessica Biel). Though Ryan has
            been mowing her family's lawn for six years, Tenley has never
            noticed him until this instant, and now she can't seem to avoid him,
            mainly because she starts frequenting the players' bar and goes to a
            game. This sudden relationship allows for lots of montagey
            sequences: the kids swim, kiss, play catch, laugh, eat ice cream,
            etc. They don't have sex, though, because he only does that with the
            town slut, and you've already seen that. Ryan is sincerely falling
            in Freddie-Prinze-movie love with Tenley.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The obstacle -- and there has to be
            one -- is class. Both Ryan and Tenley are advised by their fathers
            to give it up (her mother has nothing to say but always has a drink
            in her hand, unsubtly representing Tenley's future, if she persists
            in trying to please daddy). Her impossibly snooty dad (Bruce
            Davison) warns her (and then him) to break it off, and Sean tells
            Ryan that she'll only hurt him, etc. And who knows what those crazy
            kids will do next! When she convinces Ryan to go swimming in her
            family's pool late at night, her dad almost catches them. <b><i>Quelle
            surprise</i></b>.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And yet, the predictable plot isn't
            even the dullest part of <i>Summer Catch</i>. The dullest part is
            the execution of this plot. I lost count of the times that the
            camera solemnly circles a character who's giving an Important
            Speech, about dedication or loyalty or being true to yourself or
            taking big risks to get big rewards, from Ryan's Coach to Dad to
            Best Friend to Girlfriend. And don't forget all those long shots
            from overhead to indicate Ryan's sense of alienation or the rain
            that pours down conveniently whenever a dire emotional moment is in
            the offing.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p style="text-indent:0in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And,
            omigod, the baseball scenes: the sweeping shot of the field (at
            night, by day, whatever); the serial close-ups -- Ryan's grim face,
            Bru's fingers, Ryan shaking him off, Bru's fingers; the scouts in
            the audience (chief among them, John C. McGinley, who writes on his
            pad and mutters that &quot;this kid has something,&quot; even when
            Ryan's hitting batters with wild pitches); Sean shaking his head in
            dismay, off to the side of the bleachers; Tenley looking endlessly
            hopeful and proud; and, to cap it, Curt Gowdy as the announcer,
            filling in uninteresting plot points and describing Ryan's emotional
            state. It's like you've landed in banality heaven, where all the
            movie clichés have come to rest.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
