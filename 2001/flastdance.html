recent year has been a big one for Thomas, with <i>Save the Last Dance</i> and
his work as part on CBS's <i>The District</i>. And he's come to this place
almost by accident. He grew up in Wilmington, Delaware, and during his
undergraduate years at the University of Virginia, answered a casting call for a
production of <i>Raisin in the Sun</i>. To his surprise, he found that he loved
acting, and he pursued it, not by going to Hollywood, but to grad school, at
NYU's Tisch School of the Arts, where he honed his skills, particularly on
stage, and earned an MFA. And he's been working steadily, including parts on
Fox's <i>New York Undercover</i>, and in the films <i>Courage Under Fire</i>, <i>Can't
Hardly Wait</i> (in which he played &quot;Jock #2&quot;), <i>Cruel Intentions</i>,
and <i>Wes Craven Presents Dracula 2000</i>. <o:p>

<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>Sean
Patrick Thomas:</i></b> To me, that's always an interesting question. When
you're sitting in your apartment and you're unemployed, and somebody offers you
a job, unless it's something outrageous, you take it. I auditioned and I got it.
I didn't have dance experience, except for some aerobics dance classes, and I
had to dance at the final audition, and that was bizarre. Usually, with any type
of choreography, you have to learn it and practice it. I didn't have that chance
-- they taught it to me that morning. I did the best I could. <o:p>

How do you see this role in the context of your career so far? <o:p>

<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>SPT:</i></b>
When I first started auditioning for stuff, I was expected to be funny or
menacing, and neither of those come naturally to me. I see myself largely doing
the types of roles that aren't necessarily written &quot;black.&quot; That's the
way I was trained -- I went to school doing Shakespeare, Molière , and Ibsen,
so I came out expecting to do that. <o:p>
</o:p>
 <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CF:

[Your character on <i>The District</i>, the young cop] Temple Page isn't a
typical &quot;black&quot; role. <o:p>
</o:p>
 <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>SPT:
</i></b>
I thought it was a great part when I read it. You don't usually get to see a guy
that looks like me be on tv as a devout Christian, in all likelihood a virgin,
and completely devoid of angst. So when the reviews were coming out before the
pilot aired, saying it was &quot;Driving Miss Daisy&quot; and &quot;The Great
White Hope,&quot; I thought it was nonsense, because it was like reading the
first page of a book. And I haven't heard much of that talk since there've been
more episodes. <o:p>
</o:p>
 <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CF:
</i></b>
How do you like doing the series, with a character who develops over time? <o:p>
</o:p>
 <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>SPT:
</i></b>
I love it. I'm as anxious as any viewer would be to see what Temple is going to
do next. All I know is that in the second half of the season, he's going to have
more sexual tension developing. And it's a great cast -- they're all Broadway
actors except for me. I aspire to that. <o:p>
</o:p>
 <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CF:
</i></b>
It appears to be a smart move, to do both film and TV at this point. <o:p>
</o:p>
 <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>SPT:
</i></b>
Yeah, but that wasn't a strategy. I was unemployed after finishing <i>Save the
Last Dance</i> and I went out for this other role. It wasn't like, &quot;Okay,
now I'm going to do tv.&quot; It was like, I have to pay my rent and my student
loan, what can I do? I'm lucky that the show is doing well, so it looks like
I've got this balanced plan. I also like that I'm playing a &quot;grown-up&quot;
on <i>The District</i>. I'm happy to look young, but high school parts aren't
usually fully rounded -- <i>Save the Last Dance</i> is an exception. So I'm
trying to grow facial hair, but it's not quite working. [Laughs]<o:p>
</o:p>
 <o:p>
</o:p>

<hr size="1">
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CF:

How is the process of TV different for you than movies? It sounds like you don't
get scripts too far ahead of time. <o:p>
</o:p>
 <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>SPT:
</i></b>
Right, we get scripts close to when we shoot, and sometimes rewrites an hour
before we do a scene. There's far less rehearsal time in tv, because you have to
get a lot done in a short time. So you don't have time to be like,&quot;The
motivation here is this.&quot; With movies, there's more time to rehearse and
finesse it. <o:p>
</o:p>
 <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CF:
</i></b>
But if there's more time pressure in tv, there's more money pressures in movies?
<o:p>
</o:p>
 <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>SPT:
</i></b>
Oh yeah! Those economic concerns have direct effects on acting. There were many
scenes in <i>Save the Last Dance</i> when they said, &quot;Well, that was good,
but you're not likeable enough.&quot; There's a scene in the club, when [my
ex-girlfriend] wants to dance, and I played the genuine indignation and hurt,
and getting pleasure out of telling her to step off, with some venom. And they
said, &quot;That's realistic, but you're not appealing.&quot; To me, it intrudes
on playing the scene truthfully. [My character, Derek] had to be a guy who's
noble beyond all human expectation. But I think every actor has to go through
this. And this film gives me the opportunity to do many different things -- how
many times do you get to be the head guy in a romance, dance, and fight? It's
all cool. <o:p>
</o:p>
 <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CF:
</i></b>
Do you imagine doing parts that are less likeable? <o:p>
</o:p>
 <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>SPT:
</i></b>
To a certain extent. I feel like I would identify more with someone who's a
little shady, because I'm more guarded than either Temple or Derek. To an
extent, I would understand a villain, the guy who's standing on the corner,
watching and plotting what he wants to do, as opposed to being everybody's hero.
But it all interests me, bad guys and good guys.<o:p>
</o:p>
 <o:p>

<hr size="1">
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CF:

It looked like you all had fun playing vampires in <i>Dracula 2000</i>. <o:p>
</o:p>
 <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>SPT:
</i></b>
It was a lot of fun. My first instinct, when I read for the role, was to be very
broad, the mustache-twirling bad guy. But Patrick [Lussier, the director] wanted
it to be as realistic as possible, within the constraints of it being a Miramax
Dracula film, which meant that there was a certain amount of gloss and sheen. I
tried to play it pretty straight, but also to remember that it's fun, it's a
horror movie. <o:p>
</o:p>
 <o:p>
</o:p>

<hr size="1">
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CF:

Do you have models for your art, or your career? <o:p>
</o:p>
 <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>SPT:
</i></b>
I admire Andre Braugher, Joe Morton, Denzel Washington, Lynne Thigpen [Thomas's
co-star on <i>The District</i>], and Anthony Hopkins. Sidney Poitier of course,
and Alfre Woodard. I love Sanaa Lathan's work, and my [NYU] classmate Aunjanue
Ellis. I respect actors who bring the truth of who they are to their parts, who
don't succumb to what's expected of them, as black men. I think that when you're
a black actor, what's hard to remember is that before you're black, you're a
person, and there are certain characteristics you have that have nothing to do
with being black -- the question is, how do you bring all that to the table? I
find it difficult to do, with the parts we're expected to play, which come with
characteristics assigned to them because they're black. It's ridiculous. <o:p>
</o:p>
 <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CF:
</i></b>
What are the ways that <i>Save the Last Dance</i> breaks down some of those
expectations? <o:p>
</o:p>
 <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>SPT:
</i></b>
I think that the relationships among the characters are well-developed. I like
that early scene where Sara [Julia Stiles' character] asks me if I have a kid.
That's such a bizarre question, not because I'm black, but because of [what she
knows about me], at that point in the movie. I like the fact that I get to
challenge the stereotype. <o:p>
</o:p>
 <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CF:
</i></b>
I know that you did a lot of theater early on. Are you interested in going back
to that? <o:p>
</o:p>
 <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>SPT:
</i></b>
Definitely. When you're doing a play you get to go full speed ahead, all night,
in front of an audience. It's a roller-coaster ride, responding to other actors,
it feeds you. And in theater, there's less commercial concern, less tendency to
say, &quot;Well, this thing might suck, but we have to do it anyway, because it
will sell.&quot; In theater, you get more of the sense that if something is bad,
you find a better way to do it. It's a struggle in film and TV, between commerce
and quality. <o:p>
</o:p>
 <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CF:
</i></b>
In a way, Fredro [Starr]'s role in <i>Save the Last Dance</i>, the formulaic
&quot;bad kid,&quot; is a good example of that problem.<o:p>
</o:p>
 <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>SPT:
</i></b>
True. What's odd though, is that when I read the script, I thought, obviously,
Derek is not going to go with this guy, so why introduce this storyline, because
there's no tension. But lots of people I've talked to, who've seen the movie,
tell me, &quot;I thought you were going to die,&quot; or &quot;I'm so glad you
didn't go off with him.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
 <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CF:
</i></b>
I guess they haven't seen <i>Boyz N the Hood</i>. <o:p>
</o:p>
 <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>SPT:
</i></b>
[Laughs] I guess not. Even though we were both aware of how obvious it seemed,
we did the best we could with it. <o:p>
</o:p>
 <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CF:
</i></b>
With so many high school movies being made, there appear to be many
opportunities for young actors -- not necessarily teens, but young actors -- to
work. What are your feelings about that? <o:p>
</o:p>
 <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>SPT:
</i></b>
I think it's a dangerous thing, because you have so many actors coming up who
don't have a clue. Not that I have this great clue, but I have a tiny bit of a
clue. Rarely do I think those movies are particularly good. It creates an
underclass of actors, few of whom will have a future. I know that when I'm not
cute anymore, I'll still be able to get a job. If <i>Save the Last Dance</i>
does well, it might keep me in that &quot;teen box&quot; a little bit longer,
but I don't have a problem with that because my first priority now is to work,
and beyond that, I'll suss things out. I think I've managed to create a niche
for myself, where no one's going to ask me to play a hoodlum or to be Mr.
Funnyman. At the same time, I'm not a purist -- a lot of my friends don't like <i>Cruel
Intentions</i>, they think it's common. But I like fun movies. It's funny
though, because now that I'm in Hollywood, I've kind of shifted, now I'm more of
a snob. <o:p>
</o:p>
 <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CF:
</i></b>
So, if you were offered an action script, like <i>Die Hard</i>, you'd think
twice about it?<o:p>
</o:p>
 <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>SPT:
</i></b>
Oh, I'd do it in a heartbeat. [Laughs] I have so much respect for good writing,
it's an actor's lifeblood. But I had a teacher in grad school who said, nine
times out of ten, your job as an actor is to make bad writing look good. But I
love what I do. I'd never want a nine-to-five job. I had a lot of those
corporate internships for so-called &quot;gifted&quot; black kids, so I got a
good sense of what that was like, and it was pure hell -- I knew I'd do anything
never to have to do that. <o:p>
</o:p>
 <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CF:
</i></b>
Are you able to help other actors when you work with them? <o:p>
</o:p>
 <o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>SPT:
</i></b>
It depends on who I'm working with. Aside from <i>The District</i>, I mostly
work with actors who are far younger than me. And I've had a couple of them tell
me that I help them do better. And vice versa: I've worked with people who are
17 or 18 years old, and they have access to things, certain spontaneous
instincts, that I've suppressed because of my training. And on the flipside,
they say, &quot;Sean, you can come back and do that scene eight times and hit
your mark every time.&quot; That's technique and training. So it goes back and
forth. I'm still learning. <o:p>
