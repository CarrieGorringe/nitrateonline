            review by <a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>, 21 September
            2001</i></font>
            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">As big, overweight, balding 
            puppies go, <i>Haiku Tunnel</i>, which bills itself as &quot;an office 
            comedy,&quot; cuddles up on its own self-impressed throw rug and pretty 
            much stays there for a ninety-minute nap. In this case, trying to 
            wring imagined excitement out of the wacky world of temping is about 
            as stimulating as trying to unclog a jammed copy machine. Josh 
            Kornbluth has taken his ten-year-old San Francisco-based 
            working-geek-show and expanded it for the big screen. But on that 
            road from monologue to cinematic enlightenment, Mr. Kornbluth and 
            his younger brother Jacob (who wasn't even alive when Josh reached 
            Bar Mitzvah age) have fashioned a paste-up effort in which the 
            filmmakers seem to be hoping for Xerox technology to enlarge (by 
            125%) their low budget expectations and slender, plain vanilla 
            script. The result is a small film that I don't expect will grow 
            beyond its limited target audience as an art house oddity or as a 
            training film for Kelly Services rejects. <i>Haiku Tunnel</i>, a 
            pseudo-mockumentary for the nine-to-five temp crowd, is not nearly 
            as cleaver as its creators think. I suspect Josh's nagging narration 
            and omnipresent character (he's rarely off screen) will weigh too 
            much on those who expect more from their temp agencies and today's 
            budding film directors.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The elder Kornbluth plays a hapless 
            character not unlike himself. Heck, he even calls him Josh Kornbluth. 
            How eponymous! He plops his chubby face smack in front of the 
            camera, telling us his story is based in the &quot;fictional&quot; town of San 
            Franclisco. <i>Wink, wink.</i> And he disclaims that only reel 
            lawyers were used in the making of this film. Part absurdist 
            autobiographical simulation, part self-indulgent fantasy, the film's 
            &quot;hero&quot; looks more like he ate a few too many on his lunch break. As 
            an employee of the Uniforce Agency, every day brings new ethical and 
            social conundrums for Josh, who'd rather sneak a few keystrokes at 
            this job and that writing his great American novel (we're still 
            waiting). His transient world changes when his ineptitude is 
            immediately appreciated at the smallish tax law firm of Shelby and 
            Mitchell. The writers (the Kornbluth brothers and John Bellucci, 
            whose resume is completely absent from the film's pressbook—don't 
            worry, he's real, playing a &quot;spastic dancing nerd&quot; in the film) have 
            a field day playing up the S&amp;M jokes, but they're generally pallid 
            stabs at humor. His temporal universe comes unstuck when he's 
            offered a permanent position on the staff, with the deal clincher 
            coming when icy office manager Marlina D'Amore (Helen Shumaker) 
            agrees to cover his psychotherapy costs. That must be a big 
            contractual concern for West Coast office workers.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After crossing over from temp to 
            perm, Josh short circuits in fits of tardiness and dunderheadedness, 
            even though he appears to be handling the same office chores. All 
            those habits that made him so attractive to his new employers are 
            cast off in Josh's fitful fear of commitment. The rest of the film 
            focuses on office politics and the growing pressure he's under to 
            mail seventeen important letters for his stoic boss Bob Shelby 
            (Warren Keith). Procrastination and other messy circumstances 
            intervene; luckily Josh's fellow workers DaVonne (June A. Lomena), 
            Clifford (Brian Thorstenson) and Mindy (Amy Resnick) quickly 
            diagnose his illness and prescribe a cure that takes on mission: 
            improbable seriousness. At which point Josh steps out of the frying 
            pan into the fire of passion when Julie Faustino (Sarah Overman), 
            mistakes the lowly office worker on an exercise in skullduggery for 
            a fellow attorney. So the Big Lie becomes the Big Joke in <i>Haiku 
            Tunnel</i>. Unfortunately, Josh is so screwed up there's not much to 
            like of him by the end of the movie.</font></p>
