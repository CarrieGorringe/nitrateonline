            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In this week's entry for worst
            movie comedy of the year, Martin Lawrence plays a professional thief
            who is surprised, while in the act of committing a burglary, by a
            corporate tycoon (Danny DeVito), who, at gunpoint, demands that the
            thief hand over a ring he is wearing. The tycoon is going through
            bankruptcy proceedings, and justifies his act by saying that the
            ring will bring him luck. The ring was a gift to the thief by his
            new girlfriend (Carmen Ejogo), and in his attempts to get it back,
            he goes to further and further lengths to take down the tycoon who
            gloatingly &quot;robbed the robber&quot;.</b></font><i><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></i></p>
            <p><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">What's the Worst That Could Happen?</font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2"> is based on a
            Donald E. Westlake novel (Westlake wrote the novel and screenplay
            adaptation for <i>The Grifters</i>), and, aside from the terrific
            central idea involving the ring, has all the makings of a
            comedy-thriller about one-upmanship. None of which materializes. The
            movie starts out in London, then, without telling the audience,
            shifts to Boston, then on to Washington, D.C. All the settings and
            locations look the same. (The film was actually made entirely in the
            Boston and Cambridge, Massachusetts area, which at least accounts
            for the absence of shots where the characters walk or drive by the
            Capitol Building or the Washington Monument.) The characters of the
            thief and the tycoon are never really defined, so there's no feeling
            of a battle-of-wits being waged, connivance-wise or otherwise, and
            the plot moves from one situation to another without much rhyme or
            reason. (The tycoon, for instance, never notices the absence of a
            Fabergé egg, one of the most fabulously rare collectibles, and
            status symbols, in the world. And a second residence of his, loaded
            with paintings and artwork, is burglarized with all the simplicity
            of opening a Zip-Loc bag.) At one point, Martin Lawrence tosses the
            precious ring away, but in the very next shot you can clearly see
            that it is still on his hand.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Lawrence doesn't so much give a
            performance, here, as do a series of comedy riffs which are strung
            together (some Stevie Wonder here, a little Richard Pryor there).
            But he looks a lot better than Danny DeVito, who plays the same kind
            of grubby little conniver that he used to play twenty years ago but
            which, as a performer, he has way since progressed beyond doing.
            DeVito does some luvy-duvy-oochy-smoochie-snuggy-buggy stuff with a
            couple of the female characters during the early part of the movie
            (which may explain why Glenne Headly, who plays the tycoon's psychic
            advisor, doesn't make eye contact with him during most of their
            scenes), after which he screams his way through the rest of the
            picture and never lets up.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Some of the humor is pretty
            deplorable, too: Lawrence and John Leguizamo pretend to be Arab
            sheiks in one scene, and there's a long, long bit where DeVito
            bellows a blue streak of dialogue which is simultaneously translated
            by a sign language interpreter, verbatim. Most surprising is the
            appearance of William Fichner as a police inspector who speaks
            breathily and moves about in the long, swooning manner of a
            grandiose drag queen. It's a bit of a shock at first, because it's
            as if the film is trying to bring back the kind of gay stereotype
            that went out with the damp, loathsome homophobic scenes in the 1968
            film <i>The Detective</i>, but the joke, here, is that none of the
            other characters, including the inspector's fellow police officers,
            act like they notice or care. (In the production notes, Fichner says
            that he deliberately took the role just so that he could turn it on
            its head, and you can see how he takes the character with all of its
            clichés intact and tries to play it in a non-clichéd way, an
            almost Herculean effort.)</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you've gotten this far, you've
            probably already decided whether you're going to see the movie or
            not, but I must make one final mention regarding poor (and I mean
            that sincerely) Sascha Knopf, who plays the little cutie whom
            DeVito's tycoon keeps on the side. (The tycoon has a wife, played by
            Nora Dunn, and I must also admit that it's nice to see Dunn, a
            talented comedienne who was unceremoniously dumped from the cast of
            &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; some years ago, in a substantial
            film role.) In one scene, Knopf has to wear a short, knit halter top
            which, shall we say, presents the female form in a way which is
            neither flattering or attractive to look at. She then has to bend
            over while facing the camera, repeatedly. It is absolutely
            stupefying, and I hope the filmmakers are satisfied with themselves.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
