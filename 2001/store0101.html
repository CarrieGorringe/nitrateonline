<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Top-secret United Nations dirty tricks
operative Shaw (Wesley Snipes) is hung out to dry by unscrupulous superiors in a
tense and rainy New York City (actually Montreal) in <i>The Art of War</i>, a
needlessly labyrinthine and ultimately numbing new action thriller from Canadian
director Christian Duguay, who fared much better with the 1995 sci-fi/horror
film <i>Screamers</i>. Snipes has subsisted on a kind of &quot;righteous player
on the run&quot; routine for a good number of movies now (<i>Drop Zone</i>, <i>Murder
at 1600</i>, <i>U.S. Marshals</i>), and even though he’s leavened his career
with more serious parts (<i>One Night Stand</i>, <i>Down in the Delta</i>),
he’s at serious risk of caricaturing himself. Not surprisingly, the best
things about this film are Canadian: even when he phones it in, Donald
Sutherland as the U.N. ambassador is never less than regal, and rumpled
character actor Maury Chaykin is affably implacable as an FBI agent on Shaw’s
tale. And the action sequences, particularly a zig-zag footrace the plot demands
Snipes run not once but twice, exhibit Duguay’s facility for large-canvas
action scenes. Yet the entire endeavor might best be summed up by one character,
who describes the shadowy action within the film as &quot;reality mixed with
illusion mixed with bullsh*t.&quot; The bare-bones DVD offers Dolby Digital 5.1
only, with no commentary or extras.</font><font face="Verdana">&nbsp;<o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the year 3000, rebellious young
&quot;man-animal&quot; Jonnie Goodboy Tyler (Barry Pepper, the prescient sniper
from <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>) matches wits with security chief Terl (John
Travolta), representing the thuggish and gangly race of Psychlos who have
conquered the planet and are mining it for gold before destroying the roving
bands of surviving humans in and around the ruins of Denver, and blowing it up.
Think of the most miscalculated, unbalance, ill-conceived high-profile movies: <i>Howard
the Duck</i>, <i>The Postman</i> (with which this shares a sketchy,
post-apocalyptic future), maybe that Al Pacino movie <i>Revolution</i> (or <i>Bobby
Deerfield</i>, take your pick). <i>Battlefield Earth</i> trumps them all, mixing
a very weird, slang-filled sense of humor that finds its characters finding many
uses for the word &quot;crap&quot; with a cheesy look and feel made even more
galling by the fact that director Roger Christian actually won an Oscar for set
direction once upon a time (for the first, uh, fourth <i>Star Wars</i> -- the
one in 1977). When a Hollywood star initiates a vanity production there’s
usually some vanity involved, yet John Travolta, who shepherded this adaptation
of L. Ron Hubbard’s novel to the screen, has conceived Hubbard’s Psychlos as
dreadlocked giants with guttural speech and huge hands (and no, he doesn’t
seem to be grinding some Scientologist ax, either overtly or subliminal). They
might be accurate according to the book, but onscreen they’re not only less
than intimidating, but just plain icky. And Christian’s visual style is
fundamentally irritating, a jumble of mismatched shots and crazy angles that is
all wrong for the material. Incredibly, a supposed selling point of the DVD is
Travolta’s make-up test, one of a handful of the disc’s handful of features
and hidden bonuses which only the truly dedicated or demented will bother to
mine.<o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Young Violet (Piper Perabo) travels the forty-two miles
from South Amboy, New Jersey to the wilds of New York City intending to be a
performer, only to be waylaid as a &quot;Coyote&quot; -- part bartender, part
camp counselor, part stripper -- in the impossibly wild watering hole of the
title. A throbbing male fantasy posing as a popular entertainment, producer
Jerry Bruckheimer’s second of three films released in 2000 (it was bookended
by the equally weighty <i>Gone in Sixty Seconds</i> and <i>Remember the Titans</i>)
is the kind of movie where everyone in Joisey has an accent except Our Heroine,
whose childhood chum finds a parking spot right in front of the chicly
fleabitten tenement to which she relocates. Debuting director David McNally
brings a <i>Flashdance</i>-y energy to this improbable cocktail, which never
rise much above a supercharged hodgepodge of show-business wannabe clichés
(although screenwriter Gina Wendkos did write a terrifically perceptive play
called <i>Ginger Ale Afternoon</i> some eleven years ago -- a movie of which
might still be floating around the video shop). The entertaining -- if wildly
uneven -- supporting cast includes Maria Bello (formerly of <i>E.R.</i> ) as
heart-of-gold owner Lil, model Tyra Banks as one of the barmaids, John Goodman
as Violet’s grudgingly supportive dad (whose climactic bar dance is a
highlight), LeAnn Rimes as herself, director Michael Bay (the upcoming <i>Pearl
Harbor</i>) as a Village Voice photographer, <i>Mad TV&quot;s</i> Alex Borstein
as a lusty patron and Bud Cort (Harold in <i>Harold and Maude</i>) in a
blink-and-you’ll-miss-him bit as a counterman. The DVD features a number of
production featurettes, deleted scenes (!!!) and a music video by Rimes.<o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the posh Georgetown section of Washington DC, young
Regan (Linda Blair) becomes possessed by the devil, and must undergo a violent
and horrifying exorcism at the hands of Fathers Merrin (Max von Sydow) and
Karras (Jason Miller) under the watchful eye of her mother Chris (Ellen Burstyn).
Among the greatest of contemporary horror films, <i>The Exorcist</i> survived
the creative tussling of author William Peter Blatty and director William
Friedkin to emerge a taut, absorbing, completely plausible horror thriller. Now,
after a &quot;25<sup>th</sup> anniversary&quot; tape and DVD edition, followed
by the surprise box office success of &quot;The Version You’ve Never
Seen,&quot; the latter cut of the film comes to video (priced to rent) and DVD.
For the record, there are approximately eleven minutes of previously cut footage
woven into the whole, the bulk of which involve an early psychiatric examination
of Regan and Chris’ discussion of it with her doctor (who prescribes the then-unkown
Ritalin). A major downer of the new disc is Friedkin’s morose and literal
commentary, which comes across as more of a pitch; in his zeal to describe
what’s happening on screen (often mouthing dialogue with the characters), he
completely forgets to point out such interesting trivia as Blatty’s early
crowd-scene cameo (&quot;Mr. Blatty,&quot; he calls him later) or the grotesque
and shocking &quot;spiderwalk&quot; sequence (which can be glimpsed in the
documentary accompanying the previous DVD issue). While the track is of interest
to those who prize structure and character motivation, there’s little else to
recommend it. And leaving aside the admitted value of the added footage to the
film’s overall impact, the numerous versions of the film in print smack of a
distasteful manipulation on Warner Bros.’ part. Sure, it’s a great movie,
but enough already with versions of <i>The Exorcist</i>.<o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When a child goes missing outside a Toronto apartment
block, the resulting investigation accelerates and reveals the subtle linkages
of the tenants, each of whom unconsciously represents a sensory perception:
there’s massuese Ruth (Gabrielle Rose), teenagers Rachel (Nadia Litz) and
Rupert (Brendan Fletcher), baker Rona (Mary-Louise Parker), bisexual
housecleaner Robert (Daniel McIvor), and opthamologist Richard (Philippe Volter).
As these five stories unfold, the viewer is invited into a unique and
enthralling universe where everything is familiar but at the same time fraught
with new and provocative meaning. &quot;<i>The Five Senses</i>,&quot; says
writer-director Jeremey Podeswa, &quot;has always been, for me, a film about the
difficulties we encounter when we venture outside ourselves… We live in a
cynical age, but the natural senses predate urbanity, ennui, jadedness. The
senses are elemental, and in connecting us to the world, they connect us to
others.&quot; Winner of the Best Canadian Feature Film award at the 1999 Toronto
Film Festival and a Best Director Genie for Podeswa (whose sophomore feature
this is), <i>The Five Senses</i> is a remarkable exercise in pure filmmaking
that is at once visually rigorous and emotionally enveloping. Warner’s austere
DVD release is coded for Dolby Digital 5.1.<o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Twelve hours in the lives of San Francisco area kids
attending a rave in an abandoned warehouse refitted for the event. A blissed-out
and thus dramatically flimsy feature film debut from writer-director-editor Greg
Harrison, <i>Groove</i> gets into a shallow one early, opting for a simplistic
approach to character development and story structure that plays more like a
series of quasi-dramatic events strung together by sequences of music and joyful
dance than a traditional beginning-middle-end plot (perhaps just how one of
these raves play out over the course of a night). The best of these stories
involves David (Hamish Linklater), the straight-arrow brother of rave vet Colin
(Denny Kirkwood), who loosens his inhibitions long enough to take some ecstasy
and relate to Leyla (Lola Glaudini), a transplanted New Yorker who advises him
to breathe deeply and drink lots of water to counteract the drug (gee, is that
all it takes?). While this gentle utopia may be appealing to the susceptible
teen looking to surf the current zeitgeist, the cumulative effect is less of
thrill-seeking than ennui; when someone describes the look he’s going for as
&quot;a suburban living room meets opium den kinda thing,&quot; the similarity
to the finished product carries no small irony. Best moment: when an awestruck
DJ tells real-life turntable wunderkind John Digweed (one of many playing
themselves) &quot;if you’re ever in Fresno, I do a weekly there…&quot; The
&quot;Special Edition&quot; DVD features numerous extras, including a commentary
track, behind-the-scenes footage, deleted material, auditions and camera tests,
the Bedrock music video for &quot;Heaven Sent,&quot; and a choice of letterboxed
or full-frame presentations.<o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana"><o:p><font size="2">Hollow man, hollow movie: brash researcher Sebastian
Caine (Kevin Bacon) decides to use himself as a guinea pig for advanced
experiments in invisibility, only to succumb to paranoia and rage at his new
isolation. The latest slick, high-decibel action opus from Paul Verhoeven is a
decided step down from his previous high water mark <i>Starship Troopers </i>(also
shot by Jost Vacano), due in large part to the same strategy that made that film
a success: a quasi-no-name cast and a cheerful flaunting of the genre
conventions under which it labors. As has been a hallmark of Verhoeven’s work
since 1987’s <i>Robocop</i>, the violence is unexpectedly and brutally blunt
and the special effects are first-rate, depicting the process from seen to
unseen as a gruesome yet fascinating layering of bone, veins, tissue and skin.
Yet for all its efforts the movie itself is unable to achieve a similar depth,
with the maneuvering between Bacon and his long-suffering minions conceived as
high drama but executed as little more than the connecting, uh, tissue between
high-tech set-pieces. The slickly-packaged DVD includes a commentary track with
Verhoeven, Bacon and producer Andrew Marlowe; the HBO production featurette;
three deleted scenes with director commentary; and, of greatest value to the
collector, an isolated music track with commentary from legendary composer Jerry
Goldsmith (<i>The Man From U.N.C.L.E.</i>, <i>Chinatown</i>, the Oscar-winning <i>The
Omen</i>).<o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Farrelly brothers' latest piece of calculated
outrage, <i>Me, Myself &amp; Irene</i> has Jim Carrey playing a state trooper
who develops a second, more aggressive personality in response to the way
everyone keeps using him as a doormat; when he has to transport a pretty young
woman (Reneé Zellweger) across state lines, his second personality keeps coming
out and won't go away. Less a matter of bad jokes (bodily fluids fly, cows get
wrestled to the ground and held at gunpoint, plastic sex toys are hurled, etc.)
than of bad storytelling: Carrey wrestles with himself and with trying to bring
two superficially drawn characters to life, while Zellweger keeps slamkicking
him over and over again. The two of them could be pounding sides of beef in a
cooler. The late Rex Allen, who narrated the Walt Disney <i>True Life Adventure</i>
short films, also narrates this picture, and nobody seems to know why. The DVD
features a commentary track from the brothers, deleted scenes with optional
commentary, production vignettes, a &quot;making of&quot; featurette and the Foo
Fighters video for <i>Breakout</i>.<o:p>

Miguel (Kenneth Branagh), equipped with a loftier vision, win a map to the title
treasure in a game of dice, fall into cahoots with explorer Hernando Cortes on
his journey to South America, get the girl (Rosie Perez) and even help invent
basketball. Sort of a cross between one of those old Bing Crosby/Bob Hope
&quot;Road&quot; pictures (1945’s <i>Road to Utopia</i> has always been a
favorite) and John Huston’s <i>The Man Who Would Be King</i>, <i>The Road to
El Dorado</i> is an amiable yet shallow animated film (and don’t even think
about historical accuracy), proving that in this new era of commercial viability
for the form, there will be pedestrian films in this genre just like there are
in every other phase of Hollywood filmmaking. Still, DreamWorks SKG’s strides
in the production of this kind of movie, under the stewardship of studio partner
Jeffrey Katzenberg (the &quot;K&quot; in SKG), is impressive: <i>Chicken Run</i>
was also bankrolled by DreamWorks and is one of the best movies of 2000, and
they’re also the studio of record for <i>The Prince of Egypt</i>. <i>The Road
to El Dorado</i> features some nice verbal interplay between Kline and Branagh,
a half-dozen new songs by Tim Rice and Elton John (the popstar-turned-composer
also narrates the action) and a message-free mood that is, in its own goofy way,
rather liberating. The extras-laden DVD includes an informative fold-out
booklet, a behind-the-scenes featurette, filmmakers’ commentary track, an
Elton John video and oodles of interactive content for younger viewers.<o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">During the New Year’s Eve celebration in San Juan,
police commissioner Victor Benezet (Morgan Freeman) and prominent local attorney
and philanthropist Henry Hearst (Gene Hackman) play a tense game of
cat-and-mouse over the recent murders of two young girls. What begins as a
ten-minute meeting prior to a glitzy fundraiser turns into a night of
accusations and maneuvering that sucks in Hearst’s young trophy wife Chantel
(Monica Bellucci, <i>Malena</i> and one of Dracula’s brides in Coppola’s <i>Bram
Stoker’s Dracula</i>) as well as Benezet’s hotheaded colleague Felix Owens
(Thomas Jane, from <i>Boogie Nights</i> and <i>Deep Blue Sea</i>). <i>Under
Suspicion</i>, which is a remake of Claude Miller’s highly regarded 1980
French film <i>Garde à Vu</i> (currently out of print), isn’t a bad movie,
exactly, just… unnecessary. Freeman, whose company produced the film,
doesn’t find much new in essentially the same character he played in both <i>Seven</i>
and <i>Kiss the Girls</i>, while the always-dependable Hackman seems weary and
fussy beyond the demands of Hearst’s defiant discomfort. The best thing about
the film is the fluid visual strategy employed by director Stephen Hopkins (<i>Lost
in Space</i>), who opens the action up from the single office set by playing
provocatively with time and points of view. It is within these shards of memory
that <i>Under Suspicion</i> feels most at home. Alas, there are no extras on the
DVD to explain its methods or trace its odd existence.<o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Can’t you people see there are guns here?&quot;
In a contemporary American southwest redolent of Sams Shepard and Peckinpah,
tough-guy punk loners &quot;Parker&quot; (Ryan Philippe) and &quot;Longbaugh&quot;
(Benicio del Toro), possessed of an almost mystical form of silent
communication, bite off more than they can chew by kidnapping the woman (Juliette
Lewis) carrying the baby of a local kingpin (Scott Wilson). The directorial
debut of Christopher McQuarrie, who won an Oscar for writing <i>The Usual
Suspects</i>, <i>The Way of the Gun</i> is a gleefully defiant genre exercise
that combines a savvy understanding of lowlife honor codes with the more violent
and surreal elements of movies like <i>The Wild Bunch</i> and <i>Bring Me the
Head of Alfredo Garcia</i>. Thus, the duo is able to appear both noble and
doomed, defiant young men in the service of an urge for violence and bloodshed
that seems predestined, yet somehow almost righteous. McQuarrie clearly
doesn’t care what you think of the film’s morals (or lack thereof), and over
time that gambit becomes strangely refreshing. James Caan is terrific in his
best tough-guy supporting role in eons, and that’s Lewis’ father Geoffrey
(Clint Eastwood’s sidekick in those monkey movies) as his resigned associate,
who has a great death scene. Artisan Entertainment’s stylish DVD edition
features a 16x9 version (the film was shot in muted earth tones by Mike
Leigh’s long-time cameraman Dick Pope), script and storyboards for a deleted
scene and a commentary track with McQuarrie and composer Joe Kraemer. Of
overriding interest, however, is an isolated track with Kraemer’s commentary
that highlights his muscular and percussive score, an exhilarating throwback to
such 1970s action movies as <i>Dirty Harry</i> and <i>The Taking of Pelham, One
Two Three</i>. Note that people named &quot;McQuarrie&quot; were responsible for
costume design, weapons and on-set massage. &quot;Karma’s only justice without
satisfaction,&quot; someone says, and that pretty much sums up the cold clarity
inherent in <i>The Way of the Gun</i>. For another cracking good kidnap caper,
see Akira Kurosawa’s <i>High and Low</i> (preferably the Criterion Collection
DVD edition).<o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Made by director Robert Zemeckis while on hiatus in the
middle of the <i>Cast Away</i> shoot, <i>What Lies Beneath</i> stars Michelle
Pfeiffer as a woman who senses all is not right in the house she shares with her
husband (Harrison Ford), and that it all has something to do with some
wrongdoing that may have occurred there not that long before. The first hour is
splendid -- the picture does for bathtubs what <i>Psycho</i> did for showers --
and Pfeiffer's performance is superb; during the second hour, the filmmakers
push their luck, and the picture goes right off the table, but Pfeiffer's
performance remains superb and holds one's attention even during some of the
most outlandish moments. Diana Scarwid is also excellent in the role of the
heroine's friend from the big city. The DreamWorks DVD features Zemeckis’
commentary track, production notes, a theatrical trailer and a behind-the-scenes
production featurette. <o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In late 1960s southern California,renegade scientist
DeMarco (John Carradine, father of, uh, all those other Carradines) has
unleashed the bloodthirsty mutant of the title on an unsuspecting populace. Who
will track down the monster first: will it be a team of CIA agents led by
office-bound Wendell Corey (who, seemingly surprised to be in the film, glowers
in front of a portrait of Lyndon Johnson) -- or a gang of hinky Mexican secret
agents who take orders from the slit-skirted Tura Satana (of Russ Meyer’s <i>Faster,
Pussycat, Kill! Kill!</i> fame), whose idea of problem-solving is to shoot
anyone who disagrees with her or obeys too slowly. Directed, co-written and
edited by horror vet Ted V. Mikels (who went on to write and helm the immortally
titled <i>Corpse Grinders</i> and <i>Blood Orgy of the She Devils</i>) in a
style not unlike the popular 1960s TV show <i>Batman </i>(whip-pan cutaways
between scenes, the same credit font), <i>The Astro-Zombies </i>was co-written
and co-produced by Wayne Rogers, who segued to some fame in the early years of
the <i>M*A*S*H</i> TV show. The film is bargain basement all the way, with
hopelessly stilted and convoluted dialogue (&quot;Prepare him for brain
transplant and total astro mobilization!&quot;) alternating with long real-time
passages where nothing much happens. There is an interesting sound design,
however, with heartbeats signifying the presence of the not-so-hideous mutants,
dripping water, whooshing electronics and what sounds like a Theremin in the
score. The print used for Image Entertainment’s DVD transfer is spotty at
best, with crisp sequences alternating with fuzzy, washed-out stretches and a
couple of tears in the print (a fullframe theatrical trailer of poor quality but
possessed of a pleasing urgency is the only extra). &quot;Quickly now! The blood
exchanger!&quot;.<o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A story combining the Creation and a <i>Frankenstein</i>-ish
genre plot is brought to life in fuzzy, nightmarish black and white, with an
ethereal soundtrack of wind, nature and secret things. Among the most unique and
exciting American experimental films of the last decade, this debut feature by
E. Elias Merhige -- director of the John Malkovich/Willem Dafoe horror dramedy <i>Shadow
of the Vampire</i> (see also <i>Nosferatu</i>, below) -- is unlike anything
you’ve ever seen; think Stan Brakhage at the helm of The <i>Texas Chainsaw
Massacre</i> or early David Lynch and you’re in the right zip code.
Unrelentingly intense and profoundly disturbing, the film is an early, visionary
example of distressed cinema, with Merhige (who’s spent the intervening decade
in the theater and directing Marilyn Manson videos) taking in excess of ten
hours per minute of film to reprocess and otherwise alter the image. The
cumulative effect is disconcerting and immensely thought-provoking, prompting
the viewer to question not only fundamental beliefs but the very idea of seeing
the world as well. Although not previewed at press time, the World Artists DVD
release promises a souvenir booklet, interactive menus, a theatrical trailer
and, most tantalizing, a gallery of previously unseen stills and color
production photos. The company is to be congratulated for bringing this
little-known yet pivotal work back to the marketplace.<o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In 1980s Hong Kong, counterfeiters Mark (Chow Yun Fat)
and Ho Tse Sung (Ti Lung) are framed on a bust and separated for three years,
after which they team up to wreak revenge on their betrayers while staying one
step ahead of Sung’s brother, Kit (Leslie Cheung), a rookie cop who blames his
sibling for the death of their father. Although difficult to view properly for
nearly a decade (poor prints, worse subtitles, wretched video dupes), the effect
of these two films on the contemporary Hollywood blockbuster is incalculable,
providing as they did an entrée into the business for director John Woo, who
counts among his recent movies both the exhilarating <i>Face/Off</i> and the
enough-already<i> Mission: Impossible 2</i>, and Chow, currently starring in the
breakout hit <i>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</i>. It’s all here in
rudimentary form: Woo’s ballets of bullets and bodies, the melodramatic male
bonding (Chow is the essence of cool) and the stylized visual effects. Pressed
into a sequel by producer Tsui Hark, Woo dances with who brung him in the
sequel, sticking close to the plot and structure of the original -- even
inventing a twin brother for Mark, who’s offed in the first installment. The
Anchor Bay DVD releases offer clear widescreen transfers (enhanced for 16x9
TV’s), crisp subtitles, theatrical trailers in both English and Cantonese and
talent bios. The original Chinese title translates as &quot;The Nature of
Heroes,&quot; a fitting moniker for the subsequent success of <i>A Better
Tomorrow</i>’s director and star. <o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In contemporary Manhattan, prostitute Claire Dolan
(Catrin Kartlidge) tries to break free of the profession with the help of taxi driver
Elton (Vincent D’Onofrio) and against the wishes of her pimp Roland (Colm
Meaney), but finds that her expertise with men doesn’t extend to trust or
being completely independent from them. This second feature by Lodge Kerrigan (<i>Clean,
Shaven</i>, which is about schizophrenia) is distant, cold, and formal, but that
doesn’t make it uninteresting by any means. Kartlidge, so fearless as Emily
Watson’s sister-in-law in <i>Breaking the Waves</i> and the roommate in Mike
Leigh’s <i>Naked</i>, is extraordinarily focused as the title character, an
Irish émigré so in touch with the defensive value of her emotional distance
that she finds it well nigh impossible to come closer to anyone. Meaney is all
beady-eyed menace as Roland, while D’Onofrio continues a remarkably varied
career as the quiet, sincere working-class lad who may or may not be Claire’s
savior. As usual, New Yorker Video’s letterboxed transfer is first-rate (this
release is exclusive to video and moderately priced at $49.95), preserving the
hard edges of the film’s look and feel. Seldom has a movie dealt with
prostitution in so unsentimental a fashion, and seldom has that strategy
resulted in a film so unutterably sad. <o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Of the slew of Blaxploitation pictures currently being
re-released on video and especially DVD, <i>Cotton Comes to Harlem</i> is among
the earliest and best of a genre that seems now forever associated with the
1970s in which it flourished. The writing and directing debut of actor Ossie
Davis (from the novel by Chester Himes), the genial, action-packed film stars
Godfrey Cambridge and Raymond St. Jacques as plainclothes cops Gravedigger Jones
and Coffin Ed Johnson, who become involved with &quot;Back to Africa&quot;
preacher Calvin Lockhart and a stash of cash hidden in the title textile. The
neat supporting cast features Cleavon Little (still aways off from <i>Blazing
Saddles</i>), Lou Jacobi and Redd Foxx as Uncle Bud. <i>Cotton</i> was followed
by a 1972 sequel, <i>Come Back, Charleston Blue</i>, and is not to be confused
with <i>Hell Up in Harlem</i> (1973), legendary B movie director Larry Cohen’s
energetic sequel to the Fred Williamson starrer <i>Black Caesar</i>   (aka <i>The
Godfather of Harlem</i>, 1973). Also of interest is Norman Jewison’s earlier,
more serious treatment of racial tensions (rural division), 1967’s multi-Oscared
<i>In the Heat of the Night</i>, which was scheduled to make its DVD debut on
the same date as <i>Cotton Comes to Harlem</i> as well as numerous other titles
of the genre. <o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">One of the best films of the 1990s, and one of the few
to communicate the experience of the creative process. Victor Erice's 1992 film
follows Spanish painter Antonio Lopez as he attempts to capture the subject of
his latest painting, the quince tree that grows in the backyard of his home in
Madrid as it look in the light of the late summer sun. We see Lopez's acumen and
patience as he makes accomplishments and encounters setbacks in the step-by-step
process which he takes in realizing his goal, from setting stakes into the
ground so that his stance will be the same at his easel from one day to the
next, marking the leaves and quinces on the tree with dabs of paint that serve
as reference points for when the branches lower with the change of seasons, and
dealing with more uncontrollable elements such as the weather (Lopez does not
begin his painting until late September). Meanwhile, the film includes such
other elements as Lopez's tender relationship with his wife, Mari; a visiting
Chinese artist who is an admirer of Lopez's work; advice, wanted or otherwise,
from Lopez's longtime friend Enrique Gran, also a painter, and Polish workmen
who go about tearing apart and renovating Lopez's house, and on whose portable
radios news buzzes in the background about the reestablishment of diplomatic
ties between Russia and Israel, the reunification of Germany, and Saddam Hussein
calling for a jihad while warships steam into the Persian Gulf. The picture has
a beautiful, easy rhythm, along with a highly evocative visual style. It is one
of the few films that leaves you more invigorated after having watched it than
you may have felt before sitting down to do so. The <a href="http://www.facets.org"> Facets Video</a>
release is tape-only, with a price of $79.95. <o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Among the most inspired documentary ideas in recent
memory, <i>East Side Story</i> asks the immortal question &quot;who knows how
things might have turned out if socialism had just been more fun?&quot; To this
end, it gathers clips from pre-World War II and Iron Curtain-era musicals
produced from the 1930s to the 1960s in the USSR, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the
German Democratic Republic, Poland and Romania. With titles like <i>Hard Work,
Happy Holiday</i> and <i>Tractor Drivers</i> and <i>Vacation on the Black Sea</i>
and <i>The Swineherd and the Shepherd</i>, the films were envisioned to
entertain the working classes but are here analyzed by critics, actors,
technicians and even audience members (one scholar points out that people seemed
to need these films &quot;for no other reason than to survive&quot;). It’s
easy to laugh at the movie and that’s OK, but care has been taken to place the
genre in a context that will provoke sobering thought. The clips were researched
by an American, Andrew Horn, who lives in Berlin, and the film was directed by
Dana Ranga. Kino’s DVD transfer (the tape was released in late August) does
right by the meticulous attention to quality displayed by the filmmakers, and
although the disc has no enticing extras the clips are organized by title and
country for ease of access. Ranga and Horn are rumored to be at work on a sequel
examining science fiction films produced during the same period. <o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Recruited from the vaudeville stage by legendary comedic
Svengali Mack Sennett in 1923, Iowa-born silent era comedian Harry Langdon was
immensely popular with moviegoing audiences throughout that decade, a mournful,
simple-minded manchild who found humor in situations both recognizably mundane
and comically absurd. Yet by 1930 he had alienated those around him (including
young gagman/director Frank Capra), declared bankruptcy and begun a slide into
relative obscurity that ended with his death in 1944. Image Entertainment has
gathered three of his early features on a single DVD, beginning with his second
-- and best -- film, 1926’s <i>The Strong Man</i> (directed by Capra), in
which young Belgian vet Langdon (who looks a bit like Andy Kaufman with more
makeup) returns from the Great War and attempts to win his sweetheart. In his
first film, <i>Tramp, Tramp, Tramp</i> (1926), Harry stars alongside a young
Joan Crawford as the ambitious son of an embattled shoemaker who enters a
cross-country foot race. In Capra’s weird <i>Long Pants</i> (1927),
Langdon’s donning of the title trousers results in a comic odyssey to save his
newfound sweetheart -- a drug smuggler. Respected film restorer David Shepard
has done a superlative job of restoring these films (the release is a joint
effort of Image Entertainment and Kino on Video), which are more clean and crisp
than anyone had a right to hope for. <o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Curious about the gambler who has driven one of her
patients to the brink of suicide, popular psychiatrist and author Margaret
(Lindsay Crouse) leaves her bright and well-ordered world for the urban <i>House
of Games</i> and Mike (Joe Mantegna), a professional card sharp who promises to
amortize the patient’s debts if the shrink spends some time soaking up the
atmosphere with him. Appropriately enough, this writing-directing debut of David
Mamet enjoys a long-anticipated DVD-only debut close on the heels of the
nationwide rollout of his latest movie, <i>State and Main</i>. Yet while the new
work plays things strictly for acidic yet ultimately benevolent laughs, the
sinister atmosphere of this early effort leaves no room for comedic release;
peopled by many of the same weather-beaten faces -- grifters of one sort or
another picked up by the director in his underworld sojourns -- who would
congregate at the intersection of <i>State and Main</i> thirteen years later
(save for the brilliant and late lamented character actor J.T. Walsh), it
carries the sinister shock of the new and announced Mamet (who was then married
to Crouse) as a writer of extraordinary rhythm and a director whose static
compositions are often mistaken for dramatic lethargy.<o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A heartfelt if somewhat overheated melodrama set against
the Turkish immigrant transvestite community in contemporary Berlin, this
handsome fourth feature from L.A. and Istanbul-based writer-director Kutlug
Ataman displays lots of seamy atmosphere and some solid storytelling chops in
service to a tale best suited for a gay audience. Sixteen-year-old Murat is
hesitantly experimenting with his sexuality in parks and bars, dodging his
hostile classmates and uptight, gay-hating brother Osman. But when Murat falls
in with nightclub performer Lola (one third of the popular &quot;Gastarbeiter,&quot;
or &quot;Guest Worker,&quot; transvestite trio at a local club), his/her lover
Bilidikid (after Billy the Kid), closeted German aristo Friedrich and his
wisecracking mother Ute (a standout performance by Inge Keller), the teenager
learns that in this closed society very little stays secret for long. While not
exactly on the order of &quot;Norman Bates is his own mother,&quot; Murat’s
discovery of a family link to Lola underscores the secrecy inherent in the
lifestyle. Lola and Billy the Kid shared a jury prize from the nine gay and
lesbian fest programmers who bestow the popular annual Teddy Awards at the
Berlin International Film Festival. The release is exclusive to DVD. <o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Correctly hailed as the first and perhaps the best
version of Bram Stoker’s landmark horror classic &quot;Dracula,&quot; F. W.
Murnau’s <i>Nosferatu</i> was in fact an unauthorized adaptation of the book.
The resulting lawsuits resulted in the attempted destruction of the film, which
explains the dupey, truncated versions available over the years. Image
Entertainment’s new DVD release of this pivotal work (which follows the recent
Kino Video tape by almost a year to the day) goes a long way towards rectifying
that situation, adding the color tints and presenting it with a remarkable new
score (in 5.1 Dolby Digital) by the Silent Orchestra (Carlos Garza, Rich
O’Meara), which incorporates elements of the rich organ score by Timothy
Howard found on the Kino tape. Watch it for the historical importance, as Murnau
took the Expressionist movement outdoors and thus heightened the feeling of
otherworldly dread. Watch it for the intriguing tweaks to the story, as Van
Helsing’s character is minimized in favor of Orlok’s hold over the beautiful
Ellen. But most of all, watch it for Max Schreck’s astonishingly contemporary
performance as the demonic count, a repulsive creature with none of the suave
dignity of Bela Lugosi’s later interpretation. Plus you’ll be able to judge
for yourself if there’s a grain of truth to the premise behind E. Elias
Merhige’s <i>Shadow of the Vampire</i> (see <i>Begotten</i>, above) or if
Willem Dafoe’s reading of Schreck as a real-life vampire is indeed
Oscar-worthy. Also included on this disc is a &quot;Nosferatu tour,&quot; in
which silent film historian Lokke Heiss presents a series of 22 then-and-now
location photos, as well as some production sketches, early publicity material,
artistic influences and a bibliography. Like the count himself, this disc is one
for the ages. <o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Among the most formidable and affecting documentaries
ever made, <i>The Sorrow and the Pity</i> blends archival footage and interview
material conducted by filmmaker Marcel Ophuls to trace the history of the French
occupation during World War II in the modest industrial city of Clermont-Ferrand.
Initially rejected by French television, the film first opened in a tiny Left
Bank theater in Paris, growing in stature and acclaim to win an Oscar and be
used as a recurring motif in Woody Allen’s Annie Hall (this restoration was
released under the filmmaker’s name). Nothing less than inquiry into the
nature of complicity, tolerance and resiliency, the movie explores how ordinary
people conducted themselves in an extraordinary situation. As in art this chunk
of life has heroes, villains -- and even a soundtrack of Maurice Chevalier
chestnuts. Available for the first time in fifteen years and for the very first
time entirely undubbed and with new electronic subtitles, <i>The Sorrow and the
Pity</i> is being released exclusively to VHS -- in a two-tape set to
accommodate its 260-minute running time -- by Milestone Film &amp; Video
(800.603.1104) and is highly recommended for students of documentary, history
and humanism. <o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The life of unconventional artist/filmmaker/professional
celebrity Andy Warhol is explored, with particular emphasis on his legacy of
breaking down the barriers between art and advertising in the 1960s and 1970s
and his redefining of fame in the 1980s (according to one admirer he &quot;would
go to the opening of a drawer&quot;). Anyone with an interest in Hollywood knows
what director/editor/writer/producer Chuck Workman does: he’s the fellow who
assembles those breathtaking movie montages for the Academy Awards ceremonies,
and his short film <i>Precious Images</i>, although unavailable for home
viewing, is the definitive compendium of snapshots from a century-old art form
(the less said about his star-studded yet dramatically spotty fiction feature
work, the better). <i>Superstar </i>opens, and is punctuated by, dazzlingly
edited cavalcades of culturally pivotal footage and soundbites, placing Warhol
firmly in the firmament of icons he both promoted and helped define. Winstar’s
fullframe video and DVD editions of the film are clean and evocative (the disc
comes in a pink plastic case); its value may be summed up by former New York
Times critic Hilton Kramer, who once said of the artist &quot;he treated it all
as a game and the name of the game was success.&quot; <o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In 1860’s New Zealand, noble Maori warrior Te Wheke
(Anzac Wallace), once a guide for the British forces, rebels and seeks revenge
(&quot;utu,&quot; in Maori) against the outsiders for slaughtering his people.
This he accomplishes in a series of brutal and ferocious raids (&quot;I must
kill the white man,&quot; he cries in anguish before having ritual battle
tattoos applied to his entire face). Among the first films from New Zealand to
have an impact on the American art-house circuit (Roger Donaldson’s <i>Smash
Palace</i> was another), <i>Utu</i> finds its power in an emotional
unpredictability from sequence to sequence: the elegiac opening segues into a
brutal pre-credit massacre, and industry mainstay Bruno Lawrence brings Clint
Eastwood’s Man With No Name to mind as Williamson, the bearded, long-coated
mercenary who vows to stop Te Wheke’s reign of terror and bring the rebel to
&quot;justice&quot; for the murder of his wife. <i>Utu</i> was until that time
the most expensive film ever made in New Zealand (and its portrayal of Maori
culture feels authentic), with noteworthy cinematography from Graeme Cowley and
John Charles’ lush, mournful score setting a mood of both beauty and dread.
The new DVD and tape editions from Kino on Video is spotless, restoring
approximately 18 minutes of footage cut for the film’s initial American
release (this version now runs a full two hours). <o:p>

more important than baseball,&quot; &quot;Take Five&quot; composer Dave Brubeck
enthuses about jazz and its impact on society, and from the context it isn’t
entirely clear whether he’s referring to America’s national pastime and
indigenous music or Ken Burns’ marathon take on each. No matter: at ten
episodes with an average running time of nearly 107 minutes each (the first is
shortest at 86 minutes and episode eight is the longest at 122 minutes), for a
total running time of a whopping 1,066 minutes -- well over 17 hours -- <i>Jazz</i>
the movie is for all intents and purposes as important as jazz the music,
tracing its New Orleans roots in the 1890s all the way up to today’s scene.
Along the way there are thousands of film and video clips, interviews with
various critics, writers and and performers (with Wynton Marsalis the most
prominent and unabashedly enthusiastic) and, of course, the music: excerpts from
497 separate pieces, from the 1920s Jazz Age through big band to post-World War
II bebop and even 1970s fusion. While some are arguing that the series dwells to
long on the Swing Era of the late 1920s through the war at the expense of the
last two decades, while others object to the omission of certain artists, the
naysayers are missing the point: this wealth of detailed information, like
democracy itself (to which jazz is often referred to as a symbol of), is focused
yet messy, inclusive to a fault but by it’s very nature unable to take it all
in. As such, the film is an invaluable tool not only as a history of the major
players, but a way to clear up confusion over lesser-known but nonetheless
important musicians, the Chick Webbs and Charlie Hadens who have either faded
from memory or haven’t achieved the household-name status of the Duke or
Satchmo or Bird or Dizzy. The Public Broadcasting Service has partnered with
Warner Bros. for this handsome release, which comes on ten separate discs in a
sturdy cardboard box. The booklet in disc one has a brief episode guide and
details on the surprise extras, which include a 16-minute featurette
&quot;Making of Jazz&quot; on disc one, Louis Armstrong’s complete 1933
Denmark performance of &quot;I Cover the Waterfront&quot; on disc two, Duke
Ellington’s &quot;C-Jam Blues&quot; performed in a 1942 short called Jam
Session, and Miles Davis performing the complete &quot;New Rhumba&quot; with Gil
Evans conducting on a 1959 television program (the trumpeter’s earliest filmed
appearance). Also worth mentioning is the velvety narration of actor Keith David
(who may also be seen currently in Darren Aronofsky’s <i>Requiem for a Dream</i>),
who brings just the right tones of urgency and soothing to the material. But the
key feature of the set, and one that elevates it to must-own status, is the
music information mode, whereby the viewer can choose to have each piece of
music discreetly identified in the lower left-hand corner during play. Click on
the title, and a screen showing detailed information on the song is displayed
while the film is running. Thus it is possible to develop a pleasing rhythm of
clicking on songs as they go by, enriching the total experience in true
multimedia fashion. On the downside, viewers who wish to watch the DVD on their
computers must put up with the annoying PC Friendly program, which installs
itself with barely a warning and is apparently the only software under which it
will run. Strike your own blow for freedom by deleting the program immediately
after viewing. In all, this set is the sweet lowdown on a vital musical heritage
much in need of the spotlight; to paraphrase the movie itself, &quot;above all,
Jazz swings.&quot; <o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Among the most audacious and subversive conjurers in the
cinema, Dusan Makavejev (b. 1932, Belgrade) used the do-it-yourself filmmaking
aesthetic necessitated by his Yugoslav birth and upbringing, combined with a
keen appreciation for psychology (in which he majored at university) -- and an
eternally controversial championing of the libido over all -- to fashion some of
the most distinctive and freewheeling feature films ever conceived. Built
largely around staged sequences featuring actors improvising in real-life
situations (often supplemented by &quot;found&quot; footage), each work is a
volatile mix of drama and documentary, comedy and tragedy, sex and politics, all
uniquely informed by the filmmaker’s nomadic lifestyle. After years of spotty
availability, Facets Video has assembled six of his 10 features to date
(including his first four) into one cohesive package that charts the
improvisational yet firmly focused concerns of this visionary, provocative
filmmaker. In <i>Man is Not a Bird</i> (<i>&#268;ovek</i> <i>nije Tica</i>,
Yugoslavia, 1965), an engineer assembling machinery in a small town finds love
and wonder, while <i>Love Affair, or the Case of the Missing Switchboard
Operator </i>(<i>Ljubavni slu&#269;aj ili tragedija službenice</i>, Yugoslavia,
1967) looks at the romance between a rat exterminator and the title character. <i>Innocence
Unprotected</i> (<i>Nevinost bez zaštite</i>, Yugoslavia, 1968) reassembles the
surviving cast and crew of a grade-Z 1942 melodrama made in Nazi-occupied
Belgrade, while his most notorious work, <i>W.R. -- Mysteries of the Organism</i>
(<i>W.R. -- Misterije organizma</i>, Yugoslavia/Federal Republic of Germany,
1971) hilariously mixes the teachings of sex therapist Wilhelm Reich with
various dramatic and documentary sequences promoting political and sexual
insurrection (that the &quot;W.R.&quot; might also mean &quot;world
revolution&quot; is just one of many elements that earned the film both the Luis
Buñuel prize at the Cannes festival and a an exhibition ban from unamused
Yugoslav authorities). Two flamboyant tales of sexual emancipation in France and
Holland form the backbone of the eternally controversial and little-seen <i>Sweet
Movie</i> (France/Federal Republic of Germany/Canada, 1975), while the 1992
return to form <i>Gorilla Bathes at Noon</i> (Germany, 1992) follows a
disoriented and abandoned Russian officer around the changing Berlin landscape.
Of his remaining four features, only 1981’s Swedish-British co-production
Montenegro (aka <i>Pigs and Pearls</i>, starring Susan Anspach) is available;
among the works apparently gone missing is among his most high-profile, 1985’s
Australian-shot <i>The Coca Cola Kid</i>, in which Eric Roberts and Greta
Scacchi tryst against the backdrop of a whimsical soft drink war (many of these
films will be broadcast on the Sundance Channel in early February). Each tape is
also available individually at $24.95; at $149.95 the complete set is no
monetary bargain but offers the committed cineaste an invaluable glimpse into
iconoclastic mid-century central European filmmaking. <o:p>
