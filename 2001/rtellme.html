            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 9 November 
            2001</i></font><p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the South 
            Korean thriller, <i>Tell Me Something</i>, police detectives in 
            Seoul discover the remains of a murder victim who has been neatly 
            and professionally dissected, the parts then cleaned and placed in a 
            sealed black plastic refuse bag that is dropped off somewhere in the 
            city. Two more plastic bags are discovered (one during an outrageous 
            scene that takes place in a packed elevator full of adults and 
            children), confirming that the victims (all male, and all working 
            professionally in the arts) were dismembered, albeit under 
            anesthesia, while still alive. Moreover, parts of one murder victim 
            are found to be missing, while those of another have been put in 
            their place; the victims were also not killed sequentially.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A young, pretty museum curator, 
            Suyeon (Shim Eun-ha), is brought in for questioning, and she 
            confirms that not only did she know one of the victims shortly 
            before he was killed: she knew all of them. Suyeon, who has the 
            composed, vaguely troubled appearance of someone who is disturbed by 
            something in her past, is the daughter of a renowned painter who has 
            been presumed to have been out of the country for the last several 
            years.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And -- fear not, disparagers of 
            &quot;spoilers&quot; -- this is just the start of the story. Despite the 
            gruesome murders which are at the heart of its narrative, <i>Tell Me 
            Something</i> is, visually, one of the most elegantly made thrillers 
            in years, beautifully photographed (by cinematographer Kim Seong-bok) 
            and scored (by composer Jo Yeong-uk), with the camera gliding 
            through settings that are supplely coloured in mahogany browns and 
            verdigris greens. The director Chang Yoon-hyun pulls off some 
            virtuoso touches, including a multi-vehicle pileup on a highway 
            which is filmed in real time, and an armed standoff in a record 
            store that is cued to the same Shostakovich jazz waltz used in <i>
            Eyes Wide Shut</i>.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Suyeon makes a gift of some exotic 
            fish to Cho (Han Seok-kyu) the young detective who is in charge of 
            the case, saying that, for one thing, they might come in handy: 
            &quot;They hear footsteps.&quot; The relationship between Cho and Suyeon is 
            very respectful, dignified, and chaste, right up to and including 
            when Cho puts Suyeon up at a &quot;safe house&quot; which turns out to be his 
            apartment. We don't find out what his real feelings towards her are 
            until later, when he's shown watching a video surveillance tape made 
            of Suyeon's movements.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After its attention-getting start, 
            the bulk of the main story turns out to be rather conventional -- a 
            disgraced detective (Cho) must both redeem and prove himself by 
            taking on a difficult case, during which he must rescue and protect 
            a moody, troubled, possibly victimized girl (Suyeon). One's interest 
            in the leads comes mostly from the fact that they look good 
            together, rather than from any emotional resonance they may 
            generate: Han Seok-hyu rather vainly plays to the camera, while Shim 
            Eun-ha has a naïad-like beauty and an air of looking gracefully and 
            decorously removed from what's going on around her. On the other 
            hand, Jang Hang-seon's performance as Cho's older, average-Joe 
            partner, tenacious and shrewd but solicitous, and never rude, is one 
            of the best things I've seen this year. (His reaction to when Cho 
            asks Suyeon point-blank if she was ever in &quot;love&quot; with any of the 
            murder victims whom she knew is choice.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yet, despite the presence of five 
            writers who are credited with the screenplay, the pieces of the 
            puzzle still don't entirely fit together at the end. The filmmakers 
            put a very tricky turn near the conclusion which is meant to throw a 
            new light over everything that we have seen up until then, and is 
            meant to make the police look like they've been duped. (This 
            surprise is one of the reasons the film has been likened to the 1995 
            thriller, <i>Seven</i>.) But every time you think you have the whole 
            thing figured out in your head, long after the film is over, it 
            flies apart, like springs from a clockwork. The makers of <i>Tell Me 
            Something</i> may have intended for their film to have this 
            endlessly tantalizing effect on the audience, and sometimes a film 
            works better if it retains an element of ambiguity. However, after 
            seeing the film twice, I still found myself throwing up my hands in 
            despair, and sometimes you just have to leave it at that. Even 
            Raymond Chandler couldn't explain who killed the chauffeur in <i>The 
            Big Sleep</i>.</font></td>
