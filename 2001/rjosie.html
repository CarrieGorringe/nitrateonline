            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>As
            demonstrated by artists as different from one another as Eminem,
            Blink-182, and Andy Dick, there are many jokes to be made at the
            expense of the current crop of pop stars. Sheesh, even MTV's <i>Total
            Request Live</i>, so obviously devoted to promoting and exploiting
            Britney Spears, Samantha Mumba, 'Nsync, Christina Aguilera, the
            Backstreet Boys, Mandy Moore, Dream, 98 Degrees, Eden's Crush,
            O-Town, etc. etc., is just fine with making fun of its cash cows.
            The kids are easy targets, and mostly very good sports about the
            whole business. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And
            so you won't likely be startled or even very impressed with the
            ingenuity of the opening scene in <i>Josie and the Pussycats</i>,
            which takes place on a tarmac, as a flamboyantly decked out boy band
            deplanes and greets their fervent fans. When the so-aptly named Du
            Jour spins into song and dance, it's clear that they have the BSB
            moves down, from the turn on their heels to the dramatic fingers
            across the eyes, from the billowing coats to the arms gesturing wide
            to indicate the extent of their fabulous luuuv. (Apparently to
            italicize the satire, the lyrics of this song, &quot;Backdoor
            Lover&quot; are decidedly racier than most of the &quot;real&quot;
            boy bands -- please note the scare quotes, as &quot;real&quot; is
            mostly irrelevant when it comes to boy bands, except when discussing
            fans' devotion.)</font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            girlies scream, the photographers snap pix, the handlers handle, and
            the boys are whisked off to their next gig aboard their label-owned
            jet. During the flight, Travis (Seth Green), Marco (Breckin Meyer),
            Les (Alexander Martin), and the black one (Donald Faison) argue and
            fret, while Wyatt (Alan Cumming) attempts to keep their outsized
            egos under some control. &quot;Remember,&quot; they sloganize at one
            another, &quot;Du Jour means cleanliness&quot; and &quot;Du Jour
            means friendship.&quot; Yeah, yeah, we all know that Du Jour means
            money. But to ensure that meaning, they have to behave. Realizing
            that the boys in this band are getting a little too fractious, Wyatt
            decides it's time for a new act. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            is the moment where Josie and the Pussycats -- Josie McCoy (Rachael
            Leigh Cook), Melody Valentine (Tara Reid), and the Latina one,
            Valerie Brown (Rosario Dawson) -- come into his field of vision.
            Literally, they cross the street while carrying their instruments
            and find themselves deerlike in the headlights of Wyatt's car.
            Though they wonder at the speed of their good fortune (Wyatt doesn't
            even ask to hear them play before he whips out the contract), within
            minutes, the girls in the band (real lead vocals by Kay Hanley,
            ex-Letters to Cleo, with backup by Bif Naked and the actors
            themselves), are signed with a major label and on their way to the
            Big City, where they will be made over and packaged for sale. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Contrived
            and ridiculous as it sounds, the above set up is, as they say, only
            the beginning. The rest of <i>Josie and the Pussycats</i>, written
            and directed by Harry Elfont and Deborah Kaplan, concerns a very
            silly scheme by the label (played by self-parodying Parker Posey) to
            control kids' desires through subliminal messaging. How's that for
            an adult anxiety? Music carries evil messages! (Or, as Melody
            learns, via a note scrawled by a secret visitor in the steam of her
            bathroom mirror: &quot;Beware of the music.&quot;) Adults just don't
            get it -- kids don't need extra impetus to buy Revlon, Starbucks,
            Reeboks, Diesel, Pizza Hut, McDonalds, Target, Gatorade, or Coke.
            Much like adults, kids buy what they can with their disposable
            income. For teens and pre-teens, it's not about morality; it's about
            finding an identity and trying on possibilities -- they're on their
            way somewhere else, and they know it. And of course, Josie learns to
            say, &quot;I love you&quot; to her utterly dull boyfriend Alan M
            (Gabriel Mann) and all three girls learn that being friends is more
            important than being in a band. They sell a lot of records too. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            movie pretends that there's something else at stake, namely, the
            free minds of America's youth. But its satire about the music biz,
            its stars, star-making process, dastardly promoters and label
            masterminds -- in short, all the &quot;trend pimps&quot; -- as well
            as its chattel-like consumers, is tired already. The targets
            themselves have already been there and done that. Consider 2Gether,
            the &quot;fake&quot; boy band that MTV concocted for a TV movie and
            series satirizing the pop process? Like Eminem, Blink-182, and Andy
            Dick -- who have been downright mean in their spoofs -- the band
            members all too old to be called boys) are bona fide pop stars now.
            This despite and because of the fact that they make delirious fun of
            boy-bandness, performing broad melodrama on and off stage, and nasty
            songs about the hysteria that comes with youthful romance (in
            &quot;The Hardest Part About Breaking Up,&quot; is... &quot;Getting
            back your stuff!&quot;). The girls who buy 2gether's records and
            watch them on TV understand the satire, and like the (admittedly
            soft) edge that provides: fans can be cynical and love their stars
            at the same time. It's part of being young in the '00s. You have to
            keep up. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            doubleness of the satire -- that kids recognize it as such and
            recognize their participation in the process -- is partly tribute to
            the wisdom of young consumers. They know. And they buy the
            lunch-boxes and lip-gloss anyway. Even Mr. Awesome himself, Carson
            Daly, gets it. In a perverse cameo as himself, he calls himself
            &quot;a key player in the plan to brainwash the whole of the
            nation's youth with pop music.&quot; Well, it's cute, but no one
            cares. He then tries to beat dumb-blond Melody to death with a
            baseball bat. Need I remind anyone that Tara Reid and Daly are
            affianced? It may be that this &quot;inside fact&quot; is supposed
            to make their cartoonist life-and-death struggle all the more
            hilarious, but the effect is more like an awkward pause in the
            action. Really, no one cares. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            very population whom the film appears to represent and target might
            find the movie uninteresting, too obvious and tame: there's nothing
            newsworthy here: even the fashions the girls are wearing -- those
            way-low-riding pants and scarf tops -- are a few minutes too late.
            You might say that <i>Josie and the Pussycats</i> gets half the
            story right. In the film, it's adults who are insecure and uneasy,
            who still believe there are fixed lines defining what's cool or
            right or real, opposed to what's uncool or wrong or fictional. Most
            kids -- at least those who might imagine themselves momentarily
            reflected in MTV and the world of Josie -- know better. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And
            still, the machine grinds on. The real payoff here is in the tie-in
            products, and in the music: Josie and the Pussycats' video for
            &quot;Three Small Words&quot; premiered on <i>TRL</i> on April 11.
            As Kurt Cobain wore on his t-shirt so many years ago, corporate rock
            still sucks. And so what?</font><o:p>
