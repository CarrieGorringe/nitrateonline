            Forman once put forth the equation that Disney plus Buñuel equaled
            Švankmajer, and that’s as good a place as any to start with
            Prague-based Jan Švankmajer’s fourth feature, the startling and
            exhilaratingly imaginative <i>Little Otik</i>. For it is this very
            blend of a deceptively family-friendly fairy tale with the shrewd
            and often grotesque brand of Surrealism on which Švankmajer’s
            staked his career that gives <i>Little Otik</i> its power, an odd
            and singular intersection of the familiar and the terrifying.<o:p>

            child, Karel Horák (Jan Hartl) fantasizes they're sold on the
            street like the cherished Christmas carp as his despondent wife Božena
            (Veronika Žilková), shut up in their city flat, sinks slowly into
            glassy-eyed depression. On a whim, he presents her with a cleverly
            hewn tree stump from the garden of their rural cottage, only to
            watch in nervous horror as her desperate longing wills the root to
            life.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><o:p>

            the appetite of what Božena has dubbed Otík grows to include
            cabbages, postmen and anything or anyone unfortunate enough to
            wander into its path. Meanwhile, precocious neighbor child Alžb&#277;tka
            Štádlerová (distinctively spooky newcomer Kristina Adamcová) has
            been reading up on the tragic ending of the original fairytale, and
            realizes it's up to her to elude her comically doting parents
            (Jaroslava Kretschmerová, Pavel Nový -- the latter a star of Švankmajer’s
            previous film, 1997’s <i>Conspirators of Pleasure</i>) and save Otík
            -- if she can. <o:p>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Although
            considered by some to be inappropriate in these cautious times, the
            truly memorable fairy tales have always been those endowed with
            peculiar and unsettling blends of whimsy and gore. Such is the case
            with <i>Little Otik</i>, which continues the move towards live
            action begun by Švankmajer in <i>Conspirators of Pleasure</i> (<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i>Spiklenci
            slasti</i></b>, 1996). As always, there's an exhiliarating technical
            precision to Švankmajer's craft, a working method born of exquisite
            patience in the service of a boundless imagination. At once
            mischievous and cautionary, <i>Little Otik</i> is a bravura display
            of inspired artistry, Švankmajer's most accessible and charming
            feature to date (the two others are 1987’s <i>Alice </i>and
            1994’s <i>Faust</i>—note the amount of time between features, a
            tribute to the painstaking work that goes into his stop-motion
            technique).<o:p>

            card-carrying member of the Czechoslovak Surrealist Group since 1969
            (it was founded in 1934), Švankmajer began his work at the tail end
            of 1968’s Prague Spring and survived a rift in the organization
            caused by its members’ level of commitment: those who saw it as an
            artistic orientation drifted away to other pursuits or emigrated,
            while Švankmajer committed to the true power of the imagination as
            a lifestyle.<o:p>

            is no Surrealist aesthetic,&quot; he once explained, &quot;it’s a
            psychology, a view of the world, which poses new questions about
            freedom, eroticism, the subconscious, and which attracts a certain
            type of people… It’s tried to return art, which has become
            representational, aesthetic, commercial, to its level of magic
            ritual.&quot; Understandably, the director practiced that lifestyle
            largely underground for the better part of two decades, emerging
            from behind the Iron Curtain with his imaginative vision and
            determined work ethic intact.<o:p>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Seen
            in this light, the attraction of Karel Jaromír Erben’s cherished
            fairy tale seems obvious. In fact, the latter reels of <i>Little
            Otik</i> are punctuated by significant passages from the actual Otesánek
            fairy tale, animated by Švankmajer’s long-time wife and partner
            Eva Švankmajerova, herself an established author and the costume
            designer of record for the film. Though the 127-minute running time
            may look daunting on the page, by the time Alžb&#277;tka’s
            research into the classic story begins to unfold there’s a
            momentum and inevitability to the proceedings as solid as Otik
            itself. This is buttressed by the film’s rich and complex textual
            references to Surrealistic principles, most notably in Švankmajer’s
            ongoing fascination with the textural possibilities of Czech
            cuisine. And although the film preceded the worldwide publicity
            afforded recent developments in the mapping of the human genome,
            such an analysis provides its own peculiar and frightening rewards.<o:p>

            the record, the name &quot;Otík&quot; means, literally,
            &quot;Little Otto.&quot; The film’s original title is a playful
            and universally understood diminuation of the Czech, meaning
            &quot;that which has been chiseled.&quot; The decision by American
            distributor Zeitgeist Films to go with an English language variant
            (note the lack of the accent mark over the &quot;i&quot;) is
            probably prudent—although, when it comes right down to it, <i>Otesánek</i>
            is far catchier, a snappy title for a movie that represents nothing
            less than an entire lifestyle.</span></font><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana"><o:p>
