            review by <a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 16 November 
            2001</i></font><p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="5">
            'Tis roadkill </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700">
            <font size="2">'Tis 1328. Or more precisely, 'tis so in the 
            overactive imagination of theme-park custodian Jamal Walker (Martin 
            Lawrence). This would be the high-concept premise of <i>Black Knight</i>, 
            in which <i>A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court</i> and <i>
            Beverly Hills Cop</i> collide. As the film opens, you see that Jamal 
            is something of a perfectionist when it comes to personal 
            cleanliness -- he electric toothbrushes, flosses, cleans his ears, 
            and plucks his nose hairs: in other words, medieval times, a 
            pre-toilet paper era with a vengeance, is precisely not where Jamal 
            wants to be. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">And yet, here 
            he is, not once, but twice. First version has Jamal at work at 
            Medieval World, he cleans the &quot;moat&quot; and loudly expresses his 
            discontent with the diurnal tedium, especially his boss-lady's 
            repetitious complaints about costs and competition. Second version 
            begins when Jamal falls headfirst into that moat and wakes to find 
            himself dumped back in time, in the &quot;real&quot; medieval England, 
            emerging from a magical lake. Not very convincing, but who cares? 
            The point is to see Martin act up, this time in front of folks 
            wearing armor and unable to parse his homeboy slangin' (or, as one 
            new acquaintance calls it, his &quot;unusual tongue&quot;). </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">So 
            Martin-as-Jamal emerges from the lake in his football jersey and 
            sneakers, whereupon he meets ex-knight Sir Knolte (Tom Wilkinson), 
            currently homeless and drinking too much, having been run out of the 
            kingdom run by tyrannical King Leo (Kevin Conway). At first, Jamal 
            mistakes everything, imagining he's at the rival theme park down the 
            road, Castle World, whose bigger budget would explain why its cast 
            and location look so realistic. Check those convincing costumes, 
            powerful odors, and even the roasted scraggly rabbit that quite 
            resembles &quot;roadkill,&quot; as Jamal astutely observes. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Leaving Knolte 
            to his tasty dinner, Jamal meanders off to the castle proper, where 
            he's stopped him at the gate by a foul-looking guard: &quot;Who be ye?&quot; 
            Jamal adapts instantly: &quot;I be stompin' your ass if you put your 
            hands on me again!&quot; Comical. The castlefolk think Jamal's a 
            messenger from France, bringing word of some Duke's anticipated 
            arrival, and being an agreeable guy, he plays along, calling himself 
            Jamal Skywalker, from Florence and Normandy (his very own South 
            Central street corner) and chatting up the king, who promises him 
            the nocturnal pleasures of any maidens he might desire. </font>
            </span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">There's only 
            one guy who takes an immediate dislike to Jamal, and that would be 
            the overtly racist knight Percival (Vincent Regan), who insists on 
            referring to him as &quot;Moor.&quot; In order to fit in and show up &quot;Percy,&quot; 
            Jamal works overtime to win Leo's approval: he learns to ride a 
            giant black stallion, makes Martin faces, leads the court in a 
            vigorous rendition of Sly Stone's &quot;Dance to the Music,&quot; beds the 
            king's randy daughter (by accident: &quot;That white girl came on to me!&quot; 
            he defends himself), and makes more Martin faces. Much as he always 
            has, Lawrence delights with his enormous capacity for rambunctious, 
            self-deprecating physical comedy, and surely, no one is expecting a 
            stretch beyond Lawrence's usual fare. Even so, <i>Black Knight</i>, 
            directed by Gil Junger (<i>10 Things I Hate About You</i>) and 
            written by Darryl Quarrels (<i>Big Momma's House</i>), is 
            particularly uninspired, a series of gags strung together without 
            much care for order or context. Watch Jamal flop about on that big 
            black horse's neck, save a poor peasant from certain death, or 
            observe the king glopping his hand from roast bird innards to his 
            own nose to a plateful of peas. Just one hilarious hijink after 
            another. </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Jamal is 
            apparently fine with this discombobulation until he meets the lovely 
            chambermaid Victoria (Marsha Thomason), who happens to be the only 
            other black character in sight and who informs Jamal that Leo is in 
            fact a dastardly sort. This point is made clear when Jamal witnesses 
            his first beheading, an odd choice for a joke, to be sure, but there 
            it is: Martin Lawrence grimaces when the head rolls off the platform 
            right into his eager hands: &quot;How do they make it look so real!?&quot; he 
            exclaims, just before he passes out. After that, Jamal wants out, at 
            least until Victoria shows him her breasts. Then he starts to 
            formulate a moral position, that is, to support and even take part 
            in a community uprising against the bad despot, rather than look out 
            for himself alone. (Thus: character development.) </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Said community 
            is composed of ratty-tatty rebels who live out in the woods and plan 
            to assassinate Leo in order to reinstate the good queen. She's got 
            her own problems, having been hiding out since Leo chased her off 
            however long ago. For one thing, she's such a godawful public 
            speaker that her even her most loyal subjects cringe and try to walk 
            off when she opens her mouth, and so she must call on Jamal to help 
            her inspire the grubby throng to fight in her name. Jamal proceeds 
            to &quot;give 'em the ol' Al Sharp,&quot; essentially a running together of 
            jumbled references, from Rodney King to John F. Kennedy (&quot;Ask not 
            what you can do for your fiefdom...&quot;). Now motivated, the peasants 
            start training, in a knights' boot camp montage, a lot like the one 
            in <i>A Knight's Tale</i> where Heath Ledger learns to joust and 
            swordfight, to the tune of raucous James Brown. How down of them.
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">A battle 
            follows: arrows flying, swords crashing, horses galloping, catapults 
            catapulting, all in a scene so clunkily edited that you're hard 
            pressed to care who's clobbering whom. Even with this clutter around 
            him, the irrepressible Lawrence maintains a jolting vivacity and 
            endearing sense of himself. Too bad that the rest of <i>Black Knight</i> 
            doesn't keep pace with his considerable energy.</font></span></td>
