            Anjanetta Fox is a dependable, fearless performer. She's always --
            and I mean always -- dynamic and charming, a joy to watch no matter
            the obstacles that lay in her way. As any Vivica A. Fox fan will
            tell you, these obstacles have occasionally been formidable, for
            instance, the badly plotted hijinks in Idle Hands or the manifest
            political constraints of the TV sitcoms, Getting Personal and
            Arsenio. You know what I'm talking about, and yet, my girl Vivica
            always comes through. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            Two Can Play That Game, Fox is again up against it. This despite and
            because of the fact that her character, Shante Smith, is a strong
            and independent woman, part professional major-player and part
            sister-girlfriend. An advertising agency partner at age 28 (easily
            the youngest person in the boardroom, as well as the only black
            woman), Shante doesn't compromise her community &quot;values&quot;
            to get ahead (a 30-second scene displays her command over her white
            guy compatriots, who look to Shante for guidance on how to make
            money and influence people, in a &quot;good&quot; way). What's more,
            she's got a solid waiting-to-exhale-ish support-and-advice system in
            her three girlfriends -- Karen (Wendy Raquel Robinson), Tracye
            (Tamala Jones), and Diedre (Mo'Nique). Again, she does most of the
            advising, but she genuinely appears to like that role. Though, truth
            be told, this advice seems pretty obvious, as for instance, when she
            tries to help Karen, who's upset that her golddigging, gold-toothed
            mechanic boyfriend Michael (Bobby Brown) isn't treating her right,
            even after she has paid to overhaul his hair, teeth, and wardrobe.
            Hmmm, what could be the problem here and what should she do? (And
            I'm not even going to mention that she's trying to school Mr. My
            Prerogative.)<o:p>
            </o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still,
            for all her self-confidence, sass, and success, Shante has issues.
            And wouldn't you know, they have to do with a guy? As Two Can Play
            That Game begins, she learns that her apparently perfect man Keith
            (Morris Chestnut) may not be so reliable as she thinks. Her dilemma
            isn't just that he might be or have a problem. It's that her own
            sense of control over her world is shaken. After seeing him at
            &quot;their spot&quot; with another woman when he's supposed to be
            &quot;working late,&quot; Shante starts to doubt herself, or more
            precisely, she starts to doubt her belief that she's always right.
            Facing this identity crisis, Shante decides that she must
            &quot;punish&quot; Keith, in order to ensure that he will not step
            out again, but more importantly, to ensure that her own expectations
            are correct and righteous. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If
            you've seen a movie based on a Terry McMillan novel, or, gee, even a
            recent romantic comedy, you know exactly where this is going: the
            girl will get the guy, along with a lesson in how to be less
            demanding, arrogant, and aggressive, that is, a lesson in how to be
            more like a traditional girl. Written and directed by Mark Brown (he
            also wrote How to Be a Player, a film fraught with stereotypes, from
            which he is eager to distance himself), Two Can Play That Game is
            premised on Shante's knowledge of &quot;the rules,&quot; which she
            proceeds to list and enact for your benefit (&quot;Rule Number 1:
            Stay cool,&quot; &quot;Rule Number 2: Never let your girls know the
            whole situation,&quot; etc.). Since this is a comedy about social
            codes and gendered behaviors, the jokes (some of which are very
            funny), aren't strictly inoffensive, and that's okay. What's
            troubling is that, even if Shante's lesson is a predictable one,
            because of Fox and the rest of the talented cast, the route to it
            actually has some potential to be something different. And honestly,
            that's why Two Can Play That Game is disappointing. That... and the
            fact that Fox has to say corny stuff like, &quot;A man's lovin' is
            always better on a full stomach,&quot; or, &quot;What is it about
            men and big booties?&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">All
            that said, Fox makes the most of the movie's primary gimmick, which
            is Shante's direct address to the camera. Not only does the film
            take Shante's point of view, but it also invites you to share it,
            having her break the &quot;fourth wall,&quot; in a trendy, Malcolm
            in the Middle-ish kind of way. Fox is terrific fun at these moments,
            and further, she calls the camera/you &quot;girl,&quot; assuming a
            sympathetic and knowledgeable female audience and which (after a
            movie like America's Sweethearts, so clearly disrespecting its
            presumed audience) is rather refreshing. As well, Shante's comments
            to you allow Fox to act outside the usual generic confines: the
            character gets to remark on her own unsmart behavior or offer
            observations that you might make yourself, sort of preemptive
            catcalls. Still, you do see things Shante doesn't (as the camera
            follows Keith home, for instance), and so you are always one up on
            her. This means that, after a while, her shared confidences start to
            seem more desperate than assertive, because you know she'll be
            paying a price for her loud declarations of self-assurance. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            main reason you know this is Anthony Anderson's performance as Tony,
            Keith's irrepressible best friend and &quot;wartime&quot; counsel.
            Announcing that the contest is about all men and all women, he vows
            vengeance and victory. The miracle is that you don't really begrudge
            Tony that ridiculous attitude, because Anderson is such a kick to
            watch. He's been busy lately (with supporting roles in Kingdom Come,
            Me, Myself &amp; Irene, Big Momma's House, and Exit Wounds), and
            it's easy to see why: this guy is speedy-electric, injecting all his
            scenes with a contagious energy. It's not long before the story is
            focused on the heady game between Shante and Tony, with Keith as the
            not-so-interesting intermediary. He's attractive, yes, but just a
            little slow, usually waiting to be motivated by Shante or Tony, or
            later, Conny (Gabrielle Union), the super-smooth, consummately
            made-up rival whom Shante introduces as a &quot;lay-on-her-back,
            do-whatever-it-takes-to-get-your-man kinda ho&quot;). Meanwhile,
            Shante and Tony are hard at it, playing the &quot;game&quot; and
            enumerating the &quot;rules,&quot; each equally sure that he or she
            is on top, or at least, anticipating when the next opportunity to
            get on top will emerge. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's
            too bad that Shante and Keith are the movie's designated couple who
            must get back together, because the movie misses the opportunity to
            do something different, that is, to hook up its real charismatic and
            emotional powerhouses, Shante and Tony. Just because he doesn't look
            like a standard romantic lead, Tony doesn't even get much of a
            lesson in the end. <o:p>
