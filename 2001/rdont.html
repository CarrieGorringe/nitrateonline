            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 5 October
            2001</i> </font>
            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">It will be interesting to see if 
            audiences respond to the vigorous thumping and thrashing that the 
            bad guys receive in <i>Don't Say a Word</i>, or if they'll get tired 
            and see the film for the preposterous, confusing mess that it is. I 
            know I got tired of Sean Bean's sarcastic cackling mighty fast, as 
            it is in the same vein that has been mined by a lot of actors in a 
            lot of bad movies over the last ten years until it has become 
            bereft.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Don't Say a Word</i> opens with 
            a lengthy sequence depicting a robbery (lead by Bean's character), a 
            girl being incarcerated in a mental ward after inflicting injuries 
            requiring &quot;one-hundred-and-eleven stitches&quot; (they counted them!) on 
            someone with a razor, a dead body floating in a river, and an 
            abduction, and then takes an hour to explain how all of these are 
            supposed to be interrelated. Michael Douglas plays a New York City 
            psychiatrist, famous for his &quot;touch with the teens&quot;, who wakes up on 
            Thanksgiving morning to discover that his daughter (Skye McCole 
            Bartusiak) has been kidnapped -- without waking anyone in the 
            apartment, and by men using bolt cutters, yet -- and that he has 
            until five p.m. to extract some information out of a 
            catatonic-schizophrenic (Brittany Murphy), the aforementioned girl 
            with the razor, or face the consequences. Surveillance devices have 
            been placed everywhere (inside the apartment, the mental ward) to 
            keep track of his every move, and his cell phone lines are all 
            tapped, as well. The disturbed girl has been bounced in and out of 
            various institutions for the past ten years, so the psychiatrist 
            faces performing a Herculean task of making contact with her; his 
            wife (Famke Janssen), bedridden with a broken leg, is similarly 
            tortured in the meantime by having to sit at home and watch 
            scorpions being baited by loony humans on the Animal Planet channel.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film, mercifully, cuts short a 
            terrifying-looking scene where Douglas gives Janssen an erotic 
            sponge bath. Otherwise, it asks us to make more leaps of faith than 
            any audience should be called upon to perform. Opting for style over 
            content, the filmmakers jump back and forth between parallel 
            plotlines and use fibrillating editing which, instead than creating 
            tension or drawing us into the corkscrewing action, throws us out of 
            it. It also defeats the performers, and Douglas and Murphy show that 
            they're more than capable of making something out of their 
            characters, but we never get the chance to establish contact with 
            them other than on a superficial level.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Murphy, in fact, is reduced to not 
            much more than a piece of baggage during the final parts of the 
            film, toted around by Douglas, whose character shows an inordinate 
            amount of trust towards someone who has just committed mayhem the 
            night before. The story has possibilities -- plenty of them, in 
            fact, from the unnerving depths suggested by Murphy's character 
            during her introductory scenes, to the smarts shown by the 
            psychiatrist's abducted daughter, and whether the psychiatrist 
            himself will choose compassion or blunt fury -- but they simply 
            haven't been developed. What's on-screen may suffice, for now, as 
            something that can help people take their minds off of things in the 
            outside world for an hour or two, or maybe not.</font></td>
