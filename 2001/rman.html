            review by <a href="../kj.html" target="_top">KJ Doughton</a>, 2 November
            2001</i></font><p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ed is a 
            chain-smoking barber who sports a look of perpetual bewilderment: 
            his eyebrows tilt in a diagonal slope, and his heavy, lined forehead 
            has the worried vibe of a St. Bernard’s melancholy face. This is a 
            guy who is obviously not quite up on things.&nbsp; He cuts hair in a 
            barbershop owned by a motormouthed, overbearing brother in law, and 
            his wife has denied Ed any intimacy for the last several years.&nbsp; 
            Played by the chameleonic Billy Bob Thornton (was this presence 
            really the same man who embodied Carl, the pudgy, reluctant killer 
            from <i>Sling Blade?</i>), Ed is one of life’s bystanders. He’s a 
            man too tentative to take charge of his life, and too dim to even 
            acknowledge what those around him are up to.&nbsp; </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ed is <i>The Man Who Wasn’t There</i>, 
            and The Coen Brothers examine his stillborn life in a black and 
            white, <b><i>film noir</i></b> yarn that echoes their earlier films
            <i>Blood Simple</i> and <i>Barton Fink</i>.&nbsp; Like <i>Blood Simple</i>,
            <i>The Man Who Wasn’t There</i> features criminal acts and betrayal, 
            and its main character is a passive schmuck like the screenwriter <i>
            Barton Fink</i>, whose inability to assert himself led – literally – 
            to Writer’s Hell.&nbsp; Unlike these past films, however, <i>The Man Who 
            Wasn’t There</i> is so leisurely paced and so comfortable with 
            itself that it fails to generate any buildup.&nbsp; It’s gorgeously 
            filmed, brilliantly acted, and perceptively peppered with clever 
            dialogue, but to what end?&nbsp; Ultimately, we see a 1940’s barber get 
            screwed, screw over other people, and ultimately screw up so bad 
            that he’s put out of his – and our – misery.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film establishes itself in the 
            confines of Ed’s barbershop. Well, actually, the establishment 
            belongs to Frank (Michael Badalucco), and Thornton’s voiceover 
            confirms this. “Frank is the Principal Barber,” Ed explains of his 
            loud in-law, “cutting the hair and chewing the fat. I just cut the 
            hair.”&nbsp; Within seconds, we get a real feel for the salon’s routine. 
            Frank discusses the tense news that Russia has begun testing nuclear 
            bombs.&nbsp; Cigarette smoke clouds the cramped cutting room.&nbsp; There’s a 
            montage of different haircut styles, as customers come and go, while 
            Ed and Frank remain at their chairs to snip and clip. The Coen 
            Brothers have no equals when it comes to getting the details right: 
            just as they made <i>The Big Liebowski</i>’s bowling alleys as 
            comfortable and familiar as a well-worn couch, the filmmaking team 
            create a cozy home base out of this humble haircutter’s shop.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We follow Ed home and meet his 
            bingo-loving wife, Doris (Frances McDormand), who works as a 
            bookkeeper at a local department store.&nbsp; It’s owned by a bear-sized 
            fellow named Big Dave (James Gandolfini), and when he accepts an 
            invitation to Ed’s house for dinner and has Doris entranced by his 
            macho war stories and boring jokes, Ed brushes it off. “I guess 
            Doris liked that he-man stuff,” he shrugs.&nbsp; Eventually, he gets wind 
            of an affair between Doris and Big Dave, but even this is met with a 
            weary, resigned submissiveness. “I guess it’s a free country,” Ed 
            reasons.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Out of the blue, Ed finds something 
            to act on.&nbsp; A shady traveling salesman convinces him to cough up 
            $10,000 for a dry cleaning franchise (“Cleanliness, my friend,” the 
            entrepreneur assures, “there’s money in it!”), and Ed hatches a 
            scheme to snatch the money and exact a kind of passive-aggressive 
            revenge on Big Dave and Doris.&nbsp; Suddenly, we are in <i>Fargo</i>-land, 
            with Thornton reprising the role that William H. Macy acted out in 
            that 1996 classic.&nbsp; Like Macy, he’s a man with a plan that’s 
            destined to leave a trail of bodies in its path.&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The remaining reel of <i>The Man 
            Who Wasn’t There</i> combines courtroom drama, mystery, wry comedy, 
            UFO conspiracies, and a twisted attempt at romance, and throws it 
            all at the wall to see what sticks.&nbsp; There are hilarious scenes of 
            existential angst, as when Ed thinks a bit too deeply about his 
            trade. “This hair,” he ponders. “It just keeps growing.&nbsp; It’s a part 
            of us, but we cut it off and throw it away.”&nbsp; There’s a 
            sidesplitting bit by Tony Shalhoub as an arrogant, pretentious 
            attorney hired by Ed to defend a key character as the plot 
            thickens.&nbsp; “I’m an attorney,” Shalhoub explains. “You’re a barber. 
            You don’t know anything.”</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ed also obsesses on Birdy Abundas, 
            the teenaged, piano-playing daughter of a family friend.&nbsp; Sitting 
            intently and listening to Birdy’s music, the film’s troubled hero 
            finds “some kind of escape; some kind of peace.”&nbsp; His interest in 
            the youthful lass precedes an ill-fated attempt to manage her career 
            that brings to mind Travis Bickle’s efforts to “rescue” Jodie 
            Foster’s teen prostitute Iris from her plight, in <i>Taxi Driver</i>, 
            another film about a man unable to connect with the outside world.&nbsp; 
            Birdy represents something pure and innocent to Ed – or is there a 
            libidinous attraction buried beneath it all? Ed’s too confused to 
            know, but when she reciprocates his interest in a way that’s 
            anything but innocent, the result is more frustration and 
            embarrassment for the repressed dope.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>The Man Who Wasn’t There</i> 
            ends with an ironic spin. It’s an amusing wrap-up that’s fitting to 
            the dry tone of the film, but I lamented my inability to establish a 
            human connection with Ed.&nbsp; A similar frustration has seized me 
            during other Coen film outings.&nbsp; So impenetrable and detached are 
            the leads in <i>The Hudsucker Proxy, Barton Fink</i>, and this 
            latest effort that there’s no emotional empathy or identification.&nbsp; 
            When they can couple their brilliant irony with a real 
            salt-of-the-earth character like <i>Fargo</i>’s unforgettable police 
            woman Marge (who praised her insecure, duck-painting husband after 
            his work is selected to appear on a stamp, even as the pregnant 
            workhorse is recovering from a bloody crime investigation), there’s 
            pure gold to be found in them hills.&nbsp; With <i>The Man Who Wasn’t 
            There</i>, the mines are empty.</font><br>
