            review by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 2 March
            2001</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>As one can expect from a movie
            titled <i>Last Resort</i>, the first fiction film from Polish
            director Pawel Pawlikowski is often downbeat. While it centers on
            the lives of two Russian refugees stuck in a strange limbo in the
            seaside tourist town of Stonehaven in the U.K., the movie is
            frequently engrossing because it presents them in a believable and
            sympathetic manner. Pawlikowski cut his teeth making documentaries,
            and the handheld camerawork that is common in those types of films
            makes <i>The Last Resort</i> seem even more authentic.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The story (by Pawlikowski and Rowan
            Joffe) follows a young widow named Tanya (Dina Korzun) and her son
            Artiom (astonishing newcomer Artiom Srelnikov) as they go through
            customs at the airport. Because of some of the valuable belongings
            she has brought along (like furs and artwork), it’s obvious they
            aren’t tourists. The two hope to start new lives in London with
            Tanya’s fiancée Mark.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">They wait for hours, but Mark never
            appears. Wondering why he hasn’t shown up, Tanya tells the
            immigration officials that she’s a political refugee. She hopes
            this will get her preferential treatment. Instead, the authorities
            force her and Artiom to stay in a rundown hotel and refuse to let
            her leave until all of the paperwork has been processed. This, they
            reassure her, takes a mere twelve months. Stuck without money or
            friends, Tanya struggles to find a job (her only previous work was
            writing and illustrating children’s books) or a way to sneak to
            London. Despite constant effort, they wind up in a further muddle.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In addition to imbuing <i>Last
            Resort</i> with a convincingly gritty atmosphere, Pawlikowski also
            loads the film with several fascinatingly seedy characters.
            Real-life pornographer Lindsey Honey is eerily charming as an
            internet-based skin merchant. Likewise, many of the other
            performances seem more lived than acted. The bureaucrats in the film
            come across bored and impassive, as if the routine has numbed them
            completely.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Korzun, however, provides a real
            contrast to her surroundings. She projects a vitality and
            vulnerability that makes identifying with her remarkably easy.
            She’s never glamorized (which would undermine what Pawlikowski’s
            trying to do), often looking as if she’s been forced to wear the
            same clothes for days. Still, she cuts a striking figure, so it’s
            easy to see why she’s a major star in Russia.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While at times a little redundant, <i>The
            Last Resort</i> is able to present the Tanya’s plight without
            degenerating into a diatribe about the insensitivity of immigration
            officials. There’s a remarkably skilled, if star-crossed, love
            story between Tanya and Alfie (Paddy Considine), a local jack-of-all
            trades who befriends the beleaguered duo. The two have a genial
            rapport, but Pawlikowski gives us plenty of signs that it might not
            last. Alfie is intriguing because he can be either generous or
            hostile at a moment’s notice. Considine, has appeared previously
            in <i>A Room for Romeo Brass</i>. Nonetheless, his handsome but
            unpolished features make him a credible jack-of-all-trades.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A lot of recent films, particularly
            a lot Hollywood flicks, have suffered because many filmmakers are
            under the impression that realistic settings or characters aren’t
            interesting. By following the lives of two inadvertent refugees and
            the working class community they arrive in, Pawlikowski proves this
            notion to be false.</font>
