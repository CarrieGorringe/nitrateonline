Will Rock You. Unless you've been living under a rock for the past few weeks,
you've seen Heath Ledger's face. It's the one looking out at you from the <i>Knight's

quite who Heath Ledger is... well, catch up. By some accounts, he is, as

performances opposite Julia Stiles in 1999's <i>10 Things About You</i> (<i>The
Taming of the Shrew</i> set in high school) and Mel Gibson's hot-headed son in <i>The

<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
if 22-year-old Heath Ledger is new to the U.S. mega-movie-promo scene, he's
quite aware of how it all works, thank you very much. When I first see him in a
New York hotel, he's coming out of the bathroom, having done battle with the
door (&quot;I thought I was locked in there!&quot;). He sits restlessly on the
hotel room couch, leaning back and then forward, crossing and uncrossing his
arms, chewing on a bottle cap until it nicks him in the mouth
(&quot;Ouch!&quot;). He's tied a red wool kerchief over his famously tousled
hair, tossed his frayed, hooded sweatshirt on the floor. He's set out his light
cigarettes before him, gets up to get an ashtray, drums his fingers
occasionally, and at one point climbs over the couch to get a bottled water
(over his shoulder, as he's climbing: &quot;Want anything?&quot;). <o:p>
</o:p>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For
all the activity, he's oddly relaxed, almost serene in his confidence. He knows
what he likes -- photography, hanging out with his friends back home in Perth,
Australia, his girlfriend Heather Graham -- and he knows who he is. Well aware
of how the system works. Ledger says, &quot;That guy [in the poster] is William
Thatcher; he's in a movie and the studio found an angle on how to market that
product. That's what studios do, they decide, 'Let's turn this kid into a star,
and get him to bring in the bucks for our movie.' It's strange and it sucks,
because it's an ensemble movie, and it always was.&quot; Facing fame, he now
sees himself<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;in that
transitional stage where I'm asking myself questions about this, figuring it
out. At the end of the day, it's just yin and yang, it all balances out. You
receive a hell of a lot and it takes away a hell of a lot.&quot; He got into
acting, he says, &quot;because my sister was a theater actor, a very good
theater actor, and I wanted to experience what I saw in her. I had a curiosity
for it, because in getting to know how to play a character, I also found that I
had to start getting to know myself as a person.&quot; <o:p>
</o:p>
<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></span></p>
<p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ledger
remembers <i>A Knight's Tale</i> a good time. The cast arrived in the Czech
Republic a month ahead of time for what Ledger jokingly calls
&quot;rehearsals,&quot; complete with scare quotes. But, he says, this time with
the rest of the cast was important. &quot;It was mostly about getting to know
each other. It gave us time to develop something real, which was important
because ultimately it's a movie about friendship.&quot; As for stunts and other
such excitement, Ledger says that since he's a &quot;product,&quot; there's no
way he was actually going to be jousting (&quot;They brought in a professional
jouster from Vegas,&quot; he cracks). In fact, he remembers that the &quot;most
dangerous thing&quot; he did during filming was to &quot;ride back into frame
and wipe the sweat off my brow. I would have loved to have given it a shot,
hitting some guy off a horse, but insurance-wise, I wasn't allowed to ride a
bicycle.&quot; <o:p>

am affected by all this, you'd be a freak if you weren't. I don't care about it
enough to let it affect me, it's not the be-all and end-all of my life. I truly
work to live. I love what I do, but the special moments for me are between
&quot;action&quot; and &quot;cut,&quot; and the rest really bores me. I'm being
pushed into this position as a product by a fucking studio that invested $40
million into publicity as insurance. I'm aware of that too, and I tell them that
to their face. I don't think a lot of people want to ask those questions, like,
&quot;Why, really, am I here?&quot; And then they start to believe it a little,
and then they can lose it a little. As long as you can approach these matters
and be truthful about it and ask questions of yourself that you don't want to
ask, you're fine, or at least know what's going on, your &quot;position,&quot;
so to speak.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">&nbsp;

But then it's like, choose your attitude. They will play off of whatever I
present, because that's their job. But I keep them on their toes still. I keep
surprising them. I won't be as consistent as they think I'm going to be. I've
gotta have fun with this: they're all about games. And me, because I came from
Australia, they think they can just push you over. And they're like that with
any kid: they think, &quot;Oh it's a kid, let's mold him into a superstar and
ask him to slick his hair and wear suits and become this for us, and tell him
all this, so we can make him into this.&quot; People have never been able to
change me. My parents couldn't change me, so there's no way I'm going to let
these guys change me. I work. I love what I do, and I don't want to let this
part of it destroy that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

think so. I really take pride in choosing pieces. And I just want to have fun. I
could never say, &quot;They're gonna pay me, it's gonna be a drag, but fuck it,
four months.&quot; Four months is four fucking months, and that's really
valuable time for me. You want to feel like you're somewhat in control. If I
wasn;t having fun, I wouldn't think twice [about leaving]. It would actually be
fun to just walk out: the phone calls I'd get, it would blow things up. Right at
a point when they think they've got someone who they can [manage]... I've got my
plan. <o:p>

it's just having an understanding of the character straightaway. You know, to

somewhere else. He's learning, he has flaws.&quot; It's not always on the page,
but as you're reading it, you see if you can find the layers underneath the
skin. I'm not out to do one particular kind of character or movie. I want to
keep it interesting for myself, so I'm going to have to vary it up. Otherwise,

I'm doing a movie in a couple of weeks, a $4 million dollar movie, I'm on for
two weeks. So I'm doing it. It's not hard for me, it's hard for the people
around me, the people who want everything but that. The hard thing is getting
hold of the material, because ultimately, your agents, as much as they say,
&quot;We're here for you,&quot; and &quot;We'll find you a cool independent
movie,&quot; for them a &quot;cool independent movie&quot; is made by Miramax,
it's a $100 million movie, hardly independent. So the hardest thing is getting
to see material that is cool. Often enough, those pieces, you hear about by word
of mouth, or someone gets it to you somehow, or sends it to my dad in Perth
[adopting deep masculine voice]: &quot;Son, I've got another script, I'll send
it your way!&quot; So the decision isn't hard, because I'm not here to sustain
my career as a superstar. I'm not afraid to let it go if need be. It's a
ruthlessness. It's going for your instincts, what you feel is right at this
particular time in your life, and nobody else knows that. They want to know,
your agents and the studios, yeah, and think they know from what they've seen
you work in, but it's your job to keep surprising them. <o:p>

it. You have to step up: you're playing this guy and you've just gotta do it....

&quot;Are we done already?&quot; Yes, comes the answer. It's time to prep him
for his tv interviews. That is, the red wool kerchief has to go and Ledger's
hair and face have to be made lovely for his adoring public. He leans back into
the couch as the professionals approach, resigned and polite, and yet, he
stiffens for an instant, just a little bit resistant. &quot;This has been
refreshing,&quot; he says. We shake hands and I wish him luck. <o:p>
