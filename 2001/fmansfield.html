            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>feature by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory
            Avery</a>, 30 November 2001</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>&quot;Hi. I'm Jayne
            Mansfield,&quot; says the breathy voice on the soundtrack.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">She first appears descending the
            Spanish Steps, in Rome, her hair a cascade of candy-spun blond, her
            ample yet lithe-moving figure clad in a simple black dress, with
            low-heeled shoes on her feet. She moves like someone who knows how
            to comport themselves like a movie star, and as if it seems the most
            natural thing for her to do. She stops to smell some mimosa
            blossoms, and picks one for herself. She smiles, and men around her
            clasp their hands together, shake their heads, or just expire flat
            out on the pavement then and there.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is appropriate that this should
            be Jayne Mansfield's first appearance in <i>The Wild Wild World of
            Jayne Mansfield</i>: Jayne's career flourished in the 'fifties and
            'sixties under the gaze of public attention, and Jayne in turn loved
            to be adored. The documentary, released in 1968, is receiving its
            first theatrical showing in years on Nov. 30, in New York City.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For those whose recollections only
            go back as far as Britney Spears, Jayne Mansfield first came to
            prominence and acclaim playing Rita Marlowe, the seemingly ditzy but
            actually shrewd movie star and sex goddess, in George Axelrod's
            Broadway comedy, <i>Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?</i> Jayne's
            performance landed her on the cover of <i>Life</i> magazine, and
            Hollywood soon came calling, a fortuitous opportunity since Jayne
            had set her sights on Hollywood stardom from the beginning. She
            would reprise her stage performance in the 1957 film of Axelrod's
            play, but not before appearing in Frank Tashlin's deliriously
            surreal <i>The Girl Can't Help It</i> (1956), where her wiggly hips
            and hourglass figure shatter men's eyeglasses and cause milk to
            erupt from bottles they hold in their hands as she passes by.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While still in New York, Jayne met
            Mickey Hargitay, a Hungarian-born body builder who was one of
            several musclemen then appearing in Mae West's stage revue. Jayne
            and Mickey would marry, and have three children, two sons, Miklos
            and Zoltan, and a daughter, Mariska (who would go on to have an
            acting career in her own right). Mickey purchased a house in
            Hollywood and made it over to please Jayne. The &quot;Pink
            Palace&quot; (pink being Jayne's favorite color) featured a
            heart-shaped bathtub, a living room fireplace hand-crafted from
            unfinished stone, and two pink cars, a Cadillac and a Corvette,
            parked alongside an Eldorado in the garage. A rival studio tried to
            lure Jayne away from her contract with Twentieth Century-Fox by
            giving her a three-years supply of pink champagne, to bathe in.
            (Note: do not try this at home, unless you water the alcohol content
            way, way down).</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While Jayne proved her dramatic
            ability in a film version of John Steinbeck's novel, <i>The Wayward
            Bus</i>, made in between <i>Girl Can't Help It</i> and <i>Rock
            Hunter</i>, her comedic talent, and cheerful self-parody, are
            probably more readily appreciable now than they were when the films
            first came out. Nobody has been able to match Jayne Mansfield's
            ability to express pure, unadulterated delight. In <i>Kiss Them for
            Me</i> (1957), she abandons Cary Grant to the glacial Suzy Parker in
            favor of a chief petty officer played in the film by Nathaniel Frey,
            and you can see why: realizing they were meant to be together, they
            cling-tight and express their happiness and devotion to each other
            in a non-verbal, but aural, way that, for a moment, lifts the film
            to near-rhapsodic heights.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jayne had a great love of animals,
            and was often seen in public accompanied by one or two of her pet
            chihuahuas. She was also fervent about publicity and self-promotion,
            which she felt was absolutely integral to becoming, and remaining, a
            star. The list of titles that she won at various pageants and
            competitions early in her career is numerous (&quot;Miss Nylon
            Sweater,&quot; &quot;Miss Geiger Counter,&quot; &quot;Miss Fourth of
            July&quot;). The crowd of 100 guests who attended her and Mickey's
            wedding ceremony was amply filled out with publicists, press agents,
            and photographers. There was the time in Rome when Jayne danced so
            vigorously at a nightclub that the top of her evening dress fell
            down (paparazzi were conveniently at hand to take pictures); there
            was also the time when Jayne upstaged a noticeably chagrined Sophia
            Loren by showing up at a public event wearing the lowest-cut gown in
            Hollywood history (immortalized on the cover of Kenneth Anger's book
            <i>Hollywood Babylon</i>). When Jayne and Mickey were stranded at
            sea after a serious boat mishap, many dismissed the incident as a
            publicity stunt. (It was not.)</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I felt -- and still do feel
            -- that it takes more than looks and figure for a girl to be
            sexy,&quot; Jayne wrote in 1963, listing &quot;ten rules that will
            help a girl be physically attractive,&quot; aside from the mere
            maxim to &quot;think sexy:&quot;</font></p>
            <ol>
              <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yes, think sexy, that is
                important. It makes you walk, talk and be sexier.</font></li>
              <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Dress sexy -- not obvious, but
                teasing.</font></li>
              <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Create sexy incidents and
                conversations. Again not obvious but subtle.</font></li>

              <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Work towards good health.</font></li>
              <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Stay away from competition

            <p><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Wild Wild World of Jayne
            Mansfield</font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2"> opens in Rome,
            with Jayne walking down the Spanish Steps (during which we hear her
            complain about the pesky paparazzi, &quot;the nightmare of
            Rome&quot;), strolling down the Via Veneto (where she complains
            about being pinched on the behind by men), and tossing coins into
            the Trevi Fountain. Visiting the Colosseum, she recalls how
            Christians were tossed to lions in the arena, and how the spectators
            would then throw &quot;wild orgies&quot; afterwards because they'd
            become so excited by the spectacle.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Gazing upon statues made for the
            recent Olympic games conjures up the sight of Mickey, and of he and
            Jayne appearing in <b><i>Gli Amori di Ercole</i></b> (<i>The Loves
            of Hercules</i>) (1960), where he battled a large, mechanical
            three-headed dragon that breathed fire and roared. Finally, on her
            way out of Rome, she is chauffeured past a place where women ply
            their trade on the roadside for passing motorists, and Jayne worries
            about the poor wives of the men who are being neglected so they can
            stop and patronize prostitutes and haggle over the price.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Next stop, Cannes, where Jayne
            poses, wearing a bikini, in the &quot;Marquis de Sade Fountain&quot;
            (?!?!), and does the twist while Rocky Roberts and the Airdales sing
            and perform &quot;The Bird.&quot; From there, by boat, to the island
            of Levant, where, outside the town of Heliopolis (&quot;They used to
            say, 'See Naples and die'. Now it's, 'Cut loose in
            Heliopolis!'&quot;), there is a celebrated nudist colony. Jayne
            almost goes naturalist, herself, but worries someone might be
            looking. (She's right: there's a peeping tom, right over there in
            the bushes).</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In Paris, Jayne visits the salon of
            Fernand Aubry, whose staff use tape measures to position sunlamps
            over women who need to be &quot;rejuvenated.&quot; (Before receiving
            her sunlamp treatment, some stuff is sprayed on Jayne's back which
            makes her grimace.) Restored to vitality, Jayne visits the Eiffel
            Tower (where she takes a ride on the back of a motorbike driven by,
            she says, a visiting &quot;Hell's Angel&quot; from California),
            stands atop the <b><i>arc de triomphe</i></b> (where she imagines
            seeing all sorts of lovers' rendezvous, below), and takes a boat
            ride down the Seine. She also visits a club frequented by
            cross-dressers, and does the twist, again, with a woman smartly
            dressed as a man.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At night, Jayne visits clubs on the
            Place Pigalle (a riot of colorful neon and huge electric signs, at
            the time), including Le Sexy, where her friend, Gloria, works as a
            stripper. We are told that most of the dancers performing at the
            clubs are English girls, because they have the best breast shape.
            (Earlier, we are shown the annual competition at the &quot;Club
            Bust-Out,&quot; where girls from around the world are judged on
            whether they have the best &quot;bust.&quot; The winner is from
            Sweden.) There are several fairly elaborate dance numbers, some of
            which are hard to comprehend, because the music and on-stage patter
            accompanying them was not recorded by the filmmakers. (This was
            filmed in a fairly inexpensive-looking way, with what looks like one
            camera and one set of hand-held lights.) Before going back to the
            States, Jayne visits a &quot;club choreographer,&quot; and gets the
            idea to do a strip tease in her next film, in homage to the one
            Sophia Loren did in &quot;Yesterday, Today and Tomorrow.&quot;
            (Sophia might not have dug it, after that business with the
            photographers and Jayne's low-cut dress).</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In New York City, we take a turn
            into an annual transvestite competition, which we are told is
            &quot;highly illegal&quot; (not exactly), and one of the judges can
            be seen wearing a suit, tie, and a mask. (The winner of the
            competition is an African-American.) Jayne makes much merriment over
            whether to call the contestants &quot;girls&quot; or
            &quot;boys.&quot; (Honey, just as long as you don't call 'em
            anything less than fabulous.) There is also a brief interview with a
            tiny guy who is supposed to be a Jayne Mansfield impersonator (he
            has a blond wig on, at least), and who makes <b><i>moués</i></b>
            with his lips in between answers like, &quot;No, I don't want
            children.&quot; and &quot;That's the only thing in my life I'm
            waiting for -- 'til I can party like you.&quot;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But Jayne's biggest surprise is
            when she gets back home to Los Angeles, where she discovers that,
            while she's been out of the country, the whole town has gone --
            topless! Yes! There's a topless female ice-cream vendor; a topless
            female shoe-shine person, with a long line of waiting male
            customers; two topless female mechanics who work in a garage
            (&quot;This is a full-service garage.&quot;). There's even a topless
            female window-washer. The ultimate occurs during a visit to the Blue
            Bunny, and a performance by the Ladybirds, a topless all-girl rock
            band who perform while wearing outfits that look like they were
            designed for the next episode of the Learning Channel's
            &quot;Junkyard Wars.&quot; If that doesn't blow your mind, nothing
            will. But -- THAT'S NOT THE END OF THE MOVIE.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Scenery rushes by the camera. The
            sound of car brakes. &quot;A bulletin has just been handed to
            me!...&quot; Still photographs appear behind a filter of blazing
            red. All of a sudden, Jayne perishes. And...oh, my goodness, is that
            one of Jayne's dogs, up there? The film moves quickly on....</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">On the one hand, the filmmakers had
            a lot of gumption to end their film in such a way. On the other
            hand, it still staggers belief. We are given a tour of the
            &quot;Pink Palace,&quot; which allows us to catch our breath. We see
            Mickey, along with his two young sons by Jayne, and we see home
            movie footage of the three of them with Jayne in happier times. The
            narrator says, &quot;And so ended the wild, wild world of Jayne
            Mansfield....&quot; The title, which had first been used as a
            come-on, now turns into a eulogy.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In real life, Jayne tried several
            new avenues for her career during the Sixties. She made several
            pop/rock recordings. After performing at the Tropicana in 1958,
            Jayne appeared in a specially-written musical revue at the Dunes, in
            Las Vegas, starting in 1960. &quot;House of Love&quot; featured
            Jayne and Mickey appearing on-stage, hosting a housewarming party
            for guests (played by impersonators) that included Louella Parsons
            (&quot;I want an exclusive!&quot;), Bette Davis (&quot;Me Bette. You
            Jayne. That's an old Tarzan joke!&quot;), Charles Laughton (&quot;I
            remember someone once said 'Good things come in small
            packages'....They didn't know you, Jayne Mansfield!&quot;), Noel
            Coward (&quot;My dear, you could turn the marble statue of a saint
            into a r-r-r-raving maniac!&quot;), and Tallulah Bankhead
            (&quot;Egad! Why couldn't they've slipped me a Mickey like
            that?&quot;). (The show has been immortalized on L.P. and CD, and
            it's rather ingratiating.) When the Whiskey-a-Go-Go opened on the
            Sunset Strip, in Hollywood, Jayne became a regular fixture, twisting
            away on the dance floor night after night with other patrons.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">On television, Jayne made several,
            funny guest appearances on Jack Benny's program, and also did an
            impressive dramatic turn on an episode of the &quot;Alfred Hitchcock
            Hour,&quot; &quot;Blackout,&quot; opposite Tony Randall. She
            allegedly turned down a chance to appear as a regular cast member on
            a new television series, &quot;Gilligan's Island,&quot; but
            television, at that time, was still seen as second-rate, and a step
            downwards for anyone who had established themselves in motion

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jayne's feature film career,
            though, was foundering. Her decision to appear topless in two scenes
            of <i>Promises...Promises!</i> (1963) made her the first name star
            to perform any sort of full frontal nudity on-screen, at that time.
            (She also allowed &quot;Playboy&quot; to take color
            behind-the-scenes photographs during the production. The issue they
            appeared in became one of the highest-selling in the magazine's
            history.) Her other films during this period ranged from the
            mediocre (<i>It Happened in Athens</i>, a chloroformed account of
            the revival of the Olympic games; <i>The Sheriff of Fractured Jaw</i>,
            a Western parody made in the U.K. with an uncomfortable Kenneth
            More) to otherwise (<i>Primitive Love</i>, made with the Italian
            comedy team Franco and Ciccio, and the cruddy thriller <i>Dog Eat
            Dog</i>). Her cameo in Tony Richardson's film, <i>The Loved One</i>,
            ended up, along with those by several other celebrities, on the
            cutting room floor.<o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jayne and Mickey separated, though,
            legally, they never officially divorced. Jayne then fell in with
            Matt Cimber, who directed her playing three roles in the film <i>Single
            Room Furnished</i>. (Cimber would later direct Pia Zadora in her two
            &quot;debut&quot; 1981 films, <i>Butterfly </i>and <i>Fake Out</i>.)
            The film was designed as a low-budget showcase for Jayne's serious
            dramatic talents, and, so that the audience wouldn't fail to notice,
            Walter Winchell appeared on-camera to introduce the film, concluding
            his remarks with the emphatic pronouncement, &quot;Jayne Mansfield
            can act!&quot; Winchell's nationally syndicated newspaper column,
            along with his radio and TV programs, had long since folded by that
            time, so the &quot;newsroom&quot; in which he is seen to habituate
            in this introduction was actually a stage set.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">During the week of June 25, 1967,
            CBS-TV ran a four-part &quot;news inquiry,&quot; over four nights,
            on the Warren Report. <i>El Dorado</i>, Satyajit Ray's <i>The Big
            City</i>, <i>The Family Way</i> (in which Hayley Mills gets married
            and, gasp! tries to have a baby), and Vittorio De Sica's <i>Woman
            Times Seven</i>, with Shirley MacLaine playing seven different
            roles, were premiering in theaters, along with a little film version
            of Jean Genet's <i>Deathwatch</i>, directed by Vic Morrow and
            starring Leonard Nimoy, Michael Forest and Paul Mazursky. Jerry
            Herman, whose musical, <i>Mame</i>, was still playing on Broadway
            with Angela Lansbury in the lead, announced that he was doing a
            musical stage adaptation of <i>The Madwoman of Chaillot</i>.
            Antonioni's <i>Blow Up</i>, whose U.S. ads emphasized Vanessa
            Redgrave's &quot;topless&quot; scene in the film, was going into
            wide release, as was <i>You Only Live Twice</i>, the film that was
            going to be Sean Connery's last appearance as James Bond. &quot;The
            Far East Suite,&quot; a final series of musical pieces Duke
            Ellington had written with his late collaborator Billy Strayhorn,
            was due out in record stores. The Jefferson Airplane were performing
            to packed audiences at the Fillmore in San Francisco. Thornton
            Wilder's novel, <i>The Eighth Day</i>, was number one on the <i>New
            York Times</i> fiction best-seller list, with William Manchester's <i>Death
            of a President</i>, about the John F. Kennedy assassination, in the
            number 1 spot on the non-fiction list. Jerusalem's mayor Teddy
            Kollek and the Israeli Knesset annexed &quot;Old Jerusalem,&quot;
            held by the Jordanians, unifying the city that week, a move
            denounced by U.S. President Lyndon B. Johnson.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The night of June 29, Jayne had
            agreed to make an appearance at a supper club in Biloxi,
            Mississippi, substituting for Mamie Van Doren, who was originally
            scheduled to appear. She was due to appear the next day on an
            early-morning TV show in New Orleans. The club provided her with a
            car and driver to take her from Biloxi to New Orleans overnight.
            Traveling with Jayne was lawyer Bill Slocum, with whom Jayne had
            become involved after breaking up with Matt Cimber, and who,
            according to several accounts, did not treat Jayne or her children
            well. In the southern delta states at that time of year, municipal
            trucks would spray in areas where mosquitoes were known to
            proliferate during the humid summer months; the trucks' appearance
            on the roads would be announced in advance in the local papers or on
            TV The driver of Jayne's car did not see the truck lumbering ahead
            of them, trailing a thick cloud of pesticide, and the two vehicles
            collided, sheering off the top of the car Jayne was riding in.
            Jayne, her driver, and Slocum were killed; had Jayne's three
            children not been settled down on the floor of the back seat to
            sleep, they, too, would have perished in the accident. (The crumpled
            vehicle was later purchased by someone who put it on display for the
            next thirty years.)</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Jayne Mansfield who appeared in
            the &quot;Hitchcock Hour&quot; episode, &quot;Blackout,&quot; with
            Tony Randall -- slim, mature, yet attractive, with short-cut auburn
            hair -- offers a glimpse of a Jayne Mansfield that might have been
            had she been taken in hand by an advisor or manager who would have
            acted in her best interests, and helped re-shaped her in a way that
            would also have brought out her best qualities as a performer and
            personality. At the conclusion of her stage show at the Dunes, Jayne
            asks Tallulah Bankhead (played, splendidly, by impersonator Arthur
            Trask) for a response to her &quot;House of Love.&quot; &quot;It's
            the living end. The only thing that could top it would be World War
            III, and that WILL be the living end!&quot; replies Tallulah,
            adding, &quot;Tell me...tell me honestly...are people still making
            'love'?&quot; &quot;Of course, Tallulah,&quot; Jayne replies.
            &quot;Everybody's making love, all over the world!&quot; Forty years
            later, reality may be different, but Jayne's basic sentiment -- that
            it's love, above all, that keeps the world going 'round -- is one
            that will never go out of style or out of date.</font></td>
