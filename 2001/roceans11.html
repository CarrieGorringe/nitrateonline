            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Movie
            stars. Like so many terminators, they are relentless. </font></span><font face="Verdana" size="2">They
            can't be reasoned with, can't be bargained with, they don't feel
            pity or remorse, or fear. And they absolutely will not stop. But why
            should they? It's their job, after all, to be everywhere and be
            everything, to bring joy to the masses and profits to the few, to
            appear in movies (of course), on TV, in magazines, in newspapers, in
            shopping malls. Okay, so maybe they're not always happy about such
            promotional excesses: all those talk shows, fawning fans, and hotel
            suites must get tedious.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yet, they soldier on, and in so,
            earn the thanks of a grateful nation. They pledge time and money to
            good causes, get teary on camera, mean what they say. They look so
            fabulous, they understand their worth, and yet they are still
            willing to spill their guts on <i>Oprah</i>. And you believe them.
            This is the genius of the U.S. star system: as remote and special as
            celebrities seem to be (indeed, as much as they are primped and
            permed and processed to be), you can believe you have a stake in
            their success, that it matters to you if Renee Zellweger is dating
            George Clooney or if Britney Spears is a virgin. It's fun to care
            about something because you think they care, that you have access to
            their lives and feelings. Watching celebrities perform as if they
            are not performing, can be the most moving, most meaningful part of
            celebrity worship.&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hence, <i>Ocean's Eleven</i>,
            Steven Soderbergh's star-studded homage to star-studdedness. Hence,
            as well, movie stars Clooney, Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts, Matt Damon,
            and Don Cheadle sitting down with <span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Barbara
            Walters and Katie Couric, Leno and Letterman, even spending a few
            minutes with Pink, for an MTV version of <i>Entertainment Tonight</i>.
            This last is a vaguely batty idea, resulting in a train-wreck-like
            compelling interview sequences I've seen in a while: dear sweet Pink
            brings along a list of Boring Interview Questions (the kind parodied
            by recent movies about the movie business, like, Julia Roberts' own <i>American
            Sweethearts</i>), and poses them one by one to a few of the </span><i>Ocean's
            Eleven</i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
            stars, behaving as if she is genuinely nervous to meet Brad Pitt,
            just you would be... except of course, Pink has a new CD to hand out
            to her interviewees, who smile as they take this token of their
            blushing fan's appreciation. You have to hand it to these movie
            stars: they know how to work their own brilliance.
            </span></font></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Such
            self-conscious gimmickry is at the center of the</font></span><font face="Verdana" size="2">
            <i>Ocean's Eleven</i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
            marketing engine for months. Consider the December </span>2001 <i>Esquire</i>
            magazine gambit, where Clooney interviews Roberts, and vice versa:
            two way-cool and self-loving movie stars conversing with each other
            in a restaurant, laughing uproariously and making fun of the process
            while revealing &quot;themselves&quot; in ways that they would never
            do for the reporter, because, of course, they care not that said
            reporter is observing from the bar and will be transcribing the
            recording afterwards. How clever and radiantly movie-star-like is <i>that</i>?!</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The occasion for this interview --
            and the bijillion other fabulous marketing moments featuring
            Clooney, Roberts, Pitt, or Damon that you've seen in the past month
            -- is, of course, the release of <i>Ocean's Eleven</i>, Steven
            Soderbergh's remake that's not quite a remake of the 1960 Rat Pack
            romp in Vegas. The original, as you've probably heard, was less a
            movie than a rationale for the <span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Frank
            Sinatra and friends Dean Martin, Joey Bishop, Peter Lawford, and
            Sammy Davis Jr., to hang out and get paid at the same time, maybe
            coinciding with show-dates in Vegas, maybe not. The movie is
            notoriously not-good, mostly talky and tedious (except when Dean
            Martin sings Sammy Cahn's swingy &quot;Ain't that a kick in the
            head,&quot; a couple of times), but no one cares because it's about
            watching the guys, and Honorary Rat Shirley MacLaine for a minute,
            &quot;be themselves.&quot; (Angie Dickinson also shows up for a two
            scenes, as Sinatra's ex, but she actually seems to be acting a part,
            and pretty well, unlike everyone else.) This not-goodness is part
            and parcel of the first <i>Ocean's Eleven</i>'s appeal: it's not
            concerned with plot but with that performance of access. It's lovely
            to see Frank and Sammy and Dean hang out, improvise, horse around,
            in<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Sinatra's casinos,
            where they performed live anyway. Who cares if your sense of access
            is false? <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            new movie is a little less swanky, but it's just as
            smirky-in-love-with-itself, and that actually carries it along for a
            bit. If it lacks the first one's sheer nerve, it makes up for that
            with showy cinematography (by Soderbergh under a pseudonym, as in <i>Traffic</i>),
            Stephen Mirrione's keen editing, and David Holmes' smooth,
            lounge-ish score. Better than anything else, the caper is set in
            Vegas, which tends to look better on wide, saturated-color movie
            screens than it does in person. It's too perfect: even more than
            Hollywood, Vegas is a star-lovers' paradise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Where
            the first film understood the simplicity of its own concept, and the
            Soderbergh version is slightly more elaborate, the main appeal is
            the same in both: stars being themselves. In 2001, the mechanics are
            changed slightly: both films involve eleven men stealing lots of
            money from Vegas casinos, but in the new one, Danny Ocean (Clooney)
            is a just-released prison inmate, not a WWII veteran, and the new
            Danny's girl issues are much less worked out (he has this true love
            thing going on; Sinatra couldn't be bothered with such silliness).
            As the new <i>Ocean's Eleven</i> opens, Danny has &quot;paid his
            debt to society&quot; and is ready to resume a life outside. He's
            pissed though, and wants to get back some of what he lost: he
            believes that &quot;because the house always wins,&quot; this is a
            good reason to try to mess with the house. (This is the second
            stroke of genius of the U.S. star system, that a star can pretend <i>not</i>
            to be the &quot;house,&quot; and thus win your sympathy.)
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Danny
            has vengeance on his mind, targeting Terry (Andy Garcia),
            billionaire owner of several Vegas hot spots and the man currently
            dating Danny's ex-wife, the splendiferous Tess (Roberts). To win
            this high-stakes game (and yes, the gambling metaphors run rampant
            here), Danny enlists the help of old scam-chum Rusty (Pitt),
            introduced as he's instructing a group of pleasant-enough but
            clueless teen and sorta-post-teen stars to play cards (Joshua
            Jackson, Holly Marie Combs, <i>Traffic'</i>s Topher Grace). Clearly,
            Rusty needs Danny. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">More
            than that, these guys are made for each other, the perfect buddy
            unit (which makes the other characters rather insignificant, but
            they do their best to provide lively, well-acted backdrop). Rusty is
            practical and exacting, Danny scheming and dreaming, into Big
            Pictures. Never mind the little detail that this time, Danny's Big
            Picture has to do with &quot;winning back&quot; his ex, thus leaving
            Rusty at a bit of a loss by film's end... more about that later. The
            supporting crew ranges in degrees of movie-starness, much like the
            1960 movie's cast did. Danny and Rusty recruit pickpocket Linus
            (Damon), licensed dealer/Vegas insider Frank (Bernie Mac), sage
            conman Saul Bloom (Carl Reiner), financier Reuben (Elliot Gould),
            munitions expert Bashir Tarr (Don Cheadle, wrestling with one heck
            of an unconvincing Cockneyish accent), electronics expert Livingston
            (Eddie Jemison), &quot;grease man,&quot; a.k.a.
            Chinese-only-speaking contortionist Yen (Shaobo Qin), and the
            driver/mechanic brothers, Virgil (Casey Affleck) and Turk (Scott
            Caan). All come together to rob the money from three mega-casinos,
            conveniently stored in one place, the super-well-guarded basement
            safe of the Bellagio, sure to be extra-specially chucky full on the
            night of the Lennox Lewis-Wladimir Klitschko heavyweight bout.
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            is a nice touch, because the film is all about heavyweights, about
            clout and how they wield it, about access and how they perform it.
            And so the metaphor extends. As Clooney tells Roberts in <i>Esquire</i>,
            although the industry is &quot;male-driven,&quot; she is the
            inspiring, stimulating exception, an old-fashioned &quot;female
            star&quot; who outshines her male counterparts. &quot;It's
            hard,&quot; he says, &quot;For a leading man at times to hold his
            own against you.&quot; I suppose this explains why the new <i>Ocean's
            Eleven</i> lines up eleven men to hold their own against Julia.
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            men look good. And Tess, even with all her Julia-juju working, looks
            less good. I mean, she <i>looks</i> amazing, in flawless costumes,
            lighting, and makeup, and Roberts is the Best American Movie Star
            and an Oscar-winner. But Tess suffers, plot-wise. Between Danny and
            Terry, both self-absorbed, obsessive rich guys (stars in their own
            ways), she's got a ridiculous and wholly unbelievable choice to
            make, a choice that is not in the first film. By the time this
            choice becomes the supposed climax in the movie after the caper
            stuff, which is much more interesting), the movie has lost
            considerable steam.
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Then
            again, this is the kind of choice that you might imagine a movie
            star making, a movie star whose emotions you might recognize or even
            share. For Tess is really just an observer here, like you. The boys
            are where the action is. They </font></span><font face="Verdana" size="2">love
            themselves and one another. <span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">You
            might wish that Bernie Mac's Frank had a little more to do, because
            Bernie Mac does charge up whatever scene he's in, but perhaps he's
            still working on his movie star cred. (He wasn't on the Barbara
            Walters special, either; though he has since showed up on Leno,
            razzing him about not understanding what he meant by &quot;black
            movies.&quot;) Roberts might take your breath away, as Clooney has
            observed more than once, but the boys are the stars here. Check
            Clooney on <i>Premiere</i>'s cover, in mid-laugh because he's that
            spontaneous and delightful. And check &quot;All American
            Heartthrob&quot; Pitt on the cover of <i>Vanity Fair</i>. These guys
            know how to look like movie stars. Even when the news inside such
            magazines might be grim, about holy wars and military tribunals,
            this is how the U.S. manages its nerve, mounts its interests, and
            takes care of its own. Brad Pitt doesn't know how to be anyone but
            himself, and that's why he's a terrific movie star: the background
            surf, unbuttoned shirt, and look away from the camera -- all this
            demonstrates just how movie-starness is done. The plot, like I say,
            is beside the point.
