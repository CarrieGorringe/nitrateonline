            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>Éloge de l'amour</i> (<i>Eulogy
            About/of Love</i>), is the latest film from one of the now-elder
            statesmen of the New Wave, Jean-Luc Godard. The film's title suggest
            that this is a more mellow work than one might expect of the
            traditionally acerbic Godard, one of the most mordant observers of
            human values, especially American values. Actually, <i>Éloge</i> is
            both mellow and mordant, but also interlaced with a strong sense of
            disquiet. Ostensibly a film about personal relationships, it really
            Of course, Godard reserves his most ascerbic commentary for American
            capitalism and the means by which it has served up the American way
            of life in a seemingly endless supply of goods for world-wide
            consumption -- or, as he has always believed, for forced-feeding.
            Godard stated his opposition to this Coca-Cola capitalism most
            unequivocally -- and snidely -- in his 1967 film, <i>Two or Three
            Things I Know About Her</i>; in the course of this film, two title
            cards appear in almost immediate sequence: the first, &quot;<i>Pax
            Americana</i>,&quot; and the second, &quot;Economy-Sized Brain
            Washing.&quot; Now, Godard emphasizes how the American media does
            exactly the same thing with human tragedy: in Godard's mind, they
            grind up the subtle elements involved in human tragedy and serves
            them up as easily-digestible entertainment (a relevant point to
            anyone who sat endlessly watching the coverage of the atrocities
            heaped upon America on 11 September, and waited for hours to receive
            any snippet of real news from the constant blathering of on-air
            journalists who were ready with snazzy graphics, but who were
            desperately groping around for any substantive information in order
            to fill an unending demand for 24-7 news coverage. In a recent
            interview in <i>The New York Times</i> <i>Magazine</i>, Godard
            confirmed that a fear of losing &quot;cultural memory&quot; is the
            central theme running through <i>Éloge</i>, through, among other
            things, willful indifference or the remixing of history to turn it
            into something more entertaining. Godard's uses one of the worst
            examples of brutality in the twentieth century -- the Holocaust --
            and makes it the central metaphor in <i>Éloge</i>. His attitude
            toward those who are now &quot;reshaping&quot; the Holocaust as a
            means of storytelling has all of the trademark Godardian
            irreverence. One scene in particular is an apt illustration. It
            involves a discussion between a World War II Jewish resistance
            fighter and her agent. Apparently, Steven Spielberg wants to
            purchase the rights to her memoirs, and their overall attitude
            toward his overtures is less than flattering (so much so that, after
            this obvious jab at Spielberg's cinematic treatment of the
            Holocaust, it might be doubtful as to whether or not Mr. Spielberg
            will be including Godard on his list of the Top Ten directors in
            cinema history within the time frame of anyone's memory).</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But Godard, as is typical, uses
            that irreverence for more than the sake of doing so. He (rightfully)
            disapproves of the capacity of entertainment to concentrate upon a
            so-called &quot;bigger picture,&quot; sentimentalizing and
            simplifying the monstrous, ignoring the small but significant
            details in the name of narrative efficiency, regardless of the
            perpetrator. Godard concentrates upon those small details, how
            everyday places and people were also incorporated, in an almost
            undetectable way, into the machinery of murder, making the killing
            easier for people to tolerate. For example, Godard uses lingering
            still shots to capture the train station at Drancy (probably one of
            the many transit points for Jews headed for the death camps),
            accompanied by a voice-over who utters the still-unsettled and
            unsettling question concerning French collaboration, &quot;Why did
            we [the French] allow ourselves to be led like sheep?&quot; The use
            of black-and-white film to shoot these images -- and also the
            majority of the film-- conveys the sense of losing an immediate link
            to historical events. The experience is not dissimilar to the one
            generated by looking at photos of Auschwitz over fifty years later;
            without historical context, the site could pass for a factory that
            could have turned out plates rather than corpses; without historical
            context, much of the film's thematic richness goes unappreciated).
            Intimate knowledge creates and sustains memory, and those who have
            experienced the hell first hand, or those who have the ability to
            &quot;read&quot; and translate the information for mass consumption
            while keeping it vital are either a rapidly-dying or very small
            group of individuals. Godard seems to be suggesting that once the
            last of the eyewitnesses have disappeared, memory and horror will
            have passed into dusty archival documents in an immutable, lifeless,
            form; we will be dependent upon the translators, and in a world in
            which the majority seemingly prefers minimal information and
            immediate gratification, cultural history lies in a state of peril.
            One could, in fact, come to the same conclusions about <i>Éloge</i>;
            without historical context, much of the film's rich subtext isn't
            always recognizable and, thus, in danger, perhaps, of becoming
            irrelevant. Even allowing for Godard's disdain for mass acceptance,
            the thought of a filmmaker's work not surviving him in a thematic
            sense must inspire some sort of dread in him or her.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film is filled with rueful
            nostalgia for both lost personal and global opportunities, whether
            in terms of making irreparable mistakes in a relationship or in
            preventing the destruction of millions of people, because both
            contain the uncomfortable issue of personal pleasure versus
            responsibility and potential culpability. <i>Éloge</i> is a
            characteristically Godardian work, an acquired taste for many, and,
            on many occasions -- including this one -- both provocative and
            thoughtful, instead of merely provocative.</font></o:p>
