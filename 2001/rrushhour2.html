            Tucker is looking well-fed. Sitting pretty on the cover of August's <i>GQ</i>,
            the twenty-eight-year-old actor-comedian doesn't look nearly so
            scrawny as he used to. It's no wonder: he's a superstar, just paid
            $20 million to co-star with Jackie Chan in a sequel to 1998's
            boffo-surprise hit <i>Rush Hour</i>. This isn't to say that Tucker
            shouldn't be making this kind of money (though it is worth remarking
            that co-star Chan made &quot;only&quot; $15 million). After all, the
            first movie earned some $250 million worldwide, making it something
            of an industry benchmark, namely, the highest-grossing movie without
            white male leads. To its minor credit, New Line recognized. And,
            well, if studios are good at anything, it's knowing how to pay,
            promote, and pacify their cash cows. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Tucker
            is no overnight cash cow. The Decatur, Georgia native has shown and
            proved his willingness to take a dare, within limits. For, like many
            actors who start out in comedy (Chris Rock, Eddie Murphy, Jim
            Carrey), Tucker was right off identified as a particular persona,
            irreverent, mad-speedy, and ever-ready with the elaborate
            neck-rolls, gumby-body gyrations, and spastic vocals. Again and
            again, he's been hired to deliver that persona, from his initial
            &quot;hungry&quot; roles (Johnny Booze in <i>House Party III</i>
            [1994], <i>Friday's</i> Smokey and <i>Dead Presidents's </i>Skip
            [both 1995]) to his next-step, determined-to-piss-off-someone roles
            (<i>The Fifth Element's</i> Ruby Rhod and <i>Money Talks's</i>
            Franklin Hatchett, both 1997). The fact that he executive produced <i>Money
            Talks</i>, helmed by <i>Rush Hour</i> and <i>RH2</i> director Brett
            Ratner, indicates Tucker's own early understanding of what he had to
            sell and how best to sell it. As the outrageous, outraged black man
            whose efforts to stay out of trouble only ensure that he will be in
            it, he's hit a (profitable) nerve. At a time when hypocrisy over
            racism is the cultural norm -- when racial profiling is deplored but
            okayed (by high profile court verdicts), when bling-bling and booty
            spell success, and when minstrelsy is making a well-paid comeback --
            Chris Tucker's simultaneously cool and calamitous pose makes an
            uncomfortable sense. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At
            once noisy and sympathetic, Tucker owes something to Murphy and
            Rock, Richard Prior and Redd Foxx, performers with something to say
            about their worlds. He also has P. Diddy's gift for image
            management. After <i>RH</i>, he was predictably inundated with
            similar projects. But, he tells <i>GQ</i>, he took a breath and
            pondered his options. He left super-manager Michael Ovitz, turned
            down the Jamie Foxx part in <i>Any Given Sunday</i> (not wanting to
            play the &quot;black athlete&quot;), backed out of <i>Black Knight</i>
            (which then transmogrified into a Martin Lawrence vehicle, due out
            this fall), and appeared on the covers of swank mags such as <i>GQ</i>
            and <i>Code</i>. Currently, Tucker is shooting the long-in-the-works
            <i>Guess Who's President</i> (a.k.a. <i>Mr. President</i>) in which
            he plays the first black U.S. president; producing and starring in
            the spy-comedy, <i>Double O-Soul</i>, and, oh yes, doing press for <i>Rush
            Hour 2</i>. This past week, as part of the promotional blitz for <i>RH2</i>,
            he appeared on Leno and did his version of MTV's <i>Diary</i>,
            wherein he demonstrates affection for his fans and dedication to his
            craft (&quot;I work like James Evans on <i>Good Times</i>!&quot;),
            by sneaking into his own movie, playing in a multiplex, to check how
            well it goes over. When a kid asks him to perform a &quot;Chris
            Tucker&quot; move, he politely refuses, saying the kid can probably
            do it better than he can. This suggests that Tucker understands his
            foremost function -- as a screen onto which fans project their own
            desires and fantasies. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like
            most sequels, RH2 does what the first film did, only louder and more
            extravagantly. A bigger budget allowed for more locations (Hong
            Kong, LA, and Vegas); a couple of &quot;quality&quot; players in
            supporting roles (John Lone as a triad boss, Don Cheadle as an
            informant who, for no clear reason, wears a cue and speaks Chinese);
            a rising star (Zhang Ziyi, essentially playing Jet Li's part in <i>Lethal
            Weapon IV</i>, i.e., the earnest martial arts expert who doesn't say
            much); and an old-school comedian (Alan King). None of these
            add-ons, however, does much to cover up <i>RH2</i>'s essential
            banality. But what else can you expect? This is the way that film
            franchises tend to work: the dynamic of the first will be replayed
            unto death in subsequent variations. <o:p>

            opens with cop-buddies Carter (Tucker) and Lee (Chan) in full-on
            camaraderie, singing &quot;California Girls&quot; at the top of
            their lungs while cruising Hong Kong streets and looking for
            &quot;moo shu&quot;: flipping the original script, Carter's on Lee's
            turf. Within minutes, the Big Case descends on them as if from
            sequel heaven, something to do with counterfeit U.S. money, murders,
            and a Trump-like casino-owner named Steven Reign (King). To make the
            whole undertaking &quot;personal&quot; for Lee (as in the first
            film, his sense of honor is differentiated from Carter's general
            raffishness), writer Jeff (<i>Speed 2: Cruise Control</i>) Nathanson
            includes a culprit who's close to Lee, namely, his dead father's
            former partner, Ricky Tan (Lone, though he hardly seems old enough
            to be Chan's father's partner), now a criminal in league with Reign
            and backed up by fashionably female muscle, Hu Li (Zhang). <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Lee
            and Carter bumble their way through the investigation, which
            conveniently takes them through a series of set-pieces, in a karaoke
            bar, a massage parlor, and a yacht in Hong Kong, a Vegas casino,
            etc. In each, the partners deploy race jokes, cultural
            misunderstanding jokes, and potency jokes. So, when he's angry at
            his partner, Carter cries, &quot;I'll slap you so hard you end up in
            the Ming Dynasty!&quot; or, &quot;I'm from LA: we invented
            gangs!&quot; Or again, after Carter's raucous karaoke performance of
            Michael Jackson's &quot;Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough,&quot; Lee
            tries to get him to be more discrete during their investigation, to
            follow his lead. In Hong Kong, he says, &quot;I'm Michael Jackson and you're Toto,&quot; to which Carter responds with peppery
            exasperation, &quot;You mean Tito!&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            you know they're just going through the motions of disagreement
            here, since their &quot;chemistry&quot; and mutual affection were
            well-established in the first movie. In fact, my favorite scene in <i>RH2</i>
            both exaggerates and satirizes this relationship, when Lee,
            believing Carter to be dead, gets misty when he hears Puffy's
            torturously overplayed pop-paean to Biggie Smalls, &quot;I'll Be
            Missing You,&quot; on the radio. But for the most part, the movie
            does what most buddy-movie sequels do -- it works overtime to
            reassure the audience of the buddies' straightness. Sometimes this
            works by indirection, with the boys acting &quot;gay&quot; so you
            can laugh at their prissiness: Carter prances through a sewer
            because he's scared of rats, or both characters contend with a
            flaming Versace clerk (Jeremy Piven channeling Bronson Pinchot from <i>Beverly
            Hills Cop</i>). Other times, their heterosexuality is affirmed by
            standard manly-man activities: shooting, driving, running, kicking,
            ogling breasts. At the massage parlor, Carter slavers after an array
            of mute bikinied babes at the massage parlor (this bit is the film's
            least imaginative by far: it's as if they've stepped into a Jay-Z
            video, or more pertinently, a Ludacris video: see also his MTV movie
            plug, &quot;Area Codes&quot;). And Lee finds himself attracted to an
            undercover U.S. Treasury Agent, Isabella Molina (Roselyn Sanchez,
            TV's Fame LA). Perhaps needless to say, Lee does not act on his
            attraction, being a nobly asexual Asian action star.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And
            this being an action comedy, sex is sublimated repeatedly into crazy
            violence. The massage parlor scene ends in a melee when Ricky Tan
            sics his karate-chopping goons on Lee and Carter, who, in turn, wage
            slickly choreographed retaliation, outfitted in miraculously affixed
            towels and little robes (Arnold already did this way back in Red
            Heat, but his incredible-hulked-up body wasn't the revelation that
            Tucker's newly developed physique is). Here, Carter performs as a
            kind of too-tall gangly double for the powerhouse Lee. Here again,
            their partnership is celebrated in their collaborative ass-kicking
            and satirized in a race joke: Carter whomps Lee in the face by
            accident, then declares in his own defense, &quot;All y'all look
            alike!&quot; The line neatly captures what's at stake in their
            dynamic, which is designed to make fun of and profit from
            longstanding stereotypes. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And
            this brings us back to that phrase, &quot;without white male
            leads,&quot; as it marks a shift in movie making and marketing.
            Under other circumstances, it might be heartening to see a studio
            appreciate its black and Chinese leads, even if only in the interest
            of grossing more money. But really, such appreciation is behind the
            times, and reinforces same-old thinking: if white folks buy it (this
            being the sign of a &quot;crossover&quot; product), then producers
            will do it again, but only then. My question is: how can it be news
            to anyone that whites consume merchandise -- music, movies, TV --
            featuring non-Caucasians? The question makes you wonder about what's
            at the heart of the <i>Rush Hour</i> franchise's comedy and the
            studio's understanding of it. Comedy need not be subversive or even
            intelligent, to be funny, but rehearsing ancient insults hardly
            seems worthwhile. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Of
            course, the <i>Rush Hours</i> aren't alone in this practice. Indeed,
            recycling and recontextualizing racist, classist, and sexist
            stereotypes is quite the fashion these days. So, you have <i>The
            Animal's</i> Guy Torrey and <i>Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back's</i>
            Chris Rock playing hyper-irate black men who see racist offense in
            every trivial non-event. Call this the mainstreaming of the kind of
            stand-up material that makes white folks feel nervous (and excluded)
            -- Rock's &quot;the difference between a black man and a
            nigger&quot; routine from a few years back, or more recent work by
            Bernie Mac, Margaret Cho, Cedric the Entertainer, Dave Chapelle, and
            slam poet Beau Sia. The very excessiveness of the stereotypes, and
            the &quot;ironic&quot; self-consciousness it presumes, make
            faux-edgy fun for the films' young, cross-over viewers, who can
            &quot;get&quot; all the punchlines, no matter their
            self-identifications. Hooray if this mainstreaming can bring
            cultures together, but let's not fool ourselves: it begins and ends
            with those millions to be made. <o:p>
