            review by <a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 2 February 2001</i> </font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In <i>Sugar and Spice</i>, Diane
            (Marley Shelton), the leader of Lincoln High School's
            &quot;A&quot;-team cheerleading squad, tells the four other girls on
            her team that she has been inspired, no, moved by the words of
            another great woman, words that she then proceeds to recite, with
            all the reverence and meaning of the Gettysburg Address or Dr.
            King's &quot;I have a dream&quot; speech. The other girls bow their
            heads in unison, out of recognition of the Great One whom Diane has
            just quoted. They then all go out and rob a bank.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And it's not even a big bank, but a
            supermarket bank branch, one of those little mini-places where you
            make a withdrawal before buying this week's groceries or obtain a
            money order on the spur of the moment. This all has to do with Diane
            (whom, as played by Shelton, has the wide, expressive eyes of the
            young Blythe Danner) becoming involved, at the start of the school
            year, with the new star of the school's football team, grinning,
            sauntering and charismatic Jack (James Marsden), making them, yes, a
            couple named Jack and Diane, just like in the John Cougar Mellencamp
            song. Diane becomes pregnant, Jack promises to marry her as soon as
            they graduate, and they get a place of their own, but Diane finds
            that she can't financially make ends meet, causing her to bitterly
            exclaim to her friends, &quot;The Beatles were wrong: love isn't all
            you need!&quot; Money must be found, and the girls get the idea
            while watching a video of &quot;Point Break&quot; -- because it, you
            know, has Keanu in it? -- that a bank robbery will solve all their
            problems.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The other members of the
            &quot;A&quot;-team include Hannah (Rachel Blanchard), who comes from
            a strictly Christian family and is particularly fond of horses; Lucy
            (Sara Marsh), whose future is pinned on her getting into Harvard;
            Cleo (Melissa George), who has a mind-boggling crush on Conan
            O'Brien; and Kansas (Mena Suvari), who just happens to have a mother
            in the penitentiary who is happy to give the girls all the
            particulars on how to go about staging an armed robbery (and who is
            played, in a surprising, unrecognizable, but not-bad performance, by
            Sean Young). Another member of the team, Fern (Alexandra Holden),
            comes onboard in exchange for some contraband weapons supplied by
            her father.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The story is narrated by a venomous
            member of the high school's &quot;B&quot;-team of cheerleaders,
            played by Marla Sokoloff, who not only describes scenes that she
            could not have witnessed or known about but whose function in the
            story<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>does not become
            apparent until almost the very end of the movie. In fact, by the
            time the main characters finally stage the robbery, the movie turns
            out to be almost over, so there's little or no room left to enjoy or
            find out what happens afterwards. The characters are drawn in broad,
            zany strokes, and the filmmakers try to keep the audience high on a
            fizzy, dizzy atmosphere -- there's so much work on creating fizz, in
            fact, that it turns out to be just about all there is in the movie.
            There isn't a single moment or depiction of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>what the other kids at school think about Diane's blossoming
            into the flower of motherhood, how she can still get into her
            midriff cheerleading uniform after she is past six months pregnant,
            or whether or not she can still do, much less get hurt by,
            performing regulation cheerleading &quot;dismounts&quot;,
            &quot;illegal&quot; or not.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The picture ends up seeming
            &quot;light&quot; without the &quot;weight&quot;, and that may be
            fine for some, but it's especially apparent in some of the scenes
            with Mena Suvari, who not only has what turns out to be a supporting
            role in the picture, but gives her scenes enough of a bite to show
            that she has way too much talent to be knocking around in
            insubstantial material. Hopefully, she won't end up stuck making
            movies like <i>Poison Ivy 3</i>.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
