            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">As you hit the play button at the 
            beginning of <i>Tape</i>, Richard Linklater's latest small indie 
            project (shot on tape, transferred to film), Ethan Hawke is guzzling 
            warm Rolling Rock and emptying another down the sink. As Vincent, 
            he's setting the stage for something/someone—crunching both cans on 
            the floor, tossing off his leather cowboy boots, dropping trousers. 
            Now adorned in his drab, baggy undergarments and the hint of a 
            tattoo on his back, he repeats step one, strategically positioning 
            two more beer cans in random exasperation around a plain vanilla 
            (actually dreary earth tone) motel room. Pumping up the scene with 
            ten push-ups and a slow dash of stagy anticipation, we wonder…</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Prom night?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We should be so lucky. More like 
            opening night, if I can string you along a few sentences. If you 
            know the cast (there's only three actors), maybe that knock on the 
            door will bring Uma Thurman. No, it's John Salter (Robert Sean 
            Leonard), and high-fiving Vince just whooping it up like old 
            high-school friends do. Which is exactly what they are…on the 
            surface. There's a low-level frenetic energy (the low-angle 
            camerawork tells us so) in Vince's eyes.. He's popping pills while 
            his buddy comments that &quot;you're getting stranger every year,&quot; 
            something that fans of director Richard Linklater wonder with each 
            new release. It's been ten years since the forty-year-old Texas 
            native's free-form <i>Slacker</i>, followed by <i>Dazed and Confused</i> 
            (my favorite of his work). Only weeks ago I was dazed and not very 
            amused with his <i>Waking Life</i>, this century's first existential 
            animated film for the Ph.D. crowd, and a talky one at that. All 
            other dummies -- hey, I only have a B.A. -- need not attend. At a 
            preview screening of <i>Life</i> I counted more walkouts than last 
            year's <i>Battlefield Earth</i>.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Back to <i>Tape</i>, it's also a 
            bit talky. Which is what I assume Stephen Belber's original play is. 
            But it's no <i>My Dinner With Andre</i>. Spalding Gray's monologue 
            movies are divine. But his transfer of Belber's play to digital tape 
            to film hasn't become anything even remotely enjoyable. Who are 
            these &quot;Men Are From Mars&quot; chatting about violent tendencies? 
            Johnny's a budding filmmaker, a cultured USC film school grad 
            reluctantly returning to his home town of Lansing, Michigan (the red 
            carpet at Cannes wasn't available), to premiere his debut feature at 
            the local film festival (ah, finally getting back to that 
            opening-night reference a few rows up). Vince is there to cheer him 
            on…sort of. They are prodigal sons, tens years gone from high school 
            and returning home to deal with past, unresolved issues, festering 
            up like an ugly zit about to pop. Vince, a Oakland, California, drug 
            dealer (he insists he's a fireman to everyone else) bummed out after 
            being dumped by his girl friend of three years, gets slammed by his 
            friend for selling dope to the fire chief; Johnny is a slightly 
            haughty filmmaker who gets pissed at the percolating pothead's put 
            downs of his social proclivities.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And so on for twenty minutes, until 
            Amy Randall (Thurman) enters <i>Tape</i>. Actually they chat her up 
            for another half hour as a shared experience, the dialogue 
            escalating to a semi-heated, extended-play bark fest. Boiling down 
            to one excruciating investigation (for those whole value quality 
            cinema time) from the obsessed Vince: Did Johnny rape Amy ten years 
            ago? Soon the camera starts panning quickly back and forth between 
            the two men, as if following a volley, tracking on lobbed, 
            remorse-filled dialogue instead of tennis balls. It's really 
            annoying. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Then you know who knocks on the 
            door.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The interrogation enters 
            three-ring-circus mode. Ulterior motives bubble to the surface, with 
            a intimation of spineless, irrational extortion and a gaggle of 
            misinterpreted concerns, generally one-sided. Opponents (and the 
            camera) volley for serve, blame, mockery, jealousy, and repressed 
            perceptions.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Would you guys just figure out 
            what the ---- you're talking about?&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Actual line from the film.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Actual way you might feel by the 
            time that line is uttered.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While this mind game has a 
            semi-enlightening ending, the trip home isn't worth the effort. The 
            filmmaker and his cast may have had a fine time putting this little 
            film exercise together, but Brenda Lee's version of &quot;I'm Sorry&quot; 
            swells up as the end credits roll. Regrettably, that's the only 
            apology the audience is going to get.</font></td>
