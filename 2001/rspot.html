            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 2 March

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>If <i>See Spot Run</i> is going
            to be remembered at all -- aside from spelling out the end of David
            Arquette's movie career, thereby exiling him to the Devil's Island
            of television -- it will undoubtedly be for the soon-to-be-notorious
            Caca Scene.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Arquette, with an ugly thatch of
            broomstraw-yellow hair, and wearing only a bathrobe, slippers,
            t-shirt and boxer shorts, has to take the title character, a
            Mastiff, outside in the middle of the night so that the dog can do
            his duty. The animal complies, but he then rushes inside and locks
            Arquette out. Arquette then promptly steps into some of the dog's
            fresh excrement. He takes off his slipper, and, barefoot, steps in
            some more. Then he slips and falls on some more. He tries to climb a
            drainpipe, but his underdrawers get caught on something, and they
            rip off, after which Arquette falls and lands on more of the dog's
            excrement. Soon, a police car pulls up, and some of Seattle's Finest
            are given the opportunity to smirk and sneer at him. But before they
            do, Arquette lifts his face to the heavens and cries, &quot;I'm
            covered in caca!&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In another scene, Arquette somehow
            ends up wearing a dog collar which is outfitted with a device that
            emits an electrical shock, which it does when somebody uses a
            television remote control, again, and again, and again. Later,
            Arquette gets his head stuck inside a glass bowl, his backside has
            sea anemone stuck all over it, and yards and yards of bubblepaper
            are wrapped around him, which are then filled with helium so that he
            bounces around, like a rubber diving-bell, while a song on the
            movie's soundtrack warbles about &quot;the Hamster Dance&quot; (I am
            not making this up, folks).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Arquette is not only comedically
            challenged in this film, he's linguistically challenged. &quot;I'm
            sorry I tied you up to the furnace,&quot; he tells the dog after it
            has been tied to a radiator. &quot;The dog locked me out of my
            house!&quot; he says at another point, despite the fact that he
            lives in an apartment building. He also gets beaten up in one scene
            by two women who converse only in sign language.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The story, if you're still with us,
            has Arquette playing Gordon, a Seattle postal courier who outfits
            himself with an arsenal of devices in order to combat hounds who
            would keep him from delivering the mail. Gordon is also apparently
            afraid of dogs, but this character trait seems to have fallen by the
            wayside. (Eight writers are credited with the screenplay, original
            story, and &quot;adaptation.&quot;) When his pretty neighbor,
            Stephanie (Leslie Bibb), must go out-of-town on business, Gordon
            agrees to take care of her young son James (Angus T. Jones). When
            the dog, Spot, comes along, Gordon allows James to keep him.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What they don't know is that Spot
            is an F.B.I. canine who was being put into a &quot;witness
            protection&quot; program after a contract hit has been taken out on
            him by a gangland boss, played by Paul Sorvino. Sorvino, a fine
            actor, has to do a terrible gag routine that involves that surefire
            laugh-getter, partial castration, and it's depressing to watch;
            then, the filmmakers have him do it all over again later in the
            movie. Stephanie's travel plans go awry, and in one scene she is
            covered from head to foot in mud. The two hit men turn out to be
            bumbling fools, allowing for some of that good ol' comedic sadism
            from the <i>Home Alone</i> movies to work its way into the film. One
            of the men is bitten in the back by an angry terrier who won't let
            ago, and the hit man tries to dislodge the dog by whapping his back
            against a tree trunk. Later, the dog is successfully removed and
            dropped out of an open window, two stories up.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There are fart jokes. There are
            also warm, human moments, such as when Gordon and James tell each
            other fart jokes, and then giggle themselves silly. Spot's F.B.I.
            trainer (the majestic Michael Clarke Duncan, who provides the only
            respectable moments to be found in the film) looks high and low for
            him, but only finds him at about the same time that Paul Sorvino
            gets the same electrical shock treatment that Arquette got earlier
            in the film. It's like <i>Lassie, Come Home</i> crossed with <i>The
            Traveling Executioner</i>. James screws up his face when they try to
            take the dog away, and wails, &quot;Bu' y'u ca't t'k 'im!!&quot; But
            somehow it all manages to come out with a happy ending after all.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Parents who want to punish unruly
            children can't do any better than to set them down in front of this
            film. Afterwards, they'll behave however you want them to, gladly.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"></o:p>
