            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 17 August
            2001</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Campbell Scott delivers one of the
            most stone-dead withering looks in years in the new film that he and
            Eric Simonson have made of <i>Hamlet</i>. Seated at a formal dinner
            across from mother Gertrude (Blair Brown) and
            former-uncle-now-stepfather Claudius (Jamey Sheridan, who brings a
            decidedly virile tone to the role), he wears his mourning band for
            his own departed father not on his arm but straight across his brow,
            like a headband, and you can tell that, from the start of the story,
            he's boiling over with feelings of resentment and disdain until he's
            ready to burst,</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That doesn't come until later, when
            he meets the ghost of his dead father, who makes Hamlet relive what
            he experienced during his murder. After that, emotional
            reverberations begin to increasingly sound in his head, like echoes
            bouncing off of mountainsides: he walks about Elsinore barefoot and
            wearing an undone vest, abstract in countenance and with the
            red-rimmed eyes of a tortured insomniac. When he attempts to
            convince Rosencrantz (Michael Imperioli) and Guildenstern (Marcus
            Giamatti) that he's not really mad -- &quot;I am but mad
            north-northwest: when the wind is southerly I know a hawk from a
            handsaw.&quot;--<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>we
            know that he's absolutely wrong: to borrow a phrase from Anne
            Robinson, this Hamlet is definitely &quot;a few fries short of a
            Happy Meal&quot;.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Scott and Simonson have filmed
            their &quot;Hamlet&quot; (which will be showing at New York's Film
            Forum, starting August 17) in and around a magnificent country house
            in Nassau County, New York, and with the characters attired in the
            formal tailcoats and gowns of the &quot;fin-de-siecle&quot; period
            at the start of the twentieth century. Scott's performance is
            sometimes too literal -- he carves directly into his arm with a
            piece of glass while contemplating mortality, and at one point is
            pinned to the floor under a huge framed portrait of Claudius --
            while at other times he deftly parries with self-mockery and
            mercurial changes of mood.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The most notable piece of staging
            is in the way the character of Polonius, Claudius' Lord Chamberlain,
            is presented, a loquaciously-written part that is usually played
            pedantically or as a simple fool. With Roscoe Lee Browne in the
            role, performing with the ease and confidence of a master, Polonius'
            penchant for words is used to make him a fuller, richer character,
            generously mannered, artful, diplomatic, and in the utmost the
            &quot;noble heart&quot; that the other characters regard him to be.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Lisa Gay Hamilton's casting as
            Ophelia is a bit of a surprise, not just because it's the first time
            I've seen an African-American actress playing the part, but because
            her dark-haired, dark-eyed beauty is in direct contrast to all the
            lilting, fair Ophelias that one commonly expects to see, their looks
            and manner setting them up to already become the tragic victim. (In
            Kenneth Branagh's 1996 film, his Hamlet not only verbally abused
            Kate Winslet's Ophelia, he thrashed and bashed her and mashed her
            face against the woodwork.) Hamilton's casting, and performance,
            brings out something unexpected, which is Ophelia's strength in
            character -- she never entirely turns against Hamlet, no matter how
            much he rebukes her, and there is a tangible, sharp sense of loss in
            their scenes together, of a romance that might have been -- but when
            Ophelia herself begins to go on the downward spiral, her madness in
            this film comes across more as an act of defiance than as a defeat
            (she seems too angry at what happened to become overwhelmed by
            remorse), making it hard to believe that she would go so quickly and
            easily to her end. (The scene describing Ophelia's death is the one
            really noticeable cut that has been made by Scott and Simonson in
            the original text.)</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Scott's Hamlet is shocked back into
            his senses after seeing, unalloyed and with his own eyes, the
            consequences of his out-of-joint actions, and while he doesn't
            backpedal on what his character has done, he emerges in the final
            scenes as a man who has come to terms with himself, unafraid to face
            the future.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While the film comes in at just
            under three hours, it is always dynamic and moves along at a clip
            without ever sacrificing any of the integrity of Shakespeare's
            words. The filmmakers and performers have staked out their own way
            in finding what's true and meaningful in the drama, and as a result
            both the story and the film work extremely well as a result of it,
            as do many of the performances. (John Benjamin Hickey, for one,
            makes probably the best Horatio that I can recall seeing.)</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is the third film <i>Hamlet</i>
            in five years, after Branagh's Austro-Hungarian version (with all
            those mirrors, and all those idiotic spot-the-star cameos) and
            Michael Almereyda's extremely streamlined, up-to-the-minute modern
            version (with Denmark as corporate politics, and a now-famous
            opening scene set in a video store). However, after Olivier, Burton,
            Asta Nielsen, Maximilian Schell, Innokenti Smoktunovsky (allegedly
            the best Hamlet ever filmed -- and in Russian), Richard Chamberlain
            (who did a very 1960s Hamlet for television), Nicol Williamson,
            Derek Jacobi, and Mel Gibson<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>--
            plus a smidgen of John Barrymore's great stage performance,
            preserved on-film at the beginning of the 1941 Kay Kyser film <i>Playmates</i>,
            and Mark Wahlberg's condensed rap version in &quot;Renaissance
            Man&quot; -- I can't think of how else to otherwise approach this
            material, except to either send it into outer space (which was
            actually done, on the San Francisco Bay Area stage, in the early
            Eighties, with Rosencrantz and Guildenstern portrayed as R2D2 and
            C3PO-like robots), or, as with the recent <i>Carmen</i> on MTV, do
            it as a hip-hopera. The great thing about Shakespeare's play is that
            it can accommodate all manner of versions, and still remain great.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
