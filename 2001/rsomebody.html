            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 28 December 2001</i> </font>
            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">As Joe Scheffer, the lead 
            character in <i>Joe Somebody</i>, Tim Allen moves through the 
            opening scenes with the pleasant, myopic look and gait of somebody 
            who has already resigned themselves to the fact that they're never 
            going to really amount to much of anything. When somebody says &quot;hi&quot; 
            to him at work, it's most likely directed to whoever's behind him, 
            and he finesses his way past the situation before it can turn into 
            something humiliating. When another person is floundering with 
            putting up a banner, he initially demurs, but his attempts to help 
            them turns out to be less helpful than expected, anyway, and Joe 
            accepts it, too, as part of the norm without becoming ruffled.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Which is not to say that he's 
            turned into a schlub. Joe works creating interoffice computer 
            displays at the headquarters of a huge Minneapolis pharmaceutical 
            company. He has a twelve-year-old daughter, Natalie (Hayden 
            Panettiere), with whom he gets along very well and who is sharp as a 
            tack. (The movies may be getting a little dumber, lately, but some 
            of the kids in them seem to be getting a lot smarter.) When she 
            rides along with him to a &quot;take your kids to work&quot; day, Joe's 
            parking space is swiped by another co-worker, a bully (Patrick 
            Warburton, cast for his burliness), and when Joe protests and tries 
            to rectify the situation, the co-worker strikes him to the ground. 
            Joe ends up challenging him to a fight -- a physical one -- and 
            suddenly everyone at work takes notice of him: he's doing something 
            they've wanted to do for a long time, but didn't. And Joe revels in 
            the attention.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As a whole, the picture seems 
            comfortable to let itself settle into the even, middle ground, for 
            better or worse: there is the feeling, for instance, that the 
            picture is not just out to entertain (which it does) but also to 
            impart some &quot;life lessons&quot; that the audience can take away with them 
            after the picture is over. In the process of getting his 
            self-respect back, Joe turns from a nobody into a someone who wants 
            to be somebody, even if the person he's trying to be may not be the 
            person he actually should be -- not to his daughter, who already 
            respects him, cares about him, and doesn't feel he has to prove 
            anything, or to Meg (Julie Bowen), the pretty human resources 
            person, who doesn't want Joe to turn into a phony with misplaced 
            values (she wants him to be unique, not someone who's &quot;like everyone 
            else&quot;). And never mind that, at most companies, what the co-worker 
            does to Joe would be grounds for instant dismissal: Joe goes through 
            with the preparations for the fight, just so that we can see, right 
            up to the end, whether he'll figure out what we already have 
            determined, that violence doesn't solve anything and, of course, it 
            takes more strength to decide not to get into a fight than to engage 
            in one.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The most middlebrow parts of the 
            film are the ones depicting Joe's ex-wife, Callie, played by the 
            talented Kelly Lynch who, alas, is not well-served in this role: 
            trying to find a reason why Joe has separated from her, Callie is 
            depicted as being &quot;eccentric,” meaning, in the film, that she does 
            yoga and frequents restaurants that serve meals made from curd. (She 
            is also shown involved with a theatre group that is putting on some 
            sort of daffy &quot;edible&quot; production of Bertolt Brecht's <i>Baal</i>.). 
            Joe also takes self-defense courses from a character played by Jim 
            Belushi who is a washed-up former action-film star who now runs a 
            martial-arts school. Belushi sort-of leans into the camera in his 
            first appearance, looking terribly bleary, but not to worry: his 
            performance is perfectly fine in the film, and he works very well 
            with Allen.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is the third film that Tim 
            Allen has made with director John Pasquin (who directed him in <i>
            The Santa Clause</i> and <i>Jungle 2 Jungle</i>). They seem to work 
            very comfortably together -- Allen performs confidently, and the 
            film itself takes on some of the same easy-going, genuine quality 
            that he has as an actor. It also has a great feel for how huge 
            companies try to put a human face on their hugeness, turning 
            workplaces into &quot;campuses&quot; that ply employees with initiatives to 
            work, feel, and improve themselves (while usually wringing them dry, 
            work-wise). There are also a couple of memorable parodies of 
            pharmaceutical ads that have been invading primetime television, 
            required to list all their possible side-effects while trying to 
            sell you on how wonderful they are.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Tim Allen may not be the most 
            glamorous or showy of performers, but he has warmth and he knows how 
            to connect with audiences in a one-on-one way. He also doesn't stoop 
            too low to get a laugh: his characters may get tripped-up by the 
            indignities that life visits upon them, but they never become 
            totally foolish and they don't play the audience for suckers. He 
            could be anyone who has either thought they've seen their chances in 
            life go by or had to wrestle with an ergonomically-designed office 
            chair or figure out the vagaries of trying to use various unguents 
            to make their hair look good. Beneath the relaxed and affable 
            surface, a spark of greatness may lurk in this performer.</font></td>
