            the start, <i>Save the Last Dance</i> looks like just another teen
            romance film. It has all the familiar ingredients -- the pretty
            couple, a high school setting, troubles with parents, troubles with
            cliques, and a major ambition to be achieved. However, it also
            brings more than you might expect, namely, two talented actors as
            the pretty couple -- Julia Stiles and Sean Patrick Thomas -- and a
            script, by Duane Adler, that for the most part, treats hiphop
            culture, its teen protagonists, and its audience with some respect. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            film opens with Sara (Stiles) riding a train from her Illinois
            hometown to the big city, Chicago. As she gazes sadly out the window
            at the rushing landscape, she remembers for you the circumstances of
            her move. Once a talented young ballerina with great ambitions, now
            she's grieving the loss of her mother, who died in a car wreck while
            rushing to be at her daughter's Juilliard audition. The flashback
            lays out this trauma as it will affect young Sara for the rest of
            the film -- lots of scenes showing hugs and kisses with mom, then,
            Sara blowing her audition at precisely the moment that her mother's
            car crashes. Of course, she feels enormously guilty, believing that
            her mother would still be alive if it weren't for her. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So
            now Sara faces a new beginning, living with her scrungey jazz
            musician father Roy (Terry Kinney, strong in an underwritten part),
            in a tiny apartment on the South Side. Immediately, she's plunged
            into a world that is completely opposite of her previous experience.
            Not only has she given up dancing, but she's now confronted with a
            student population, where she is -- on screen, anyway -- the only
            white member (on the phone, Sara's best friend from back home asks
            if she's seen any murders and promises to pray for her). But Sara is
            not easily intimidated. On her first day in English class, she
            tangles with Derek (Thomas), when he challenges her good-student's
            formalist analysis of Truman Capote's <i>In Cold Blood</i>, by
            saying that it served a more important social and political
            function, by making &quot;white folks back then&quot; realize that
            violence could invade even their safe Midwestern homes, adding that
            it was an old story and even an old technique for black folks, who
            knew -- as Sara does not -- that Richard Wright had already made the
            case in his work. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If
            all this sounds a little heady for a teen romance, it is. It also
            demonstrates that <i>Save the Last Dance</i> has more on its mind
            than the usual angst over what to wear to the prom. Sara not only
            has to adapt to a culture that most suburban white kids only glimpse
            via Jay Z CDs or bling bling videos on MTV, but she also has to come
            to terms with her own limited self-consciousness, including the fact
            that, as a privileged kid, she's never had to grapple with the daily
            issues -- violence, fear, poverty -- common to so many other
            populations, both urban and rural. This isn't to say that <i>Save
            the Last Dance</i> is flawless or even wholly enlightened. It falls
            back on a few cliches to get its points across, for instance,
            pitting Sweet Sara against a Bad Girl (Derek's jealous
            ex-girlfriend, played by Bianca Lawson). They engage in a bit of
            brutal competition on the dance floor and the basketball court (the
            fight here is a bit of a surprise -- and their inability to talk it
            out afterwards is actually fine, less contrived than if they had).
            You've likely seen these scenes before in other movies. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Similarly,
            you've also seen Derek's subplot, specifically, his longtime
            friendship with his boy Malakai, played by the magnetic rapper
            Fredro Starr (sorry, Firestarr), late of Onyx. Starr here reprises a
            role he can probably play in his sleep by now -- after doing it in <i>Strapped</i>,
            <i>Clockers</i>, and last year's <i>Light It Up</i>, to name a few
            -- that is, the hyperactive, ever-ready-to-roll, bad-boy banger.
            This business inevitably leads Derek to face a terrible choice,
            between his own future (college, the white girl) and loyalty to his
            friend during a neighborhood showdown. Sara's cliche is equally
            silly. In her <i>Flashdance</i> trajectory, she's the
            &quot;real&quot; (i.e., ballet) dancer, who finally triumphs at her
            audition for a panel of snobby-looking Juilliard judges when she
            learns to incorporate (not to say appropriate) &quot;street&quot;
            knowledge and skills. In this case, she lucks out that Derek, in
            addition to being a brilliant student, loyal friend, and responsible
            brother, is also a great hiphop dancer. Over the course of their
            informal rehearsals (Derek: &quot;Want to get together sometime, to
            work on your movies?&quot;), they fall in love. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">With
            all this said, though, <i>Save the Last Dance</i> does offer a
            relationship that you may not have seen previously, at least not in
            the shape it takes here. This is the friendship between Sara and
            Derek's sister, Chenille (the super-charismatic Kerry Washington), a
            single mom who's completing her high school degree and has some
            definite opinions about what it means for white girls to date black
            boys. These opinions come to light during a conversation they girls
            have while sitting in a clinic waiting room full of mothers and
            babies, and they reveal (without entirely resolving) some sensitive
            questions that don't often come up in mainstream teen movies. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For
            my money, it's the girls' friendship that holds the film together.
            Almost as soon as Sara arrives, Chenille &quot;adopts&quot; her,
            sitting with her in the cafeteria and bringing her along to <i>Stepps</i>,
            a hiphop dance club, where, Sara discovers, all her years of
            training mean little. Here the dance moves are, as Chenille might
            say, &quot;slamming&quot; (and they're choreographed by Fatima, who
            created the dances in Michael Jackson's video for &quot;Remember the
            Time,&quot; Aaliyah's &quot;Try Again,&quot; and the Backstreet
            Boys' &quot;Larger Than Life,&quot; among other videos). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's
            true that Sara learns the steps and is accepted by the other kids
            pretty quickly -- hey, it's a movie. But the dance scenes inject <i>Save
            the Last Dance</i> with all kinds of energy (not unlike the
            cheerleading competition scenes in <i>Bring It On</i>), and more
            importantly, they show just how the girls connect. It's telling that
            in the last club scene, under the closing credits, it's the girls
            who are dancing together, joyous in their shared love of music and
            movement. High school movie romances are one thing, but the hiphop
            alliances, those are forever.<o:p>
