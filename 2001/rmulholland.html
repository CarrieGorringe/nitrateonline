            review by <a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>, 12 October
            2001</i></font>
            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">As the master of the confused 
            narrative, Lynch has once again pepper sprayed his viewers with 
            twentieth-century visions of Heironymus Bosch's <i>Purgatory</i>. 
            You may scream at the incoherent madness that unfolds over this 
            two-and-a-half hour experience, but you'll beg to go back to find a 
            logical understanding to the weirdness that has assaulted you. Good 
            luck. You'd have a better chance of finding Waldo than &quot;common&quot; 
            sense in most of Lynch's <i>oeuvre</i> (the exception being <i>The 
            Straight Story</i>).</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This picture puzzle of the 
            Hollywood landscape consists of the director-writer's prerequisite 
            sideshow set pieces of death, seduction, and dwarves as seen through 
            the sadistically strange eyes of a cinematic maestro (which won him 
            a share of the best director prize at the Cannes Film Festival). 
            Lynch's faithful fans will revel in his trademark irrational 
            excesses, of his cryptic story lines (Ah, to be a ganglion in his 
            brain. Why couldn't <i>Osmosis Jones</i> have tackled the mind of 
            David Lynch instead of the body of Bill Murray!), intoxicating 
            imagery (murky cinematography by Peter Deming, who takes a similarly 
            dark approach in the forthcoming Hughes brothers' thriller <i>From 
            Hell</i>), dreamlike editing (fade-ins and fade-outs courtesy of 
            Mary Sweeney, another Lynch compatriot), a dread-filled score (by 
            longtime Lynch partner-in-crime Angelo Badalamenti, ripping a page 
            from his score for <i>Twin Peaks</i>), and all of the other 
            baffling, unconventional mysteries far from the mainstream maddening 
            crowd.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mr. Lynch's opus began life back in 
            1999 as an intended network television pilot and anxiously 
            anticipated return to the boob tube. Following its pointed rejection 
            (&quot;ABC doesn't want <i>Mulholland </i>Drive for fall and they don't 
            want it for midseason. They don't want it.&quot;), in its current 
            theatrical form -- with added nudity, oozing sexuality, a corpse or 
            two, and associated violent shenanigans -- it's strictly premium 
            cable fare. It seems appropriate that Le Studio Canal Plus helped 
            rescue the project; Lynch has a wide following in Europe, and 
            Jean-Pierre Jeunet's marvelously mystical romantic <b><i>Le Fabuleux 
            destin d'Amélie Poulain</i></b> [simplified for U.S. release as 
            merely <i>Amelie</i>] has distinct Lynchian underpinnings.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Whereas <i>Twin Peaks</i> tweaked a 
            nation's curiosity for brilliantly weird television melodrama more 
            than a decade ago, even with today's more tolerable small screen 
            audiences, network executives (and theater-goers) are scratching 
            their heads at wunderkind Lynch's latest post-production journey 
            down a lost highway. What hath this cinematic god wrought? There is 
            no easy or unanimous answer. You'll be hypnotically entranced and/or 
            contemptuously infuriated. Handicapping individual appreciation for 
            a work of this caliber is akin to practicing black magic. Or a throw 
            of the die. American distributor Universal Focus is cautiously 
            unreeling the film in selected markets (including New York and Los 
            Angeles) and a handful of screens, including Washington, D.C.'s 
            smallish Loew's Cineplex <i>Dupont Circle</i> and its sister 
            operation in suburban Shirlington, Virginia.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">On the twisted road from Deep 
            River, Ontario, to the City of Angels, blond-haired, kind-hearted, 
            aspiring starlet Betty Elms (Naomi Watts) has landed in the 
            courtyard apartment vacated by her show-biz aunt, away filming on 
            location. Meanwhile, high above the hills of Hollywood, a sexy 
            brunette is nearly murdered in a limo along Mulholland Drive; an 
            opportune turn of bad luck leaves her alive but adrift in a sea of 
            amnesia. The latter stumbles down the hillside into Betty's lair, 
            espies a <i>Gilda</i> poster (thus christening herself Rita—as in 
            Rita Hayworth), and the two women—the ever-optimistic Canadian and 
            the sullenly scared damsel in distress—form a fatalistic bond as 
            they begin a feature length investigation attempting to fill in 
            Rita's blank past. Yet as one jagged piece of the puzzle falls into 
            place, many others sprout as the bizarre picture jigsaws among the 
            several sinister plotlines, primarily involving frenetic film 
            director Adam Kesher (Justin Theroux), forced by his mysterious 
            backers to star an unknown actress, Camilla Rhodes, in a forthcoming 
            production. As the tangential tales drag you along to a rather odd 
            conclusion (a word I use with great trepidation), the eccentric 
            characters blur, the &quot;twilight zone&quot; reality bends, and the story 
            becomes anything but straight. We are not in Kansas, or Iowa, 
            anymore, but in the wildly strange carnival world of the irascible 
            David Lynch. For those of us riding this carousel, the brass ring 
            you grab is merely a key to Alice's wacky Wonderland.</font></p>
