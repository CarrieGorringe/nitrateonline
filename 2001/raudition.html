            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 14 September
            2001</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>&quot;You look listless,&quot;
            says the teenaged son of the protagonist in Takashi Miike's grisly
            thriller, <i>Audition</i>. His father, Aoyama (Ryo Ishibashi), has
            been a widower for seven years, and now he decides that he would
            like to remarry, maybe to a nice, quiet, well-mannered girl,
            essentially obedient in the classic Nippon tradition, but someone
            whom he could talk to and feel comfortable around. How to go about
            finding her?</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Aoyama runs a media production
            company in Tokyo, and a friend of his, a producer, suggests that
            they hold an open-call audition for young women to come in and try
            out for a motion picture part that would fall within the perimeters
            of the type of girl that Aoyama is looking for. The movie may or may
            not be made, but there would be plenty of applicants whom Aoyama
            could look at and decide whether he would like to get in contact
            with later on. As the hopefuls file in and out of a wide, bright
            room, with the two men seated behind a table on one end, the
            producer asks them questions about their likes and dislikes, while
            Aoyama either regards them quietly or feels vaguely uncomfortable
            about the whole business. He becomes enchanted, though, with one
            girl, Asami (Eihi Shiina), who has exquisite long, dark hair and a
            strange look about her eyes. She trained as a child to become a
            classical dancer, but an injury put an end to all that. Aoyama sees
            her a couple of times, but then she disappears, and as he tries to
            track her down and find out what became of her, he ends up visiting
            the sites of some of the most darkest experiences in Asami's past,
            and then, oh, my goodness.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As you may have heard, <i>Audition </i>has
            already been much talked about for some very nasty business, indeed,
            which is perpetrated at the end of the picture by the seemingly
            sweet but very methodical Asami (and persons who think they might be
            having a look at the film, which is scheduled to open around the
            U.S. between now and the end of November, may want to stop here and
            come back, as I will be delving into aspects regarding the climatic
            scenes of the film). That doesn't occur until the last half-hour of
            the film, but one can see how it would definitely overshadow
            everything that comes before it in most audience's recollections. Up
            until then, the first hour and a half of <i>Audition</i> is a fairly
            well-made suspense piece, also unfolding methodically, showing the
            well-intentioned Aoyama becoming pulled inexorably into territory
            that he turns out to be totally unprepared for and where he is on
            increasingly uncertain ground. Asami turns out to be the ultimate
            dating nightmare -- but whose? Beneath the surface, she is scheming,
            vicious, cold-hearted, sadistic...but she's also supposed to be the
            product of an upbringing where she was severely victimized and
            abused. (and she gets her own back on her tormentors, big time). She
            could represent a man's worst fears about women, but Aoyama is not a
            misogynist, and he is not shown either hating or fearing women to
            any inordinate extent. In fact, he is polite to a fault and
            respectful, right up to and including (and after) when he and Asami
            go to bed together (she ends up practically pulling him in with her,
            after getting into bed herself). That would mean that Asami is
            simply a twisted little creature who is running loose in the world,
            and Aoyama is someone who just happened to get in her path.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While I'm not adverse to films that
            end up boiling down to simply trying to deliver a few good, healthy
            jolts to the system, the horridness of what Asami does to Aoyama
            mitigates whatever one could come up with to justify it (it involves
            a paralysing drug, long needles, and wire). &quot;It's time to cut
            off your right feet,&quot; Shiina's Asami says cheerily, pursing her
            lips while I imagined people flying up the aisles to the exits. And
            that's not all: the filmmakers, who have been juggling (somewhat
            cleverly) the dramaturgy during the second hour, leave things open
            as to whether everything we have been watching during that time may
            actually be a premonition that Aoyama is having, while he's still
            relatively unscathed and before he becomes Asami's victim.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Nonetheless, one has to ask what
            the movie's real purpose is, and that has to do with Takashi Miike's
            interest in bizarre violence. He has already said in one interview
            that he didn't think <i>Audition</i> went far enough, while adding
            that a forthcoming film of his may be so violent that &quot;it might
            never make it to the screen&quot;. If art can be made out of mayhem,
            Miike told Travis Campbell in the <i>Village Voice</i>, &quot;we can
            force the audience to accept the film&quot;.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Audience reaction can be highly
            subjective. Michael Powell's 1959 film, <i>Peeping Tom</i>, is now
            seen in its proper context and is regarded as a legitimate film
            about a highly-disturbed individual, but at the time when it first
            appeared, public reaction was so vituperative, as if it had been
            slapped on the face hard, that Powell's career as a filmmaker was
            permanently damaged. A year later, Hitchcock was able to gauge
            audience reaction to <i>Psycho </i>by means of an elaborate
            promotional campaign that not only primed audiences as to what to
            expect, but also generated more interest in seeing the film.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The ante has been upped
            considerably since then, with such merry romps as <i>Evil Dead Trap</i>
            and Shinya Tsukamoto's genuinely repellant <i>Tetsuo: The Iron Man</i>
            (a.k.a. the film in whose opening scene a man shoves a metal rod
            into his leg for no discernable reason). While I do not advocate
            censorship -- I don't particularly like <i>The Wild Bunch</i>, but I
            would fight to the death for Sam Peckinpah's right to make it -- I
            do believe that people have a right to either accept or reject what
            a filmmaker tells them, and that eliciting audience reaction is one
            thing while clubbing them over the head until they're insensate is
            another. The only aim of <i>Audition</i> ultimately seems to be to
            create a setup for a payoff that exceeds all possible expectations
            and comprehension, but when Asami playfully, and deliberately,
            brushes her hand along the ends of the needles that she has so
            carefully placed in Aoyama's flesh and I found that I was wincing
            for no particularly good reason other than the fact that what I was
            watching was simply abhorrent, then enough was enough.</font>
