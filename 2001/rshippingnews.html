            Shipping News</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>You
            can feel the ache of punishing wind and snow, in the film’s
            opening image of a weathered, knotted rope surrounded by the
            bleakest landscape this side of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Fargo</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Not since that 1996 Coen Brothers classic has a movie’s
            vivid depiction of the elements been so engulfing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>In fact, you might find yourself reaching for a scarf and
            mittens, or trading in that Coke for a steaming cup of mocha to ward
            off <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Shipping News’</i>
            nose-nipping chills.</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Following its opening whiteout, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Shipping News</i> warms up a bit.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Momentarily abandoning his film’s unsparing landscapes,
            director Lasse Hallstrom blasts us into the new millenium with a
            startling special effects scene.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The image of a child’s delicate, softly rounded facial
            features slowly takes on the lines, crinkles, and weathered
            imperfections of middle age. Suddenly, it’s the matured mug of
            Quoyle (Kevin Spacey), whose response to the challenges of time is
            to hide passively from life’s stressors in the safe, risk-free
            offices of The Poughkeepsie News, where he works as a print setter.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Despite such self-imposed
            isolation, he’s blindsided one day by a true force of nature.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>She’s a free-spirited alarm saleswoman named Petal, who
            joins him for coffee, and maybe something more. &quot;It’s
            8:05,&quot; she observes, eyeing her watch. &quot;I think I’m
            gonna screw you by ten.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>A
            real subtle gal, this Petal, who makes good on her prediction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Following a fierce bout of coitus, she leaves the love-struck
            Quoyle in bed to retrieve a snack from the refrigerator.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>&quot;I’m always hungry after I get laid,&quot; she
            observes with a typical lack of restraint. &quot;I guess I burn off
            too many calories.&quot;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Petal is the trailer-bred female
            equivalent of Kid Rock, with her shocking-pink hair and filthy
            sailor’s mouth, but she lights a fire of lust beneath Quoyle’s
            introverted, tailor’s dummy.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>He’s hooked on her crass, bar maid charm.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>A few years go by, and the couple find themselves married
            with a young daughter in tow.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>However, it’s Quoyle who inherits most of the parenting
            while Petal drags home stray men from the local bars.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Like Billy Bob Thornton’s inert title character in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Man Who Wasn’t There</i>, Quoyle is such a browbeaten, indifferent
            doormat that he merely shrugs off her one-night stands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>&quot;Has your friend left yet?&quot; he asks, after Petal
            has booted some biker out of her crowded bed.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Eventually, Petal’s wild life
            catches up with her. A patrol cop asks Quoyle to identify her
            drowned remains, after a car is dredged from the Atlantic’s watery
            depths.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;They
            apparently got in a wreck,&quot; the officer tells Quoyle. &quot;She
            was with a gentleman friend.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>This news isn’t surprising. However, the messenger’s
            other news – that Petal had attempted to sell their six-year old
            daughter to a black market adoption agency – is difficult for even
            her cuckolded widower to swallow.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Misfortune continues to plague
            Quoyle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His father
            leaves a telephone message that nonchalantly announces his plans to
            &quot;end it all for your mother and I.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>It would seem that Quoyle now has <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">three</i>
            funerals to attend.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">These opening passages of doom and
            gloom make it clear that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Shipping News</i> is no walk in the park.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>However, a ray of faith and optimism soon emerges in the form
            of Quoyle’s Aunt Agniss, played with an air of spirited
            determination by Judi Dench. Agniss is a tough, resilient resident
            of Newfoundland who visits her East Coast nephew to pay respect to
            Quoyle’s deceased dad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However,
            her steely, determined stare suggests that there’s something more
            pressing on the agenda.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Later,
            when the old gal defiantly desecrates the cremated remains in a
            scene that one-ups the old expression &quot;I spit on your
            grave,&quot; you know that all was not well in this relationship.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In dire need of an emotional
            tune-up and energized by Agniss’ presence, Quoyle and his daughter
            agree to return with her to his Newfoundland home country.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Upon their arrival, however, this untamed new terrain
            startles the newcomers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;I
            don’t understand,&quot; Quoyle remarks of their new stomping
            grounds. &quot;It’s May and there’s so much snow.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Equally unsettling is the rickety, antiquated family home, a
            leaky assemblage of weathered wood anchored together by creaking
            cables onto a lonely coastal point.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>As Quoyle and his daughter move in, the house begins to give
            off some creepy<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">, Sixth-Sense</i>-style
            vibes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Are there some
            ancestral skeletons lurking about in the abode’s many cluttered
            closets?<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Shipping News</i> moves at a leisurely pace, allowing its characters
            room to breathe even as past mysteries creep up on them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Quoyle finds work at <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Gammy Bird</i>, a behind-the-times newspaper with as many
            typewriters as computers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Its
            editor, Jack Buggit (Scott Glenn), is a stern, seen-it-all cuss who
            would rather be out fishing the saltwater than be cooped up in a
            newsroom.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Thus, it’s
            up to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Gammy Bird’s</i>
            roost of reporters, including Pete Postlewaite and Rhys Ifans, to
            run the show.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Postlewaite
            is a particular standout, as a wannabe editor who lounges in
            Buggit’s office while his boss isn’t around.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p style="mso-outline-level:1"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like
            Harry Potter introducing himself to the supernatural staff and
            students at Hogwart, Quoyle’s presence raises eyebrows. The
            utterance of his family name has heads turning. &quot;So,&quot;
            questions Buggit during their first word exchange, like a veteran
            pirate interrogating an apprentice. &quot;You’re a Quoyle,
            eh?&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Indeed,
            pirates play a role in one of many family secrets that are unveiled
            during the man’s long-delayed journey of discovery.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p style="mso-outline-level:1"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the
            process of untangling such a messy web of history, perhaps Quoyle
            can rid his home of the spectral old men and white dogs that torment
            his daughter’s restless nights.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>His search for a day care provider brings him to Wavey, a
            redheaded teacher who harbors a few secrets of her own<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The Shipping News</i> watches as the pieces of Quoyle’s
            past and present begin fitting into place, affording this damaged
            man a new lease on life.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p style="mso-outline-level:1"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Lasse
            Hallstrom, whose past work includes <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">What’s
            Eating Gilbert Grape</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Cider House Rules</i>, and the underrated <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Once
            Around</i>, would seem a natural choice to direct the difficult
            material from E. Annie Proulx’s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The Swedish filmmaker has made it his mission to expose the
            universal, human hunger for family support and community acceptance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Meanwhile, he’s never afraid to explore the frayed ends of
            household dysfunction, and examine one’s need to escape such an
            esteem-smashing web. Hallstrom lends a light touch to what could
            have been an overwrought, weighty affair.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>He catches the busy-yet-personable vibe of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Shipping News’</i> tough, tightly knit coastal community, with
            scenes of locals feasting on &quot;seal flipper pie&quot;, or
            journalists prioritizing their coverage. &quot;We need a car
            wreck,&quot; enthuses a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Gammy
            Bird</i> reporter. &quot;A good wreck always sells papers!&quot;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p style="mso-outline-level:1"><font face="Verdana" size="2">However,
            the film’s casting is more questionable.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Spacey is far too charismatic a presence to play the aloof,
            beaten-down Quoyle, a frail cinder of a man whose persona might be
            better represented by Anthony Edwards, John C. Reilly, or Billy Bob
            Thornton.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As is stands,
            Spacey does a game job, but I had to push back his shrewd, laconic
            persona.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After watching
            this master thespian pull off such meaty roles as Keyzer Soza and
            Lester Burnham - sneaky anarchists with attitude to burn – his
            understated turn here was a bit like seeing Tina Turner impersonate
            a nun.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p style="mso-outline-level:1"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Shipping News</i> boasts some terrific supporting work by Julianne
            Moore, who mothers a disabled child and knows a thing or two about
            alienation.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>When Quoyle
            asks Wavey if she notices anything strange about his frightened,
            sensitive daughter, her response is both wise and sad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>&quot;That little girl is the only friend my son ever
            had,&quot; she responds. &quot;So she’s strange. You bet.&quot;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p style="mso-outline-level:1"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            movie’s real standout, however, is Judi Dench. Her Aunt Agniss is
            a defiantly dignified soul who has been through Hell and come out
            bruised, but not beaten.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Dench
            has few lines in the film, but when Hallstrom follows her with his
            camera, she conveys the history of a once-restless survivor making
            peace with a rocky past.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>She’s
            the heart of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

            northern adventure worth the trip.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></td>
