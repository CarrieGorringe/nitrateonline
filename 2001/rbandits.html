            review by <a href="../kj.html" target="_top">KJ Doughton</a>, 12 October
            2001</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>With <i>Bandits</i>, director 
            Barry Levinson has dredged up the most shopworn premise in film, and 
            revived it with his masterful command of nuance, mood, and humor. 
            Yeah, it’s another outlaws-on-the-lam flick, but in this veteran 
            filmmaker’s hands<i>, Bandits</i> feels fresh and invigorated. For 
            instance, how many crime films feature a hypochondriac antihero who 
            carries The Merck Medical Manual on the dashboard of his car, while 
            listening to talking books about vaginitis and brain tumors? How 
            many such genre pieces choose the uplifting tempo of U2’s “Beautiful 
            Day” over a noisy, overstated orchestration? How many cinema bank 
            robbers are so polite that they charm the tellers even as they’re 
            hauling away the loot? Meanwhile, Levinson keeps things jumping with 
            a frantic, guerilla-filmmaking immediacy that brings to mind Steven 
            Soderberg, even as a breezy, casual humor calms the pace. <i>Bandits</i> 
            also laces this unusual brew with a brilliant soundtrack that brings 
            to mind Martin Scorsese’s use of music to accent dramatic moments. 
            It’s a terrific ride.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Bandits</i> begins in the midst 
            of a desperate robbery attempt. An “America’s Most Wanted”-style 
            telecast informs us that two infamous stick-up men, Terry Collins 
            (Billy Bob Thornton) and Joe Blake (Bruce Willis), have been 
            surrounded in a Los Angeles bank and are running out of options. 
            We’re introduced to the former, as he whines in desperation. “I’m 
            trapped like a rat,” moans the neurotic, worrywart Terry, “and I’m 
            destined for an early grave.” Meanwhile, the more stoic, silent Joe 
            would rather reflect back on how the two partners dug themselves 
            into such an inescapable hole. The scene is set: it’s <i>Butch<b>
            </b>Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</i> meets <i>Dog Day Afternoon</i>.
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Suddenly, <i>Bandits</i> flashes 
            back several months earlier, when both men are doing time at Oregon 
            State Prison. The always-manic Terry is distraught over the news 
            that the warden is banning garlic from the premises. “It’s a cure 
            all,” he insists. “I use it for everything.” Meanwhile, the more 
            macho Joe beats a sparring partner to a pulp during a prison boxing 
            practice. Seems the other fighter chipped Joe’s tooth with a 
            surprise uppercut. “Practice your anger management,” screams Terry 
            from the sidelines in the manner of a guy who has thumbed through 
            one too many self-help books. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The two incarcerated friends begin 
            their next round of crime not with a bang, but with a humble wish. 
            “I’d sure like to sleep in a comfortable bed,” confesses the 
            ponytailed Joe, “after eating a cheeseburger, fries, and a shake for 
            dinner.” With this vision of freedom dancing in his impulsive head, 
            Joe instigates a spontaneous prison break using a cement truck, with 
            Terry going along for the ride. “I’ve got a real Quasimodo-style 
            bell-tower ringing in my head,” Terry complains, plugging fingers 
            into ears as their rig takes bullets from prison sharpshooters and 
            smashes through chain link fences. The whole frantic escape is 
            played out to the appropriate tune of Led Zeppelin’s “Gallows Pole” 
            in one of <i>Bandits’</i> many ingenious injections of classic rock.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s here that <i>Bandits</i> 
            discloses an attention to detail that drives the film away from 
            cookie-cutter formula. The two outlaws take refuge in a unique form 
            of hideout: it’s a suburban home with two teen-agers house-sitting 
            for a vacationing couple. Rather than be terrified when the outlaw 
            strangers break in and question them, the two youngsters are more 
            than eager to help them out. Indeed, Terry and Joe become the 
            attention-giving surrogate parents missing from this abode, if only 
            for a short time. The duo plans its future, opting to retire south 
            of the border and open a nightclub, despite Terry’s initial 
            misgivings. “It’s Mexico,” he explains, “and I have some sanitation 
            issues.” He warms to the concept, however, when visions of tuxedos 
            and margaritas flash through his excitable noggin. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As the fugitives trek south, 
            through such Northwest towns as Silverton and Oregon City, they pick 
            up Harvey (Troy Garity), a young, slow-witted relative of Joe’s who 
            becomes their driver in a series of robberies. Their modus operandi 
            involves taking bank managers hostage an evening before the thefts 
            occur. This routine, which earns them the nickname “Sleepover 
            Bandits” in the media, allows them access to the banks early the 
            following morning, when the managers discreetly let them in to lift 
            the loot. Joe has plans for his share of the dough: to take 
            Hollywood by storm and become a professional stuntman. “I’m gonna 
            make a name for myself with fire,” he promises. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Adding to <i>Bandits</i>’ canvas of 
            characters is Kate (Cate Blanchett), who chops up carrots and celery 
            in the kitchen while gyrating to stereo music and belting out her 
            favorite tunes, Janis Joplin-style. Clearly, this rebel personality 
            is not made out for domestic life. Meanwhile, when her yuppie 
            husband darts home just fast enough to announce that he’ll “be at 
            the gym” and has no time to eat, we sense the personal prison that 
            this neglected wife has been reluctantly condemned to. When Kate 
            accidentally hits Terry from behind the wheel, she insists that he 
            get in the car for a ride to the hospital. Even after the crook 
            reveals his identity, and demands her car, she senses a new lease on 
            life and demands to join the excitement. “I’m desperate. I’ll shoot 
            you unless you stop the car,” he warns, waving a pistol in her face. 
            “Go ahead,” dares the depressed Kate. “Desperate is waking up and 
            wishing you hadn’t, like I do.” </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Soon, the sympathetic Terry 
            reluctantly offers her a chance to join the bank-busting crew and 
            drives her out to a woodsy cabin, where Joe awaits his return. 
            Initially perturbed by Kate’s surprise presence, Joe is won over by 
            her sad manner. “One of your eyes is a fraction darker than the 
            other,” he observes to this new presence with an admiring gaze. “No 
            one ever noticed,” she responds, flattered by this unfamiliar 
            attention.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Eventually, <i>Bandits</i> becomes 
            a love triangle, with both men falling for Kate as they continue 
            their crime spree en route to Mexico. Predictable, perhaps, but when 
            her courtship with Joe begins as the two confess a mutual admiration 
            for Bonny Tyler’s ballad, “Total Eclipse of the Heart,” we nod in 
            familiarity. Who hasn’t started a relationship based on love of 
            music? Later, when Kate finds herself coupled with Terry, she finds 
            his vulnerability a welcome contrast to Joe’s strong, silent 
            demeanor. Blanchett and Thornton continue cementing their 
            reputations as celluloid chameleons, while Willis’ more collected, 
            low-key work acts as a counterbalance. Indeed, the “Die Hard” icon’s 
            distinctive, chiseled mug and cool charisma are becoming as 
            recognizable onscreen as Clint Eastwood’s similarly laconic 
            presence. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Bandits</i> seldom reaches the 
            realms of belly-laugh humor. Its giggles result from a wise, low-key 
            recognition of life’s absurdities. For instance, there’s the bank 
            manager who suffers from a fainting disorder and can’t open the safe 
            without passing out. Then there’s the image of Billy Bob Thornton in 
            a vast range of increasingly ridiculous disguises, whether it’s a 
            plaid golfer’s nerdy getup or the sideburns of a grungy Neil Young 
            clone. Finally, there’s the perfectly realized finale, a wrap-up 
            that’s as light as a feather, but just as smart as what’s gone 
            before. It might not rub your nose in the harshness of criminal life 
            like its box-office competition <i>Training Day<b>, </b></i>but 
            during these tense times, the cerebral, unthreatening humor and 
            thoughtful soundtrack of <i>Bandits</i> are a welcome combination, 
            indeed.</font></td>
