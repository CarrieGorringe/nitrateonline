            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Drop
            dead satire can be a tricky genre to master, and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Series
            7: The Contenders</i><i style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times"> -- </i>partly
            by coincidence, but mostly by a good, tight script -- has fallen out
            of the idiot box at just the right time. It actually was dreamed up
            years before <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Survivor</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Big
            Brother</i> were conceived. With a dollop of originality, a pinch of
            drollness, and a dash of dry wit, it sends up survivor-based reality
            television with a deadly dose of gladiator humor digitally mixed
            with all the technical tricks found in the ever-growing number of
            small screen programs it is mocking. The only things missing are the
            Saturday night special commercials. Director-writer Daniel Minahan
            has cooked up a warped stew of those video documentary conventions
            that invariably grab our attention every night in the comfort of our
            couch potato lives. He has created a universe so realistic, it is as
            chillingly believable as was Orson Welles' 1938 radio broadcast <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">War
            of the Worlds</i> was for an unsuspecting public. Today's more
            sophisticated audiences, especially those living in the fictional
            community of Newbury, Connecticut, won't necessarily flee for their
            lives, but they might find their make believe neighborhoods overrun
            by strangers, anxious to jump on the tabloid bandwagon and join in
            on the action that has made Minahan's contest such a hit. Yes,
            that's them in your back yard looking for the next Blair Witch.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Without
            a doubt Minahan's style of guerrilla filmmaker will turn a head or
            two out there in multiplex land. One has to bear up under the film's
            throw-it-at-me attitude to fully appreciate what being pulled off.
            On the most simplistic level, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Contenders</i> is just another wildly successful &quot;game
            show,&quot; having finished off it's seventh season. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Series
            7</i> is the ultimate eighty-five-minute recap, a marathon edited to
            the fast-paced hilt to keep the fans and sponsors happy in
            post-season letdown. Contestants, picked at random by lottery (a
            shapely model nonchalantly picking the ping pong balls), are a
            demographics cross sampling who must scrape together every square
            inch of gray matter to psych each other out for the top prize --
            which happens to be your life.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Readers
            of Shirley Jackson's 1948 short story <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Lottery</i> will notice a similarity in the ideological worlds
            depicted in Newbury and Jackson's unnamed New England village.
            Reaction to the former were hundreds of letters to the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">New
            Yorker</i> expressing &quot;bewilderment, speculation, and
            old-fashioned abuse.&quot; At least in Minahan's cautionary tale of
            fast-food murder begins with a &quot;due to the graphic nature of
            this program&quot; disclaimer. If you're not hip to the wickedly
            entertaining humor from the start and gullibly believe that
            &quot;everything you are about to see is real,&quot; you'll probably
            walk out within minutes, or start writing your Congressman by the
            time you get home from the theater.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            cast, a generally unrecognized lot of character actors, is put
            through their rigorous paces and each shines within their own space
            or in duet with a significant other or adversary. The contestants
            include serial mom-to-be Dawn Lagarto (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Uncle
            Vanya on 42nd Street</i>'s Brooke Smith), the eight-months-pregnant
            reigning champ (&quot;Mother! Hero!! Contender!!!), back for a
            riveting delivery in her hometown. A thirty-nine-year-old unemployed
            father and former juvenile delinquent (Michael Kaycheck as Tony
            Reilly) is the first of the five new competitors greeted as if
            winners of the Publishers Clearing House. Marylouise Burke is the
            God-fearing angle-of-mercy nurse Connie Trabucco; Franklin James
            (Richard Venture) is a seventy-two-year-old retired piece of white
            trailer trash; giggly teenager Lindsay Berns (Merritt Wever) is
            prouder of her arsenal and the bulletproof vest gifted to her from
            her boy friend than she is of her overprotective, cheerleading
            parents; and suicidal Jeffrey Norman (Wes Bentley look-alike Glenn
            Fitzgerald) is an emaciated victim of testicular cancer and
            semi-aborted love interest from Dawn's high school days.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Each
            is armed with live ammunition and accompanied by a cameraman in flak
            jacket and therapy. Within this unprincipled moral void there are
            occasional honorable moments, even if they are painted with comical
            undertones. Dawn declares a truce with Jeffrey to work out
            unresolved issues from their semi-torched love affair (showcased by
            their fifteen-year-old amateur punk music video <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Love
            Will Tear Us Apart</i>). His gaunt features and weakened condition
            suggest it is a time for self sacrifice at the hands of an old
            flame.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            omnipresent camera captures nearly every weird moment. Dawn's
            gynecologist notes she is three centimeters dilated. &quot;If you
            feel anything unusual or strange, call me.&quot; In a garage
            face-off with her mother, sister, and niece, Dawn shows how
            expendable her family really is. Minahan tosses his actors about in
            a salad of reality show wizardry, and therein lies the darkness of
            the gallows humor and the brilliance in which it is depicted.
            Interviews, voiceovers, cut-aways, dramatic re-creations, the
            aforementioned music video, home movies, and self-promoting teasers
            (&quot;Rules are as simple as life…and death!&quot; &quot;Is Dawn
            ready to extinguish an old flame?&quot;), and Hellishly appropriate
            music by Girls Against Boys are all, pardon the pun, dead on.<o:p>
