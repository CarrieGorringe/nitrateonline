            review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 17 August
            2001</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Almost twenty years after the
            release of Porky's -- and over twenty years since the box-office
            bonanza of &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; -- people have suddenly
            discovered that -- gasp! -- Hollywood has been selling sex and
            violence to teenagers. Thus, the new ads for <i>American Pie 2</i>
            are much less luridly suggestive than those for its 1999
            predecessor. The new movie's ads show the main characters all
            pictured together, simply, in a group, giving the impression that
            the film is a warm and funny look at the lives of family and
            friends. The accompanying ad line about &quot;sticking
            together&quot; does not take on ironic proportions until after
            you've bought your ticket and gotten into the flick.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After spending the first half-hour
            making nothing but references to what went on in the earlier film,
            most of the action in <i>American Pie 2</i> turns out to be set at
            that old standby, the Beach House by the Lake during Summer
            Vacation. Jim (Jason Biggs) gets postcards from exchange student
            Nadia (Shannon Elizabeth) telling him that she is anticipating
            having another visit with him at a later date. Since Jim failed to
            make a perfect union with Nadia in the last movie, he turns again to
            Michelle (Alyson Hannigan), the seemingly goofy girl who turns out
            to be smarter than she looks and knows everything about The Subject,
            and is happy to offer some help to Jim, seeing as she's attending
            music camp right next door to the Beach House by the Lake. Finch
            (Eddie Kaye Thomas) has taken up the study of Tantric meditation
            prior to having a second go-around with the woman of his dreams (who
            happens to be the mother of one of the guys he's living with). And
            Stifler (Seann William Scott, who aggressively attacks his role and
            is aggressively unfunny) reveals that he has a younger brother (Eli
            Marienthal, listed in the credits only as &quot;Stifler's
            Brother&quot;) who is as much of a contemptible bore as Stifler
            himself is. Some of the other returning characters are barely in the
            movie, such as Thomas Ian Nicholas' Kevin, and Chris Klein and Mena
            Suvari, who are still boyfriend-girlfriend, here, with the exception
            that Suvari's character spends almost the entire film gallivanting
            around overseas. (Suvari appears about four or five times during the
            course of the action, tops.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Opting for a more loosely organized
            tone, the film -- directed by J.B. Rogers (who earlier helmed the
            ghastly <i>Say It Isn't So</i>) from a script by Adam Herz (sample
            dialogue: &quot;Holy s**t, there's a dildo in my drawer!&quot;), who
            also wrote the 1999 film -- doesn't so much have a story as simply
            mosey from one bit to another, as if it were loading its plate at a
            buffet. What's annoying and tiresome, though, is not the lax plot or
            the continual emphasis on sex, but the way the film keeps dumping on
            its characters and then hanging them out to dry. In one scene, Jim
            gets stuck to himself when he accidentally uses Krazy-glue instead
            of a lubricant jelly. Rather than call on his friends for help
            (which would have made the scene more funnier), the film sends him
            flailing away on his own until he's caught, naked, in the
            crosslights of a police car. This is usually the type of thing you
            see done in a movie to a character for whom you are not rooting, but
            Jim is supposed to be the main protagonist. There is also the
            two-girls-whom-the-guys-think-are-Lesbians who say they'll do
            anything the guys ask them to do in exchange for the guys doing
            something the girls ask them to do, first: the guys don't catch on
            for ages that they're being made fools of, and on top of that
            everyone is listening in to their antics over the local short wave
            radio band (a copy of the Internet video gag in the 1999 film).
            Another scene shows one character being drenched with what he thinks
            is champagne but is actually something else. All of these scenes
            lack a punch line that would take the callous edge off of them.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There are a couple of instances
            where the movie actually works: When Jason Biggs and Alyson
            Hannigan's characters suddenly realize whom they are actually
            supposed to be with; Eddie Kaye Thomas lowering his eyelids and
            looking and sounding like the suave James Shigeta when his character
            speaks about how he's channeling his energies for the sake of his
            &quot;goddess&quot;; and some fairly miraculous work from Eugene
            Levy, again appearing as Jim's dad, and who finds precise ways to
            keep his character from turning foolish and risible while awkwardly
            trying to guide and support his son through the pangs of maturity.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When all is said and done, the guys
            -- four of them, anyway -- decide that it's time that they move on
            from what they've been doing -- peeping up girls' skirts, renting
            porn videos -- to other, more mature things. This occurs at the end
            of the movie, after much peeping and renting has been done.
            Actually, <i>American Pie 2</i> does not look poised to cause
            serious damage to the moral fiber of our younger generation, but
            rather it will probably flit in and out of the national
            consciousness faster than you can say, &quot;What do you have for
            desert?&quot;</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
