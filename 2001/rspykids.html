            Robert Rodriguez has dropped his stylish macho action façade for a
            stylish action fantasy geared for the younger (and the younger at
            heart) set. Willy Wonkas of the twenty-first century rejoice! It's a
            daring departure for the man who killed off hundreds in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">El
            Mariachi</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Desperado</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">From Dusk Til Dawn</i>, and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Faculty</i>. Sure there's violence in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Spy
            Kids</i>, but it's a comic book variation of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">True Lies</i>, or what a sequel to that the-family-that-spies-together
            action comedy would have ended up. Rodriguez reigns over a world
            filled with cutting-edge, computer-generated nyuk-nyuk-nyuks and
            candy-coated, gizmo-laden, live-action cartoon characters. Harmless,
            innocuous, and definitely entertaining. Bumblegum Bond. Oy-Oy-Seven.

            the stuff that Technicolor dreams are made of. Or bedtime stories.
            And as the movie starts out that is exactly how well-to-do Ingrid
            and Gregorio Cortez present their secret adventures to their
            impressionable children. The kids quickly learn those night-time
            tall tales are the autobiographical escapades of two semi-retired
            professional agents. Super enemies once, then blissfully married (in
            an opening sequence comically modeled after those pre-credit
            exploits of 007), mom and pop have traded the battles of espionage
            for those of parenthood. Eight-year-old Juni (Daryl Sabara) and his
            four-year-older sister Carmen (Alexa Varga) are molded after the
            kids from <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Jurassic Park</i><i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal; mso-fareast-font-family: Times">
            </i><i style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times">-- </i>resourceful,
            innocence, and daring -- ready to follow a Mission-Impossible agenda
            that their parents have elaborately prepared for in the event of an
            &quot;emergency.&quot; My only gripe is wondering how they could
            have pre-measured the kids' classy purple battle outfits in just the
            right size.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Those
            plans are quickly called into play when Ingrid and Gregorio are
            trapped by Fegan Floop, an oversized, overdrawn television celebrity
            with a children's show (think Pee Wee Herman on steroids), cereal
            empire, network marketing savvy, and enough sci-fi gadgetry to
            please a billion techno-geeks and Radio Shack franchisees. It's his
            transmogrification machines, though, that interest one Mr. Lisp (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Terminator
            2</i>'s Robert Patrick), a wealthy financier funding the eccentric
            Floop's inventions for megalomaniacal intentions involving an army
            of robotic children. It turns out Gregorio holds the key component
            to make the dastardly scheme work, a miniature brain to actually
            make the automatons speak. There are a ton of visual delights for
            all, including submersible, convertible cars (complete with
            microwave popcorn) the Ninja-wardrobed Thumb-Thumbs (no head, no
            arms, no legs, just -- you guessed it -- thumbs), a Virtual Reality
            Room that works like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Star Trek</i>'s hologram programs, and the Fooglies, a group of secret
            agents turned into floppy-headed, pop-up creatures. The production
            designers, costumers, and makeup artists have a field day in this
            fruit-flavored, Gaudi-inspired world. Floop's castle is a fruit
            loopy maze of the weird and magnificent.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            cast embraces the whole film with a giggly over-the-top attitude.
            Rodriguez veteran Antonio Banderas has the dash of Zorro and the
            charm of a modernist action hero. His Gregorio is adequately Annie
            Oakleyed by the spunky supermom Ingrid (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Spin
            City</i>'s Carla Gugino), a feminist-realist who wants her share of
            the anything-you-can-do-I-can-daring-do-better one-upwomanships. The
            dark side is fortified with Alan Cumming as Floop, Tony Shalhoub as
            his eyeglass-enshrouded and Nehru-suited sidekick Minion, Teri
            Hatcher as a double agent. The good guys get Cheech Marin and Danny
            Trejo as plucky, self-sacrificing family members.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There's
            an effervescent brightness, a stunning pace, and a sly, comic
            undercurrent to the proceedings. Dragged into the caper, the kids
            realize &quot;we are definitely going to be late for school.&quot;
            Hey, write your kids a note and take the whole family to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Spy

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">P.S.:
            Texas Instruments surprised me and several other critics at the
            press screening held at General Cinema's Mazza Gallerie malltiplex
            in Northwest Washington, D.C. They brought in a roving demonstration
            model of their DLP Cinema digital projection systems, with nearly
            thirty of these units showing major releases around the world. The
            film itself was contained in a small hard-drive encasement, filling
            up sixty-five gigabytes. The closest installation to this next of
            the universe is New York City, so getting a glimpse of the
            technology was a welcome surprise. The system is fairly compact and
            installs very quickly on the face of one of the theater's existing
            lamp units. The color and sharpness don't change and if this is the
            future of cinema, I'd say it's 98 percent here.<u><o:p>
