            Christopher Nolan's first, short feature is the perfect opportunity
            to take a backward glance at how such an exciting filmmaker can
            succeed in making such disturbingly fresh use of the medium. In
            hindsight, it's very easy to see how this black-and-white low-budget
            puzzler is an instructional exercise for his second, more ambitious
            work, the much acclaimed and most successful independent film of the
            year. That would be <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Memento</i>
            for those of you with short-term memories. Oh, I see you may have
            forgotten.<o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            such, Nolan's 1999 debut feature <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Following</i>
            (capsule reviewed by Nitrate regular Eddie Cockrell from that year's
            Seattle International Film Festival) becomes <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Memento-on-training-wheels</i>.
            When friends ask me if they should see Nolan's newer film (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Following</i> only recently available to most of us -- in Washington
            it's here for a fleeting week at DC Visions.), I beg them to open
            their brain for a major temporal displacement. If you can store a
            lot of gray-matter data in your neural hard drive, then you'll find
            BOTH of Nolan's films appealing. Many have called <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Memento</i>
            a backwards film, perhaps a fitting category, but still not terribly
            clear for the uninformed and the picky viewer. Mull over this
            variation instead. Consider little snippets of plot delivery
            sequences that make up the film as the forward movement of a second
            hand of a clock. Except that when the second hand gets to the top,
            the minute hand snaps <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">backward</i>.
            The action continues ahead -- but from an earlier time frame -- for
            another screen minute, while every &quot;sixty seconds&quot; the big
            hand continues in reverse. You're caught in a chronological
            tug-of-war. As you started out from the end of your &quot;hour&quot;
            you are forced to remember something that actually hasn't happened
            yet. This time-twisting hypothesis is what has made <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Memento</i>
            such a hit. That and the near-necessity to watch the film again
            (much like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Sixth Sense</i> fanatic's repeat audiences) out of enervating
            &quot;what-the-heck?&quot; curiosity</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Turning
            the clock back to examine <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Following</i>,
            there was an eerie feeling of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">déjà
            vu</i> when you watch this art-house failure when initially released
            two years ago. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Memento</i> had
            a similar struggle finding a distributor, eventually getting
            self-released to a current box office gross of $15 million (and
            growing). A pittance compared to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Pearl Harbor</i>, but wildly successful based on a $5 million budget.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            for story, there's the same back-stepping tale-spinning, this time
            involving a struggling writer in London. Bill (played by co-producer
            Jeremy Theobald) struggles for a literary edge, seeking character
            inspiration by randomly selecting individuals to follow. We first
            find him telling his woeful account of his fixation disorder to an
            unidentified gentleman; seventy minutes later we learn his
            questioner is a policeman (John Nolan), concerned about some nasty
            neighborhood occurrences. The twists begin when one observee, Cobb
            (Alex Haw), a thief with his own curious &quot;British psycho&quot;
            agenda, catches his observer in the act and makes him a game piece
            in a diversion involving a blonde woman (Lucy Russell) and her
            unscrupulous bar owner boy friend (Dick Bradsell). It's not quite
            starting at the end, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Memento</i>
            style, but it's obviously from the same captivating anal-retentive
            mind of Christopher Nolan. The events unfold as an overlay of time
            slip-sliding to and fro, careening closer to the central surprise
            ending, (from left and right speakers, figuratively). It's like
            watching the subject from two sides (notice how wounds vanish and
            reappear), superimposing the plot from several points-of-view.
            During a press screening someone jumped out of their seat and ran
            out of the theater; I can only assume he mistakenly thought the
            reels were out of sequence.<o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sure
            it's unpolished, but it's the same intoxicating brew I've now
            welcoming from Mr. Nolan with each new project. He guides his cast,
            most with little or no film experience, with deliberate inspiration.
            Shot in 16mm with hand-held equipment, there is a certain <b><i>noir</i></b>ish
            feel to the undertaking. He breaks the rules we are accustomed to
            for a crime drama (equal parts <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Usual Suspects</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Spanish
            Prisoner</i>, and a handful of other doppelgangers) forcing us to
            sit down before a daring jig-saw puzzle built upon jagged pieces of
            time and false pretenses. Anxious to catch the start of a risen
