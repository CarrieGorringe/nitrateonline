            Charles Shyer's unapologetically shameless, woozy, romance novel of
            a movie, the despised French Queen Marie Antoinette is proclaimed
            guilty of &quot;excess, greed and indifference.&quot; Much the same
            might be said of Shyer's shamelessly biased bodice ripper.<o:p>

            on the fascinating true history of one Jeanne de la Motte-Valois
            (played by Hilary Swank), Shyer, who's screen credits include the
            remake of &quot;Father of the Bride,&quot; has not-so- subtly
            attempted to elevate her plight to the iconic status of another
            famous Jeanne de - Jeanne de Arc. All the subtleties of court life
            and the chronic conspiracies that slithered beneath the facade of
            regal manners and powdered wigs have never felt as stacked as in
            this deck of duplicitous, dilettante-ish cinematic cards.<o:p>

            Affair of the Necklace</i> reminded me of another bastardized
            history, in its case about America's shift from wild west to
            industry, as seen through the eyes of one family. Director Ed Zwick
            turned American Indian lore into the white man's burden in the
            near-laughable melodrama &quot;Legends of the Fall.&quot; Brad Pitt
            over-acting the spoiled middle son who runs roughshod over land,
            animal and woman and Anthony Hopkins imitating Popeye as he growled
            &quot;F*ck 'em!&quot; after having had a debilitating stroke were
            only two of its lesser problems.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like
            <i>The Affair of the Necklace</i>, as a sweeping epic of a complex,
            transitional time it did nothing but generalize the era and it
            stubbornly refused to find anything deeper than surface
            righteousness in the traits of all concerned. The &quot;good
            guys&quot; were faultless, noble and right, despite their shady
            doings and immorality. The bad guys were simply, lawless and violent
            sub-creatures because they would not yield to the good guys' whims.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Shyer
            does much the same in his period piece, eradicating the truly
            interesting aspects of Jeanne's personality and influence on the
            uprising of the poverty-stricken classes that led to the ultimate
            eruption of the French Revolution in favor of making her a saint and
            martyr, devoid of any depth, cruelty or color. This is French
            history run through a de-flavorizer.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jeanne
            St. Remy de Valois was a happy child, loved by her Reformist father,
            who became a champion of the people. But the ruthless Monarchy of
            King Louis XVI and his demanding wife Marie Antoinette (played
            petulantly by Joely Richardson) changed her fate. When her father is
            murdered, her mother literally dead by grief and the family estate
            in escrow to the King, Jeanne, now a sprightly young woman of
            limited means, finds herself trapped in a marriage by arrangement to
            dissolute Count Nicolas De La Motte (a miscast Adrien Brody). After
            several misguided attempts to attract the Queen's attention in hope
            of regaining her family home and name, Jeanne instead attracts a
            savvy young gigolo of the court, Retaux de Vilette (Aussie Simon
            Baker), who educates her in the way of society and ultimately, the
            bedroom.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Retaux
            de Vilette tells Jeanne that the Versailles court is full of
            &quot;lechers and parasites&quot; and the only way to regain her
            name is to observe what each participant wants. Their eyes settle on
            the lascivious, corrupt Cardinal Louis de Rohan (Jonathan Pryce), a
            ruthless, vain cleric who has fallen out of favor with the Queen and
            will do anything to be reinstated into her good faith</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jeanne
            and the Retaux mastermind a complex plot that involves a lavish
            diamond necklace, &quot;a tribute to the vanity of man,&quot; that
            would defy any Presidential scandal or public relations misbehavior
            gracing Page Six of the The New York Post today. It's a plot that
            will bring down an empire and disgrace a loathed Monarchy,
            culminating in an uprising by the people that remains unprecedented
            in French history.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Unfortunately
            <i>The Affair of the Necklace</i> skims over the more beguiling
            aspects of the intrigue, laboring to exacerbate Jeanne's
            discrimination by repeatedly banging us over the head with
            slow-motion shots of her father being dragged and bludgeoned by
            soldiers and a mysterious chair tossed from an upper window of the
            family home, now engulfed by flames. These images pulse through
            Jeanne's brain again and again (and again), straining the running
            time of Shyer's film, surpassing already questionable, qualified
            boundariess of good taste.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's
            possible the film could be thought of as a guilty pleasure for those
            who enjoy the genre - and - with Christopher Walken stepping in as
            mesmerizer Cagliostro, it certainly promises a snigger or two. But
            in truth, <i>The Affair of the Necklace</i> is an indulgent vanity
            project. While the onus of blame must rest on Shyer's shoulders for
            his lack of restraint, it may well fall instead of the narrower
            shoulders of Hilary Swank.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">She
            won an Oscar for <i>Boys Don't Cry</i> but that film was a directing
            and writing coup, destined to give praise to any actress who may
            have stepped into Brandon Teena's shoes. This affair just might come
            back to haunt Swank by reminding us that her abilities have
            extenuating circumstances attached - when she is blessed by a
            shining script, she also shines. When the role is as overwrought as
            this, her limitations become glaringly apparent because unlike a
            Meryl Streep, Cate Blanchett or Julianne Moore, she can't transcend
            the material with the sheer force of her presence.<o:p>
