            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>Brother </i>is another nihilistic, post-<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Reservoir Dogs</i> blend of tiresomely hip humor and serious splatter.
            After <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Things To Do In Denver
            When You’re Dead</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Way of the Gun</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Snatch</i>,
            and a gazillion other Tarantino imitators, here comes the Far East
            variation on this incredibly influential style of shades ‘n trench
            coats-sporting criminals spouting both trashy talk and crimson
            rivers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>So liberal is
            the bloodletting in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Brother</i>,
            that Los Angeles would soon rival Wyoming and Alaska as one of
            America’s most barren, unpopulated landscapes, were the film’s
            head honcho to unleash his own brand of ballistic population control
            in Southern California for even a day.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>But <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Brother</i> is
            somewhat distinguishable from the pack, if only because lead man
            “Beat” Takeshi Kitano (who also wrote, directed, and edited the
            film) is so hilariously laid-back.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Hiding behind dark glasses and a leathery, pock-marked face,
            Kitano is like a grizzled, fifty-something seen-it-all – and
            he’s amused by what he observes, laughing in the face of death
            like it’s just one more day at the office. Ho hum.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Unlike other Asian film personas,
            like the elegant, suave Chow Yun Fat and the manic, clownish Jackie
            Chan, Kitano resembles a weather worn turtle. Reluctantly poking his
            head out from under a shell just long enough to waste a few
            irritating yakuza slimeballs with some carefully-orchestrated
            lead-slinging, one can picture this resigned ol’ cowboy chuckling
            at the absurdities of life before retiring to some dark hole for a
            good night’s sleep.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
            guy might be a tad slow, but he carries with him the wisdom of the
            ages.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Brother</i>
            opens with a casual, unruffled pace, as Kitano’s character,
            Yamamoto, navigates down La Brea Street in the City of Angels.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>It’s clear that Yamamoto is a stranger in a strange land,
            and flashbacks reveal that his underworld family in Japan has
            recently been wiped out by some younger, meaner yakuza gangsters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>He retreats to the U.S., and searches the streets for his
            half-brother, Ken (Claude Maki).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>For the first several minutes of the film, its star is
            wordless.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Laconic to
            the extreme, Yamamoto is so stone-faced and static that he makes
            Clint Eastwood look like Jim Carrey on angel dust.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We watch this loner track down Ken,
            and his rowdy encounter with an intimidating hoodlum shows that
            beneath his relaxed manner, Yamamoto is capable of swift, sudden
            violence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He gashes the
            punk’s eye with a glass bottle, then chills out again, sauntering
            down the boulevard as if nothing had happened.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Eventually, he finds his sibling shacking up in a seedy
            apartment, and sharing company with some amateur crooks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>This had not been the family master plan for Ken, whom we
            learn was sent to America by Yamamoto with a healthy checking
            account with which to pay for an education.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The older brother is disappointed to find that his sibling
            has frittered away money not on school, but on illicit trades like
            dope peddling with his none-too-ambitious buddies, which include
            Denny (Omar Epps), Jaye (Royale Watkins), and Mo (Lombardo Moyar).
            “My brother doesn’t speak English,” Ken informs his fellow
            toughs, who are puzzled by the quiet manner of Ken’s relative.
            “What do I do with him?”</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But Yamamoto, it turns out, does <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">what</i> he wants, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">when</i> he
            wants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Putting aside
            his idealistic hopes for Ken, and deciding that if one is gonna do
            something, he might as well do it right, the elder member of this
            ethnically diverse motley crew is soon whipping it into a menacing,
            domineering underworld force.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Brother</i>
            can be hysterically funny.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The
            less professional crooks stand by, shaken and wide-eyed, as their
            new leader shoots his way through rival Asian criminals, black
            gangs, and Mafia henchmen, all with the laid-back elegance of a
            seasoned dancer. So matter-of-fact is Yamamoto’s style that even
            the most horrific violence in the film often induces laughter.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Take, for instance, a hotel meeting with Mexican crime
            rivals, where failed negotiations lead to tension at a table rigged
            with guns, hidden beneath its surface.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>“Fucking Jap,” giggles an unimpressed adversary from
            across the wooden surface. “You can’t even speak English.”<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Suddenly, Yamamoto lets loose with a hailstorm of lead.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>As the smoke rises from a pile of dead Mexicans, this killer
            unleashes the corker: “I understand ‘fucking Jap,’
            assholes.”</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As soon as you can say “upward
            mobility,” Yamamoto’s group has a swank new headquarters,
            complete with indoor basketball court and a personal accountant.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>But all good things must come to an end, as Yamamoto finds
            out while trying to waste some persistent Italian goodfellas that
            simply won’t lie down and play dead. Eventually, the veteran
            lowlife finds that even in America, to live by the sword is to die
            by the sword, as he endures a cluster of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Scarface</i>-level bullet exchanges.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After an orgy of finger-slicing,
            beheadings, chopsticks-up-the-nose, and other disturbing means of
            yakuza-style mayhem, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Brother</i>
            turns into a male-bonding buddy pic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The African American Denny finds himself adopted by Yamamoto
            as a kind of stateside brother, and there’s an act of selfless
            salvation at the end that brings to mind John Woo’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Killer</i> or Abel Ferrara’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Bad
            Lieutenant.</i></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Does the film work? If you have a
            taste for ironic, jet-black humor, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Brother</i>
            delivers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As an action
            film, however, Kitano provides more routine fare that seldom matches
            the dark beauty of similar blood cinema masters, like Woo, Sam
            Peckinpah, or early Brian DePalma. Still, this overseas<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>heir to Clint Eastwood certainly commands authority.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Fans can also catch him upping the body count in the
            disturbing, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Survivor- </i>meets-<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Lord of the Flies </i>grue-fest <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Battle
            Royale</i>. It’s clear that he’s still got a few more bullets in
            his .38 to dispense before he retires.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
