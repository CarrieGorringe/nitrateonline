            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In the opening scene of <i>Hedwig
            and the Angry Inch</i>, John Cameron Mitchell, lithe-waisted and
            wearing a gold flip-curled wig, spreads wide the cape he is wearing
            so that the audience can see its inscription, &quot;YANKEE GO HOME
            -- WITH ME,&quot; and then defies the audience to tear him down like
            they tore down the Berlin Wall, before exploding into the opening
            song. &quot;Explode&quot; is putting it mildly: the opening musical
            performance fairly sweeps you into the movie, take no
            prisoners-style, and fully charges up the scene for what follows.</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hedwig, the German chanteuse played
            by Mitchell, relates, partly through song, the story of how he
            started out as Hansel, born in the same year that the Berlin Wall
            first went up, during which his mother fled with the lad -- to East
            Berlin, not to West Berlin and freedom. Hans grew up inspired by the
            music heard through Armed Forces Radio, but the song stylists who
            made the most impression on him were not singers like Judy Garland
            or Eartha Kitt, but Toni Tennille, Olivia Newton-John, and Anne
            Murray (the latter, of course, being Canadian, as Hedwig points out,
            but none the worse for it). An American G.I. becomes smitten with
            Hans and offers to take him West, but only as his wife, so Hans
            undergoes the hurried operation that will turn him into Hedwig --
            almost. As he puts it in one of his more punk-influenced songs, what
            occurred was &quot;six inches forward, five inches back.&quot; When
            Hedwig gets dumped in Junction City, Kansas, of all places, and
            becomes involved with the young man (Michael Pitt) who will become
            the future rock star Tommy Gnosis, it is that &quot;angry inch&quot;
            that puts the kibosh on anything romantic between Hedwig and Tommy.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">John Cameron Mitchell both co-wrote
            the stage production on which this film is based and played Hedwig
            in the original off-Broadway production (which had a phenomenal two
            year run), so he had plenty of opportunity to fully realize Hedwig's
            particular brand of hard-nosed determination and desperation, all of
            which keep the proceedings from turning into anything resembling
            camp, and all of which has been fully transferred to the screen.
            (Mitchell also wrote and directed this film, part of an attempt to
            hang-up Hedwig's wig, if not permanently, then for a while.)
            Hedwig's musical career has fallen under the shadow of Tommy's, who
            has had the success -- with, according to Hedwig, music and songs
            stolen by Tommy -- that has eluded Hedwig. The film comes most to
            life during the musical sections, which are, frankly, terrific: the
            songs by Stephen Trask show the influence of, for instance, David
            Bowie's sometimes anthemic early Seventies songs without becoming
            derivative, and which are performed with an almost evangelical
            fervor of energy. Others, such as &quot;The Origin of Love,&quot;
            which hauntingly depicts a world that was first created with whole
            people who were then split in two and spend the rest of their
            existence searching for their other half, fully stand well on their
            own.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hedwig is, if not
            &quot;stalking,&quot; then &quot;shadowing&quot; Tommy Gnosis '
            current concert tour by playing in a series of chain restaurants,
            with salad bars, that span across the U.S. heartland; the
            hard-driving musical performances, with their references to sexual
            confusion and heartache, leave the diners in stunned but bewildered
            silence. The film opens-out the original stage show's story so that
            we now follow the &quot;world tour&quot; of the
            &quot;internationally ignored song stylist barely standing before
            you.&quot; It makes the story more linear, but it also seems to have
            let a little of the air out of it, as well, and the film's own
            regard as to what becomes of Hedwig, in the end, becomes, in spite
            of itself, ambiguous. Hedwig eventually sheds the artifice -- the
            wigs, the costumes, the bitter self-mocking and spiteful attitude --
            for a more truer self, but what that &quot;new&quot; self is, and
            what is to become of it, is amorphous in both conception and
            execution. The film gives us credit that we'll figure it out for
            ourselves, but we need more information and more clues than it gives
            us in order to do so. And this is aside from the fact that John
            Cameron Mitchell's performance of the closing song is exhilarating.
            That performance shows that <i>Hedwig and the Angry Inch</i> has
            succeeded in capturing a great performance, but it's one that needs
            a better movie to go around it.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"></o:p>
