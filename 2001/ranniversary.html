            review by <a href="../gianni.html" target="_top">Gianni Truzzi</a>, 8 June 2001</i></font><p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In a lengthy, improvised
            sequence, Joe and Sally's Hollywood friends each give a toast to the
            six years of their on-again, off-again marriage that they have all
            gathered to celebrate. The celebrity pair may have spent more time
            apart than together, reunited only five months ago after a one-year
            separation. They're trying to have a baby. They curl together on the
            floor, still basking in the glow of recovered romance, while their
            guests pay tribute. Their business managers, Jerry and Judy Adams,
            flail about for something to say, masking their uncertainty that the
            marriage they're toasting will last. &quot;Six years,&quot; Judy
            (Parker Posey) says, then giggles, &quot;six minutes, six
            hours,&quot; before Jerry (John Benjamin Hickey) stops her with
            &quot;six eons!&quot; What does it matter? This couple is doomed,
            and deservedly so.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Alan Cumming and Jennifer Jason
            Leigh co-wrote, co-directed and co-star in what purports to be an
            exploration of love, marriage and modern relationships. Leigh is
            Sally Nash, a highly regarded actress -- Hollywood-speak for someone
            who has never won an Academy Award. Cumming is Joe Therrian, a
            bisexual, <i>enfant terrible</i> novelist who is about to direct the
            film of his own book.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Over
            the course of an evening's party, the warts of their relationship
            are uncovered, amid the counterpoint of their friends' relationship
            issues, helped along by doses of Ecstasy.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The parade of name acting talent --
            drawn from Leigh and Cummings' circle of friends -- delivers
            performances that strut and occasionally stun. Kevin Kline, as Cal
            Gold, the leading man starring opposite Sally in her latest film,
            doesn't overwhelm for once. Gwyneth Paltrow plays Skye Anderson, the
            hot star property that has agreed to play the lead in Joe's picture
            (a major coup for him), as a character that all assume was based on
            Sally. She is sweet and radiant, always leaving you uncertain of how
            innocent she really is.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But this is a character actor's
            film, and the lesser-known names give the best performances in their
            interplay of neuroses. Phoebe Cates tears things up as Cal's
            centered wife Sophie, a former actress who retired to raise their
            children (&quot;Get the epidural!&quot; she advises Sally). Jane
            Adams, as Clair, the wife of Sally's director Mac Forsyth (<i>Magnolia's
            </i>John C. Reilly) is rollicking as the hovering new mother,
            monitoring her pager for the sitter's call and avoiding Sophie's
            ill-judgment that she's not breast-feeding. Hickey, as Sally's
            business manager, is wonderfully aggressive and single-minded; he
            can't play a simple game of charades without belligerence.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The outsiders in this tightly knit
            crew are the Roses, Ryan (Denis O'Hare) and Monica (Mina Badie), who
            have been invited solely to keep them from suing Joe and Sally over
            their dog's barking. One feels a little sorry for O'Hare, since they
            have given him little to do except be a curmudgeon, but, as Monica,
            Badie is wonderfully complex. The surprise is how eager she is to
            smooth things over, starstruck by her famous neighbors. Her request
            for Joe to sign her dog-eared copy of his book, even after he has
            cruelly admitted to her that she isn't really wanted there, is
            heartbreaking.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Surprisingly, one of the most
            endearing to watch is the one person (other than Kline's kids) who
            isn't an actor. Michael Panes, as Sally's best friend Levi, plays a
            violinist who revels in his physical similarity to Peter Sellers. He
            is grounded and funny, and his success with Skye Anderson will offer
            plain men everywhere some hope.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Despite so much fine work by such
            talented people, it fails to satisfy as a film about modern
            marriage. We can't relate to these people. They're self-absorbed and
            shallow. They're spoiled by having others clean up after them, and
            unwilling to engage in the hard give-and-take of a relationship. We
            feel no pity for them, no connection to our own, more commonplace
            lives. They're icky, and deserve all the grief they make for
            themselves.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In its ensemble hodgepodge,
            improvisations, character-based meandering of plotline and casual,
            thrown-together style, <i>The Anniversary Party</i> aspires to mimic
            the work of Robert Altman, a director that has been important in
            Leigh's acting career. The Los Angeles setting certainly reminds us
            of <i>Short Cuts</i>, in which Leigh played a distracted housewife
            moonlighting as a phone sex worker. (She was also in <i>Kansas City,
            </i>and Altman produced <i>Mrs. Parker</i>.) But Cumming and Leigh
            have mistakenly mimicked Altman's deceptive appearance of sloppiness
            by ignoring structure altogether. Story elements that you think will
            have significance, such as Sally's purchase of Joe's grandfather's
            London house as a surprise present, evaporate. Where do they go?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The press notes make much of the
            19-day shoot on digital video, and how much more accessible it has
            become to make movies. This is a mistake. If anything, this film is
            an argument that filmmaking should remain difficult, with enough
            technical obstacles to keep actors away from goofing around with a
            dangerous instrument like a camera. Late in the evening, Mac asks
            Joe, &quot;Do you even like movies?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; the newly
            made director responds sheepishly, &quot;not really.&quot; This is
            meant to be Cumming and Leigh's joke on Hollywood, a slap at <i>poseurs
            </i>who pursue directing only for the perceived glamour and power.
            But it's a criticism that could be leveled at themselves. They don't
            seem to be very interested in film either, or even in story.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">They <i>are</i> interested in
            acting, of course, and they give themselves plenty of opportunities
            for scenery chewing, from Sophie's wonderful dishing of Joe's
            infantile habits, to Sally's late-night confessions to Joe. But the
            drama flounders in the absence of any real <i>denouement</i>. The
            final events seem contrived and desperate, chosen for their
            weepiness rather than trying to help this film add up to anything.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If <i>The Anniversary Party</i>
            reminds us of any of Altman's great works, it's probably one that
            Cumming and Leigh would find the least flattering. Taking on
            co-writing, co-starring and co-directing seems like their version of
            studio head Griffin Mills' musing, in <i>The Player</i>, about how
            attractive it would be to do without all those creative people that
            get in his way. Everyone thinks his or her own contribution is the
            most essential. Cumming and Leigh desperately need those other
            people to put some flesh on their film.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
