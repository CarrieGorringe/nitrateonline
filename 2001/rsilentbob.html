            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Jay
            and Silent Bob are a joke that gets a little less funny with each
            subsequent retelling, so it's probably a good thing that Kevin
            Smith's <i>Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back</i>, the fifth film to
            feature the popular stoners, has been christened their final outing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Smith, who created the characters in his 1993 breakout indie
            movie, <i>Clerks</i> (and also plays the part of Silent Bob), has
            proven himself willing and able to tackle more thoughtful subject
            matter than dick and fart jokes, as evidenced by offerings like <i>Chasing
            Amy</i> and <i>Dogma</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>This movie, then, plays like a loving farewell to the rabid
            fans who got the director where he is today, with virtually every
            major character from Smith's previous work popping up here for a
            swan song appearance.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But
            all things must pass, and it makes sense for Smith to retire the
            characters now -- the duo appear to have wandered so far afield of
            their indie roots that a more appropriate moniker for the flick
            might be <i>Jay and Silent Bob Sell Out</i>.</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            story is simple enough: having been banned from the Qwik-Stop
            convenience store (the setting of <i>Clerks</i>), our intrepid
            heroes visit their friend Brodie (Jason Lee), the main character
            from Smith's <i>Mallrats</i>, who now owns a comic book store.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Brodie informs the duo that Miramax is about to make a movie
            based on Bluntman and Chronic, two comic superheroes who are in turn
            loosely based on Jay and Silent Bob.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>But after learning that (a) Miramax doesn't intend to give
            them any money and (b) the Internet community can't stop bitching
            about the forthcoming project, our heroes decide to head to
            California to halt production of the film.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Along the way they'll smoke a lot of pot, learn unorthodox
            new methods of hitchhiking, get involved with a gang of professional
            jewel thieves, liberate an orangutan from a medical research
            facilities, and, in one of the movie's most hilarious moments, crash
            the set of the fictitious <i>Good Will Hunting 2: Hunting Season</i>,
            starring Ben Affleck and Matt Damon.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>(Be sure to look for Gus Van Sant, the director of the
            film-within-a-film, who plays himself, hysterically, as a greedy
            money grubber.)<o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            &quot;road movie&quot; has long been a staple of the comedy genre,
            and Smith uses it to good effect here.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Familiar faces from Smith's other &quot;New Jersey&quot;
            films pop-up, including the titular slackers from <i>Clerks</i>, the
            comic-book artists of <i>Chasing Amy</i>, Shannon Doherty from <i>Mallrats</i>
            (who reveals her dramatic range here by playing a bitchy actress),
            and far too many others to list.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The jokes fly fast and furious, with some real gut-busters in
            attendance, especially the opening scene, which reveals the origin
            of the friendship between our title characters.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            for every joke that succeeds, there's another -- and possibly two --
            that don't.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Chris Rock,
            for instance, turns in a much-too-lengthy appearance as a racist
            movie director that didn't prompt a single laugh from me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>And while it's always great to see Mark Hamill in a movie,
            his appearance as a character called Cock Knocker (I'm not making
            this up) also seemed to last far longer than it should have; indeed,
            the movie's reliance on cameos for much of its humor wore quite thin
            on me.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>How about
            employing humor by being funny, rather than trying to make us laugh
            because we recognize the actors on the screen?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>(I'll excuse Wes Craven, director of the <i>Scream </i>trilogy,
            for brilliantly parodying himself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>His turn as the uncaring director of the latest <i>Scream</i>
            sequel prompts one character to quip, &quot;Gee, Wes, you're not
            even trying any more, are you?&quot;)<o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Jay
            and Silent Bob Strike Back</span></i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">,
            as funny as it (sometimes) is, nonetheless feels like a step
            backwards in Smith’s evolution as a filmmaker -- as if, having
            just made the thought-provoking and universally praised <i>Dogma</i>,
            he anticipated a critical backlash and tried to deflect it by
            deliberately making a film that pokes fun at itself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">&nbsp;
            </span>This is literally a critic-proof movie -- it spends far too
            much time kidding itself (and indeed, the whole entertainment
            industry in general) for any such criticism to work.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">&nbsp;
            </span>In terms of tone, <i>Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back</i> feels
            more like, say, a hypothetical sequel to <i>Mallrats</i> than the
            next logical step in Smith's career evolution.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">&nbsp;
            </span>And since <i>Mallrats</i> is Smith's most polarizing work --
            fans either adore or despise it -- this revelation should tell you
            everything you need to know.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">&nbsp;
            </span>I'll also mention that the flick contains the only fart joke
            that has ever, to my knowledge, made me laugh; however, it also
            features a bunch of others that did nothing but irritate me.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></span></font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Certainly,
            <i>Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back</i> is, at times, a funny movie.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>But it's not a great one, basking as it does in needless
            celebrity cameos, a number of pointless explosions, and enough gay
            and fart jokes to (ahem) choke a chicken.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>There's some unintentional irony here -- it stinks of
            hypocrisy that <i>Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back</i>, which seems
            determined to flaunt its indie heritage and personally make friends
            with each and every member of the audience, nonetheless boasts a
            multi-gazillion dollar advertising campaign and a soundtrack album
            featuring the likes of Bon Jovi and Marcy Playground.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">With
            the retiring of these characters, Smith stands at a crossroads in
            his career -- will he jettison the immature aspects of his earlier
            work to embrace a more thoughtful style?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Only time will tell.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Rumor
            has it that Smith has been tapped to write and direct a new <i>Fletch</i>
            film as his next project, possibly to star Ben Affleck as a younger
            incarnation of the title role.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>While this news is unconfirmed as of this writing, it seems
            an ideal way for Smith to sever ties with his earlier work, while
            continuing to embrace the comedy and verbal wit for which he is
            known and admired.</font></span>
