            his passion for war zone news reporting and action hero's name,
            journalist Buck Williams (Kirk Cameron -- remember him from <i>Growing
            Pains</i>?) seems destined for great things. And indeed, at the
            beginning of <i>Left Behind</i>, he finds himself in the middle of
            an amazing story, a story so momentous and planet-changing that at
            first he has trouble believing it.<o:p>
            </o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            young Buck is out of the loop. The story he stumbles on -- or
            rather, the story that stumbles on him -- will actually be very
            familiar to readers of the <i>Left Behind</i> book series (and they
            are legion), as well as to readers of the Bible. It begins with the
            disappearance of millions of people around the world, vanished in
            the blink of any eye, while driving their cars, eating their
            dinners, watching their TVs, or, like Buck, taking an airplane.
            Those who remain can only wonder at the bizarre remains of their
            neighbors, parents, teachers, or people whom they happen to be
            sitting next to -- sad little piles of emptied-out clothing, and
            maybe a wristwatch or a necklace. Where have they gone, all these
            suddenly-gone folks? And what does it mean that everyone else has
            been left behind!? <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">These
            are the questions that drive Buck Williams -- who fancies himself a
            relentless seeker of truth -- through the rest of <i>Left Behind</i>,
            a Christian fundamentalist film styled as a grade-B sci-fi action
            thriller. It's based on the first of eight books by Tim LaHaye and
            Jerry B. Jenkins, a series that not incidentally sells like the
            proverbial hotcakes, eighteen million books and counting (along the
            way, spending some weeks on the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller
            list). Now, the books' success --unprecedented for a Christian
            series in the mainstream market -- has led to equally impressive
            video sales. Vic Saren's film of <i>Left Behind</i>, the very one
            that's opening theatrically this weekend, was released on video by
            co-producers Cloud Ten Pictures (based in Ontario, Canada and headed
            by brother Peter and Paul Lalonde) and Namesake Entertainment
            (Kentucky) last October. By the beginning of November it was the
            number two video seller, just behind <i>Toy Story 2</i>, and this
            at$22-$33 per video, more than double the cost of the typical
            priced-to-sell video release.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Following
            on the heels of Providence Entertainment's successful grass-roots
            marketing campaigns for its theatrical releases (1999's <i>The Omega
            Code</i> and <i>Revelation</i>), the Lalondes' plans are looking
            even more ambitious: they hope to open the film in 2500 theaters on
            February<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>2 (some 2200
            more than <i>The Omega Code</i>), and so unleash a Christian
            blockbuster, proving to Hollywood bottom-liners and infidels that
            Christian entertainment has an audience who will put their money
            where their mouths are. The idea is unusual, to say the least. It's
            something of a given in the movie industry that you don't release a
            film to video and then take it to theaters, after everyone has
            already had a chance to watch it in the comfort of their own homes,
            etc. But here the thinking appears to be that viewers who loved the
            film so much that they bought it will be willing to schlep out to
            theaters -- and bring their loved ones along -- in order to support
            the cause, or, at the least, to enjoy the full impact of the film on
            a big screen. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            problem -- which appears to be irrelevant to viewers' support for
            the video, at least -- is that this full impact is rather weak. The
            plot unfolds as you might expect, with Buck seeking answers and
            finding them, not believing them quite at first, and then, finally,
            coming to an understanding that the Biblical end times are coming to
            pass and that only believers will be saved. Lucky for Buck, several
            secondary characters appear to help him on his journey. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Looming
            tallest is square-jawed airline pilot Rayford Steele (Brad Johnson),
            on whose jet Buck is riding when the trouble begins. Rayford has his
            own baggage, most strikingly his lack of commitment to the Bible and
            to his family, manifested in his recent adultery with a flight
            attendant, Hattie (Chelsea Noble, who happens to be the real life
            Mrs. Kirk Cameron). When things go zooey, Rayford heads on home to
            find his wife's pajamas in a little body-less pile in the bed, set
            off by her shiny gold crucifix. His son is also gone, but his
            rebellious teenage daughter Chloe (Janaya Stephens) is full of rage
            and resistance. Rayford realizes that his dedicated, vanished
            Christian wife has been right all these years, and helps his
            daughter to see this as well. <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And
            oh yes, Buck too. Somehow he's included in this domestic drama,
            along with a convenient instructor they know, someone who can cite
            chapter and verse, as they say -- one Pastor Barnes (Clarence
            Gilyard, whom you'll know as Chuck Norris' loyal, cowboy-hat-wearing
            sidekick on <i>Walker, Texas Ranger</i>). With his new
            understanding, Buck is almost ready to proceed with the rest of what
            appears to be his mission, involving a microdisk containing
            information vital to the evil forces that will prevail at end times,
            something to do with engineering food supplies and ruling the world.
            Buck ends up at the United Nations, where he confronts the
            Anti-Christ Himself, Nicolae Carpathia (Gordon Currie), who shows
            off some fearsome mind-control powers, alarming Buck and opening the
            door for the sequel. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Buck's
            capacity to be alarmed makes him a useful hero; after all, if he had
            all the answers, he wouldn't be leading you on this particular
            journey. And so, his learning curve becomes yours, except that
            you're likely to be ahead of him at every step. Then again, this
            doesn't appear to matter. <o:p>
