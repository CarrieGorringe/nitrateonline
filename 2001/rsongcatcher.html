            review by <a href="../gianni.html" target="_top">Gianni Truzzi</a>, 22 June 2001</i></font><p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Maggie Greenwald's new film
            opens to show Dr. Lily Penleric accompanying herself on the piano,
            singing in a light, almost operatic style, the tragic ballad <i>Barbara
            Allen</i>. When done, Penleric instructs her all-male class that
            they should pay attention to the feeling of the song, not just the
            music. Yet, her relationship to the music she researches is cold and
            analytical, in the scientific fashion of 1907 musicology, rigidly
            cataloguing each piece by number.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Penleric (played by Golden
            Globe-winning Janet McTeer, for <i>Tumbleweeds</i>) is, we find, a
            woman of fiery passion, willing to engage in a torrid but empty
            affair with a married professor. Even so, her exchanges with others
            are stiff, rigid and quietly judgmental. She directs her
            slow-simmering rage at her male colleagues in the North Carolina
            college who repeatedly pass her over for promotion.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">She escapes to visit her sister
            Elna (Jane Adams), who, in the do-gooding manner of the progressive
            era, has helped found a school in the remote Appalachian hills. In
            these piney woods, she hears an orphaned schoolgirl, Deladis (Emmy
            Rossum), singing the same song. But this <i>Barbara Allen</i> sounds
            different; twisted with despair, a lilting wail in the shape-notes,
            the tragic words spring to life: &quot;Oh mother, mother, make my
            bed / Make it soft and narrow / Sweet William died, for love of me /
            And I shall of sorrow.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What Lily's scholarly ears hear is
            an academic treasure. She is excited by the idea that she could be
            hearing the song preserved in the style Samuel Pepys would have
            heard it in 1666, when he noted &quot;the little Scottish tune&quot;
            in his diaries. Lily begins to catalogue all of the songs Deladis
            knows and then combs the mountains for more. She carts a
            preposterously huge wax-cylinder phonograph through the hills and
            damp hollers to make field recordings. As she is resisted, then
            embraced by the locals, she learns to appreciate their culture where
            &quot;music is a part of everyday life,&quot; but also learns how
            it's threatened by the encroaching world.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like her last acclaimed feature, <i>The
            Ballad of Little Jo</i>, Greenwald mixes her story with feminist
            polemic, showing us a strong woman trying to compete with men in a
            time when this could be dangerous. Greenwald seems more interested
            in the women, such as Viney Butler (delightfully played by veteran
            actor Pat Carroll), the thorny backwoods midwife that befriends
            Lily, or the discomforting relationship Elna has with her fellow
            schoolteacher, Harriet Tolliver (E. Katherine Kerr). Less well
            rounded is Viney's grandson, Tom Bledsoe (Aidan Quinn) who initially
            berates Lily for &quot;exploiting&quot; the hill people, but later
            (and all-too predictably) becomes her love interest.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The success of <i>O Brother Where
            Art Thou</i>, and the interest it revived in old-time music, is
            likely what allows us to see this lyrical film. Although <i>Songcatcher</i>
            premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2000, it languished for
            lack of a distributor. While that's the film's good fortune, it will
            also suffer from unfair (since it really was filmed first)
            comparisons. For example, Greenwald gives us a chilling scene in
            which the weaselly mining company stooge sings, after his public
            humiliation, sings <i>Conversation with Death</i>.<i> </i>It's a
            clever foreshadowing of how the mountain community will inevitably
            be disrupted by the domination of coal. Yet its impact is lessened
            by its similarity to a similar use of Ralph Stanley's <i>O Death</i>
            in the current Coen brothers' hit.</font></p>
            <p><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">Songcatcher</font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">
            is a musical treat, shining a rare spotlight on the traditional
            ballad, and offering performances of <i>Come All You Fair and Tender
            Ladies, Lord Randall </i>and <i>Mattie Groves </i>as authentically
            styled as any archived Library of Congress recording. Country music
            star Iris DeMent, as a weary farm wife, intones a fine lament
            accompanied by a weeping fiddle, while blues legend Taj Mahal makes
            a too-short appearance playing the banjo.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still, as strong as Greenwald is on
            the music (with the aid of musical director/composer David
            Mansfield, who also scored Robert Duvall's <i>The Apostle</i>), she
            is weak on story. Like Lily Penleric, she is an outsider to this
            world and her portrait of mountain people, while never
            condescending, fails to peel back their skin. It's a nice try, and a
            try worth making -- the story of traditional music in America has
            long deserved to be told. Yet it makes an old folkie like me (and
            there are lots of us around) hanker for the overdue definitive film
            about Appalachian music and culture. Until then, though, <i>Songcatcher's</i>
            loving tribute<i> </i>will do jes' fine.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:Times"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
