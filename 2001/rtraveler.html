            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The theme of Bart Freundlich's
            latest film, <i>World Traveller</i>, can be summed up in one phrase:
            mid-life crisis. <i>Traveller's</i> hero, however, has decided to
            take his much earlier than expected, and it unfolds in the most
            conventional way. Cal (Billy Crudup) is a successful New York
            architect in his mid-thirties, caught up in what might be described
            as the &quot;Better Deal&quot; Syndrome; he's convinced that there
            has to be one if he can just jettison those nagging professional and
            personal commitments. So Cal packs a bag and drives off in search of
            whatever it is he's been lacking, leaving his wife and
            three-year-old son to fend for themselves. While making his way
            across the country, supporting himself through odd construction
            jobs, he encounters one of those archetypical mysterious women
            (Julianne Moore), one who is at once vibrant and a bitter alcoholic,
            who inadvertently makes him realize the meaning of life and the
            quality of life in one single, dreadful instant. Although the film
            is ostensibly about Cal, and Billy Crudup provides the character
            with just enough humanity to keep him from becoming a yuppie cad ,
            Moore's character is the fulcrum of the piece; without her, the film
            would be yet another mundane take on the man's fear-of acceptance
            archetype, and Freundlich is smart enough to know that. Moore is one
            of those rare actresses who can encapsulate an entire lifetime of
            misery in the most deceptively simple, or even simplistic, gesture,
            as in her powerful performance as the trophy wife in Todd Haynes's <i>Safe</i>
            (especially during a scene in which the wife's explosion over the
            delivery of a sofa that is the wrong color is more than a mere
            expression of repressed anger. Moore turns it into a cruel statement
            about a woman who is prized for her extrinsic value, as opposed to
            her intrinsic values; this mere delivery error represented nothing
            less than yet another act of cosmic betrayal, and becomes a
            pathetic, but apt, harbinger of her increasing imprisonment on all
            levels). Because of her, the film's tone receives a well-needed
            reinforcement at around the time that the film settles into a
            (reasonably) predictable, though easy-flowing, narrative.
            Structurally, <i>World Traveler</i> hits the basic benchmark for
            quality common to all life-crisis film; thanks to Ms. Moore, it
            becomes something else: a piquant statement on the nature of human
            neediness and its relationship to human responsibilities.</b></font></p>
