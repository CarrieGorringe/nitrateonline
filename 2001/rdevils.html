            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Best known for
            films that blend horror and fantasy, such as <i>Cronos</i> and <i>Mimic</i>,
            Guillermo del Toro now adds historical background to his trademark
            mix in <i>The Devil's Backbone</i>(<b><i>El Espinazo del Diablo</i></b>).
            It is 1939, the end of three years of bloody civil war in Spain, and
            General Franco's right-wing Nationalists are poised to defeat the
            left-wing Republican forces. A ten-year-old boy named Carlos
            (Fernando Tielve), the son of a fallen Republican war hero, is left
            by his tutor in an orphanage in the middle of nowhere. The orphanage
            is run by a curt but considerate headmistress named Carmen (Marisa
            Paredes) and a kindly Professor Casares (Eduardo Noriega), both of
            whom are sympathetic to the doomed Republican cause. Despite their
            concern for him, and his gradual triumph over the usual schoolhouse
            bully, Carlos never feels completely comfortable in his new
            environment. First of all, there was that initial encounter with the
            orphanage's nasty caretaker, Jacinto (Federico Luppi), who reacts
            even more violently when anyone is caught looking around a
            particular storage room -- the one with the deep well. Second, and
            more inexplicable, is the presence of a ghost, one of the former
            occupants of the orphanage named Sante. Not long after Carlos'
            arrival, Sante latches onto Carlos, badgering him incessantly at
            night and gloomily intoning, &quot;Many of you will die.&quot; As if
            that wasn't enough to keep the orphanage's occupants in an
            unrelenting state of terror, there's the unexploded bomb that
            dominates the orphanage's courtyard, still ticking away; With the
            orphanage left defenseless by its isolation, and the swift
            progression of Franco's troops, the ghost's prediction seems
            depressingly accurate. Nevertheless, with every step of the plot, it
            becomes apparent that the ghost's predictions as to who (or what)
            will die, the real source of danger and even the definition of death
            itself may be more ambiguous than first thought.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            urge to call <i>The Devil's Backbone</i> an allegory for the
            cruelties inflicted upon the innocent during the Spanish Civil War
            is at once appropriate, but also one that is far too facile an
            interpretation. Once the audience figures this out -- and does so
            fairly early in the proceedings -- the film appears as though it is
            about to unfold as a typical thriller that has had a thick layer of
            high-flown, if obvious, symbolism slathered over it in order to make
            it respectable. The consequences of allowing the historical and the
            narrative to act in parallel often leads to the sacrificing of
            history in favor of melodrama (The Hughes Bros.' execrable Ripper
            film, <i>From Hell</i>, is the latest dismal example of this
            all-too-common occurrence.). However, as with all films about
            historical events that move above the mediocre, the real
            entertainment should lie in watching how a filmmaker can keep both
            history and story firmly in control. Director/co-writer del Toro
            accomplishes this by taking the well-worn conclusion that historical
            and personal events are affected, however intentionally, through a
            psychological blindness that can be conscious and/or unconscious,
            and encases the good/evil dichotomy within it. Del Toro accomplishes
            this, with the assistance of cinematographer Guillermo Novarro,
            through the use of extreme color saturation, alternating between
            dark, dreary interiors and scalding bright exteriors as if in an
            oscillating structure. Thus, the color in this film does not follow
            a neat symbolic pattern; evil and good exist equally well alongside
            each other in both darkness and light. The overall look of the film
            is not unlike the structure of an exemplary essay or even a melody,
            one with a clearly discernible &quot;pulsing&quot; rhythm underneath
            the visuals (this style -- perhaps roughly described as an attempt
            to anthropomorphize the visual and narrative structures -- is a
            predominant feature of del Toro's previous features, <i>Cronos </i>and
            <i>Mimic</i>). <i>The Devil's Backbone</i> is a remarkable example
            of how a filmmaker can make the seemingly insurmountable task of
            translating historical circumstances into a film in which true and
            fictional horror coincide so cleanly appear easy.</span></font><!--webbot
