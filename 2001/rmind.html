            review by <a href="../kj.html" target="_top">KJ Doughton</a>, 28 December 2001</i></font>
            <p><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">A
            Beautiful Mind</font></b></i><b><font face="Verdana" size="2"> is
            the kind of dignified, do-gooder melodrama that seems tailor-made
            for Oscars. Often involving an unlikely hero overcoming adversity,
            this feel-good blueprint shows up in the multiplexes each December,
            often &quot;based on a true story&quot; and adapted for the screen
            just in time for Academy Award consideration. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Awakenings,
            Shine, Mr. Holland’s Opus</i>, and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Hurricane</i> are but four examples of this well-intended hybrid of
            filmmaking, stamped <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">noble</i>
            with a capital &quot;N.&quot;</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">However, it would appear that the
            Academy is tiring of such inspirational stories, or at least
            scrutinizing their accuracy. Most recently, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Hurricane</i> was snubbed for a Best Picture nomination, while
            Denzel Washington’s brilliant performance was robbed of an Oscar
            during charges that the film played too fast and loose with the
            factual story that inspired it. Meanwhile, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">A
            Beautiful Mind</i> is already dodging similar criticism, as it spins
            the semi-true account of mathematical genius John Forbes Nash Jr.,
            whose theories on economics saw him graduate from Princeton and
            eventually win a Nobel Prize in 1994.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ron Howard’s cinematic glimpse at
            Nash’s life and achievements provides viewers with next to no
            insight concerning what made his theories so groundbreaking and
            unique. Like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Good Will Hunting</i>,
            Howard’s movie gives us several scenes of its hero feverishly
            scrawling formulas onto blackboards to establish his genius. Perhaps
            the director felt that such fodder would be yawn-inducing, and go
            over the heads of your average <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">American
            Pie</i>-loving flunky. He’s probably right, but it’s still a
            shame that Howard doesn’t attempt to educate us to Nash’s
            intellectual contributions.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Instead, he takes an easier, more
            dramatic angle by focusing on the mental illness that Nash battled
            throughout most of his adult life. Fortunately, he handles this
            approach so well, that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">A
            Beautiful Mind</i> wins brownie points on an entirely different
            playing field. It might not tell us anything about the importance of
            &quot;game theory,&quot; but it brings the much-feared and
            misunderstood world of schizophrenia into wide release on the big
            screen. This devastating disease merits the attention, and the fact
            that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">A Beautiful Mind</i>
            treats the condition with empathy, respect, and a convincing degree
            of realism is a welcome bonus.</font></p>
            <p><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">A
            Beautiful Mind </font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">begins on
            the campus of Princeton, in the fall of 1947. Nash is introduced as
            a cocky, obsessive student who wears his arrogance like a badge of
            honor. Approaching a fellow math prodigy on the school’s
            courtyard, he initially flatters the peer by telling him,
            &quot;I’ve read your two papers.&quot; Nash then goes on to
            extinguish any fraternal good will by concluding, &quot;I am
            supremely confident that there’s not one innovative idea in either
            one of them.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Nash knows that his social skills
            stink, resulting in some witty, scathing one-liners. &quot;I have a
            chip on both shoulders,&quot; he proclaims early on. &quot;People
            say I was born with two helpings of brain and one-half helping of
            heart.&quot; Indeed, he’d rather spend leisure time
            &quot;extracting an algorithm to define the movement of
            pigeons&quot; than go drinking with Charles, his often-sloshed
            roommate. &quot;You have no respect for cognitive reverie,&quot; he
            says when the party animal interferes with his studies.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Eventually, Nash graduates and
            takes on a teaching gig on the MIT Campus of Wheeler Defense
            Laboratories. Per usual, his ability to decipher complex story
            problems far exceeds his bedside manner. When a student requests
            that he open a window and allow fresh air into the classroom,
            despite the irritating rumble of a jackhammer sounding off in the
            distance, Nash balks. &quot;Your comfort comes second to my ability
            to hear my own voice,&quot; he proclaims from the front of the
            class.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Nash’s blend of lone wolf
            personality and brilliant mathematician is an appealing combination
            to William Parcher (Ed Harris), a shady recruit from the Department
            of Defense. &quot;There are certain endeavors in which your lack of
            personal connections would be an advantage,&quot; suggests Parcher
            as he persuades Nash to moonlight as a code-breaker for the
            government.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meanwhile, an assertive student
            named Alicia (Jennifer Connelly) succeeds in breaking through her
            instructor’s pathetic dating abilities. &quot;Give me a moment to
            redefine my girlish notions of romance,&quot; she requests, as
            John’s stab at courtship takes on all the warmth of a statistics
            lecture. Later, they observe the clear night sky, using star-gazing
            as a means of meshing their love of both aesthetic beauty and
            scientific possibilities. It’s a striking metaphor.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The two are brought together in
            marriage. All would seem to be perfect, until the October of 1954,
            when John suffers a harrowing psychotic break. To explain how Howard
            stages Nash’s startling decomposition would be to spoil <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">A
            Beautiful Mind</i>’s central twist. Without revealing too much,
            suffice it to say that the viewer is forced to question all that has
            gone before. It’s an effective revelation that brings to mind <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Sixth Sense</i>.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The resistive Nash is admitted to a
            psychiatric hospital, where he endures thorazine injections,
            restraints, and electroconvulsive shocks. He’s labeled a paranoid
            schizophrenic, then sent home to pick up the pieces with Alicia and
            the couple’s new baby. It’s at this point that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">A
            Beautiful Mind</i> hits its stride with some truly ambitious
            strokes. Crowe is one of a select few actors who can dramatically
            change his appearance as the story demands, and this time around, he
            must morph from an ambitious, buttoned-down snob to a haggard,
            bewildered chain-smoker. All the trademark details of schizophrenic
            appearance and behavior are there: the endless cigarettes, the dark,
            hollowed eyes, the stubborn, unyielding delusions and conversations
            with intrusive, internal voices. While most cases of this mental
            illness aren’t characterized by the visual hallucinations that the
            movie suggests were common to Nash, the general torment that Crowe
            suggests is dead-on accurate.</font></p>
            <p><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">A
            Beautiful Mind </font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">also depicts
            the impact of Nash’s illness on his dedicated wife. The sexual
            dysfunction that results from psychotropic medications is made
            clear, as is the anger that surfaces in even the most devout
            caregivers when a loved one becomes virtually unrecognizable.
            &quot;I feel guilt, obligation, and rage,&quot; Alicia confesses to
            a psychologist. &quot;Rage against John and against God. I force
            myself to see the man that I married.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meanwhile, Nash copes with his
            illness using a newfound sense of humor. &quot;Did you meet
            Harvey?&quot; he asks of an old classmate stopping by for a visit,
            before chuckling at the friend’s uncomfortable response.
            &quot;Relax. There’s no sense in being nuts if you can’t have a
            little fun.&quot; Such remarks reveal that perhaps the old iceberg
            of the past is warming up to his fellow man, appreciating the very
            people he’d arrogantly written off during college.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A Beautiful Mind <span style="font-style:normal">concludes
            with a predictable but nonetheless moving redemption. The wrap-up
            requires Crowe to age and take on the contented manner of a
            self-actualized man who has learned to see outside of himself. The
            actor pulls this off effortlessly, escorting us across the arc of a
            truly compelling life story. Connelly, who started out in trivial
            teen fare like </span>Career Opportunities<span style="font-style:normal">
            and </span>The Rocketeer<span style="font-style:normal">, has
            recently ventured into far darker waters such as last year’s
            devastating horror show</span>, Requiem for a Dream.<span style="font-style:normal">
            She plumbs similar depths of complexity here, as a woman who
            patiently maintains a steady course even as frustration pulsates
            through her veins.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><span style="font-style:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I
            smell another Oscar for Crowe,&quot; predicted an impressed audience
            member as </font></span><font face="Verdana" size="2">A Beautiful
            Mind<span style="font-style:normal">’s final credits rolled. The
            man who donned armor and brandished weapons to portray a </span>Gladiator<span style="font-style:normal">
            has brought another hero to the screen, using only his expressive
            countenance and body as props. Whatever the final verdict is on </span>A
            Beautiful Mind<span style="font-style:normal">’s faithfulness to
            the story which inspired it, Crowe’s performance will weather the
            storm. It’s the real deal.</span></font>
