            review by <a href="../paula.html" target="_top">Paula Nechak</a>, 28 December 2001</i></font><p>
            <b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Those who disliked the Australian 
            director Gillian Armstrong's last cinematic literary adaptation, <i>
            Oscar and Lucinda</i> - based on Peter Carey's semi-biographical 
            novel - are just as likely to critically strafe <i>Charlotte Gray</i>, 
            culled from Sebastian Faulk's Second World War-time romantic 
            thriller. Faulk's book strived for the potency and epic style of <i>
            The English Patient</i>, but fell short of that book's studied sense 
            of time and place.</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Author Michael Ondaatje's haunting 
            historical fiction was colorful and character-rich while Faulk 
            relies more upon a clichéd milieu and atrophied standard - young 
            woman falls in love and becomes a Resistance fighter when her 
            beloved is shot down over France - but you've got to hand it to 
            director Gillian Armstrong. She knows how to make a mediocre book 
            come to life onscreen. <i>Oscar and Lucinda</i> - which was also a 
            marvel of a novel - is a quiet film masterpiece that eluded 
            audiences because of its unique insights into the Australian social 
            and cultural milieu. <i>Charlotte Gray</i> is something else 
            entirely. Armstrong's rendering may follow Faulk's beaten word path 
            but it is a surprisingly affecting, effective film that is buoyed by 
            two things - the director's sturdy and impeccable sense of color 
            palette, detail and character and Cate Blanchett's marvelous 
            performance as Charlotte Gray.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Charlotte is a part that would have 
            called for a plucky actress in the old days. It's a &quot;woman's 
            picture&quot; of a film, yearning for the sharp presence of a Greer 
            Garson, and Blanchett, with her radiant, smiling, intelligent eyes 
            and innate curiosity casts a similar spell. She's sexy but not 
            overt. When she exposes her soul, she's gloriously luminous. And her 
            smarts register in every frame of film.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I've read the book by Sebastian 
            Faulk and yes, there are some elemental changes - in the novel the 
            pilot Peter Gregory, who emotionally and sexually awakens the 
            resilient Charlotte in her London flat and is the catalyst that 
            propels the young woman upon her journey midst the rumbling of war, 
            is a bare whisper of a man. He is a baby bird - so thin and pale 
            that Charlotte mothers him as well as makes love to him.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the film Peter, though likably 
            played by Rupert Penry-Jones, is hearty, blonde and handsome - an 
            accessible, dull soul who harbors nary a whit of mystery or the 
            biting, acquiescent sense of probable doom and self-effacement that 
            would compel a loved one to pursue him across a war-torn continent. 
            But the nurturing - which is missing in the movie - is really key to 
            the relationship that Charlotte later forges with the two 
            half-Jewish boys who have been orphaned after their parents are 
            whisked off to an inevitable end in the dark night. They awaken the 
            maternal urge in Charlotte, who initially opened her eyes to those 
            feelings when wrapped around her half-shaded, frail lover.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But if this is a flaw, it's 
            negligible. When I first read the cast list, I figured the slim, 
            dark Billy Crudup was to play Peter. But he's fine as Julien, the 
            Resistance fighter and Communist who educates the resourceful 
            Charlotte on the ways of betrayal, Nazi-ism and a deeper sort of 
            bond than that of simple passion. And Michael Gambon lends crust in 
            the role of Julien's father, Levade.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After all, this is a heightened 
            time and world and Charlotte's coincidental meeting on a train with 
            covert recruiter &quot;Mr. Jackson,&quot; slyly adept at sniffing out young 
            men and women who speak French, have few ties and are willing to 
            risk their lives to resist Nazi Occupation, is brave stuff. &quot;War 
            makes us into people we didn't know we were,&quot; she is told, and when 
            Peter is shot down, her destiny seems conveniently sealed. Charlotte 
            becomes code name Dominique and disappears inside her new persona. 
            Charlotte Gray &quot;no longer exists&quot; she's told.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The accents also might be murky in
            <i>Charlotte Gray</i>, with Charlotte a Scotswoman, Julien a 
            Frenchman and while they waver at times - Blanchett speaking 
            impeccable French and then falling back into English once she's 
            landed in France - are merely other incidental complaints. Blanchett 
            is so physically capable of evaporating into a role within a role 
            that she, like her portrayal of the sensible, giddy Lucinda, a 
            gambling junkie with an unrequited love for a similarly addicted 
            cleric named Oscar, is several people at once. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Even in her sudden media rush of 
            over-exposure in leads and cameos in <i>Bandits</i>, <i>The Shipping 
            News</i>, and <i>The Fellowship of the Rings</i> - as well as the 
            upcoming <i>Heaven</i>, could have tired us of her had she not been 
            so talented and clever in picking lead parts interspersed with 
            little character bits. She disappears into either comedy or drama, 
            lead or support.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yet it's Armstrong's able hand that 
            gives Blanchett the safety net in which to fly and not fear crashing 
            to metaphorical earth. Like the other actresses Armstrong has 
            steered - Judy Davis in <i>My Brilliant Career</i> and <i>High Tide</i>, 
            Lisa Harrow and Kerry Fox in <i>The Last Days of Chez Nous</i>,&quot; 
            Diane Keaton in her best dramatic work in <i>Mrs. Soffel</i>, and, 
            even making Winona Ryder and Claire Danes tolerable in <i>Little 
            Women</i>, she gives her actors stability and artistic freedom.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That she's hooked up with Blanchett 
            once again seems providential. Their prodigious talents compliment 
            each other and in the case of <i>Charlotte Gray</i> elevate what 
            could have been a maudlin, mawkish movie into something visually and 
            creatively engrossing and, better, which feels, for all its ho-hum 
            familiarity, like a genre that's fresh and full of meaning. </font>
