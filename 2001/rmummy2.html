            Sommers' big noisy new movie deserves credit for truth in
            advertising -- the Mummy does return, in all his ILMish glory.
            Imhotep first comes roaring on screen as the craggy,
            moth-eaten-looking fellow he was in <i>The Mummy</i>, his bandages
            hanging off his not-quite-existent limbs in gruesome tatters, his
            teeth glaringly visible through the holes in his skull. Eventually,
            as in the first film, Imhotep comes into his full and imposing
            bodily form (played by Arnold Vosloo), again roaring in ancient
            Arabic, again looking to revive his 3000-year-old lover
            Anck-Su-Namun (Sandra Bernhard's fabulous ex, Patricia Velasquez),
            and again pestered by brash adventurer Rick O'Connell (Brendan
            Fraser) and his sidekicks -- his Egyptologist wife Evie (Rachel
            Weisz), her irresponsible brother Jonathan (John Hanna), and their
            wise desert warrior-friend Ardeth Bay (Oded Fehr).</b><o:p>

            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            even this brief rundown makes plain, <i>The Mummy Returns</i> is all
            about rehashing and repeating. And just about everyone's back for a
            second go, from writer-director Steven Sommers (and his producers,
            cinematographer, editor, and designers), to Rick and company, to
            Anck-Su-Namun, reincarnated in this film's present day, 1933, as an
            archivist named Meela, but hellbent on bringing back her boyfriend,
            and so, her long-lost nefarious self. But then, that's what mummies
            do, isn't it? They resurrect. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Granted,
            the impulse to repeat is understandable, given the unexpected and
            tremendous success of the first film, a punchy old-school Hollywood
            B-movie dressed up as a hip, wise-cracky action-comedy. Even when
            re-viewed, <i>The Mummy</i> is corny good fun, standing Boris
            Karloff on his wrapped-too-tight head and reanimating the musty old
            mummy-stuck-in-a-pyramid story with witty FX and smarty-pants
            dialogue, not to mention Brendan Fraser's genially self-aware
            performance as Indiana Jones Lite. Arriving in theaters with
            relatively little fanfare, it made an unexpectedly whopping profit
            ($414 million), and became an insta-franchise. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Regrettably,
            the sequel takes what must have seemed the safest route, delivering
            more of the same, lots of it. Everything in <i>The Mummy Returns</i>
            is bigger and more expensive, from its impressively enormous matte
            shots and massive armies composed of thousands of digitized
            soldiers, to its great swirling sand effects and outsized
            characters. The armies are larger, the fight scenes are longer, the
            digitized stunts are more complicated, and the mighty mummy face
            that materialized in the first film's desert sand here appears in
            rushing floodwaters and black billowy smoke -- it's not so scary as
            it was the first time, and not nearly as startling. Locations range
            from the Moroccan desert to London's Tower Bridge, so folks (and
            creatures) do lots of traveling, their means limited to horses,
            trucks, trains, and a dirigible that's piloted by Rick's
            entrepreneurial buddy Izzy (Shaun Parkes), prescient proprietor of
            Magic Carpet Airways. And Rick and Evie's romantic teasing is now
            solidified into an eight-year marriage, and their ardor is
            apparently boundless: every time they catch a minute, they're
            murmuring and lip-locking, much to the embarrassment of their young
            son Alex (Freddie Boath). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Lamentably,
            the film's biggest effect -- The Rock's (Dwayne Johnson) loudly
            publicized feature debut -- is also the biggest disappointment. As
            the spectacularly doomed Scorpion King, The Rock is typically
            charismatic and beautiful to behold, but he's only on screen for a
            few minutes, right at the beginning, and he doesn't talk as much as
            he roars and grunts (which is too bad, considering his verbal
            talents, exploited so well by Vince McMahon). In the few minutes of
            pre-story set up, you see that the Scorpion King is an ancient
            warrior who sells his soul for an army of two-legged doggy-beasts,
            armed with spears and arrows and other implements of penetration.
            The SK wins a horrific and costly war, raises his fist in triumph,
            then whoosh!, he's sucked away by the demon and stowed in a pyramid,
            to be dug up much later in the film. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">That
            would be the film's present day, 1933, which -- wouldn't you know
            it? -- happens to be the dreaded Year of the Scorpion, just that
            time when he's set to reappear. On their way to the Scorpion King's
            5000-year-old resting place (at the oasis of Ahm Shere), the humans
            must battle each other, the weather, and a battalion of ewokish
            mummy-pygmies, sputtering and swooping all through the jungle-like
            oasis. Alas, when the SK is dug up, he looks rather puny and
            ghastly. And it's not just age that's made him look so feeble --
            washed out, two dimensional, not like The Rock at all. It appears
            that the effects crew didn't quite get the imaging correct, and the
            SK roars into life as an combination of digital Rock's face and
            digital Scorpion body, the SK looks like he belongs in a videogame,
            not a $multi-bijillion Hollywood blockbuster. Fraser and Vosloo do
            their best to make you believe they're in an ancient chamber with
            this bad boy, but he's too obviously other-dimensional to be
            convincing. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Of
            the human organisms, the most welcome and least developed newbie is
            Lock Nah (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, <i>Oz's</i> recently deceased
            and sorely missed Adebisi, here without his miraculously affixed
            wool cap). Assigned by Imhotep to babysit the kidnapped Alex, Lock
            Nah is in an awkward position, to put it mildly. His sparring with
            the kid is less comic than tedious (large black man vs. precocious
            white child, an exhausted trope if ever there was one). Moreover,
            their relationship is just one of the film's schematically
            antagonistic pairings, designed to situate everyone in his or her
            own combat scene in the jumbled climax. Rick and Imhotep square off
            (they also have a three-way with the SK), as do Ardeth Bay's vast
            army and the doggy-beasties, and Evie and Anck-Su-Namun. The film's
            intercutting between these three fight-finales is more distracting
            than thrilling, however: it breaks up building tension in favor of,
            again, the film's central concern, size. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            women's relationship is perhaps the most intriguing one here, in
            part because of some nifty morphing images that make Evie look a lot
            like Anck-Su-Namun (these are not a little strange, because, of
            course, Weisz and Velasquez look not a bit similar). Such images
            descend on poor Evie's fevered brain, in not-very-well-explained
            &quot;dreams,&quot; otherwise known as plot contrivances. The short
            version of the rationale for these visions (aside from the fact that
            Velasquez looks so stunning in her skanky ancient outfits) is that
            Evie has Nefertiti's spirit in her, and so somehow has knowledge of
            Anck-Su-Namun back in the day, when the latter was married to her
            dad, Pharaoh. The ladies' eventual present day showdown resembles an
            expensive, professionally choreographed catfight, and they display a
            rudimentary command of ancient Japanese martial arts (just how this
            translates to ancient Egyptian fighting techniques, taught to young
            women in royal houses, I'm not sure). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Both
            the flashbacks and the climactic final battle are designed to show
            off the girls' well-toned physiques and occasional fancy
            weapons-moves (perhaps gesturing toward the girls-can-do-it-too!
            spirit that so energized <i>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</i>, or
            even <i>Josie and the Pussycats</i>, but with considerably less
            potency). But in the end, their confrontation is only foreplay for
            the men's money shots. When Rick and Imhotep face off against the
            Scorpion King, well... the chests are a-heaving and the bodily
            fluids are a-flowing. <o:p>
