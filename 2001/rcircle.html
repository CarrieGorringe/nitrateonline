            is about political oppression. The film, banned by Iranian
            authorities, follows a series of women in Tehran as they try to
            elude persecution and harassment by policemen, government
            representatives, and other men who feel entitled to abuse them
            because they are women and so &quot;deserve&quot; abuse. It is
            structured as a &quot;circle,&quot; in the sense that each woman's
            story leads you to another's, and then another's -- the oppression
            is so pervasive, so all inclusive, that no woman can escape. It's an
            elegant film, though distressing to watch, offering little hope for
            the women you meet along the way, all resilient, resourceful, and
            trapped. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">How
            ironic, then, that the man who made <i>The Circle</i>, award-winning
            Iranian filmmaker Jafar Panahi (his first film, 1995's <i>The White
            Balloon</i> won the Cannes Film Festival's Camera d'Or), has
            recently had his own distressing encounter with official policy, on
            the part of that bastion of free speech and democracy, the U.S.
            government. Though he has traveled in the U.S. in the past, in order
            to present his films at film festivals in New York and elsewhere, he
            has always refused to be fingerprinted by the State Department,
            which routinely fingerprints citizens of countries accused of
            sponsoring terrorism. Until this January, Panahi has been granted a
            waiver from this policy, but the Bush Administration announced that
            such waivers would no longer be granted, for anyone. Fine. Panahi
            decided not to visit the U.S. But then he changed planes in New York
            en route from Hong Kong to Buenos Aires. And though he was assured
            he would have no trouble, indeed he did. He was detained for 12
            hours, his feet shackled to a bench, without being granted a phone
            call, to seek either legal or translation assistance (the director
            does not speak English).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            Iran, as Panahi's film demonstrates, women cannot smoke cigarettes
            in public. In the United States, Iranians -- just because they are
            Iranians -- cannot walk about in public without &quot;proper&quot;
            documentation. <o:p>

            effectiveness of <i>The Circle</i> lies in its attention to details
            -- it shows what it feels like to be watched, to be afraid, to be
            angry and to be disappointed, all the time. Not only does it reveal
            the large pains produced by oppression -- as in a scene when a poor,
            husbandless woman (Fatemeh Naghavi) leaves her little girl on the
            street outside a hotel, hoping that someone will take the child in
            and offer her a better life than she can. But it also shows little
            pangs, niggling and persistent, the wear-you-down daily horrors that
            will never go away, so you must get used to them.<span style="mso-spacerun:

            (played by Nargess Mamizadeh, and whose name means
            &quot;Daffodil&quot; in Farsi) is newly released from prison, and
            trying to get back to her village in western Iran, but she lacks the
            proper papers. Her friend Arezou (Maryam Parvin Almani,
            &quot;Wish&quot;) prostitutes herself in order to get Nargess's bus
            fare, but refuses to travel with her, concerned that because she has
            heard so much about the &quot;paradise&quot; Nargess has described
            to her, that she will only be disappointed when she sees it -- and
            she cannot bear more disappointment. Another friend, Pari (Fereshteh
            Sadr Orafai, &quot;Fairy&quot;), is four months pregnant and
            unmarried (her lover has been executed in prison), which means that
            she and her child are doomed. She tries to get an abortion, but the
            woman she asks for assistance -- Elham (Elham Saboktakin), who works
            in a hospital -- is afraid to help, for fear of irritating her own
            man, who also works at the hospital, and can be seen through windows
            and doorways, a threatening figure whenever the women spot him. Pari
            can only get an abortion with a husband's consent. <o:p>

            in <i>The Circle</i> come up against one obstacle after another: in
            its first moments, a young woman gives birth behind a closed door,
            screaming while her own mother waits outside in another room. When
            the mother learns that her daughter has given birth to a girl (when
            the ultrasound had suggested she was having a boy), she can only
            react with dismay, knowing that the husband's family may demand a
            divorce, because she has not delivered the expected and much desired
            son. A girl child is only a burden. Every story is more of the same,
            yet also individual and newly terrible, as the women (many first
            time actors) subtly convey the strength and determination needed
            just to get through their days. The camera is restless -- tracking,
            circling, observing, but never intruding -- suggesting the
            impossibility of really understanding the day to day duress of being
            a woman in this lifelong situation. It's a beautifully understated
            and powerful technique, drawing you inside and keeping you at a
            distance at the same time. <o:p>

            a prostitute (Mojhan Faramarzi) is picked up toward the end of the
            film, she sits quietly on the bus taking her to be booked and
            incarcerated, watching the cops joke and talk with one another. This
            routine is familiar to her, and tedious. For a brief moment of
            respite, and taking a cue from one of the cops, who starts smoking
            on the bus, she lights her own cigarette, and draws deeply. For an
            instant, she is free, while on her way to jail. </font><o:p>
