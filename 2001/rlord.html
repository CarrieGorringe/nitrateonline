            <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana"><b>A
            rare instance of a film that lives up to its hype, the ambition,
            visual styling and set piece scenes of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Fellowship of the Ring</i> constantly emphasise that doing justice
            to Tolkien’s extraordinary imaginative legacy has only recently
            become technically possible through the medium of cinema. From the
            superb opening battle sequence it is evident that whilst much of
            Tolkien’s vision has inevitably been distilled, the elusive tone
            and feel of his works has been captured with rare and extraordinary
            success, a tribute to both director Peter Jackson and screenwriter
            Frances Walsh. The limited weaknesses of the film are, like those of
            the inferior <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Harry Potter and
            the Philosopher’s Stone</i>, often weaknesses resulting from the
            need to preserve fidelity to the original text. The huge amount of
            exposition required for <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Fellowship of the Ring</i> has been ingeniously and dramatically
            condensed, but drawing the audience into the complex mythology and
            huge cast of characters of Middle-earth still requires a vast
            apparatus of explanatory material, which is handled as lightly and
            deftly as it can be. Frustratingly brief appearances by many of
            those who will emerge as lead characters is a shrewd move in terms
            of ensuring an enduring audience for the following two parts of the
            franchise, but sometimes fails in granting this film sufficient
            stand-alone quality. A surprisingly flat and inconsequential ending
            is both comprehensible and legitimate as the close of the first
            third of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Lord of the Rings</i>,
            but as the climax to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Fellowship of the Ring</i> it fails to pack the punch of the
            mind-blowing cinema that has preceded it.<o:p>

            <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">The
            praise that has been heaped upon the film for expanding upon the
            very limited female roles in the Tolkien text masks the fact that
            Arwen (Liv Tyler) and Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) still enjoy a
            surprisingly brief period of screen time, though sufficient
            foundations are laid for their more extensive reappearance in the
            next two films. Both actresses possess a suitably other-worldly
            ethereality but have little scope to really flex their thespian
            muscles. Elijah Wood is well-cast as the lead, Hobbit Frodo Baggins,
            embodying naïve goodness and purity, but the camera’s insistent
            close-ups on his tear-filled blue eyes begin to grate slightly after
            three hours. Ian Holm is an ideal elderly Bilbo Baggins, but the
            most brilliant piece of casting, and the stand-out performance, is
            that of Ian McKellen as Gandalf the Grey. Though undeniably a force
            for good, the steely glint in McKellen’s eyes is sufficiently
            reminiscent of his villainous tour de forces in films such as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Apt
            Pupil</i> and Richard Loncraine’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Richard
            III</i> to ensure that his power is not misinterpreted as purely
            benevolent.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">The
            early scenes introducing Bilbo, Frodo and Gandalf in the Shire are
            amongst the most impressive in a stunning film, with Bilbo
            Baggin’s house and Gandalf’s firework displays appropriate
            visual treats to grace Hobbiton. Seldom has a film boasted such
            visual coherence in a subtle and seamless blending of form and
            content. Frodo’s loss of innocence and journey into tribulation
            are accompanied by a palpable change in his landscape, as the
            pastoral idyll of the Shire transmutes into gnarled tress, swamp and
            marsh, vast underground mines and menacing colossus statues. Shades
            of Peter Jackson’s much earlier work, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Heavenly Creatures</i>, may be detected in the manner in which the New
            Zealand landscape has its own personality and spiritual aura,
            alternatively aiding and conspiring against the Fellowship.
            Personifications of the massed forces of the Dark Lord Sauron are
            appropriately terrifying-the Dark Riders and the Orcs all the more
            frightening for their status as grotesquely debased and perverted
            versions of good elves and kings, a premonition of the utter
            corruption beckoning the ring’s possessor.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Verdana">It
            is perhaps inevitable given its forging of a new mythology, scope,
            ambition, technological achievement and similar structure that this
            film should strongly recall <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Star Wars</i> on many occasions. It must be said that whilst <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Empire Strikes Back</i> was the strongest of the original trilogy
            despite being the one most reliant upon the other two films for
            comprehensibility, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Star Wars:
            A New Hope</i> achieved greater autonomy and a stronger ending than <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Fellowship of the Ring</i>. In every other sense though, the
            achievement of Peter Jackson’s films outdoes the Lucas
            productions. Though Frodo’s three young Hobbit companions
            initially vie with Jar Jar Binks as annoying sidekicks, the darkness
            and danger into which they are cast spares them a similarly
            lightweight and sentimental treatment. Gandalf, it must be supposed,
            will sadly be returning to Frodo only in wraith-like form for the
            remainder of the trilogy just as Obi Wan Kenobi did, but Ian
            McKellen is a far shrewder, meatier and pugilistic old sage than
            Alec Guinness’s gentlemanly recluse Ben Kenobi. Gandalf’s
            physical fight with the corrupted wizard Saruman (Christopher Lee)
            is magnificently staged, and its shocking violence exemplifies the
            many occasions upon which expectations are frustrated, reversed, and
            surpassed in Jackson’s film.<o:p>

            perfection. Superlatives begin to run dry in attempting to describe
            this film’s achievement, and even the comparative weakness of the
            final thirty minutes may be reinterpreted as a strength, as it makes
            the year-long wait for <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Two
            Towers</i> marginally more tolerable.<o:p>
