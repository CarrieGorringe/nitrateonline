            review by <a href="../kj.html" target="_top">KJ Doughton</a>, 9 November
            2001</i></font><p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">To many people 
            who saw <i>Heavy Metal Parking Lot</i>, the cult documentary’s 
            landscape was more alien and frightening than that of the Red 
            Planet.&nbsp; To others, especially those who grew up in the eighties and 
            swore their allegiance to hard rock music, the imagery was nostalgic 
            and tear inducing.&nbsp; The year was 1986, and the Largo, Maryland 
            Capitol Center had attracted thousands of headbanging teenagers to 
            worship featured acts Judas Priest and Dokken.&nbsp; </font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like a Sunday morning church 
            congregation, the faithful geared up early for the concert, 
            swaggering impatiently next to their muscle cars after navigating 
            around orange traffic cones to the venue’s massive parking lot.&nbsp; 
            Drunken stoners with frosted hair, headbands, and tank tops faced 
            off against horse-bound patrol cops with tan uniforms and redneck 
            moustaches. The tinny sound of such Judas Priest anthems as “You’ve 
            Got Another Thing Coming” and “Breaking the Law” strained from car 
            stereos, while ticket-buyers stood in line and gave the “devil’s 
            hand sign” to passers-by.&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meanwhile, all of these memorable 
            sights and sounds were being immortalized by filmmaker Jeff Krulik, 
            a bespectacled, balding fortysomething who fought his way through 
            the rabid masses like a war photographer storming the beaches of 
            Normandy at D-Day.&nbsp; When Krulik asked a concert-bound girl where she 
            was from, the mascara-dipped wench replied, “I came here from the 
            West Coast. I’m on acid now.” </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Recently resurrected during a 
            fifteenth-anniversary showing at The Eighteenth Annual Olympia Film 
            Festival last month, <i>Heavy Metal Parking Lot</i> is a true 
            underground classic. Filmed by Krulik on a shoestring budget with 
            fellow lensman John Heyn, it’s a flavorful slice of anthropological 
            pie that perfectly sums up the vibe of the mid-eighties music scene. 
            At a time before the emergence of Nirvana, when more flamboyant 
            bands like Judas Priest and their fraternal partners in metal like 
            Ratt, Motley Crue, Dio, and Scorpions reigned supreme, such concert 
            scenes were a bridge between the disco era and the grunge 
            renaissance.&nbsp; Arena rock ruled, and it was still hip to dress up and 
            sing about dungeons and dragons.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With this in mind, there was no 
            better band to host the party than Judas Priest.&nbsp; Blonde guitarist 
            KK Downing stood opposite brunette counterpart Glenn Tipton, while 
            both of them pelted riffs at listeners from stage left <i>and </i>
            stage right. Bass and drums vibrated coliseums. The band’s 
            charismatic blonde singer, Rob Halford, wailed in ear-piercing 
            falsetto and drove onstage perched atop a motorcycle.&nbsp; A kind of 
            heavy-metal Liberace, he donned leather and studs and alternated 
            between party anthems (sample lyric: “Livin’ after midnight, rockin’ 
            to the dawn, lovin’ ‘til the morning – then I’m gone!”) and more 
            apocalyptic numbers about war and death.&nbsp; It was the ultimate irony 
            when this embodiment of redneck, macho energy came out of the closet 
            in 1992 to announce that he way gay.&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Theatrical to the extreme, Judas 
            Priest’s onstage antics were still upstaged by the goofy rock god 
            worship demonstrated by their pre-show fans, which Krulik and Heyn 
            stalked using ¾ inch video and tube cameras. It’s not until the end 
            of <i>Heavy Metal Parking Lot</i> that we actually see footage of 
            the band: the main focus of this grainy, slapdash, fifteen-minute 
            movie is Judas Priest’s maniacal following waiting in line out 
            front. When Krulik asks a black-garbed redhead with bad skin what 
            she would do upon meeting Halford, she screams, “I’d jump his 
            bones!”&nbsp; Little did she know.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Later, the camera-wielder comes 
            across a vanload of kids sporting an open drink cooler. “Have a 
            Busch or a Budweiser,” offers a friendly local yokel wearing a 
            military green shirt that says<i>, Kill ‘em All – Let God Sort ‘em 
            Out</i>. Nearby, another mob of hyped-up teens hold a Judas Priest 
            banner made of bedsheets, while chanting, “Priest! Priest! Priest!”&nbsp; 
            Hanging out by the band’s tour bus is a runty male with a black and 
            white striped shirt. “Heavy metal rules,” claims the outspoken 
            critic, affectionately dubbed “Zebra Boy” by Krulik. “All that punk 
            sh*t sucks and Madonna can go to hell!” All the while, he’s 
            attempting to chug beer from an unopened bottle. Who says that 
            today’s youth aren’t respectable?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Krulik finds tenderness and good 
            intentions lurking amidst the hedonistic partying.&nbsp; After a fan was 
            killed in a recent auto accident, his mother wrote to the band’s 
            management and scored concert tickets for the victim’s friends, who 
            stand outside with a banner dedicated to their deceased pal. “Timmy 
            Loves Judas Priest,” reads the cloth sign.&nbsp; Finally, <i>Heavy Metal 
            Parking</i> lot concludes with some footage of the band cranking out 
            “Headin’ Out to the Highway.”&nbsp; After the music fades, it’s back to 
            blue collar jobs and trailer courts for the movie’s well-satiated 
            rockers. </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">However, it’s here that the true 
            legend of <i>Heavy Metal Parking Lot</i> begins. Since Krulik and 
            Heyn edited the film and dubbed off copies to friends while living 
            in Washington D.C. and working in public television, their creation 
            has become the Frankenstein’s Monster of cult short films.&nbsp; “In 
            1994,” he explains, “John got a call from Sophia Coppola, who had 
            rented a copy in L.A. at a video store. The tapes were actually 
            being sold and circulated – unofficially – by such music and video 
            outlets across the country. By that time, we had pretty much shelved 
            the film, thinking of it as just an amusing little novelty. Then 
            other celebrities, like Belinda Carlyle and Nirvana, started 
            inquiring about it as well. We realized that the movie had really 
            struck a nerve with people.”&nbsp; Allegedly, there are more bootlegged 
            copies of <i>Heavy Metal Parking Lot </i>floating around than the 
            infamous Pamela Anderson/Tommy Lee sex tapes.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">More recently, the Def America band 
            American Hi-Fi lifted imagery from Krulik’s film and incorporated it 
            into their video, “Flavor of the Week.”&nbsp; The mannerisms and fashion 
            choices of key characters are pilfered in this tale of a slutty 
            rocker chick being jilted by her big-hair boyfriend, amidst souped-up 
            Chevys and drunken rockers roaming across an asphalt jungle 
            identical to that featured in <i>Heavy Metal Parking Lot</i>. ‘They 
            never approached us or asked permission,” says Krulik.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meanwhile, the director revisited 
            the Capital Center parking lot ten years after their first bout of 
            trailing unsuspecting music fans. This time, however, the vibe was 
            significantly different – Neil Diamond was in town.&nbsp; Instead of 
            Camaros, the lot was jammed with SUV’s.&nbsp; A tuxedo-clad man in a 
            wheelchair is spotted sipping Diet Coke from a red cooler.&nbsp; A gaggle 
            of women congregate next to the auditorium with roses destined for 
            Mr. Diamond’s stage. When asked why their husbands and boyfriends 
            aren’t with them, the fiftysomething group responds in unison, 
            “Because we don’t <i>have</i> any!” Still, the lusty air of sexual 
            energy remains much like it did when metalheads congregated here a 
            decade ago. When a middle-aged blonde talks of wanting to get 
            friendly with her crooning idol, an onlooker cackles, “Go for it, 
            girl!”&nbsp; Way past adolescence, the hormones are still active in 
            Maryland.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Other amateur filmmakers have 
            gotten into the act and filmed similar parking lot homages. <i>Raver 
            Bathroom. Harry Potter Sidewalk. Girl Power Parking Lot.</i> The 
            list goes on.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Although the director maintains a 
            professional, informative web site dedicated to his cult classics (<a style="text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.planetkrulik.com" target="_top">www.planetkrulik.com</a>), 
            complete with information of how to buy merchandise and other 
            mail-order items, he confesses that <i>Heavy Metal Parking Lot</i> 
            has never been very profitable.&nbsp; To remedy this, Krulik is currently 
            negotiating the production of a feature film. “We’ve got a concept 
            that will include a reunion of the original people featured in the 
            film,” he explains. “We have positive ID’s on twelve of them, from 
            people who sent their yearbooks, or went to school with them.&nbsp; The 
            idea for the movie is a weird combination of <i>Schindler’s List</i> 
            meets <i>Rock ‘n Roll High School</i>.&nbsp; Or in the spirit of Wayne’s 
            World. Anything is possible.”&nbsp;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sounds metal.&nbsp; Beaming off of 
            Planet Krulik with a flash of the devil’s hand sign and a raised 
            cigarette lighter flickering to the heavens.</font></p>
