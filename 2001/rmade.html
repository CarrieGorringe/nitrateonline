            is P. Diddy's big week. While it's unlikely that he'll match J-Lo's
            recent feat and have a number one opening movie and chart-topping
            album the same week (but really, who's even competing?), he does
            have a movie out at the time when he's releasing his new album, <i>P.
            Diddy &amp; the Bad Boy Family: The Saga Continues</i>. This week P
            and the Family (G-Dep, Black Rob) made promotional appearances on a
            couple of Viacom venues, <i>106th &amp; Park</i> and <i>Hot Zone</i>,
            and P then showed up on <i>TRL</i>, with his co-stars from the
            movie, <i>Made</i>, Jon Favreau and Vince Vaughn. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I
            think this last was my favorite P moment for the week. Everyone
            knows the man has a genius for self-promotion. Here he spent their
            precious seconds with Carson blabbing away, while Vaughn and Favreau
            mostly looked on, not a little nonplussed. While the film's
            writer-director-producer-star Favreau tried valiantly to keep some
            control of what was going on (for example, talking about the movie
            whenever he could), the Sean John-clad P was off yonder, having a
            grand time as if he was there all by himself. By the end of their
            appearance, Vaughn had stopped even trying to talk, and his
            consternated expressions perfectly captured the moment. P charged
            ahead, demonstrating just what it means to be powerful, to be
            privileged, to be the P. Diddy. He encouraged <i>TRL</i> viewers to
            see the movie, naming all the stars who were &quot;in&quot; it,
            including himself and his co-stars, as well as Britney Spears,
            'NSynch, and a few other popsters. Carson could stand it no longer:
            &quot;That's it!&quot; he laughed, sort of. &quot;Just lie!&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">You
            have to admire P. Diddy. Or I do. There's no one so in love with
            himself (and so visibly happy about being in love with himself),
            assured that this love is the most splendiferous love of all.
            Perhaps best of all, he works it so folks around him believe it too.
            (Case in point: his Sean John clothing line is advertised on the <i>Made</i>
            website, www.gettingitmade.com.) And wouldn't you know? This
            attitude makes P the ideal person to play Ruiz, the awesome NYC
            gangster in <i>Made</i>. Favreau plays Bobby and Vaughn plays Ricky,
            longtime friends, smalltime boxers, and aspiring tough guys who get
            a chance to make it to the bigtime when Max (Peter Falk) sends them
            to do a job in New York. That job is to meet with Ruiz and make an
            exchange of drugs and money. Bobby and Ricky, however, have their
            own issues (drawn in part from the chemistry between Favreau and
            Vaughn, established in <i>Swingers</i>, to which this film is a
            &quot;follow-up,&quot; not a sequel). Ricky and Bobby are so
            concerned with making an impression, with living up to gangster
            expectations, that they make one error after another. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And
            Ruiz is the epitome of the scary guy they want to impress. Favreau
            told me that he was surprised when P asked to be considered for the
            role. But then he thought, &quot;This could really work, because
            even if he just comes off like himself, there's an intrinsic humor
            built into our making all these <b><i>faux pas</i></b> in front of
            this guy, about whom the perception is that he's this really
            dangerous character. Especially at the time, with the gun charges
            being brought up against him, so to the vast American movie-going
            audience, it's like having John Gotti in the movie.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">John
            Gotti. P is having a good week. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Bobby
            starts the movie working for Max in LA, body-guarding a stripper
            named Jessica (Famke Janssen), who also happens to be his (Bobby's)
            girlfriend. When, at some frat-boy-style bachelor party, he loses
            his cool and assaults the clients who are putting their hands on
            Jessica (one of whom is played by Tom Morello, inventive guitarist
            for the band that used to be Rage Against the Machine). Max takes
            Bobby off the Jessica detail and sends him to New York. Ricky comes
            along, though Max clearly detests him, because Bobby, out of
            loyalty, includes him as part of a package deal. Poor Bobby. He
            works so hard to make sense of the nonsense (usually violent and
            cruel nonsense) that surrounds him that you start to feel some
            compassion for him, almost in spite of yourself. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            trip East makes visible Bobby's quest for self-respect,
            self-knowledge, and, with a little luck, a down payment on a house
            for him, Jessica, and Jessica's wise-beyond-her-years daughter Chloe
            (Makenzie Vega). Max sends Bobby and Ricky in style: they fly first
            class, have a mob-world-experienced limo driver, Horrace (Faizon
            Love), a wad of cash to use wisely, and a fancy-schmancy hotel room
            where a couple of cheeseburgers cost $48. All they need to do is
            remain absolutely sober and available for the few days they're in
            town, ready to do Max's bidding at a moment's notice -- and they've
            been given guns and a couple of state-of-the-art pagers (complete
            with extra batteries) to make sure they are. It's no surprise that
            things go wrong. Mostly, they go wrong because Ricky can't keep his
            mouth shut, while Bobby looks on in barely disguised horror. They
            get on the plane and Bobby crudely comes on to the flight attendant
            (Jennifer Bransford), who is seasoned enough to handle him,
            proficiently; they get inside the hotel room and Ricky abuses and
            undertips the bellhop (Sam Rockwell); they meet Ruiz at a restaurant
            and Ricky says all the wrong shit, offending Horrace and angering
            Ruiz. This episode sets up P's big moment, his first dramatic
            performance in a feature film. He handles it well: he's smooth and
            rightfully impatient, slightly vacant and distracted, convincingly
            annoyed by gadfly Ricky, whose perpetual antagonisms are enough to
            set everyone's teeth on edge. And so Ruiz's response to Ricky's
            request for a gun -- &quot;The last person I want with a gun is
            you&quot; -- is strangely sympathetic, endowing the gangster with a
            touch of comic understatement, as well as real-life resonance for
            our boy P. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Trying
            to maintain some control of the situation, Ruiz starts ordering
            Bobby and Ricky around, telling them to wait, to show up, to wait,
            to show up. Finally, they're set to meet him at a nightclub, where
            they find they are not &quot;on the list,&quot; and while Ricky
            makes a scene at the entrance, the doorman lets in Screech -- yes, <i>Saved
            By the Bell's </i>Screech, more or less grown up and sporting a
            gorgeous girl on his arm. Ricky, don't you know it, just about blows
            a gasket at this affront. Through all this commotion, Bobby looks
            more appalled by the minute. But he's hardly blameless. He and Ricky
            have a particular rhythm, based in beating each other down. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Whenever
            something goes wrong, they're at each other's throats, or more
            accurately, wrestling, pounding, kicking, and generally falling all
            over one another. Their fighting is so awkward and so pathetic that
            you can't help but wonder at their blustery ferocity. Still, they
            are friends forever, based on an early run-in with the law, for
            which Ricky took the fall, demonstrating his stand-up-guyness and
            making Bobby eternally grateful. The fact that in each scene they
            appear increasingly more bloodied and bruised only makes them look
            more menacing to the thugs they're dealing with, who have no idea
            that they're inflicting these emblems of affection on one another.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At
            last, Ruiz hooks them up with an Irish gangster know around town as
            &quot;The Welshman&quot; (played by <i>The District's</i> David
            Patrick O'Hara). Bobby, Ricky, Horrace, and the Welshman go on an
            all-night bar-hopping bender, bonding and competing before they're
            going to cut their big fat deal the next day. It's a ridiculous
            exercise: the real tough guys can snap in and out of their hazes,
            but Ricky and Bobby are out of their league. The film keeps upping
            the ante of attempted intimacy among men, so that it becomes funny
            and a little sad at the same time. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Such
            intimacy comes at a cost, particularly for Jessica: thinly sketched,
            she's the bad partner (and bad mom) who makes the boys'
            relationship, as dysfunctional as it is, look like a viable
            alternative. You might imagine a movie built around her travails,
            one that delves into what makes her such a rowdy and miserable
            character. But Bobby can't imagine those travails, and that's the
            point: his combined good intentions and cluelessness make him want
            things he can't have and dream things that can't be. He'll never be
            Ruiz, and that's just as well. In the end, Bobby does figure out
            what's most important to him, which is most definitely not to
            achieve P-ness. And for that little bit of self-awareness, his
            journey is worthwhile. <o:p>
