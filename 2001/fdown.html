based on a play named <i>Heaven Can Wait</i>] as a means to PG-13 stardom?</span></font></span></font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>

The first time I saw this movie was two years ago, and I started writing the
script a week after I saw it. I never had a sense of the history. And I guess
that helps me out. When I saw the movie, I thought, &quot;Man, Richard Pryor
would have been great in this.&quot; It was like a woman walking into an empty
house, and knowing, &quot;The couch goes here, the drapes go there.&quot; I
could see where all the jokes went. <o:p>

from the studio showed me <i>American Pie</i>. I was looking at a lot of movies,
trying to hire a director. The f*cking a pie, I could do without, but I liked
the rest of American Pie; there was a sweetness to it, in the relationship
between the football player guy and the glee club girl and other places. Plus,
as soon as I saw it, I knew it was going to make a ton of money. I knew they
were going to be hot, and they would help me get more money for this project, to
get it made, to be able to film it in New York, to get the quality of co-stars,
like Chazz, Mark Addy, or Regina King. <o:p>

was it to transfer the working dynamic from the show to the process of making a

</span></font></span></font></i></b><font size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">It
was actually easier, because we knew the structure, more or less. There were
parts we just discarded, like the murder investigation. But since we knew the
structure, it was all about the characters and the jokes. We just thought,
&quot;Let's make it funnier, let's make it more romantic.&quot; It's kind of
like Eddie Murphy's <i>Nutty Professor</i>. Only people that know you, know how
you're funny. We wrote a lot, but to tell you the truth, most of the jokes were
written in the first two days. So, since Warren Beatty had this huge goal in his
movie, we made my huge goal to play the Apollo. And while his character wasn't
really likeable -- I mean, he's the quarterback -- we thought, my guy was going
to really suck, to want so badly to be good, to have smaller goals. <o:p>

me, it's all mainstream. I mean, if I have the biggest special on HBO, that must
be mainstream. But with the move to romantic comedy, the genre doesn't lend
itself to R ratings. And really, for the Weitz brothers, even though they didn't
know it at the time, the best thing for them to do next was something PG. That's
the only way they were going to succeed. <o:p>

yeah, when you're a black guy doing the crossover thing, there's no blueprint
for it. You can talk to Eddie, and you can talk to Cos, but it hasn't been done
a lot. So you have to really know what you're doing, to think everything out.
For this movie, I talked to Cosby a lot, who actually owned the rights to it for
a while. He and Francis Ford Coppola. Warren Beatty actually wrote <i>Heaven Can
Wait</i> for Muhammad Ali, and he told me, when I was already in pre-production,
it's a better movie for a black guy, point blank. And I talked to Cosby because
you gotta get prepared. On movies, it's arguments and fights and everybody's got
an opinion. Studios are huge, they waste so much money, on so many people doing
so little. There are six execs on one movie, none of 'em can write, but they all
got notes. You have to fight through all of them, and not get beaten up and have
this homogenized product. <o:p>

One of the reasons the movie turned out good is because of one savvy thing I did
do, which was to have me and Lance, Louie, and Ali write it for free. We didn't
make the deal until we had written the script. That way we wrote the movie we
wanted to write, rather than sell the idea and end up writing with mail room
people, essentially. Then it would have been all watered down. But it's weird,
this is a better movie than I had set out to do. <o:p>

does not happen often, but it did for me, with <i>Bring the Pain</i>. For that,
my only goal was, I hope enough people like this, so that when I play a club, I
don't have to do radio. That was my goal, to not have to get up at seven in the
morning and go to the radio station to sell three hundred seats. And if the club
owner puts me up in a hotel, and not the Comedy Condos -- that was my goal. <o:p>

about Eddie Murphy making an African American hit movie. No, he's Eddie Murphy!

Michael J. Fox making hit movies. Now, the Kings of Comedy, that's a big story.

just these last few years. I guess when I was working out the <i>Bring the Pain</i>
thing, I broke through a wall. I learned how to write, how to use my voice and
performance. So, you're playing the clubs, and one day. It's quite obvious that
you won't be playing the clubs again, to the audience. The movie plays like
that, it plays like my stand-up,
joke-joke-joke-joke-story-joke-joke-joke-story-joke-joke. I've got a confidence
in writing now that I never had before. It's not that idiotic confidence where
anything goes. I'll still rip up a page in a second. But now I can go into a
place I was never able to go into before. <o:p>

I am. But that's because I don't have a great imagination. So I have to talk
about real things.</span></font></span></font></p>
