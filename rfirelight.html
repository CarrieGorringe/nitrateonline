The nineteenth-century-based plot, on the face of it, is a first-class heartbreaker: a well-bred young woman named Elisabeth (Marceau) has been obliged to enter into a cold-blooded contract with a wealthy, married landowner named Charles Godwin (Dillane), whose wife cannot bear him a child.

Unfortunately, honoring the contract becomes more difficult for Elisabeth than for Godwin: when she hears her baby?s first cries, they are all she will ever know of her daughter, as the baby is whisked away from her with indecent haste. For seven years, she mourns her part in this transaction, and spends much of her time creating scrapbooks filled with drawings and poems dedicated to the unknown child, in the seemingly vain hope that one day she can present them to her baby as proof of her unceasing maternal love.

<p><big><strong><big>H</big></strong>ere is the film for incurable romantics who claim
that directors don&#146;t make films the way they used to. The nineteenth-century-based
plot, on the face of it, is a first-class heartbreaker: a well-bred young woman named
Elisabeth (Marceau) has been obliged to enter into a cold-blooded contract with a wealthy,
married landowner named Charles Godwin (Dillane), whose wife cannot bear him a child. In
return for the rental of her fecundity, Elisabeth will receive enough money to pay off her
father&#146;s debts. During the necessary consummation process, both partners feel more
emotional involvement than might be thought proper under the circumstances, but live up to
their mutual obligations. Unfortunately, honoring the contract becomes more difficult for
Elisabeth than for Godwin: when she hears her baby&#146;s first cries, they are all she
will ever know of her daughter, as the baby is whisked away from her with indecent haste.
For seven years, she mourns her part in this transaction, and spends much of her time
creating scrapbooks filled with drawings and poems dedicated to the unknown child, in the
seemingly vain hope that one day she can present them to her baby as proof of her
unceasing maternal love. </big></p>

<p>Then, she is summoned to an estate in Sussex in the role of governess to care for a
&#150; you guessed it &#150; seven-year-old girl (Belancourt). The child is an
insufferable hellion, seething with resentment and overflowing with insolence because she
never sees her father. Reaching her limit of tolerance with the child within a very short
time, Elisabeth is resolved to quit the job and the household until she runs into the
child&#146;s father (no extra points for putting the right name and face together). Both
of them must fight to help the child and resist each other.</p>

<p>Based upon the above synopsis, the average filmgoer, accustomed by now to too many
shoot-&#145;em-ups and gross-out-humor films, might think that <i>Firelight</i> is nothing
more than a grotesquely saccharine period-piece. Such an accusation might have merit, if
the film were not in the hands of William Nicholson, who may be a first-time director, but
whose writing credits are renowned among aficionados of &quot;quality&quot; films (<i>Shadowlands</i>,
and <i>Nell</i> among them). <i>Firelight</i> is not some sort of sentimentalist twaddle
as concocted by a cynical writer for people to wallow about in as a cheap form of
catharsis; Nicholson honestly believes, quite legitimately, that there is something
morally and emotionally compelling in the themes of love and honor and the ensuing
desperation caused by tensions between these two polar opposites. They are, after all, the
most valuable components of human existence and, because of the feelings of vulnerability
they inspire, as well as the ease with which they can generate a response, even (and
especially) in their most degraded forms, the most belittled. Nicholson has respect for
these lovers bound by obligations and blood ties; he obliges them and the audience to
explore the consequences of binding love to personal expediency. Love, says Nicholson, has
a way of punishing most brutally those who treat it too lightly, and both of our
characters, over the course of the film, will come to know that said phrase is not as
comfortingly hackneyed as many would like to believe. Simply watching the devastating
aftermath of the birth scene in <i>Firelight</i> is sufficient to illustrate the point.</p>

<p>As a result, <i>Firelight </i>is not an easy film to watch (although its
cinematography, by Nic Morris, does make the film a treat for the eye, as Morris creates a
nineteenth-century world full of wistfully gauzy images that tend to transcend the merely
visual and verge upon other-worldly), it is a film that rewards your suffering rather than
exacerbating it, despite a bizarrely-contrived ending. Both Marceau (<i>Braveheart</i>)
and Dillane (<a href="ftiff97-1.html#Welcome_to_Sarajevo" target="_top"><i>Welcome to Sarajevo</i></a>)
infuse their characters with a strong sense of credibility without making the obviously
difficult task appear too laborious. In his directorial capacity, Nicholson even
resurrects long-abandoned stylistics (such as the use of montage sequences to convey the
passage of time) and does so with an elegant hand, thereby invoking a sense of regret over
the passing of a period in film when people could create love stories without always
steeping every facet of the production in a gallon of irony. Perhaps <i>Firelight</i>
might be the start of a limited, but welcome, trend.</p>
