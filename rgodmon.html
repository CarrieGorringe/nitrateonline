this marvelous adaptation of Christopher Bram&#146;s acclaimed novel is much like a filmic
epiphany, a small but superhuman effort haunted by entrancing images and exciting
performances that filmmaker Bill Condon conjures up in his speculative and seductive
account of the final days of James Whale, without question one of Hollywood&#146;s most
welcomed (and, regrettably, later disenchanted) additions in its golden age. As a bit of
background, Whale&#146;s openly gay lifestyle was long rumored to be the reason for his
banishment just ten years after his successful debut as director of <i>Journey&#146;s End</i>.
However, in this fictionalization, we pick up years later as an aging but dapper Whale
leads a semi-reclusive life in self-imposed exile, his longtime personal relationship with
MGM executive David Lewis (later a producer at RKO) now ended on a seemingly friendly
level, and his departure from his decade in Tinseltown now more fully understood as a
particular disenchantment from a changing corporate leadership within the film industry.
His fall from grace is attributed to the disembowelment by studio management and German
government intervention of his 1937 production <i>The Road Back</i>, a drama of postwar
frustrations based on Erich Maria Remarque&#146;s now forgotten sequel to <i>All Quiet on
the Western Front</i>, made into one of Universal&#146;s biggest hits. Whale left the
over-budget and over-schedule project after writer Charles Kenyon was told to add comic
material to blunt the film&#146;s impact that the director found unsuitable. Although we
are lead to believe this was a spectacular disaster (it was from Whale&#146;s
perspective), the film was one of the top-grossing films of the 1936-37 season.</p>

<p></font><font FACE="Times" size="3"><img src="images/rgodmon-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="118" HEIGHT="150">As <i>Gods and Monsters</i> begins, it is 1957 and a debilitating
stroke has left the king of horror -- Whale is best remembered as the man responsible for
a string of Universal Pictures&#146; greatest horror successes, including <i>Frankenstein</i>,
<a href="store1098.html#The_Bride_of_Frankenstein" target="_top"><i>Bride of Frankenstein</i></a>, <i>The
Old Dark House</i>, and <i>The Invisible Man</i> -- struggling in psychological whiplash
as flashes of his past uncontrollably flash through his cognizant and unconscious states.
The comfortable seclusion in his peaceful Pacific Palisades home begins to collapse under
a series of recollections and hellish visions -- of his abusive father, a love-struck
soldier in death-filled trenches, and the gay set antics while filming the Frankenstein
monster&#146;s bride&#146;s coming-out party (in a stunning high-voltage reconstruction of
the <i>Bride of Frankenstein</i> set). A brief aside: director-writer Condon recollected
that he, as well as his cast and crew, reveled in production designer Richard
Sherman&#146;s laboratory set for the 1935 classic and were constantly running up and down
the steps in nostalgia-inspired sprints.</p>

<p>A decidedly collaborative effort of understated technical and thespian accomplishment,
Condon until now has been known as a director of a handful of telefeatures and two
commercial efforts (<i>Candyman: Farewell to the Flesh</i> and <i>Sister, Sister</i>), as
well as co-writer of <i>Strange Invaders</i> and <i>Stranger Behavior</i> [a.k.a. <i>Dead
Kids</i>], two early 1980s cult semi-classics for flash-in-the-pan director Michael
Laughlin, who recently resurfaced as writer of Warren Beatty&#146;s next feature. Condon
has elicited startling performances from his entire cast. Sir Ian McKellen&#146;s
impeccably British &quot;Jimmy&quot; Whale is another career defining role that has
already won him a Best Actor award at this year&#146;s San Sebastian Film Festival.
Bedecked with stylish flair by costume designer Bruce Finlayson, McKellen imbues Whale
with a dazzling presence, delectable gestures, and a cauldronful of wit. </p>

<p><img src="images/rgodmon-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">Brendan Fraser,
best known for airhead comedies like <i>George of the Jungle</i> and <i>Encino Man</i>,
shows his serious side as Clayton Boone, an simple-minded, brawny yard worker befriended
as a working class foil to ease Whale&#146;s recuperative progress by posing for sketches
at the director&#146;s hand. (Whale was an accomplished painter; several of his original
works are seen in the film.) Unaware of Whale&#146;s earlier accomplishments or his sexual
proclivities, Boone&#146;s homophobic shell slowly breaks as the director pricks away at
Boone&#146;s heterosexual sensibilities. The gardener, fascinated with Whale&#146;s
ever-flowing and detail-heavy stories of his past lovers and films, realizes this is his
brass ring to 15 minutes of fame, something to share with friends and family as he grows
old.</p>

<p>Whale&#146;s over-protective and plain Hungarian housemaid Hanna (Lynn Redgrave)
deserves special mention as one of the most off-the-wall characters in any film this year.
Devoutly religious but resigned to Mr. Jimmy&#146;s colorful lifestyle, she obediently
prepares cucumber sandwiches and iced tea when not complaining about his sinful habits.
Her accent, hairstyle, habits, and body movements play off her reactions to her
employer&#146;s buggering shenanigans and Boone&#146;s innocence. Bring along a wide smile
whenever her scowl graces the screen.</p>

<p>Lolita Davidovich has a small role as Boone&#146;s former squeeze and sounding board
for Boone&#146;s growing relationship with Whale, while Jack Plotnick provides several
moments of geeky delight as a USC film student infatuated with Whale&#146;s horror oeuvre
and caught up in a one-side game of strip interview with the retired, and excessively
bored director.</p>

<p><img src="images/rgodmon-3.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="123" HEIGHT="150">I pray <i>Gods and
Monsters</i> finds a audience of well-meaning cinephiles and moviegoers, and that it
won&#146;t be caught in unfavorable comparisons to McKellen&#146;s concurrent role as the
crazed Nazi fugitive in <a href="raptpupil.html" target="_top"><i>Apt Pupil</i></a>, or , for that
matter, to the lowbrow humor of <a href="rbchucky.html" target="_top"><i>Bride of Chucky</i></a>, which,
like <i>Gods and Monsters</i>, borrows footage from <i>Bride of Frankenstein</i>.. Aside
from the sentimental glimpses of a Hollywood sound set in the mid 1930s, Condon also
summons up a wildly entertaining house party honoring Princess Margaret at gay director
George Cukor&#146;s palatial estate. Whale, responding to an unexpected invitation, brings
along his garden pal to embarrass Cukor before his royal guest, zinging with a catty
comment that Boone has &quot;never met a princess, only queens.&quot;</p>

<p>Camerawork by Stephen M. Katz is outstanding and the dirge-like score by Carter Burwell
(who has composed the music for all the Coen Brothers&#146; films) provides a haunting
texture throughout the film. The end credits harp back to the bygone days of early
filmmaking acknowledgments, heralding above the actors&#146; name that &quot;A Good Cast
Is Worth Repeating.&quot; Yes, indeed. Yes, indeed.</font></p>
