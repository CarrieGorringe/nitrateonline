Mizrahi is a superstar, counting such celebrities as Lisa Minnelli and Roseanne among his
fans. Facing the prospect of designing his upcoming collection for Fall 1994, Isaac
Mizrahi is a superstar with a very serious problem: the reviews for his Spring 1994
collection were scathing: <em>Women's Wear Daily</em>, the Bible of the fashion industry,
declared that he had lost both his sense of color and a sense of what women want to wear
after five p.m. Mizrahi has every reason to be worried about negative press; after all,
the fashion world is analogous to Hollywood, where the general opinion about how
&quot;bankable&quot; you are is dependent upon how good your last reviews were. Taking the
&quot;you're-only-as-good-as-your-last-movie&quot; mentality literally, this young man

novel, <em>Call of the Wild</em>. All of this occurs in only the first few minutes of
Douglas Keeve's documentary on Mizrahi, <em>Unzipped</em>. What unfolds in the remaining
seventy minutes or so is an extremely intimate and often hilarious exposé of what it's

<p>As captured by Keeve on film, Mizrahi is an absolute hoot. The ultimate in postmodern
figures, he mixes diverse images and symbols taken from various socio-historical contexts
without missing a beat (a trait not unknown in the art world); throughout the course of
the film, the audience sees him playing Bach or Debussy on the piano, then listens to his
extensive quotation from films like <em>Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?</em> and <em>Valley
of the Dolls</em> (complete with spot-on imitations of the filmic scenes in question). He
is of the opinion that the major trend setters of the late twentieth century, as far as
fashion is concerned, were Jackie Kennedy and Mary Tyler Moore (in her &quot;Laura
Petrie&quot; incarnation on <em>The Dick van Dyke Show</em>. As befitting a postmodern
figure, his sense of irony is exquisite; he notes how Loretta Young, as depicted in the
aforementioned film <em>Call of the Wild</em>, seems to survive three days of isolation on
the open tundra looking as if she has just emerged from the makeup room, in true Hollywood
fashion. Unfortunately, what Mizrahi does not understand is that, in the land of the
postmodern, there is no such thing as an obscure symbol. Everything is accessible to
anyone else with the will to find and exploit it, as Mizrahi learns to his horror when a
rival (Jean-Paul Gaultier) &quot;nanooks&quot; him by releasing an arctic-inspired
collection just weeks before Mizrahi's own show. Desperate to find another gimmick,
Mizrahi seizes upon the idea of having a transparent backdrop at the back of the stage
where the models usually change. This last-minute, behind-the-scenes concept, creates some
problems; not only are certain supermodels understandably reluctant to place their
$10,000-an-hour bodies on constant display, but the removal of privacy during preparations
for the runway runs the risk of destroying illusion, an important consideration in
promoting fantasy and entertainment. What transpires is best left to filmgoers to
determine for themselves, but it certainly isn't dull.</p>

<p>The structure of <em>Unzipped</em> only reinforces the sense of urgency and realism
surrounding Mizrahi's fight to stay on top. Keeve, a fashion photographer, relies mainly
upon grainy black-and-white footage to maintain a documentary feel, using color only when
necessary, and he quite rightly allows the natural chronology of the situation at hand
(and the resultant tension it creates) to structure the film. His camera is mobile and his
access extensive (due as much to his own position in the fashion world as it is to his
status as Mizrahi's ex). Keeve's use of film clips as illustrations of Mizrahi's pop
culture quotations are as useful for placing symbols in context as they are ironic. What
prevents <em>Unzipped</em> from becoming purely satirical is Keeve's own obvious empathy
with the subject; the use of often-ironic intertitles that precede each sequence (like
&quot;Nanooked&quot;) are often followed up by segments of Mizrahi playing the piano, lost
in thought, or in conversations between Mizrahi and his mother, or other celebrity
friends. The audience comes away with a sense of Mizrahi in both the private and public
realm (if celebrities can be said to possess such separate spheres in their lives) and
this depiction of balanced dualism presents Mizrahi as a complete person (or as complete
as anyone in the entertainment business could ever be perceived as being). Without this
balance, Mizrahi would come off looking very superficial indeed, if the film had
concentrated exclusively upon the self-absorption which is a necessary trait in his line
of work. Even if you don't like fashion, <em>Unzipped</em> is worth a look, not only
because of its exemplary documentary style, but also because of its unintentionally
revealing stance vis-à-vis the fashion world, thereby illustrating that the most
sanguinary battles are often fought over the most socially irrelevant details.</p>
