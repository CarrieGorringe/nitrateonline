introduction as Edmund Kay elicits a chuckle from Bill Condon, a slender thirty-ish
flat-top director who strangely reminds me of Wally Cleaver. He knows I am lying. Caught
in the act. The smarmy interviewer by that name is but a character in Condon&#146;s new
film <i>Gods and Monsters</i>, a fascinating, fictional, examination of the last days of
1930s helmer James Whale. And while I empathize with that make-believe role as someone I
probably resembled more than a quarter century ago, when I first started researching a
biography of Tod Browning, a fellow director who shared studio space with Whale in the
early 1930s, I now try to present myself with a little more worldliness to Condon.
He&#146;s probably be &quot;tricked&quot; with similar introductions by other reporters he
has encountered as he readies his film for the reel world.</p>

<p></font><font FACE="Times" size="3">Condon, a New York City native and graduate of
Columbia College with a degree in philosophy, has written and/or directed more than a
handful of made for television and commercial features, with <i>Sister, Sister</i> (1987),
starring Jennifer Jason Leigh, Eric Stoltz, and Judith Ivey, being his directorial debut.
His telefeature <i>Murder 101</i> (1991) with Pierce Brosnan won an Edgar Award from the
Mystery Writers of America. For cable, he helmed <i>White Lie </i>(1991) with Gregory
Hines and <i>Dead in the Water </i>(1991) with Teri Hatcher and Bryan Brown.</p>

<p>I marvel at how well he looks considering he is about the give birth.</p>

<p>Say what? Well, his new creation was first shown at the Sundance Film Festival way back
in January, in search of a distributor. Many festivals (Seattle, New York, San Sebastian,
Mill Valley, etc.) and screenings later, as Condon enters his tenth month of labor
awaiting theatrical birth through Lions Gate Films, the results are at hand. Our
conversation starts with a brief discussion of the recently concluded San Sebastian event
(&quot;a film lover&#146;s festival&quot;), where Ian McKellen won for Best Actor. He
notes the &quot;prestigious&quot; New York unreeling, but was blown away by a very
positive screening the previous evening as the closing film for the DC Gay and Lesbian
Film Festival.</p>

<hr size="4" width="60">
<i><b>

<p>ES:</b></i> I&#146;m amazed at the performances you got out of your actors! Your
rehearsals must have been a lot of fun.</p>
<i><b>

<p>BC:</b></i> It was great fun, and we did it for three weeks, almost as long as we shot,
because we knew we had so little time. That was last June (1997). As we had our location
in Los Angeles, so we got to go there. Ian, of course, at the end of a three week
rehearsal and four week shoot, said &#145;okay, now we&#146;re probably ready to go into
previews.&quot; For him, that&#146;s a normal [theatrical] rehearsal schedule. He felt
like he was just discovering it, and it was over.</p>
<i><b>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p>ES:</b></i> I think it would make a fascinating stage drama.</p>
<i><b>

<p>BC:</b></i> I do, too. I think it could be a real good three hander. Absolutely. It
would be fun imagining getting that mood on the stage.</p>
<i><b>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p>ES:</b> </i>How did you select your actors?</p>
<i><b>

<p>BC:</b></i> I got the script to Ian. He read it and decided to do it. He became the
magnet for the other actors, in a way, but obviously I chose them.</p>

<hr size="4" width="60">
<i><b>

<p>ES:</b> </i>Brandan [Fraser] was a refreshing performance from someone better known for
his airhead comedy.</p>
<i><b>

<p>BC:</b></i> I know! And <i>George [of the Jungle]</i> hadn&#146;t opened yet. It was
fun to see him have that success in the middle of our shooting. He was excited by that.</p>

<hr size="4" width="60">
<i><b>

<p>ES:</b></i> Lynn Redgrave also was refreshing [gee, there&#146;s the geeky interviewer
using the same adjective again]. Every time I looked at her I was cracking up. Why the
decision to go from Mexican to Hungarian? [in Christopher Bram&#146;s <i>Father of
Frankenstein</i>, the basis for the movie, Whale&#146;s devoted housekeeper is Maria; in
the film she&#146;s Hanna.]</p>
<i><b>

<p>BC:</b></i> Two things. First of all, just knowing people who grew up in the movie
business at that time, no one had Mexican maids. In Hollywood through the 50s, there were
black, English, and Middle European housekeepers and maids. Whale himself actually had two
Middle Europeans, one housekeeper, one maid, Anna and Yohanna. Hence these got clashed
into Hanna. It just felt, too, that, because of his connection to the war [WWI] between
his history and Germany, that to have a dramatic figure like this in the house helped to
tie up certain themes. Then there&#146;s a direct line a stock Maria Ouspenskaya [a
Slavic-accented, forceful character actress during the 1930s and 1940s] figure. Plus, Lynn
has a great ear for accents, immediately getting to know a Hungarian woman. There&#146;s
one scene where she&#146;s on the phone and speaking in Hungarian with her daughter.
I&#146;m convinced she says &#145;They&#146;re paying me enough to get me off this
picture.&#146;</p>
<i><b>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p>ES:</b></i> Brendan Fraser&#146;s character Clayton Boone frames the film, another
enhancement from the novel. What brought that on?</p>
<i><b>

<p>BC:</b></i> The film opens with Clay opening his eyes and closes with him out in the
rain. Even though there are so many different memories and flashback for Whale, it&#146;s
almost like him piecing together what it must have been like for Whale just having seen
his movie [<i>Bride of Frankenstein</i>]. Interestingly, I did have a few other scenes
with Brendan early on and I couldn&#146;t cut to them. He hadn&#146;t earned his right to
take us away from Whale. As the movie progresses, you spend more and more time with him
because I think he becomes more interesting. It just felt that in the end he deserved an
end to his own story.</p>
<i><b>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p>ES:</b></i> Lolita Davidovich&#133;</p>
<i><b>

<p>BC:</b></i> She has a small part. It was a two-day shoot. She liked it. She was in
Percy Adlon&#146;s <i>Younger and Younger</i> with Brendan. Now she&#146;s playing Lynn
Redgrave mother&#146;s in a film up in Canada.</p>

<hr size="4" width="60">
<i><b>

<p>ES:</b></i> What was the experience like visiting the Whale house? [Prior to filming,
Condon visited the director&#146;s former residence. The current owner, feeling
Whale&#146;s presence there, had his spirit exorcised.]</p>
<i><b>

<p>BC:</b></i> It was great, and a lot of fun. I had actually been in that house before,
but it great to go there with Curtis [Harrington] and just walk through and hear the
stories. The house [in the film] doesn&#146;t really resemble it.</p>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p><i><b>ES:</b></i> Your production appears flawless. The ceiling shots, very reminiscent
of some of the shots in <i>Citizen Kane</i>. Photography and music add a wonderful blend.</p>
<i><b>

<p>BC:</b></i> That&#146;s [production designer] Richard Sherman. And thank God for
[composer] Carter Burwell.</p>
<i><b>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p>ES:</b></i> You&#146;ve worked with a lot of technical people before [Sherman, director
of photography Stephen M. Katz, editor Virginia Katz, costume designer Bruce Finlayson,
and producer Greg D. Fienberg]. Do you just bring them in, saying it&#146;s time to make
another film?</p>
<i><b>

<p>BC:</b></i> Yeah, basically. Absolutely. It&#146;s such shorthand for all of us now.
Carter Burwell was the new one. That was so great to just send him the final cut of the
movie and have him say &#145;Sure I&#146;ll do it.&#146; We had so little money [$3.5
million budget]. He was able to get an orchestra score. He made some typically
idiosyncratic choices. He went back to [noted Hollywood composer Franz] Waxman&#146;s
roots and created this sad waltz, a dirge for that culture destroyed by the first world
war. He connected a lot of the dots in the movie.</p>
<i><b>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p>ES:</b></i> In the book, chapters represent past and present episodes in Whale&#146;s
life. In the film these events are hooked by sound effects and musical and visual cues. It
compresses the book and makes it a much better film.</p>
<i><b>

<p>BC:</b></i> Exactly. It&#146;s a real useful device. The idea of having stabs of memory
is a way to do it and take that biopic curse off of it with Whale&#146;s flashbacks.</p>
<i><b>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p>ES:</b></i> People are going to think this is real anyway. Your next picture, <i>Vicky
Oberjeune: Alone in the Night</i> , has a similar theme. A Judy Garland type chanteuse
sprinkled with real characters.</p>
<i><b>

<p>BC:</b></i> Yes, Garland has an influence on it. A big part was going to be [the late]
Roddy McDowall, but it does deal with many contemporaries&#133;Debby Reynolds and others.
It used to be associated with HBO, but it&#146;s an independent production. The script is
done. [Condon wouldn&#146;t reveal who would produce or star as he was still in
negotiations.]</p>

<hr size="4" width="60">
<i><b>

<p>ES:</b></i> Michael Laughlin directed and co-wrote with you two [horror/sci-fi
&quot;cult&quot; films [<i>Dead Kids</i> a.k.a. <i>Strange Behavior</i> (1981) and <i>Strange
Invaders</i> (1983)]. What ever happened to him?</p>
<i><b>

<p>BC:</b></i> The thing about Michael is that he goes away for ten years at a time. In
the 60s he produced two films, <i>The Whisperers</i> (1967) and <i>Joanna</i> (1968),
followed by <i>Two-Lane Blacktop</i> (1971). He disappeared and then came back with the <i>Strange</i>
movies. Now he&#146;s back, having written this Warren Beatty film <i>Town and Country</i>.
It&#146;s done and due out in April.</p>
<i><b>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p>ES:</b> </i>I assume you changed the title of the film so people wouldn&#146;t confuse
the film as a horror picture.</p>
<i><b>

<p>BC:</b></i> Correct. It&#146;s also a gay film. It&#146;s a challenge to market. You
both want to get that audience, make sure you&#146;ve gotten them in there, without
excluding another audience. The horror crowd can have it&#146;s <i>Bride of Chucky</i> or <i>Vampires</i>.
Actually, I loved <i>Chucky</i>. It&#146;s one of the strangest movies I&#146;ve ever
seen. The sex scene is hilarious. And, of course, it also mentions <i>Bride of
Frankenstein</i>..</p>

<hr size="4" width="60">

<p>Our time spent, your dear nerdy conversationalist graciously had not been asked to
remove any clothing during the last half hour . Instead he clumsily presented Condon with
a lavish volume on Whale prepared for the 1989 San Sebastian Film Festival. In the moments
following his exuberant appreciation of the gift, I was so flummoxed that I forgot to take
any photos of our meeting or inscribe the book. As a postscript, my inscription
undoubtedly would have read:</p>

<p>&#145;From a son of Dracula to a son of Frankenstein. May your labors be rewarded when
the envelope is opened.&#146;</p>
