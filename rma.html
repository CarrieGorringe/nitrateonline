<p><font size="5"><strong>I</strong></font><font size="4">n <em>Mighty Aphrodite</em>,
Woody Allen has decided to address the latest burning issue among well-heeled urbanites in
the 1990s. Having acquired all of the latest and most prestigious occupational positions
and material possessions, these individuals now seek to acquire status through their
children, who, of course, are literally overflowing with talent; given their
childrens&#146; illustrious genetic advantages, how could they be anything but? In the
offspring lottery, Lenny and Amanda Weinrib (Allen and Bonham Carter) have quite clearly
won the yuppie grand prize: their son, Max, is extremely intelligent, handsome and
charming. But neither of the Weinribs can claim genetic credit for Max; he is adopted,
since Amanda, an ambitious would-be art dealer, had no intentions of becoming pregnant and
causing a potential derailing of her career, although she might be capable of having an
affair with the would-be financial backer of her own gallery (Weller). The only credit
Amanda can claim on behalf of Max is in having the personal connections that allowed her
to get to the head of the adoption line. When Max&#146;s intellectual talent becomes
apparent -- at the age of three, he creates elaborate structures with an Erector set with
no parental assistance -- Amanda and Lenny are intrigued as to the obviously gifted
origins of their son. Through a series of hilarious, if rather traditional, plot
conventions, Lenny locates Max&#146;s biological mother, and the cruelest irony of all. No
Nobel Prize winner she, Linda Ash (Sorvino), nee Leslie St. James, is an individual of
stunning naivete who works primarily as a prostitute. Nevertheless, she does have
ambitions of the thespian variety, and attempts to further them by her occasional work as
a porn actress under the oh-so-appropriate stage name of Judy Cum. Obviously horrified by
the down-market status of Max&#146;s mother, the rest of the film concentrates upon
Lenny&#146;s quest to &quot;improve&quot; Linda&#146;s life. </font></p>

<p>Fortunately for Lenny and the film&#146;s narrative trajectory, Linda is amenable to
assistance in cleaning up her act. She wants to get married and have children. Lenny
attempts to oblige Linda by fixing her up with a fighter, a dolt of the lowest order who
cannot determine his left fist from his right without an external arbiter, but who is
capable of declaring Linda an unsuitable wife because he can determine that taking an
ex-prostitute for a wife would leave him open to ridicule by his friends (the same friends
who inadvertently revealed Linda&#146;s pornographic past to him). Yet, even Lenny&#146;s
aims are hardly less elitist; he openly admits to a friend that he wants Linda to marry
well so that her shady past is safely concealed by the time that Max starts asking
potentially embarrassing questions. So, Lenny&#146;s &quot;solution&quot; to Linda&#146;s
&quot;problem&quot; is really the solution to Lenny&#146;s &quot;problem&quot;. </p>

<p>Within <em>Mighty Aphrodite</em> this contempt for Linda and the choices she felt
obliged to make is at best barely concealed and, in making it so, Allen runs the risk of
being too nasty. Anyone who is familiar with the body of Allen&#146;s work at its best
knows how skillfully he can convey barely-concealed hostility by cloaking it in an
extremely thin veneer of mordant wit; witness the scene in <em>Hannah and Her Sisters</em>
(1986) in which, at the end of a very bad date, he tells his companion that, as far as he
was concerned, the date had been as much fun as the Nuremberg War Crimes Trials. In the
case of <em>Mighty Aphrodite</em>, Allen has created an uneasy balancing act by
dehumanizing Linda excessively in the audience&#146;s eyes (because of her lifestyle)
while at the same time allowing the audience to know too much personal information about
her; an entire sequence is devoted to Linda&#146;s personal, almost touching, narration of
her rather pitiful upbringing. It&#146;s almost as if Allen is unable to reconcile himself
to using prostitution as the focal point of a joke -- though, as the examples above and
below indicate, Allen doesn&#146;t tend toward reticence in his choice of material; one
certainly hopes that he hasn&#146;t allowed publicity over his, admittedly, rather
checkered personal life to cloud his judgment. Nevertheless, comedy requires psychological
distance to make it work, and there are points in this film where the comedy threatens to
veer into the realm of tragedy.</p>

<p>But Allen has the skill to make the unwieldy apparatus stay in place by making the
ambiguity in the film work as a means of self-questioning. Using Lenny&#146;s so-called
good intentions, the film raises questions as to when altruism crosses over into egoism.
Even after she has rejected his earlier offers of assistance, Lenny still cannot resist
the urge to insult her from the safe sanctimony of his upper-middle-class pedestal
(&quot;I wish I had the penicillin concession for your apartment complex,&quot; he tells
her when she informs him that she is still a prostitute). Only gradually does Lenny,
solidly upwardly-mobile and painfully aware of the consequences of social faux pas,
reawaken in her the concept of shame and this happens only because -- surprise -- she is
really a &quot;good&quot; girl at heart, who wants nothing more than a man to &quot;treat
her nice.&quot; But, with all of his emotional goading and interference in her life, he
seems unprepared for the potential damage he might cause in her life and unwilling to take
the consequences for his actions (such as provoking a fight between Linda and her pimp).
Furthermore, he doesn&#146;t even have the decency, after barging into her life, to inform
her of Max&#146;s current status. For all of his so-called principles and his airy
confidence in the rightness of his viewpoint, Lenny is nothing more than what those at the
left of the political spectrum like to call a phony liberal bourgeois, scared to death of
what the neighbors might say. Allen conveys this rather poisonous message subtly but
effectively.</p>

<p>There is no question at all, however, about the acting ability of Mira Sorvino. Her
portrayal of Leslie/Linda/Judy (take your pick) is exquisitely balanced. When she first
appears on screen as Linda, she is an uninhibitedly cheerful and trashy individual, right
down to the overt phallic symbolism in her apartment covered by the camera in explicit
detail (you&#146;ll never look at cacti the same way again). When Linda shows Lenny her
new wall clock (a hideously cheap but hilariously vulgar artifact), Sorvino makes her seem
blithely unaware of the effect it is having on Lenny. In fact, the performance is much
more skillfully constructed; Linda is not as much blithely unaware as dissociated from her
surroundings (no doubt the dissociation is a side-effect of her upbringing, if the
dimestore-Freud deduction might be permitted). Sorvino never allows Linda to appear
completely comfortable with her current status; the nasal honk in her accent works to
promote this sense of unease, seeming to grow stronger as she becomes uncomfortable and
finally angry at Lenny&#146;s comic undermining of her attitudes toward her livelihood.
During their first meeting, a remarkable thing happens: Sorvino literally overtakes Allen
on screen and reduces him to insignificance, so powerful is her performance. Granted,
Allen has a reputation for writing strong roles for actresses (at least when he isn&#146;t
on screen at the same time as they, in which case the women can be reduced to mere foils
for his humor), but never in any one of his other films does one get the impression that
he has underestimated an actress&#146;s ability to upstage him as in this case. Allen must
have seen the result during the dailies; in the rest of the film, Sorvino is reduced to
merely keeping up with him with ease. Even the eventual diminution of her character into
the stereotypical whore with a heart of gold does not dim Sorvino&#146;s screen presence
(the same cannot be said for Bonham Carter, who never enriches her character&#146;s
stereotypical persona with anything beyond whining, and Peter Weller, as usual, merely
occupies screen space). </p>

<p>Of course, with a referent to Greek mythology in the film&#146;s title, there has to be
a Greek chorus and a &quot;deus ex machina.&quot; The former is choreographed with Busby
Berkeley charm and presided over delightfully by the versatile F. Murray Abraham. The
latter is applied with a broad stroke of satirical literalism. Sophocles -- and the
audience -- never had it so good.</p>
