<p><font size="5"><strong>A</strong></font><font size="4">n incisive if somewhat awkward
mix of contemporary social satire and neatly inverted elements of classic Hollywood
screwball comedy, <i>In &amp; Out</i> scores some legitimate and very funny points for
sexual tolerance and against the suffocating intimacy of an admittedly idealized
small-town America, but in the end lacks the shrewd insight </font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman Special G1">&#150;</font><font size="4"> not to mention the

<p>Prominent among the outstanding citizens who call the bucolic hamlet of Greenleaf,
Indiana (&quot;A Great BIG Small Town&quot;) home is Howard Brackett (Kevin Kline), <img src="images/rinout-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="168">an English teacher and
football coach at the local high school. For three years Howard's been engaged to fellow
teacher Emily Montgomery (Joan Cusack), and with the wedding only a few days away they
settle down in front of the TV to watch as one of Howard's former students, Cameron Drake
(Matt Dillon), wins an Academy Award for his bold performance as a gay soldier in <i>To
Serve and Protect</i> (in one of the film's more trenchant bits of social satire, his
imaginary competition is fierce: Paul Newman in <i>Coot</i>, Clint Eastwood in <i>Codger</i>,
Michael Douglas in <i>Primary Urges</i> and Steven Seagal in <i>Snowball in Hell</i>). In
his triumphant acceptance speech, Cameron thanks the usual hangers-on but singles out the
influence of Brackett, concluding with a dramatic flourish, &quot;and he's <i>gay</i>.&quot;</p>

<p>From this point on, life for Howard Brackett is turned upside down. His students are
confused, with one claiming &quot;Mr. Brackett's not gay! He just likes poetry and
Shakespeare and uses his napkin.&quot; His long-suffering fiancée, having waited three
years for the wedding and shed 75 pounds to please her man (a decidedly sinister subplot
that is never pursued), goes immediately into panic mode. His loving but iron-willed
parents (Debbie Reynolds and Wilford Brimley) do a not-so-subtle press for the nuptials to
proceed. And, in the most pivotal development, gay TV reporter Peter Malloy (Tom Selleck)
descends on Greenleaf and vows to follow the story in great detail <font face="Times New Roman Special G1">&#150;</font> &quot;for a full week!&quot; he declares.</p>

<p>In the face of this scrutiny, Howard goes through with the wedding <font face="Times New Roman Special G1">&#150;</font> sort of. In a defining plot point that
will not be revealed here, Howard makes a decision that changes not only his life but the
lives of seemingly everyone in Greenleaf. The much-discussed kiss between Kline and
Selleck seems to be the key motivation for the decision, and in the climactic graduation
ceremony (which appears to occur only days after the Oscars, but never mind), <i>In &amp;
Out</i>'s true agenda of support and tolerance is revealed, and promptly overemphasized to
the point of mawkishness. </p>

<p><img src="images/rinout-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="168">If the central plot
device of <i>In &amp; Out</i> sounds familiar, recall that Tom Hanks thanked his gay high
school drama teacher by name when he accepted the Best Actor Oscar for <i>Philadelphia</i>
in 1994. It was this germ of an idea, a gay man &quot;outed&quot; on national television,
that producer Scott Rudin brought to screenwriter Paul Rudnick. As is Rudnick's style (he
also wrote the Addams Family films, adapted his stage play &quot;Jeffrey&quot; for the
screen and does the monthly Libby Gelman-Waxner column for Premiere), <i>In &amp; Out</i>
is hip-deep in contemporary pop culture references, from Richard Simmons to Traci Lords
with stops at <a href="rbcage.html" target="_top"><i>The Birdcage</i></a>, Isaac Mizrahi, postal
workers, Jay Leno, self-help tapes, Johnny Cochrane, supermodels, the Catholic church,
Barbra Streisand (a running joke throughout the film), wheelchairs, walkers and the
obligatory disco songs <font face="Times New Roman Special G1">&#150;</font> in this case
Gloria Gaynor's &quot;I Will Survive&quot; and The Village People's &quot;Macho Man&quot; <font face="Times New Roman Special G1">&#150;</font> that are currently <i>de rigeur</i> in
American movies as a signifier of, well, some kind of demented nostalgia.</p>

<p>Director Howard Hawks is credited with coining the phrase &quot;screwball comedy&quot;
when he described each and every character in his 1938 film <i>Bringing Up Baby</i> as
&quot;way off center... There were no normal people in it. Everyone you met was a
screwball.&quot; <i>In &amp; Out</i> reverses this premise by presenting a town full of
&quot;normal&quot; people who are slowly revealed to have individual eccentricities. Over
the years the phrase has expanded to include the sassy, fast-paced rhythm of this and
other vintage comedies, films that play not only on role reversal but the oblivious nature
of the protagonist to exaggerate the spoof of the storytelling process. </p>

<p><img src="images/rinout-3.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="168">While Rudnick
applies an intimate understanding of the genre to his sexual agenda for <i>In &amp; Out</i>,
his glib and knowing script is fatally undermined by a number of fundamental dramatic
lapses. In addition to the fractured timeframe, Howard's key decision is more or less a
bolt from the blue, and the character is such a cypher that Rudnick's points lose much of
their sincerity. Two thirds of the way through the film, a church full of people just sit
there while two pivotal scenes play themselves out. And in perhaps the worst lapse of
logic, no explanation is ever offered for what makes the obviously straight Cameron so
sure of Howard's sexual preference. The dangers of a one-joke script are greatly increased
when that single joke collapses under the most casual scrutiny (only this week Rudnick
told Entertainment Weekly &quot;I decided my reply to anyone who brought [the timeframe]
up would be 'oh, shut up!'&quot;). </p>

<p>Nor is the film helped by the leaden direction of Frank Oz (a key contributor to the
Muppet braintrust and helmer of numerous forgettable comedies), who fails to imbue <i>In
&amp; Out</i> with any kind of logical pace. Scenes that feel short run long and vice
versa, and at a brusque 90 minutes the film still feels leaden in places and is noticeably
lacking scenes featured in the television trailer. </p>

<p>Most of the fun of <i>In &amp; Out</i> comes from watching a cast that is obviously
enjoying itself. Kline's physicality has never been more pronounced on screen, and his
showstopping scene to the self-help tape &quot;Be a Man: Exploring Your Masculinity&quot;
(tape one: &quot;Getting a Grip&quot;) is a career highlight. As she did in <a href="rgpblank.html" target="_top"><i>Grosse Pointe Blank</i></a>, Joan Cusack nearly steals every scene
she's in and has a great bit with Dillon (who does a fair Brad Pitt imitation) near the
end. Even Selleck is in the spirit, giving the film its genial gay conscious while
simultaneously skewering the media savvy his character represents (although he still looks
as if he's just bitten down on something unpleasant). While <i>In &amp; Out</i> appears to
be headed for box office success, it will come at the expense of basic storytelling. And
while that flaw may not matter, given the film's relentless good cheer and upbeat
resolution, it doesn't exactly ensure a protracted shelf life, either. Sometimes being
funny just isn't enough.</p>
