<p><big><big><strong>I</strong></big> suppose that nowadays you have to take class, in
movies, where you can get it. James Ivory's film, which he and Ruth Prawer Jhabvala
adapted from a novel by Kaylie Jones (daughter of the novelist James Jones), has taste,
style, consideration, even savoir-faire -- and is almost completely boring.</big></p>

<p>In a big, beautiful apartment in Paris in the 1960s, Chann (Leelee Sobieski) is brought
up by her parents, a rugged, but caring, expatriate American novelist (Kris Kristofferson)
and a spirited, zaftig mother (Barbara Hershey). Everyone is nice to Chann, including the
household maid (Dominique Blanc), her adopted half-brother (Jesse Bradford), the
headmistress at her school (Macha Meril), her eccentric young friend (Anthony Ruth
Costanzo, in a very ingratiating performance) who's mad about opera and confesses to being
in love with her &quot;a little bit&quot;, even, after they relocate back to the States,
her high school boyfriend (Harley Cross). About the worst that happens to her when her
father gives her a talking-to about how forging people's names is a bad idea. Later, when
he asks if Chann and her boyfriend are &quot;sleeping together&quot;, he tells them to do
it in the house, so as to save the upholstery in the car.</p>

<p>Ivory has done two excellent adaptations of E.M. Forster (<i>A Room With a View</i> and
<i>Howards End</i>) and one of Kazuo Ishiguro's <i>The Remains of the Day</i>. But he has
a persistent problem with taking all the potential conflict and darker intonations in his
story material and ironing them all out. The main actresses in his films can sometimes
also be reduced to bland, chirrupy, irritating little things. When Leelee Sobieski first
appears, with a round, bland face staring into nowhere, I thought she was going to be put
through the same treatment. But Sobieski rises to the occasion, and ends up informing her
performance with warmth and inspiration.</p>

<p>The picture is worth taking a look at for two things: a &quot;modern&quot; staging of
Richard Strauss' opera <i>Salome</i>, with inflatable furniture, a Salome dressed in black
net stockings and vinyl, and a Herodias who casually sniffs cocaine and shoots-up
on-stage; and the dead-on recreation of what it was like to go to high school in the U.S.
in the Seventies, with its air of limpid disaffection, its knit and synthetic fabric
clothes, and girls gazing at you with faces framed by long, blond, Herbal Essenced
tresses.</p>
