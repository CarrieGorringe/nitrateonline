<p><big><strong><big>T</big></strong>his harrowing, singular new film has been called a
cross between François Truffaut's <i>The 400 Blows</i> (1959) and Stanley Kubrick's <i>A
Clockwork Orange</i> (1971), combining as it does the initially innocent pleasures of
rural childhood with deeper, unstoppable forces that eventually drive an exuberant but
ultimately doomed youngster to an act of shocking violence. It is a combustible mixture to
be sure, made all the more unstable by the breakneck pace and tornado of Irish slang
unleashed by director and co-scenarist Neil Jordan, who is no stranger to dark,
risk-taking stories that mix the emotions of childhood and weary cynicism with often
surprising results (<i>The Company of Wolves</i>, <i>The Crying Game</i>).</big></p>

<p><img src="images/rbutcherboy-1.gif" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">In rural Carn,
Ireland, 12-year-old Francie Brady (Eamonn Owens) is bucking some pretty long odds on
having anything resembling a normal childhood. His Da (Stephen Rea) is an alcoholic
ex-musician, while his Ma (Aisling O'Sullivan) is mentally unstable. What little of the
outside world comes through on the Brady's undependable black and white television only
increases the tension, with such innocent fare as &quot;The Lone Ranger&quot; full of
static but clips of atomic destruction, &quot;The Fugitive&quot; and Nathan Juran's
classic sci-fi schlocker <i>The Brain from Planet Arous</i> (1958) coming through just
fine. His Uncle Alo (Ian Hart), initially appears to have some influence over the boy but
their relationship never gels.</p>

<p>At first a boisterous, cocky bully who terrorizes classmate Phillip Nugent (Andrew
Fullerton) in league with best friend Joe (Alan Boyle), Francie's pranks turn increasingly
vicious and invites the ire of his young victim's stern-faced mother (Fiona Shaw).</p>

<p>When Ma is institutionalized following a failed suicide attempt, Francie runs away to
Dublin &#151; only to find upon his return that Ma has killed herself and the town blames
the boy for driving her to it. The hostilities with the Nugents escalate, and Francie is
sent to a reform school. Sexually abused there by Father Sullivan (Milo O'Shea), he also
begins to have visions of the Virgin Mary (Sinead O'Connor), whose soothing visits he
describes to the old priest during the abuse. </p>

<p>Returning to Carn, Francie is put to work at the local butchers. While he continues to
be relentlessly cheerful in public, his maliciousness towards the Nugents increases while
his father dies of Tuberculosis in the living room and the Cuban Missile Crisis plays
itself out on radio and television. Finally, the boy snaps and brutally kills Mrs. Nugent
in her own home, smearing her blood on the walls and fleeing. Captured and incarcerated in
a mental institution, he is released many years later and immediately has another vision
of the Virgin Mary.</p>

<p>What makes <i>The Butcher Boy</i> almost hypnotically watchable are the elaborate
visual constructs Francie makes from television clips of nuclear holocaust, the visions of
Our Lady and the surreal images of pigs (what Mrs. Nugent contemptuously calls the entire
Brady clan). The entire narrative is also fuelled by a supercharged, slang-ridden, darkly
funny narration read from Francie's point of view by Rea (who, absurdly, plays the boy
briefly at the very end of the film).</p>

<p><img src="images/rbutcherboy-2.gif" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="left" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="146">In Eamonn
Owens, Jordan has found a brazen, cocksure, ingratiating youngster who cements the links
to Truffaut's Antoine Doinel (Jean-Pierre Leaud) and Kubrick's Alex (Malcolm McDowell).
His eyes merry, his face split by a fleshy, devil-may-care grin, Owens brings an energy to
the role that is at first heartbreakingly innocent, then astonishing in its heartlessness.
Long-time Jordan collaborator Rea is fine as the nearly catatonically drunk Da, and
Sullivan, who worked with Jordan in <i>Michael Collins</i> and is also in
&quot;Cracker,&quot; brings a troubled frailty to Ma. Fiona Shaw conjures up no less of a
disapproving presence than Margaret Hamilton as Mrs. Nugent (and is soon to be seen in the
remake of <i>The Avengers</i>), and veteran character actor O'Shea is chillingly effective
as the priest who must dress Francie up in a bonnet and urge him to recite his visions.
The terrific Hart scores as a tantalizingly normal enigma but is given precious little to
do.</p>

<p>Jordan seems more focused and content making personal, independent movies like <i>Mona
Lisa</i> (1986), <i>The Miracle</i> (1990), <i>The Crying Game</i> (1992) and <i>The
Butcher Boy</i> than such forced studio hi-jinks as <i>High Spirits</i> (1987), <i>We're
No Angels</i> (1988) and <i>Interview with the Vampire</i> (1994). Even his most
conventional film, the obviously personal but unwieldy <i>Michael Collins</i> (1996),
feels more like an obligation than a labor of love. </p>

<p>The director's excitement in <i>The Butcher Boy</i> and his confidence in the material
is obvious in the audacious tone of the film (co-written with source novelist Patrick
McCabe, seen briefly as the town drunk), which scores Francie's descent to such darkly
comic period songs as Santo &amp; Johnny's version of the Weill-Brecht composition
&quot;Mack the Knife,&quot; Dion &amp; The Belmonts' &quot;No One Knows,&quot; Frank
Sinatra's &quot;Where Are You,&quot; the Kim Fowley-penned rock novelty tune
&quot;Nutrocker&quot; (which plays under a frantic scene where Francie is given
electroshock therapy) and, of course, the title track, a traditional lament sung for the
film by O'Connor.</p>

<p>Tellingly, <i>The Butcher Boy</i> isn't a movie that spends a lot of time pointing
fingers at the causes of Francie's downward spiral. And while there's a complete lack of
social services, neighbor intervention (except when the police are called) or adult
responsibility for Francie's wild child life, Jordan seems more interested in making the
audience complicit with the boy's mental deterioration than with condemning a society or a
time period. Perhaps this is why the low-profile U.S. release of the film is keyed by a
studiously bland poster (a stick-figure with a lit old-time bomb for a head) that is in
direct contrast to the sketched youngster with a pig mask, pointed finger and huge butcher
knife used elsewhere in the world. </p>
<i>

<p>The Butcher Boy</i> succeeds through a spectacular mix of tone, performance and pace;
in the same way Kubrick dares us to feel compassion for Alex, Jordan invites us to witness
the end of a childhood with the same moral confusion and unnamable panic as his deeply
troubled protagonist.</p>
