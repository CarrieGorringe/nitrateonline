Jackie Chan's fourth high-profile stateside release <i>Operation Condor</i> (<i>Armour of
God II: Operation Condor</i>, aka <i>Feiying gaiwak</i>) isn't as threadbare as the
rickety <i>Rumble in the Bronx</i> (<i>Hong Faan Kui</i>), nor as breathtakingly intricate
as the large-scale stuntathon <i>SuperCop</i> (<i>Police Story III: Supercop</i>, aka <i>Jing
cha gu shi III: Chao ji jing cha</i>), nor as overly plotted as the Cold War-ish <i>First
Strike</i> (<i>Police Story IV: First Strike</i> [aka <i>Piece of Cake</i>, aka <i>Story
of the CIA</i>], aka <i>Jing cha gu shi IV: Jian dan ren wu</i>). Rather, this 1990 sequel
to one of his best films and the first of his directorial efforts to get the aural
overhaul and editorial nip-and-tuck takes barely 90 fast minutes to deliver a gag-filled
story of buried Nazi gold that is one part <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i>, one part
MacGuyver and one part Buster Keaton </font><font size="4" face="Symbol">-</font><font size="4"> and all Jackie, which will be more than enough to insure brisk summer box office
and yet another wave of adolescents at martial arts schools around the country.</font></p>

<p>Jackie stars as Jackie (code name: Condor), an adventurer summoned to the American
embassy in Madrid and enlisted to join a United Nations force determined to beat a team of
international terrorists to the 240 tons of gold buried in an underground Nazi command
center somewhere in the Sahara Desert. Along the way he collects Ada (Carol Cheng), his
timid but spunky U.N. boss; Elsa (Eva Cobo de Garcia), the statuesque granddaughter of the
officer who masterminded the stash during World War II; and Momoko (Shoko Ikeda), the
scorpion-toting flower child they pick up on the way to Morocco. Once under the desert the
true antagonist makes his presence known: Adolf (Alfred Brel Sanchez), the wheelchair
bound rogue Nazi who was the only survivor of the regiment that guarded the precious
metal. With the help of his troika of babes and some elementary physics Jackie foils the
plan and kicks the stuffing out of a bunch of largely nameless occidental bad guys (one of
whom, oddly enough, is singled out as &quot;Joe&quot;).</p>

<p><i>Operation Condor</i> can be divided into roughly three sections, each featuring an
action set piece typical of Chan's approach to filmmaking. In the first, presumably filmed
on the backstreets of Madrid, Jackie eludes a phalanx of sinister black
cars&#151;choreographed by Remy Julienne's Group&#151;using only a motorbike and his wits
(even finding time to save an infant from certain death in a bit that even Sergei
Eisenstein would love). These stunts hark back to the superlative 1985 New York Film
Festival entry <i>Police Story</i> (<i>Jackie Chan's Police Force</i>, aka<i> Jingcha
gushi</i>) and 1992's <i>Twin Dragons</i> (<i>Shuang long hui</i>), in which Jackie
pioneered the use of a contemporary urban environment and its accouterments to construct
his split-second stunts. In the second, most satisfying section of the film, Jackie, Ada
and Elsa trade barbs while eluding a series of thugs in the hallways and courtyard of a
labrynthine Moroccan inn. Actually filmed on a huge Hong Kong set at the beginning of
production, the sequence splendidly showcases the mixture of innocuous sexual humor and
intimate, precisely crafted comic stunts that lift Chan's work above run-of-the-mill
martial arts movies. The climactic showdown in the cluttered bunker complex was also
achieved on a Hong Kong set, and represents the kind of full-body fighting (usually
against an industrial backdrop) befitting end-of-movie showdowns. He never met a staircase
or catwalk he couldn't conquer.</p>

<p>As with <i>SuperCop</i>, <i>Operation Condor</i> shows its age. Originally released in
1990 as <i>Armour of God II: Operation Condor</i>, the film features a pre-credit sequence
that not only sets the film squarely in Indiana Jones territory but comments cleverly on a
similar sequence in the original <i>Armour of God</i> (during which Jackie fractured his
skull on a 40-foot drop that went awry). Jackie's longish hair and some cars and machines
also betray the film's vintage.</p>

<p><i>Operation Condor</i> has two major weaknesses, neither fatal but both annoying. The
dubbing is particularly poor (is that Jackie doing Jackie? If so, he needs more work),
with some scenes apparently darkened to mask actor's mouths. And the racial stereotyping,
while admittedly funny in the context of individual gags, is alarmingly blunt for a film
so otherwise appropriate for children. As usual, the women dish it out and take it with a
force unheard of in American films, causing one to again marvel at how some global
filmmaking sensibilities (think Paul Verhoeven and Wolfgang Petersen) are very different
than the usual Hollywood fare. </p>

<p>It isn't difficult to understand Chan's stateside success, only what took him so long.
An affable presence with an astonishing gift for physical comedy and imaginatively staged
action sequences, he's been making successful movies incorporating the rigorous training
in chang chuan-based martial arts (including praying mantis, white eyebrow, karate,
hapkido, kung fu, jeet kune do and boxing) he's learned since a childhood apprenticeship
at mentor Sifu Yu Chan-Yuan's China Drama Academy for almost thirty years. Of course, if
you're a die-hard Jackie fan <font face="Symbol">-</font> and they are legion <font face="Symbol">-</font> you probably know this stuff already and much more. But American
audiences discovering Jackie for the first time are astonished at the sheer physicality of
his movies, and rightly so: the top Asian box office draw for nearly two decades, Chan is
unique in his cheerfully egotistical approach to movie- and myth-making (note to
newcomers: never, ever, leave a Jackie Chan movie until the lights come up, as the closing
credit sequence is always an opportunity to see outtakes featuring stunts gone bad and,
inevitably, Jackie being scraped up of the ground by panicky crew members and carted away,
groggy but thumbs-up). </p>

<p>Jackie Chan appears in the upcoming features <i>An Alan Smithee Film</i> (aka <i>Burn,
Hollywood, Burn</i>) and <i>Rush Hour</i>. American distributors looking for other titles
from the oeuvre to recycle are advised to consider the aforementioned <i>Police Story</i>
and <i>Twin Dragons</i> as well as the magnificent 1987 <i>Project A Part II </i>(<i>A ji
hua xuji</i>), which as an added benefit is a period piece and thus wouldn't look so
jarring to an American public becoming increasingly Jackie-savvy (he directed it, too).
Whichever one is chosen next, let's hope the dubbing is better: &quot;Wasn't there another
way?&quot; someone wails to Jackie about halfway through <i>Operation Condor</i>, to which
he replies &quot;It worked, didn't it?&quot; Maybe so, but that doesn't make it right.</p>
