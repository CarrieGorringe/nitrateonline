<p><big><strong><big>W</big></strong>inner of a clutch of high-profile film festival
awards -- including the top award at Sundance this year and two prizes at Cannes -- <i>Slam</i>
comes to theaters with just about the best pedigree an American independent film can have
in a marketplace currently crowded, if not glutted, with such fare. And in some ways, the
movie delivers: documentarian Marc Levin's dramatic directorial debut is smooth yet
harrowing, and Saul Williams gives a soulful, appealingly mysterious performance in the
lead role. Yet the whole is less than the sum of its parts, as <i>Slam</i> (the
dual-meaning title refers both to jail -- the slammer -- and the loud, fast and intricate
spoken word performances currently the rage in clubs) is too dependent on the kinetic
urban poetry of its protagonist to propel itself over sketchy characters, leaving the
final impression that of an emotional movie-going experience without much core emotion.</big></p>

<p>A low-level weed mule with a true gift for words, the quiet and slightly built Raymond
Joshua (Williams) inevitably ends up in the wrong place at the wrong time. Sent to the
notorious Washington, D.C. jail after being arrested for marijuana possession at the scene
of a shooting in the Southeast section of the city, he survives through an uneasy alliance
with philosophical faction leader Hopha (rapper Bonz Malone) and his own innate ability.
Ray also catches the attention of poetry teacher Lauren Bell (poet Sonja Sohn), and when
he is released they begin a tentative relationship that results in Ray giving a triumphant
reading of his work at a poetry slam in a club along the newly-revitalized U Street
corridor in Northwest D.C.</p>

<p>Like the unique view of the Washington skyline from the roof of the D.C. Jail it
affords, <i>Slam</i> feels both new and authentic, a sensation heightened by the knowledge
that many of the inmates and guards played themselves in the film (Levin has confessed
that the story was originally conceived with New York's Riker's Island in mind -- a
location which would, at the very least, have provided a more racially diverse mix than
the almost entirely black faces here, and thus modified the focus of the entire story).
These scenes are the best in the film, with the explosive menace of the lockup defused by
Ray's bravura, impromptu performance of a poem he's seen writing on a legal pad as prison
life swirls around him. Unfortunately, the movie loses much of its focus and propulsion
when Ray is released, as his relationship with Lauren quickly devolves into petty
squabbling that results in a dreadfully overlong and seemingly improvised sequence of
emotion and recrimination in an alley (their confrontation is even interrupted at one
point by a bicyclist who pedals nonchalantly between them). Scenes fleshing out their
stormy courtship are desperately needed, as is connective tissue linking Ray's talent with
his effect on the warring factions around him.</p>

<p>Williams brings a vulnerable passivity to Ray that helps an audience navigate the
menacing surroundings, while Sohn is fierce as Lauren and Malone distinctive as the shrewd
Hopha. Recording artist Beau Sia has a cryptic but memorable cameo early on as an enraged
Asian chained alongside Ray in a prison bus. The presence of soon-to-be-ex-Mayor Marion S.
Barry, Jr. as the judge who sentences Ray (&quot;these drugs are just killing our
community,&quot; he preaches with a straight face) is both inspired and annoying,
especially for moviegoers who've endured his exasperating, event-filled reign in city
politics. </p>

<p>Technically, the film benefits immensely from the fluid, nervous camerawork of Marc
Benjamin and a kinetic score by DJ Spooky (Paul Miller).</p>

<p>With one wire service writer speculating on Williams' long-shot Oscar nomination for
best actor <i>Slam</i> is clearly touching a nerve as stimulating, even thrilling,
you-are-there cinema. But in gambling on the mythic elements of the lead character at the
expense of dramatic structure, <i>Slam</i> ends up being less about social injustice than
a rare textbook case of a movie that cries out to be about 30 minutes longer.</p>
