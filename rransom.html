<p><font size="5" face="Times,Times New Roman"><strong>I</strong></font><font size="4" face="Times,Times New Roman">t is every parent's worst nightmare, especially in these
unstable times: a child is kidnapped, and the parents are helpless to influence the
outcome of the crisis, swept up with police and FBI agents and the media and fearful that
anything they do will trigger the unstable kidnapper (kidnappers?) to harm the youngster.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">This, essentially, is the story told by the new
big-budget entertainment <i>Ransom</i>. And if the primary function of entertainment is
distraction, then it is a real corker, the kind of movie that the most demanding moviegoer
can patronize without fear of disappointment (at least until well after the screening,
when certain implausibilities might present themselves). But, Hollywood being Hollywood,
and the nineties being the nineties, the film is at once about much less and much more
than a kidnapping. For instance, the movie isn't about the toll of this traumatic event on
the child, but the process by which the protagonist and the antagonist match wits (and,
ultimately, face off). Nor is it about exhaustive police work or skillful negotiation or
the triumph of good over evil -- the scheme is eventually undone as much as anything else
by luck (good or bad, depending on your point of view). What <i>Ransom</i> seems to be
very much about is individual empowerment, about taking something essentially
uncontrollable and, by force of will, available resources and a large dollop of good
fortune, controlling it. While moving away from Rambo-like heroes, Hollywood still wants
to make -- and Americans still want to see -- movies about take-charge guys solving knotty
problems. In much the same way that poverty-stricken audiences of the Great Depression
responded to William Powell solving absurd mysteries in a tuxedo and clamored for similar
escapist fare in uncertain times, nervous moviegoers in the nineties like nothing better
than Mel Gibson turning the tables on lowlife scum and beating back the forces of wanton
evil that terrorize his perfect family. That the average American might not have the same
will, resources or luck as Gibson's dogged, crusading, ruthless but aw-shucks likable
airline magnate proves that in Hollywood escapism is still king -- and is precisely the
reason <i>Ransom</i> has become the first big hit of the 1996 holiday season.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Perched high above Central Park, Tom and Kate Mullen
(Gibson and his <i>Lethal Weapon 3</i> costar Rene Russo) appear to have it all. Tom is
rolling out a new ad campaign for the airline he built from scratch, and Kate is active in
New York fundraising. Their inquisitive, bright 9-year-old Sean (Brawley Nolte, very much
his father Nick in fine miniature) completes the picture-perfect family, swaddled in
luxury and privilege. During a fundraising event in Central Park, Sean is kidnapped (in a
sequence made all the more creepy by its matter-of-fact normality gone very wrong) and the
inevitable ransom demands begin. But Tom, a take-charge kind of guy, is uncomfortable
taking orders from a disembodied (and electronically altered) voice, and he is soon
clashing with FBI agent Hawkins (Delroy Lindo, so good in <a href="rgetshrt.html" target="_top"><i>Get
Shorty</i></a>) over how to proceed. Further gumming up the works is nervous cop Jimmy
Shaker (Gary Sinise), whose interference sends the investigation on an unexpected course.
When one ransom exchange goes awry, Mullen takes matters into his own hands and, rejecting
the counsel of his wife and the police, announces on network television that the two
million dollars cash set aside for the kidnappers is now a bounty on their heads -- thus
virtually daring them to kill the child.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Make no mistake about it, <i>Ransom</i> is a
clockwork entertainment that represents the very best craftsmanship and acting that
Hollywood has to offer. And, on a visceral level, the movie delivers dependably and
regularly. You'll be charmed by Sean's kite-flying absorption, traumatized by the cruelty
of the kidnappers, nervous but progressively emboldened by Tom's self-confident arrogance,
and relieved at the film's inevitable outcome. But <i>Ransom</i> is also the kind of movie
that will have you thinking, two blocks away from the theater, &quot;how could Shaker get
so much time off of work?&quot; or &quot;even if he does have a friend at the TV station
how could Tom pull off an instant broadcast to the bad guys?&quot; or &quot;will Rene
Russo's character have anything to do?&quot; or &quot;won't the kid be in therapy
forever?&quot; or &quot;how could a movie this suspenseful squander the formidable talents
of Lili Taylor?&quot; (whose increasingly desperate felon never approaches the sinister
twists she's brought to such independent works as <i>The Addiction</i> and <i>I Shot Andy
Warhol</i>).</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">The answer to these questions can be found in part
in the genesis of the script. Based on a 1956 film starring starring Glenn Ford and Donna
Reed -- itself adapted from a television play -- the movie's basic good-guys/bad-guys
structure must have cried out for updating. This was apparently done by committee, as the
original draft by the tremendously gifted Richard Price (<i>The Color of Money</i>, <i>Sea
of Love</i>) was significantly altered by director Ron Howard, who though long and hard
before finally filming scenes of Sean in captivity, and Gibson, whose idea of having Tom
perform intricate tasks while delivering a ransom payment (including an unexpected dip to
foul bugging devices) gives the movie a significant amount of action. It is only in the
midst of the prolonged third act, when Mullen's efforts to free his boy are superseded by
internal squabbling among the kidnappers and a certain indecisiveness seems to
subsequently seize the filmmakers, that the velocity decreases significantly. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">By then most audiences are in the film's sway, and <i>Ransom</i>'s
pleasures are persuasive indeed. Howard's mission, as in the acclaimed <i>Apollo 13</i>,
was to take a familiar story and make it fresh, unexpected and visually exciting. If some
of his previous work has been laboring in the fields of Capricorn (<i>Splash</i>, <i>Far
and Away</i>, <i>The Paper</i>), these two films mark a new mood and texture that is
encouraging. He's a more than capable filmmaker, and his films beguile audiences by
presenting actors and actresses who seem to be having the time of their lives living out
the drama (the typical presskit for a Ron Howard movie seems to make a point to explain
what fun everyone had making the movie). In this way his work is coming to resemble that
of his favorite filmmaker, Billy Wilder, who could take dark material in wildly disparate
genres (<i>Double Indemnity</i>, <i>Sunset Boulevard</i>, <i>Kiss Me Stupid</i>) and make
it funny and appealing to the masses. <i>Ransom</i> is at once his most accomplished and
most manipulative film.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Contributing greatly to the film's success is the
work of cinematographer Piotr Sobocinski, who brings the same cold elegance to New York
City that he brought to the sublime visual metaphors of Krysztof Kieslowski's <i>Red</i>.
And prolific composer James Horner, whose thrilling work includes scores for <i>Gorky Park</i>,
<i>Aliens</i>, <i>Field of Dreams</i> and <i>Patriot Games</i> once again provides an
aural atmosphere of white-knuckle tension essential to the moviegoing experience.</font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Of the leads, perhaps Sinise is the finest blend of
daring performer and cryptic character. An extremely un-Hollywood-y type who nevertheless
seems to be becoming a major star, Sinise has much of the edgy appeal that made the work
of John Malkovich (a fellow Chicago stage actor) so promising. Sinise has aligned himself
with more mainstream material, which if anything brings the tension inherent in his shifty
gaze to the fore. Is he good or bad? And if he's bad, why is he so difficult to dislike?
The role of Jimmy Shaker may be underwritten (his motivation is never explained to
satisfaction, and the final confrontation flies in the face of all previous logic), but
Sinise nevertheless finds ticks and traits to flesh out the performance. Taciturn in
interviews, his work speaks volumes about commitment to craft and the art of acting the
unexpected. </font></p>

<p><font face="Times,Times New Roman">Caught now in a Hollywood that wants to titillate
without offending, <i>Ransom</i> is a movie of skillful compromise that takes a harrowing
personal tragedy and makes of it a populist hit. By becoming a box office success, it
reaffirms not only the power of a well-told tale to gloss over dramatic deficiencies, but
the willingness of a contemporary audience to be seduced by a film that offers conflict
resolution through grandstanding tactics and happy endings without substantial emotional
investment. </font></p>
