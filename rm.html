<p>Sound like last night's news broadcast? It is also the plot of the 1931 German
production <i>M</i>, director Fritz Lang's first sound film, his final movie in the by
then increasingly unstable Germany between the world wars, and a showcase for the breakout
performance of Peter Lorre as the bug-eyed serial killer Hans Beckert. In addition to
presenting a chilling story in a style that seems utterly contemporary some 66 years after
it was produced, this painstaking restoration by the Munich Film Archive reveals a film
that stands as a virtual primer on the subtle uses of sound and silence to create tension,
as well as perhaps the most fully realized example of the mature Expressionist filmmaking
that was soon to come to a crashing halt as Hitler's ascension to power in 1933 promptly
and effectively killed the thriving and exciting German film industry (Lang and Lorre both
left that year). Historical value aside, <i>M</i> is also an absorbing and terrifying tale
of methodical madness and vividly exacted vengeance. </p>

<p>As the film opens Berlin is already paralyzed with fear over a series of abductions and
murders of young girls. In a slow, anguished sequence of disquieting power, young Elsie
Beckmann (Inge Landgut) is befriended and killed by a shadowy figure in fedora and topcoat
who casually whistles the troll dance theme from Grieg's Peer Gynt as he buys the child
sweets and a toy balloon. Throughout her mother is glimpsed preparing a lunch that the
girl will never eat and fretting over her tardiness.</p>

<p>The police mobilize under the direction of Inspector Lohmann (Otto Wernicke), but for
reasons both moral and fiscal the criminal underworld is equally revulsed by the killing
spree (&quot;it's bad for business,&quot; someone points out) and organize their own
dragnet spearheaded by the sinister, leather-swathed Schranker (Gustaf Gründgens). As the
authorities earnestly but ineffectually round up the usual suspects, the thieves'
grapevine disrupts Beckert's newest assignation and traps him in a block of offices. In a
daring raid of precision and urgency (the police are closing in), the mobsters nearly
destroy parts of the building to unearth the craven Beckert, who is promptly condemned to
die by a subterranean tribunal before being &quot;rescued&quot; by the authorities. At the
fade, a trio of women in mourning beseech unseen witnesses to &quot;keep an even better
eye on the children. That's up to you too. That's up to you too.&quot;</p>

<p>Fritz Lang (real name: Friedrich Christian Anton Lang) was born the son of an architect
in Vienna, and his prolific career as a film director in Germany, France (briefly) and
Hollywood includes <i>Destiny </i>(1921), <i>Dr. Mabuse the Gambler</i> (1922), <i>Metropolis</i>
(1926), <i>Fury</i> (1936), <i>The Woman in the Window</i> and <i>The Ministry of Fear</i>
(both 1944), and <i>The Big Heat</i> (1953). His oeuvre reflects a meticulousness and
austerity born of an inclination to design as well as the bleak ideology of Expressionism
(he apparently disliked this pigeonholing, although he played Death in the film adaptation
of his first screenplay in 1917). <i>M</i> is full of men consulting blueprints, maps and
diagrams, and the precise and inevitable sequence that climaxes in the capture of Beckert
in the attic storeroom is as clear and steady as a metronome <font face="Times New Roman Special G1">&#150;</font> just as gripping today as it must have
been in 1931. Elsewhere, his almost playful use of the medium speaks to his authority as a
filmmaker: the separate summit meetings of the police and thieves are intercut with
dazzling seamlessness, his overhead shots of children at play and police at work are
stunningly realized as pictures and social commentary (the kids are about as productive as
the cops), and the blocking of actors and sublime camerawork (by <i>Nosferatu</i>
cinematographer Fritz Arno Wagner) are epitomized in a separate scenes where Inspector
Lohmann makes the connection between the killer and a brand of cigarette, and the
simultaneously hideous and very funny interrogation of a watchman in the office complex.</p>

<p>Yet it is the use and balance of contrapuntal sound and extended, hypernatural
sequences of complete silence that are perhaps the most memorable and groundbreaking
achievements of <i>M</i>. The early scenes, as Elsie Beckmann's weary mother chides the
children for their repetition of a grisly rhyme inspired by the killer and later calls out
her mournful &quot;Elllsssiiieee!&quot; as the girl is being murdered in the bushes, sets
a tone of sinister dread that is only intensified as the police noisily round up the
recidivous patrons of the underworld hangout Crocodile Club and the surrounding streets
and alleys in a totally silent ballet of track and capture that ironically points up their
inability to similarly apprehend Beckert. Offscreen sound effects and snippets of dialogue
add to a pervading sense of uncertainty. And, in a satisfying twist, the killer is
identified by a blind street vendor, who recognizes the distinctive whistle.</p>

<p>Lang's formalist approach to filmmaking remains startlingly fresh today, and his other
films are worth seeking out on video (that's also Lang himself as the film director in
Godard's <i>Contempt</i>, now in regional re-release). </p>

<p>Moviegoers familiar with Hungarian-born character actor Peter Lorre (born Ladislav
Löwenstein) only from his oily turns in <i>The Maltese Falcon</i> and <i>Casablanca</i>,
or those jokey Edgar Allan Poe films he costarred in with Vincent Price for Roger Corman (<i>The
Raven</i>, anyone?) will find his performance as the porcine pedophile Beckert a major
revelation. At once completely believable but pathetically cartoonish, Lorre's virtually
silent but expressive performance (Lang did the whistle himself, as Lorre never learned
how) culminates in his babbling &quot;confession.&quot; &quot;Ghosts pursue me: ghosts of
mothers, ghosts of daughters...&quot; he screams, &quot;I can't control this evil thing
inside me ... I can't help what I do...&quot; This sequence remains one of the most
chilling scenes in movie history, and rightly so. </p>

<p>Originally called <i>Murderer Among Us</i> but shortened to the M scrawled in chalk on
Beckert's coat by a young thief when key Nazi Party members complained (legend has it they
thought it referred to them), the story is based on one Peter Kurten, who murdered nine
people (mostly young women but including one child) over a period of about 15 years in and
around Düsseldorf. Identified by a surviving victim when he revisited a crime scene, the
psychopath was beheaded the same year the film was released, claiming just before the
blade fell that he'd have the thrill of hearing his own head drop into the basket. </p>

<p>The restoration of <em>M</em> presented archivists with challenges not normally
associated with the salvage of deteriorated prints or missing scenes. Over the years,
sound effects had actually been added to silent sequences, and lines of dialogue had been
subtly modified to reinforce the authority of the police. In returning <i>M</i> to the
version Lang made, the Munich Film Archive has corrected these and other changes with an
addition of roughly seven minutes of previously deleted and/or alternate footage including
the original title card, a café scene, the final trial (including the cautionary lines
from the grieving women), and bits and pieces that were shaved from existing scenes.</p>

<p><i>M</i> is essential viewing for those interested in the early development of sound,
the lineage of genre filmmaking (Beckert is the grisly inspiration for every Leatherface
and Hannibal Lecter clone world cinema has ever conjured) and Lang's own substantial but
often overlooked contributions to the art of cinema. Long before the emphasis on
sophisticated soundscapes currently so popular in mainstream Hollywood (and the
factory-like multiplexes that show them), Lang discovered that a movie's atmosphere could
be achieved by subtle discordance, and few films since have achieved the seamless blending
of sound and image that is a hallmark of Lang's great and enduring work. <a href="rseven.html" target="_top"><i>Seven</i></a> should play so well in 2062. </p>

<p><i>M</i> may be seen currently or soon in Los Angeles, San Francisco, Seattle (an
encore run), Atlanta, Pittsburgh, Berkeley, San Diego, Minneapolis, Cleveland, Detroit,
Ann Arbor, Providence, Santa Cruz, Hartford, Austin, Durham and Williamsburg. Check your
local listings or call your favorite regional art house for further information. </p>
