<p><big><strong><big>T</big></strong>his Belgian feature from first-time director Alain
Berliner has been garnering good reviews since its year-end release in selected U.S.

Life in Pink</em>) has won acclaim and attention at numerous film festivals, including
Cannes, Karlovy Vary, New York, and Sarajevo. Although it won the Golden Globe for Best
Foreign Language Film, it didn't make the final cut for this year's Oscar contenders,

than $750,000 domestically to date, this will not rival <a href="ftitanic.html" target="_top"><em>Titanic</em></a>,
but it would be a shame if this film sank before the movie-going public tired of that
Queen of the Sea and had a chance to savor this Queen of the ABCs.</big></p>

<p>Seven-year-old Ludovic (played with an amazing down-to-earth casualness by newcomer
Georges du Fresne) comes out of the doll closet and decides that he no longer cares to be
a boy. It's not that he considers himself gay, in fact he can not even grasp that concept
at his tender age. It's just that he believes himself destined to be a girl, grow into a
woman, and marry schoolmate and neighbor Jerome, just as tomorrow will follow today. When
it's show-and-tell at school, he doesn't bring a hand-held electronic game like his fellow
students, but proudly displays Pam and Ben, two overdressed Barbie-and-Ken look-a-likes.
Ludovic's innocence makes this and other scenes in this amusing and poignant drama soar.
His singular and often surreal grasp of reality force his family and surrounding suburban
community to deal with the situation in painful and often comic misunderstanding. Set
against a pastel housing scheme designed with bright pinks and sparkling yellows, the film
often flutters off into dream sequences where Ludovic plays out his fantasies with a
magical life-size Pam (the star of a widely popular girls&#146; television program), who,
along with Ludovic's grandmother, are the only people who truly give the child the
sympathy he desires from everyone else.</p>

<p>Says Berliner, &quot;The movies often treat sexual identity as comedy material. With <i>Ma
Vie en Rose</i>, I wanted the child's innocence and his amazing certainty to make his
questions touch our hearts and allow us to understand them. There is a lot to laugh about
in the film, but there is also a good dose of drama.&quot; Indeed the script, which
Berliner co-wrote with Chris van der Stappen, is an affectionate twist on the Job story,
sprinkled with drops of comedy.</p>

<p>The situation escalates quickly as Ludovic dresses up in the clothes of Jerome's dead
sister as he and Jerome pretend to wed. Ludovic's mother and father (finely etched by
Michele Laroque and Jean-Philippe Ecoffey), and his siblings run hot-and-cold in trying to
understand the child's motives. It doesn't help that Jerome's father is Ludovic's father's
boss and both families car-pool their children to school. As tempers flare throughout the
neighborhood, Ludovic's family is ostracized by their friends, the boy is expelled from
school, and the father is fired. Just as the family feels Ludovic may be heading back to
their fold, he does something that sends them farther off the edge. Counseling from a
therapist goes nowhere, and when Ludovic&#146;s older sister tells him about X and Y
chromosomes, the boy fantasizes a hilarious sequence where toy block letters fall from the
sky and those which would have made him a woman accidentally end up in a trash can.</p>

<p>Forced to flee their home, the family hopes Ludovic&#146;s new surroundings may alter
his odd behavior. And it seemingly does until he meets Chris, er, Christine, another child
who can not rationalize her sexuality. The film culminates with another brightly colored
moment in Pam's dreamy doll house, just the right recipe to leave a smile on your face.
All may finally be well in Ludovic&#146;s off-kilter world.</p>
