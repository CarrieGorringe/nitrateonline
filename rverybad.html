<p><big><big><strong>B</strong></big>odies are meat in Peter Berg&#146;s <i>Very Bad
Things</i>. Practically everyone becomes a potential corpse, and unlucky ones wind up
sliced, diced, and otherwise dissected into easy to handle pieces. It&#146;s surprising
that a film with so much blood and bone contains so little gristle. People do very bad
things in <i>Very Bad Things</i>, but in a black comedy it isn&#146;t so much what you do
as how you do it, and Berg hasn&#146;t the gallows humor to turn this excursion into bad
taste from a sick idea to the despicably funny film it should be.</big></p>

<p>The premise is your basic urban legend middle class nightmare: five guys let loose in a
wild drug and alcohol fueled Las Vegas bachelor party, complete with a sexy stripper
who&#146;s willing to do a little business on the side. <i>The Rat Pack</i> they
ain&#146;t, but groom-to-be Kyle (<a href="rswingers.html" target="_top"><i>Swingers</i></a> star and
scribe Jon Favreau -- fittingly back in &#145;Vegas, baby!&#146;) enjoys the madness of
his friends around him, a last fling into debauchery with his best buddies before entering
the world of matrimonial bliss, but his pals get a little too into it. You know what they
say, it&#146;s all fun and games until someone kills a hooker. It&#146;s an accident,
sure, but how do you explain that one to the wife, let alone the cops?</p>

<p><img src="images/rverybad-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="100" HEIGHT="150">Bad boy Boyd
(Christian Slater, continuing the channel his devilish Jack Nicholson alter ego)
immediately takes control like a twisted self-help guru (&quot;Let me be your success
coach,&quot; he raves with practiced sincerity), outlining a plan to get the body out of
the room and into the ground in the desert. No one knows she&#146;s here, no one&#146;s
going to miss her, and what do they need with a criminal record? His terrified pals, too
scared to face the music and reveal their deed, numbly go along. But nothing goes quote as
planned and soon Boyd has murdered a witness and jumped into plan B, which involves an
electric saw, yards of plastic wrap, and plenty of industrial strength cleaner. They get
out of Vegas with only two corpses in their wake, but the body count continues to
escalates once back in Los Angeles and Boyd rises to the occasion with glee. He&#146;s a
born psychopath who seems to have been waiting all his life for this opportunity to strut
his homicidal stuff. </p>

<p>In addition to Slater (who also executive produced), Cameron Diaz is on hand as
Kyle&#146;s bride Laura, a controlling, passive-aggressive woman who drops the passive
hyphenate about halfway through the film. Like Boyd, she&#146;s not about to let morality
get in the way of her life, and as her friends die around her like flies in a bug zapper
all she can focus on is how this will affect her planned-to-the-second wedding. Diaz is
the best thing about the film, turning from screaming harpy to radiant bride to
Machiavellian plotter whose ruthlessness puts Boyd to shame with terrifying ease, all in
the space of a few minutes.</p>

<p><img src="images/rverybad-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="106" HEIGHT="150">It takes over half
the film to get back to Laura. In the meantime the film has bogged down into a series of
screaming matches and near fist-fights between the pals, all suffering through their own
private hells of guilt and fear. Daniel Stern&#146;s Adam, a husband and father most
troubled by the ordeal (he sees a cop lurking around every corner), turns into a paranoid
wreck and focuses much of his wrath at his younger brother Michael (Jeremy Piven, <a href="rgpblank.html" target="_top"><i>Grosse Pointe Blank</i></a>), an escalation of their constant
bickering that culminates in a fatal run-in. Moore (Leland Orser, <a href="ralien.html" target="_top"><i>Alien
Resurrection</i></a>) remains silent but his tension surfaces in a constant look of
constipation on his face. Meanwhile Adam&#146;s sharp wife Lois (Jeanne Tripplehorn, <a href="rwaterwrld.html" target="_top"><i>Waterworld</i></a>) suspects something is going on and starts
grilling the boys, but Kyle comes to the rescue with a story that plunges her into
depression and Boyd embellishes the tale with the glee of a little kid pulling the wings
off of flies. </p>

<p>The big problem is that Berg&#146;s cleverness stops at the plot: the dialogue is
simply flat and his direction is flashy but lacks bite. Slater&#146;s rousing speeches are
all delivery, twisting his moral bankrupt philosophy into an enticing get of jail free
card. But there&#146;s none of that winking, self-effacing verbiage that keeps the movie
moving from one violent twist to the other. It&#146;s as if Berg wants to play the film
straight while the events leap into absurdity, but it leaves the ideas more interesting
than the delivery. </p>
<i>

<p>Very Bad Things </i>likely read better as a screenplay than it plays on film because
the idea of what&#146;s going on is funnier than the actual execution. In the conclusion
Berg finally hits that completely over-the-top bad taste bonanza that the film has been
working up to, where everyone -- and I mean everyone -- gets their cosmic justice and Berg
finally let&#146;s his sniggering little digs at the handicapped kid blossoms into a truly
tasteless foray into gimp humor. But it&#146;s far too late. The presence of Slater and
Diaz ultimately do the film almost as much harm as good in one respect: they remind us
that the films that made their names (<i>Heathers</i> and <i>There&#146;s Something About
Mary</i>, respectively) delivered dark satire better than Peter Berg&#146;s well meaning
but wanting effort.</p>
