Following an explosive start, there is merely not ample comedy (sight-gags and non-sequiturs inclusive) to sustain this gangster comedy that boastfully borrows deeply from the storylines of Godfather (1972) and its 1974 sequel Godfather Part 2, but also appropriates characters, plots, or whatever from Jaws, E.T., Casino, Il Postino, Forrest Gump, and The Full Monty, just to name a few.

<p>The current crop of television ads ask &quot;If you have an hour and half to kill&quot;
you should spend it watching <i>Mafia!</i>,<b> </b>the latest send-up of just about every
movie on earth (well it just seems that way) from Jim Abrahams, one of the creators (with
David and Jerry Zucker) of <i>Airplane!</i>, certifiably one of the funniest spoofs ever
filmed. Actually, I&#146;d re-phrase the viewing time needed downward to maybe a
half-hour, as there are enough yuks to fill up a funny short subject, which jives
time-length-wise with the short-lived but hilarious 1982 <i>Police Squad</i> television
episodes made by Messers Zucker, Abrahams, and Zucker. Following an explosive start, there
is merely not ample comedy (sight-gags and non-sequiturs inclusive) to sustain this
gangster comedy that boastfully borrows deeply from the storylines of <i>Godfather</i>
(1972) and its 1974 sequel <i>Godfather Part 2</i>, but also appropriates characters,
plots, or whatever from <i>Jaws</i>,<i> E.T.</i>, <a href="rcasino.html" target="_top"><i>Casino</i></a>,
<i>Il Postino</i>, <i>Forrest Gump</i>, and <a href="fsiff97-2.html#The_Full_Monty" target="_top"><i>The
Full Monty</i></a>, just to name a few. I suspect the official website is running a
&quot;Where&#146;s Waldo&quot; contest (grand prize: a hearse-borne trip to Las Vegas) to
guess how many movies the writers (Abrahams and collaborators Greg Norberg and Michael
McManus, cohorts with the director on <i>Hot Shots! Part Deux</i>) hid in the script.</p>

<p></font><font face="Times,Times New Roman" size="3">The late Lloyd Bridges, a veteran of
<i>Airplane!</i> and the two <i>Hot Shots!</i> films, bumbles around as clueless
Brandoesque godfather klutz Vincenzo Cortino to a family of criminal (or criminally
insane) misfits. It&#146;s appropriate that his last film is an Abrahams production, as
the actor&#146;s lengthy career was rejuvenated by his appearance as McCroskey in the
director&#146;s airport/airplane disaster spoof. Regrettably, the venerable Bridges
doesn&#146;t give off much of the energy that highlighted his extraordinary comic (and
dramatic) career.</p>

<p><img src="images/rmafia-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">Jay Mohr, also
currently on screen in <a href="rssoldiers.html" target="_top"><i>Small Soldiers</i></a>, has been
turning up the heat on his career since his two-year stint on <i>Saturday Night Live</i>
in the mid 1990s and a small but significant role in <a href="rjmaguire.html" target="_top"><i>Jerry
Maguire</i></a> as the eponymous character&#146;s callous agent friend/foe. As the Al
Pacino/Robert De Niro &quot;straight&quot; man here (Vincenzo&#146;s son Anthony) he
isn&#146;t strong enough to carry the film, particularly in its weaker moments, although
his voice is pleasant, providing the narrative voice-overs as he did in <i>Paulie</i>. His
love interest is played Christina Applegate, who drifts in and out of the picture as the
brainless Diane, who, of course, by film&#146;s end, is playing the President of the
United States. She does have one preciously funny scene (it&#146;s in the trailer), when
Anthony confronts her with a small child also named Diane. &quot;You mean I&#146;m a
mother!&quot; she exclaims in deadpan Jennifer Anniston style.</p>

<p>Rounding out the leads are Olympia Dukakis (I just caught a glimpse of her in the film.
Sorry, I blinked.) and Billy Burke as Anthony&#146;s psychotic brother Joey, who gets one
of the film&#146;s better laughs with an anatomical wonder that provides the perfect perch
for a stray bird. Put that on your resume, eh?</p>

<p>The grunt factor, whereby my wife audibly groans under observation of bodily
dismemberment, excessive barfing, or other testosterone-induced conditions, was high. One
particular episode involves the young Vincenzo (Jason Fuchs), on the run from gangsters in
Italy. The director/writers get extremely anal retentive in a gag embracing the child and
a donkey, just before the boy heads for America behind (yes, behind) the good ship <i>Il
Pacino</i>. Even I grunted. That&#146;s not a good sign, even if the film is a parody.
Disney&#146;s Touchstone Pictures is releasing and while the film won&#146;t tap into the
crowd heading for <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>, it is up against probable strong second
weekends for <a href="rzorro.html" target="_top"><i>The Mask of Zorro</i></a> and <i>There&#146;s
Something About Mary</i>.</p>

<p><img src="images/rmafia-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">You&#146;ll notice I
haven&#146;t diverted into the storyline yet. And I won&#146;t. There are confusing
flashbacks to turn-of-the-century Sicily (a quaint village named Salmonella, &quot;Home of
Warm Mayonnaise&quot;), amber-lit tenement life in New York City during the 1930s
(peddlers selling used meat, dirty hats, and pre-squeezed olives dot the streets), and
1967 (and beyond) Las Vegas, where nitwit bettors lose at Guess the Number and Chutes and
Ladders, while others &#150; &quot;the smart ones&quot; &#150; just mail in their money.
The story isn&#146;t important here. Goodfellas &#150; especially some of their nicknames,
America&#146;s obsession with gambling, cholesterol-rich Italian pasta feasts, and
immigrants are just some of the icons that are disfigured.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#146;m being too hard on <i>Jane Austen&#146;s Mafia!</i> (it&#146;s screen
title), but the jokes expire long before the film does as the various mob families,
including the Jeffersons, and the ruling dons (as in Don Cornelius, Don Quixote) sort
things out. Even Barney gets harpooned ... literally. As in previous films of this ilk, be
sure to stay through the credits for some extra nonsense, if you make it to the theater at
all.</font></p>
