<p><big>The Sweet Hereafter</i> is the kind of movie you hold your breath through,
probably without even knowing it. A fragile calibration of subjects not usually found in
commercial cinema &#150; death, grief, blame, and the hideously cheapened concept of
emotional closure chief amongst them &#150; the film nevertheless offers inspiration and
hope in the form of a dogged emotional durability that achieves a certain grace in the
midst of despair. Like <a href="rbwaves.html" target="_top"><i>Breaking the Waves</i></a> before it,
this movie-going experience is an elliptical, often arduous journey to a familiar yet
utterly alien place that leads to a deeper understanding of not only the characters in the
drama, but fundamental principles of life itself. How many movies can offer something like
this &#150; or even want to?</big></p>

<p>Slick but pensive lawyer Mitchell Stephens (Ian Holm) has traveled to the remote,
frozen village of Sam Dent, British Columbia on a sad but potentially lucrative mission.
For no apparent reason, a school bus has crashed into a frozen lake, abruptly snuffing out
the lives of fourteen children and injuring others. Intending to stitch a coalition of
grieving townspeople together to mount a class-action lawsuit (&quot;I need sensitive,
loving parents with no criminal background,&quot; he explains), he travels from family to
family conducting interviews that strike an odd balance between crass background check and
awkward therapy session, with some lawyerly cheerleading thrown in for motivation
(&quot;There's no such thing as an accident,&quot; he tells one grieving couple in perhaps
the film's most multi-layered, pivotal scene. &quot;I want to give your anger a
voice.&quot;).</p>

<p>As he gathers information, he struggles with his own demons, as estranged daughter Zoe
(Caerthan Banks, daughter of source novelist Russell Banks) calls him regularly on his
cell phone to demand money &#150; presumably to feed a monstrous drub habit that has
haunted her for years. In one strand of the film's complex, time-shifting structure, Holm
relates her torturous downward spiral and his own attempts at intervention to Zoe's
childhood friend Alison (Stephanie Morgenstern) as the two share an airline flight.</p>

<p>In time, he meets those people in Sam Dent whose lives have been most severely affected
by the crash. There's veteran bus driver Dolores Driscoll (Egoyan regular Gabrielle Rose),
the dependable, solid soul who cares for her husband Abbott (David Hemblen, another member
of Egoyan's unofficial stock company), the victim of a stroke, and keeps photos of her
charges on the wall of her living room; grief-stricken parents Otto (Earl Pastko) and
Wanda (Arsinée Khanjian, director Atom Egoyan's wife and frequent collaborator); Wendell
and Risa Walker (busy character actor Maury Chaykin and <i>Spanking the Monkey</i> star
Alberta Watson), owners of the Bide-a-Wile motel and parents of an emotionally challenged
boy killed in the crash; and Billy Ansell (Bruce Greenwood, star of Egoyan's previous film
<i>Exotica</i>), a strong but mournful widower whose two children also perished. His
search for the perfect litigants leads him to The Burnells, Sam (Tom McCamus, <i>I Love a
Man in Uniform</i>) and Mary (Brooke Johnson), whose daughter Nicole (Sarah Polley, <i>Exotica</i>,
&quot;The Road to Avonlea&quot;), a promising singer, survived the accident but is now
confined to a wheelchair.</p>

<p>The closer he gets to the pivotal legal action, the more he &#150; or, more precisely,
the vague but passionate promise of retribution his professional energies seem to offer
&#150; disturbs the fragile surface of the town and the covertly intertwined lives of it's
people. It falls to Sarah, in a brave, impulsive act, to derail the lawsuit and begin her
own &#150; and the community&#146;s &#150; slow process of healing. </p>

<p>Without violating the carefully crafted environment of the novel (told in the first
person, with a selection of characters narrating each chapter), Egoyan (<i>Exotica</i>, <i>The
Adjuster</i>) has subtly enhanced the story to embrace a broad range of symbols and
references.</p>

<p>&quot;I'd never read any of Russell Banks' books before,&quot; the director explained,
&quot;It was a revelation, there's this beautiful balance between the mundane and the
ordinary on one hand, and the most extreme situations people can find themselves in on the
other. The book catapults us into a simple world that has to deal with fundamental moral
issues.&quot;</p>

<p>To that end, Egoyan's shrewd, sensitive eye and compassionate feel for the rhythms and
whispers of small town life yield numerous dramatic and visual and surprises at once
delightful and thought-provoking. Nicole's reading of Robert Browing's &quot;The Pied
Piper of Hamelin&quot; to Billy's children in an ongoing flashback that provides the
film's downbeat coda is a sad commentary on the town's unfolding drama, pointing as it
does to &quot;a joyous land, where waters gushed and fruit-trees grew, and flowers put
forth a fairer hue, and everything was strange and new.&quot; Yet, as in the poem, the
journey to that &quot;sweet hereafter&quot; is fraught with perils known and unknown.</p>

<p>Visually, the film offers its own subtle rewards (it was photographed by Paul Sarossy,
who has shot three other films and is the D.P. of this year's other Banks adaptation, Paul
Schrader's <i>Affliction</i>). Stephens is a man struggling to break out of inflexible
coverings, from the car wash he's stuck in as the film opens to the headphones he fights
with on the airplane (one clever flourish even matches the cerulean blue of his dress
shirt to a tea cozy in Dolores' kitchen).</p>

<p>As gifted as Egoyan's repertory company is, and as artfully crafted is the script with
which they have to work and the visual motifs within it, The Sweet Hereafter succeeds or
fails on the casting of Mitchell Stephens. He's &quot;a very complicated character because
he's so self-aware and yet so screwed up&quot; Egoyan asserted. &quot;He has a
chameleon-like ability to adapt himself to the specific needs of those grieving parents,
and yet he is completely incapable of addressing his own responsibilities and needs. He's
so clearly deficient on a personal level, and yet he's able to preach to other people that
he represents what they should do and feel. There's a deep fear in this man, and it's a
fear of acknowledging his own frailty because his job doesn't allow him to.&quot;</p>

<p>As played by Holm, Stephens is a study in crumbling resolve, a profoundly flawed
protagonist whose world consists of equal parts grief and manipulation as he struggles to
hold his emotions in check to do a job he doesn't even know he no longer believes in. As
he has in <i>Big Night</i> (1996), <i>Brazil</i> (1985), <i>Alien</i> (1979) and numerous
other films, Holm brings a solid, bullet-headed obstinacy to the role that never quite
masks the combustible madness just beneath the surface. Had the role of Mitchell Stephens
gone to Egoyan's reported first choice, the great, vulturine Donald Sutherland, the entire
film might've had a more ominous &#150; and thus less hopeful &#150; feel. A balancing act
of exhilarating focus and strength, this is one of Holm's very best performances.</p>

<p>As the haunted Nicole, young Canadian star Polley (who performs a cover of The
Tragically Hip's &quot;Courage&quot; over the closing credits) is precisely the cipher
called for by the story. Greenwood, Rose, Khanjian, Chaykin and Hemblen are all given
distinctive, memorable moments as they continue their ongoing collaborations with Egoyan.</p>

<p>&quot;Courage couldn't come at a worse time,&quot; someone says after the deposition
that explicitly prevents the lawsuit from ever happening. Yet even though the townspeople
are left with no one to blame and no financial gain from their haphazard loss (the film is
explicitly vague on the reason for the crash), closure and eventual peace seem closer than
ever through the impulsive words of a scarred young girl. In the world of Atom Egoyan,
where the toll taken on the quality of life by a fast-paced, technology-fuelled culture
that seems bent on separating people from their emotions &#150; and thus each other &#150;
is incalculable, <i>The Sweet Hereafter</i> offers an ending about as happy as such
resolutions can be given the profoundly unsettling circumstances. In grief, there can be
grace.</p>
