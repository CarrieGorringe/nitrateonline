<meta name="description" content="Twister - To understand some of the more serious strains that Twister places upon the audience's credulity, a quick-and-dirty overview of tornado characteristics is in order. Tornadoes, or, more precisely, a cumulonimbus cloud (a so-called &quot;funnel&quot; cloud) occur when extremely cool air from the sky encounters extremely warm air on the ground. Most unfortunate are the denizens of the American mid-west and south, because the spring weather patterns in these areas are highly favorable to such cloud formations. The result is a rather nimble and nasty nimbus that leaves a mile-wide path of devastation in its wake. Tornadoes are, to use a somewhat false analogy, like hurricanes on land, but pack far more force. The strongest hurricane has been estimated to have wind speeds of 250 miles per hour; the wind speed of an F-5, the highest measurement designation for a tornado, starts at a mere 375 miles per hour, and some F-5s are estimated to have topped out at 500 miles per hour. As if to add insult to injury, there is no method available for accurately predicting when tornadoes will form, because they do so rather rapidly, and can change direction just as fast; meteorologists can do no more than provide a two-minute warning to those under threat.">

accurately predicting when tornadoes will form, because they do so rather rapidly, and can

warning to those under threat.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">It is this obsession with widening the gap between detection and
protection that is the &quot;eye&quot;, if you will, of <em>Twister's</em> storyline.
Scientist Jo Harding (Hunt) and her motley collection of tornado chasers (imagine a
meteorological equivalent of the worst stereotypes applied to computer nerds) are racing
against several key plot elements, time being the most important. For one, they are
attempting to plant some sensors in a funnel in the hope of obtaining vital scientific
data (what else?) that will put them ahead of the competition. Second, there is the
competition, an erstwhile member of Harding's group named Dr. Jonas Miller (Elwes), an
individual who has a surfeit of vanity and corporate sponsorship (right down to the
requisite fleet of black vans that carry the traditional metaphoric punch), but seemingly
very little intelligence for a holder of a Ph.D. And then there is Jo's impending divorce
from Bill Harding (Paxton), the papers for which she just keeps forgetting to sign. Bill,
on the other hand, is indecently impatient for Jo to sign her life away, as he intends to
marry Melissa (Gertz) a mousy, whining psychotherapist who gives every impression of
needing a little extra time on the couch herself. Despite all these messy personal
details, Jo is so excited about her collection of devices for implanting sensors, each one
named &quot;Dorothy&quot; (anyone for a chorus of &quot;Follow the Yellow Brick
Road&quot;?), and its possibilities, that Bill is sucked right back into the thrill of the
chase. Soon, the crew is bounding along like an overzealous puppy chasing a large truck,
and as oblivious to the danger. The journey should be entertaining. After all, there's a
neurotic shrink fiancée in tow, and no shortage of funnel-shaped possibilities on the
horizon.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">I said that the journey should be entertaining. Unfortunately, such is
not the case. The shortages in <em>Twister</em> lie under the special effects. The
dialogue and plot are, appropriately enough, paper-thin, as might be expected from a
product hammered together via last-minute script-doctoring (by the uncredited Steven
Zaillian, of <em>Schindler's List</em>, and Joss Whedon, who did an uncredited rewrite for
De Bont's <em>Speed</em>). True, it is absurd to expect that interpersonal skills can be
exercised among characters with dialogue which basically consists of minimal variations on
the theme of &quot;Watch out for that combine!&quot; or &quot;Get out of the way!&quot;
(always good advice when dealing with a tornado). It's even more absurd to pretend that
anyone in the audience really believes that the marriage of Jo and Bill is really in
peril. But abandoning all of the pretenses of concerns about the character's personal
lives means descending to a level of cynicism about the narrative that borders on the
appalling. Why care about the means of getting to the end when everyone knows how it's
going to end? Because such concerns make for a better film; giving the audience something
to mull over in between the scenes when various farmyard animals unwillingly take flight;
in short, such concerns give the audience a psychological stake in what's happening,
making the process of getting there as fun as having a rough idea of what the end is going
to contain. They might also have helped the filmmakers to better link the constraints of
physical actuality with the boundless potential of special effects; without giving too
much away, the final sequence in this film suffers from the same disease that has infected
far too many action-adventure films this summer: a zeal for the implausible, if exciting,
special effect destroyed by the ugliness of the laws of physics -- the laws of probability
notwithstanding, since they never really figure very highly under these circumstances.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">However, it seems that the filmmakers of <em>Twister</em>, having
dropped one ball, decided to see what the effect would be if they dropped the other as
well. There is one word to describe the overall quality of the special effects, and that
word is, shockingly enough, &quot;dull&quot;. Never before has so much money been expended
to so little effect. Admittedly, the opening sequence of <em>Twister</em> starts out on a
high note, primarily because it can build suspense around the suggestion of what is
unseen. Moreover, the opening sequence provides what little psychological motivation this
film can actually muster as a justification for its existence. It's unfortunate that no
one connected with <em>Twister</em> carried this promising premise forward. Even the
metaphoric underpinnings from <em>The Wizard of Oz</em> contained in the film add nothing
to the film's essence, but they do unwittingly reveal the paucity of ideas and inspiration
at hand. To paraphrase Macbeth, this cinematic bag of wind is a tale told by idiots, full
of sound and fury, signifying nothing.</font></p>
