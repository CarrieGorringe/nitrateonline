<p><big><strong><big>T</big></strong>he reason you'll want to see this movie has
everything to do with Samantha Morton, the young actress who incarnates the
self-destructive lead character, Iris. Iris is scrawny-sexy, emotionally childish,
addicted to the approval of others (chiefly men, chiefly in the form of sexual
satisfaction), and while nothing she does in the course of this film is so bad, she's bad
enough. Which, of course, may be good reason to skip this film too. </big></p>

<p><img src="images/fsiff98-9.gif" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="159">Morton is in every
frame, and even when Iris is near the bottom of a long downward corkscrew Morton makes her
seem willful and attractive. In the opening scenes she's gooseskin naked, lazily dragging
the tip of a felt-tip pen over shoulders, breasts and navel, speculating waftingly in
voiceover, &quot;I love him. . . I sometimes wonder what it'd be like with someone
else.&quot; It's a universal-sounding language of young women caught in the gauze of
capital L Love. But for her the ideas are fresh. After her mother dies of cancer, she
takes her half of the goods, split with her sister Rose, and spends a few days in shell
shock, listening to Rose splutter out her grief about mum over the phone. </p>

<p>And then she just walks off the end of the pier. Boyishly cute in her baggy corduroys
until now, Iris turns a corner on her sexuality after the funeral. She begins to
experiment, turning up to meet Rose for lunch in a short black slip dress, big sunglasses,
a worse for wear blonde wig, and all set off with a rabbit fur mini-coat (belted at the
middle). Rose, pregnant, middle-class and working at a travel agency, pauses and says,
&quot;You look like a slut.&quot; But that seems to be Iris's way of coping. She drifts
away from her job at the bus lost and found, and randomly selects men to sleep with,
seeking ever rawer forms of humiliation from them.</p>

<p>The trajectory of &quot;Under the Skin&quot; follows the season in hell model you may
remember from reading Arthur Rimbaud's poetry (on Patti Smith's recommendation) back in
high school. But thanks to Morton's performance the film slips free of cliche and lets us
see the necessity of Iris's fall. Like Rimbaud, Iris is willing to turn her senses inside
out in the pursuit of seeing herself as someone else. </p>
