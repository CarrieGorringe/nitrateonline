In the Georgian world, &quot;sensibility&quot; was associated with strong emotions and the gift of psychological discernment. In a world with a strong emphasis on social rank and decorum, the object of the game (at least at the upper end of the spectrum) was to retain a rich inner life of feeling and imagination while keeping them both firmly under the control of a calm and rational external facade, even in the face of changing circumstances. The balance was precarious, but it had to be maintained; too much &quot;sense&quot; could lead to an impoverished inner life and too much &quot;sensibility&quot; could lead to social disgrace.">

&quot;sense&quot; and &quot;sensibility&quot; seem like synonyms, so their inclusion in a
title must appear to cancel each other out. But, in nineteenth-century terms, the two are
far from alike. Although &quot;sense&quot; has retained its practical connotations through
to the present day, &quot;sensibility&quot; is often confused with the modern meaning of
&quot;sensible&quot;. In the Georgian world, &quot;sensibility&quot; was associated with
strong emotions and the gift of psychological discernment. In a world with a strong
emphasis on social rank and decorum, the object of the game (at least at the upper end of
the spectrum) was to retain a rich inner life of feeling and imagination while keeping
them both firmly under the control of a calm and rational external facade, even in the
face of changing circumstances. The balance was precarious, but it had to be maintained;
too much &quot;sense&quot; could lead to an impoverished inner life and too much
&quot;sensibility&quot; could lead to social disgrace.</font></p>

<p>Within the confines of this mindset, the female members of the Dashwood family
epitomize the problems that result when one suffered a change in circumstances, yet had to
continue on as if nothing had happened, primarily because such a socio-economic system
provided no psychological cushion to weather the change. Mrs. Dashwood (Jones), and her
daughters Elinor (Thompson) Marianne (Winslet) and Margaret (Francois), have all fallen
upon hard times indeed, thanks to the laws of primogeniture. The head of the household has
just died, and the estate on which they live has now passed into the hands of Mr.
Dashwood's son from a previous marriage. John Dashwood (Fleet), initially intending to be
generous to his stepfamily due to a deathbed promise that his father extracted from him,
is gradually persuaded by his grasping and snobbish wife, Fanny (Walter), that he need
only provide the women with five hundred pounds a year. It is an incredible sum, to be
sure, but not for women who have been accustomed to an upper-class lifestyle; by the
standards of their set, the distaff Dashwoods are on the verge of penury.</p>

<p>Fortunately for the Dashwood women, a distant relative, Sir John Middleton (Hardy)
steps in to offer them a &quot;cottage&quot; on his estate. Before they leave for
Middleton's estate, Fanny's brother, Edward Ferrars (Grant) arrives for a visit, and he
and Elinor form an alliance of sorts which is very quickly put to the sword by Fanny's
machinations. Once the women are settled in their cottage, it is Marianne's turn to
experience love, only she has two men from whom to choose: the dashing and rakish John
Willoughby (Wise) and the outwardly staid but deeply-principled Colonel Christopher
Brandon (Rickman), who loves Marianne in a deep and most unrequited way -- as unrequited
as Elinor loves Edward. Over the next two hours, all of these threads are to be sorted
out, with many requisite plot twists.</p>

<p>What Austin conveyed so brilliantly in <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> is the arbitrary
nature of life and how a sudden shift in financial circumstance, so precarious for all,
but especially for women and especially in the nineteenth century, could invert all of the
rules by which one had lived one's life. The result was having to rely, as Blanche du Bois
once stated with unintentional irony, on the kindness of strangers. If one had relatives
in good standing (as the Dashwood women do), and they were willing to provide assistance,
one could, at best, eke out a sort of semi-respectable existence in genteel poverty. If
not, the situation could be rather dire. Being sensible was a luxury available only to the
very wealthy, something which Elinor knows only too well; it is her practicality and her
painful acknowledgment of the family's financially-straitened circumstances which prevent
her from pursuing Edward (and, by extension, personal happiness) with more determination.
Marianne, on the other hand, is all sensibility. Raised in privilege, headstrong, spoiled,
and beautiful, she is ill-equipped to cope with her family's sudden poverty. Both sisters
obviously stand as the chief metaphors for each quality in the title (but each of the
remaining characters lines up behind them on opposing sides of the line). Nevertheless,
through the number of travails suffered by all of the participants, it is apparent that
only luck and wealth save them from having to face the consequences of their
&quot;unbalanced&quot; personalities.</p>

<p>It is to Thompson's credit as a first-time screenwriter that she keeps her adaptation
amazingly faithful to Austin's work (unlike the -- if one will pardon the expression --
&quot;adaptation&quot; of Hawthorne's <a href="rscarlet.html" target="_top"><em>The Scarlet Letter</em></a>
that contaminated screens last year). Many of her omissions, among them the exclusion of
relatively superfluous characters such as Sir John's wife, are obviously based upon what
one might call very sensible choices (in both meanings of the term); because of such
careful decisions, the narrative runs smoothly, and not just because the original source
is so dependent upon the most transparent set of coincidences to move the narrative
forward (where are those well-to-do relatives when one needs them in real life?). The
cinematic narrative works so well because Thompson obeys the first law of adapting
literary works for film: the themes and tensions from the original source must remain
intact; thus, only those episodes and characters that are important to unequivocally
presenting and sustaining the presence of those themes and tensions should appear on
screen. This is what happens in <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>; the passage of events and
time is so smooth that it is almost imperceptible, but never less than enthralling. Every
adaptation should be this flawless.</p>

<p>But a great adaptation can go to pieces once it has been put through the production
mill, if for no other reason than the number of compromises that have to be made along the
way. Fortunately, this production was in the hands of Ang Lee, a director with an
indisputable talent for making the interior life into a fascinating narrative experience.
In other words, he was the perfect choice for this assignment. Lee keeps this
soap-opera-with-a-pedigree absolutely engrossing from start to finish. He is assisted by
the vivid cinematography of Michael Coulter which gives <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> a
lushly verdant, almost otherworldly, feel. Such an approach is entirely in keeping with
the film's preoccupation with a type of love that often finds itself existing within the
realm of the hyperreal. Because of its strong underpinnings, <em>Sense and Sensibility</em>
never crosses over the line into the realm of the grotesquely maudlin romantic portrayals
a la Mills and Boon -- but, admittedly, the film comes perilously close to flirting with
the possibilities (and, perversely enough, simply watching the tug-of-war that ensues near
that border is entertaining in itself). </p>

<p>The strong creative trend in <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> is sustained through to the
acting. It may seem tiresome to associate English actors with the concept of
&quot;quality&quot;, but every performance in this film is direct evidence as to why the
comparison is more often apt than not. All of the performances are standouts, most notably
those of Alan Rickman and Kate Winslet. Rickman projects onto and into Colonel Brandon a
sense of internal anguish that is almost tangible, but which always passes through a
filter of decorum and dignity beforehand. Winslet is absolutely breathtaking as the
luminescent but dangerously irresponsible Marianne. Hugh Grant's Edward is the soul of
discretion and responsibility and the combination is surprisingly charming. In addition to
her masterful adaptation of Austin's novel, Thompson creates a muted but always intriguing
performance as the long-suffering Elinor, the fulcrum of the family. Wise provides the
precise level of swashbuckling charm to the cad Willoughby. The supporting cast, including
Hugh Laurie (best known to American audiences for his role as &quot;Bertie&quot; Wooster
in the <em>Jeeves and Wooster</em> series), sustain the overall impression of quality,
even if the limited aspect of certain roles provide the audience with only a partial
glimpse of the actors' talents. All things considered, <em>Sense and Sensibility</em> is a
film that one might, to borrow Elinor's delightfully understated phrase, esteem very
highly indeed.</p>
