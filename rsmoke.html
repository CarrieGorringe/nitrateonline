<p><em>Smoke</em> is a difficult film to describe, precisely because its narrative
structure seems to meander in an almost leisurely fashion around the landscape of its
characters. Time is, after all, its central metaphor, for nearly every character in the
film has suffered from bad timing of some sort or another, or, more appropriately, the
arbitrariness of time. The metaphor is underscored by Auggie's unusual taste in
photography (for the past fifteen years he has taken a photograph of the tobacco shop at
the same time every day). Such an avocation is not, as might be imagined, the futile act
of a narrow mind. Through his photography, one gains the impression that Auggie is
freezing time, attempting to gain some limited control over and record of the multiplicity
of events that occur outside his window. Moreover, the value of Auggie's project is made
apparent to Paul, who discovers an image of his wife while flipping though one of Auggie's
many photo albums (this after having derided Auggie for the putative sameness of his
pictures): Paul's wife inadvertently appears in one of the photographs. Auggie's work
attests to that most obvious of qualities in photographs, what Roland Barthes referred to
as the &quot;what-has-been&quot;, or the way in which photographs attest to the literal
existence of someone or something within history (if not always to the context in which
he/she/it existed). Paul discovers both in Auggie's work, as he invests the image of his
wife with all of the memories he associated with her. Not surprisingly, the catharsis that
results from his ability to face the past becomes a significant factor in clearing his
writer's block, because it restores his empathy with the outside world. For Paul, and
everyone else in the film, the passage of time alone does not heal past damage; only
action can do it.</p>

<p>In keeping with its concentration upon the almost-subliminal, <em>Smoke</em> also
celebrates the beauty and comprehends the pain that is derived from the smallest of
gestures and actions, and how these gestures and actions always come back to haunt an
individual, most specifically within the realm of fatherhood. All of the men in question
have had their paternal instincts denied and/or thwarted. Auggie and Paul are the most
obvious examples: the former, confronted with a daughter whose personality has already
been formed, apparently for the worse, and Paul, whose wife was murdered when she was
pregnant. Only after Paul and Auggie have been obliged to act upon their own interrupted
patterns of parenthood can they attempt to become &quot;fathers&quot; to Rachid, utilizing
the same enforced confrontation of truth upon him that was visited upon them.
Unfortunately, the consequences of their actions are never resolved, and may have done
more harm than good. </p>

<p>For all of the semantic implications included in <em>Smoke</em>, the film never
descends to the realm of the didactic to make its point. Its approach is always subtle,
but persistent. Consequently, it's an absolute pleasure to watch, from beginning to end.
For those who dislike narrative film because of its insistence upon sacrificing the
pleasures of lingering over details in a complex story to the imperatives of moving the
narrative forward, this is their film. Screenwriter (and avant-garde novelist) Paul Auster
integrates every element with consummate ease. The final scene in particular illustrates
how powerfully affecting <em>Smoke's</em> little gestures are. Auggie and Paul gather for
lunch at a local deli, and the cost of that lunch is at stake, since Paul has promised to
pay if Auggie can come up with a Christmas story to help Paul meet a publication deadline.
As Auggie begins his story (a true one, he assures Paul with a grin that seems to be
half-joking), the camera frames them both in a medium shot. Halfway through the story, the
camera begins to move in on Auggie almost imperceptibly, until, by the end of the story
Auggie is framed in an extreme close-up. One never really knows whether the story, one
which is both funny and touching, or the camera movement is responsible for the film
achieving a sense of the beatific at this moment, and, in the end, it's really difficult
to care either way, because the film's manipulations don't leave the audience feeling
insulted; it's no wonder that this scene was adapted from one of Auster's short stories,
originally entitled -- what else -- <em>Auggie Wren's Christmas Story</em>, and that it
was the impetus for this collaboration between Wang and Auster. </p>

<p>As if <em>Smoke's</em> obvious merits weren't enough, every performance it contains is
exquisite. It's a mystery as to why none of them were nominated for Oscars, because every
one of them is of that caliber. After his &quot;rediscovery&quot; by audiences in
Tarantino's <em>Reservoir Dogs</em> (1992) and Jane Campion's <em>The Piano</em> (1993),
Keitel demonstrates once again why his understated style makes him one of the finest
actors in Hollywood. No longer in possession of the pretty-boy looks with which he graced
Scorsese's early work, Keitel now projects on screen a worn handsomeness that is much
stronger because it originates from within. His Auggie is bemused, rumpled and has been
buffeted by life, but he is no loser; within the admittedly narrow parameters of his life,
Auggie has dignity and purpose, and, more importantly, very little self-delusion about how
things really are. It is this latter quality that rightfully renders Auggie the center of
his own universe. The role of Paul Benjamin requires the skills of an actor who has to
move rapidly between artistic sensitivity and inner toughness without weakening either,
and Hurt does exactly that, and more. He gives to Paul a deep personal vulnerability, one
which doesn't rely upon excesses in either words or deeds to get his point across.
Channing, in her all-too-brief appearance as Ruby, balances brashness, despair and
hopelessness with masterful ease. Likewise for Perrineau and Whitaker, about whose
remarkable and beautifully-nuanced work not enough can be said. But the best performance
by far in the film is that of Ashley Judd, who, in one unforgettable scene (the only scene
in which she appears) manages to belie the foul-mouthed demeanor that she displayed to
Ruby and Auggie; as the camera moves in to rest upon her face, she conveys a lifetime of
emotional deprivation and vulnerability in one single, heart-breaking glance. Like
everyone else, she is weak, but, unlike those who find self-enlightenment in the course of
the film, or have it imposed upon them, her future is even less certain than theirs. She
isn't the only victim in <em>Smoke</em>, but her case is the most tragic.</p>

<p>No doubt for many in the audience, the most tragic aspect of <em>Smoke</em> is the
regularity and the alacrity with which many of the characters put tobacco products into
contact with their respiratory systems. But <em>Smoke</em> is a world in which the Surgeon
General's warnings don't and shouldn't apply. The film almost seems a throwback to an era
in which smoking was as much a social function as a habit, one that, for Auggie and Paul
in particular, provides them with the assurance of daily human contact and the resultant
potential for personal growth and friendship. It is this immediate concrete result, rather
than any perceived health threat, that makes the tobacco store significant. To paraphrase
a title of a recent social history of smoking, <em>Smoke</em> is sublime, even in the
opinion of this non-smoker. Even better, it won't burn holes in your clothes, although
most of the characters are endearing enough to possibly burn a hole or two in your heart.</p>
