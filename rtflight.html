<p><big><strong><big>T</big></strong>he cinematic equivalent to experimental light
aircraft, <i>The Theory of Flight</i> is a bumpy ride that sputters and fails, not quite
crashing yet never soaring above its earnest intentions. Yet another metaphor for the
Beauty-and-the-Beast tale, this one sports Academy-Award nominees Kenneth Branagh (Henry
V) and Helena Bonham Carter (<i>Wings of the Dove</i>) as participants in a love story
where the protagonists appear missing in action. As to which is the beauty and which the
beast, it&#146;s a toss-up.</big></p>

<p>Richard (Branagh) portrays a troubled artist, emotionally void, unstable in romance,
and on the outs with Julie (Holly Aird) his latest squeeze, a banker in London. His
fixation with flight and a failed hang glide off a high rise land him in legal
difficulties. A magistrate&#146;s sentence of 120 days of community service follows
Richard to a small Welsh community to which he has fled. In an out-of-the-way rented
farmhouse with too much spare time, he shrinks inward, fleeing Western civilization and
his g.f, whiling away hours creating a makeshift biplane (built from spit, an erector set,
some leftover Martha Stewart craft items, and, of course, Airplanes for Dummies). His
screen time is also split with his new court assignment Jane (Bonham-Carter), a paraplegic
with vibrant inner energy but devoid of the physical ability to exert it. Their
relationship is a challenge to themselves and the viewers. As drawn by budding scenarist
Richard Hawkins, the character Richard (Hmmm, notice how both have the same first name.)
shows no development through most of the film, instead pushing him from one lame-brained
idea to the next. Jane, confined to a wheelchair and her speech constrained and slurred as
she fights a losing battle with amyotrophic lateral scelorsis (ALS), the motor-neuron
disorder commonly known as Lou Gehrig&#146;s disease, has her sights set on one goal --
getting shagged (as the British quaintly put it).</p>

<p>Seems her affliction hit before a youthful deflowering and the virgin enlists Richard
to assist. The nebbish (albeit not in the Woody Allen sense/character that Branagh nailed
with aplomb in <a href="rcelebrity.html" target="_top"><i>Celebrity</i></a>) refuses the job out of
angst, but the daring duo head to the big city to find a way for the deed to be done
(topless clubs for the physically challenged, employment agencies, etc.). The pair, now
thick as thieves after a series of playful sequences, eventually secure the services of a
professional gigolo (Ray Stevenson), while Richard makes a brashly stupid decision to rob
his ex-girlfriend&#146;s bank for the necessary funds.</p>

<p>Bonham Carter is the most rewarding nugget in this morose story of a doomed
relationship; her candid frustration and brash energy radiates behind the physical
limitations of the role. She&#146;s as bold and rebellious as any teenager, bedecked in
baseball cap and bright race-car driver jacket. Be it shoplifting from a local grocery or
surfing porno websites, she desperately wants to leave her personal mark on the world she
will soon leave behind. Meanwhile, Branagh&#146;s bland identity is trapped within a fully
functioning skeleton. It&#146;s like watching an animated stick figure, which is not to
say it&#146;s all Branagh&#146;s fault entirely, but the limitations of the script. The
couple&#146;s mismatched affinity isn&#146;t sufficiently developed, and director Paul
Greengrass can&#146;t make the actors (romantically attached in real life after they
co-starred five years ago in <i>Mary Shelley&#146;s Frankenstein</i>) jumpstart off the
written page. He pushes the project to the edge of pathos, with dashes of misplaced
slapstick, including a horribly silly speeded-up sequence in a London hotel room on the
eve of Jane&#146;s date with destiny (well, Jane specifically wanted Richard Gere for her
erotic daytrip, but he wasn&#146;t available). Such bone-headed directorial blunders make
this a less than inspirational attempt at dealing with a legitimate subject.</p>

<p>As the &quot;other,&quot; smaller film dealing with death up close this holiday season
(<a href="rstepmom.html" target="_top"><i>Stepmom</i></a> being the larger, wider release, and one I
haven&#146;t seen yet), <i>The Theory of Flight</i> makes a misguided effort to explore
two awkward individuals in search of expression and fulfillment. All the sincerity the
film aches to offers is lost in the end, with all the offbeat parts never adding up to
more than the whole.</p>
