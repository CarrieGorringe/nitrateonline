			<a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 26 March 2004</i></font><p>
			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed</i> 
			is amongst us, a live-action sequel to the 2002 live-action movie, 
			but does anybody know of anyone who actually LIKED the 2002 movie? 
			The studio trumpeted that it made a lot of money, but ticket prices 
			have gone up, too. Anyway, in this installment, Fred (Freddie Prinze, 
			Jr., with blondined hair), Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar), Shaggy 
			(Matthew Lillard), Velma (Linda Cardellini), and their faithful 
			hound Scooby (courtesy of CGI) are in the first ten minutes eaten by 
			zombies that have escaped from the showing in the next auditorium 
			of&nbsp; <i>Dawn of the Dead</i> -- sorry, must investigate why ghosties 
			and ghoulies they have confronted in the past are once again shaking 
			the cobwebs from under their arms and gone on the march and on the 
			loose in Mystery, Inc.'s home town of&nbsp; Coolsville.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Anyway, probably the best way to 
			respond to this movie is as if you were plunked-down in front of the 
			television set on a Saturday morning -- although I always changed 
			the channel when <i>Scooby-Doo</i> came on, so I will have to take 
			the filmmakers' word for it that the new picture offers a rogue's 
			gallery parade of monsters, ghosts, and creepy, crawly things that 
			figured in the cartoon series. Along with the cast members, director 
			Raja Gosnell and screenwriter James Gunn have also reconvened from 
			the last picture. Prinze and Lillard once again seem ideally cast in 
			their roles, although it doesn't seem like much of a compliment, and 
			it's not as if it's much of a stretch: Prinze purses his lips, 
			lowers his eyelids, and looks obsequiously in our direction (he's 
			ALWAYS done that, though); Lillard affects an ingratiating, 
			loose-limbed, doofused amiability, then grimaces to the point where 
			the veins pop out of his neck (it's more masochistic than funny). 
			Gellar, who was ferociously good during parts of James Toback's 
			recent film <i>Harvard Man</i>, still looks like an actress who's 
			waiting to connect with the right film role. Still, you have to 
			remember that these people are playing characters based on <i>
			cartoons</i> -- with the possible exception of <i>The Flintstones</i> 
			and <i>The Jetsons</i>, which were made for prime-time viewing, the 
			Hanna-Barbera cartoons were primarily time killers, with places for 
			commercials that tried to sell us cereals that weren't good for us, 
			and toys that were probably too expensive for our parents to afford 
			but which everyone had to have.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The rowly-yelping CGI Scooby is 
			just as unintelligible as the animal on TV, except that he sounds 
			like he's possibly talking dirty part of the time (&quot;Wrowl you!&quot; and 
			&quot;Reer rue ups.,” for instance). There's also some 
			intelligibly-spoken nonsense talk about a chemical element named &quot;randymonium&quot; 
			and, if my notes are correct, &quot;chedqueries&quot; (that's what it looks 
			like), although I don't know if it would have made any difference if 
			they got David Mamet to do the screenplay, with all the characters 
			speaking in &quot;What I mean, I mean, what I mean is&quot; Mametese. Like the 
			show, the film is content to serve as a set-up for lots of cowardly 
			clowning, mugging, stumbling, things going &quot;crash,” and plot 
			resolutions that come out of the blue. The exception is that 
			everything looks a lot, lot, lot more expensive. There are some 
			gracefully-executed chases, a voltage monster that recalls the Id 
			creature in <i>Forbidden Planet</i>, a doozy of s shot showing a 
			full-scale ghost pirate ship majestically floating down, and above, 
			a congested city street, and the CGI Scooby is remarkably and 
			seamlessly integrated with the live actors (including a scene 
			involving a choreographed dance number).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">On the other hand, Alicia 
			Silverstone appears as a cruel TV reporter -- she looks into the 
			camera and talks about people being knocked from their pedestals, 
			and you wonder if her casting was some sort of a sick joke, given 
			that everyone knows her career took a fierce tumble in the second 
			half of the 1990s. (Her appearance here isn't going to do her any 
			help, either.) But the one thing that must be highlighted is the 
			appearance of Seth Green, playing a museum curator who looks into 
			the eyes of Linda Cardellini's Velma, with her geometric spectacles 
			and huge pageboy hairstyling, and instantly falls in love. (And you 
			may recall that Velma was the one on the TV show that everybody 
			speculated about.) Green's face, which is almost as rubbery as 
			Matthew Lillard's, softens in these somewhat fleeting sequences, and 
			his tone becomes surprisingly tender and touchingly heartfelt. I 
			thought that Green was the best thing to be found in last year's <i>
			The Italian Job</i>, but who would've known that the comedian who 
			played Dr. Evil's son had a romantic side that was just waiting for 
			the chance to come out?</font></td>
