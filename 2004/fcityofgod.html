</font><i><font size="1" face="Verdana">interview by <a href="../kj.html" target="_top">KJ 
Doughton</a>, 5 March 2004</font></i></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Not long ago, Brazilian filmmaker Fernando 
Meirelles almost abandoned his cinematic career to farm chickens in Australia.&nbsp; 
Ironically, it’s a clucking, feathered fowl that jump-starts his electrifying 
gang epic, <i>City of God</i>.&nbsp; While one of the film’s wild-eyed, trigger-happy 
slum lords slices carrots, boils water, and sharpens knives in preparation for a 
raucous neighborhood barbecue, his would-be main course sprints away from the 
scene. </font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Then – <b><i>boom</i></b><i>!</i> </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meirelles’ manic pinball of a camera follows 
the frustrated cook and his hungry party pals as they shuffle after the 
distraught bird. His lens eats the yellow dust churned up by flailing feet, 
ducks beneath speeding cars, bounces off crumbling stucco walls, and descends 
dizzying stairwells like a doomed foot soldier under fire.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Such fierce, sustained momentum is one reason
<i>City of God</i> has received Oscar nominations for best director, adapted 
screenplay, cinematography, and editing.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><font size="2">But wait. </font></i><font size="2">
Isn’t this the same movie that Roger Ebert praised as the best film of 2002, 
well over twelve months ago? Yes, indeed.&nbsp; Ebert and other enthusiasts screened
<i>City of God</i> at film festivals before its official U.S. release date in 
2003. Despite such raves, Academy voters snubbed the film for a best foreign 
film Oscar in 2002, most likely due to its limited accessibility.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After percolating for a year, however, the 
Academy has finally acknowledged <i>City of God</i>. Because the harrowing, grim 
crime drama was not officially released in America until January 2003, it was 
eligible for awards in categories other than best foreign film. Hence, its four 
nominations. Meirelles explains, “Because of the attention, the film is back in 
theatres in the U.S., Brazil, France, and Spain. It’s been given a second 
life.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>City of God</i> is the most visually 
inventive, vibrant, and enthusiastic crime film since <i>Pulp Fiction</i>. Its 
introductory chicken-chase kicks us from one jarring, breakneck sequence to 
another, and the pace never wavers, even as Meirelles’ circle of characters 
grows like mushrooms after a thundershower. Meirelles hacks his decades-long 
story (from Paolo Lins’ 1997 book) into three manageable mini-films, each 
representing a separate slice of time in the notorious Brazilian slum Cidade de 
Deus, where criminal gangs rob, rape, and steal during unending turf wars.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The first act channels Sergio Leone in its 
desert earth tones and Western attitude, while a visually garish mid-section 
packed with disco and soul tunes convey the seventies’ disco era.&nbsp; <i>City of 
God</i> careens completely out of control during its final frames, a punching 
match of quick cutting that symbolizes the jarring hand-off in cartel power from 
pot to cocaine. Like some sinister street kid brandishing pistols and loaded on 
PCP, we stagger into a satanic Never Never Land of staccato gunfire and 
bloodstains, with enemies everywhere.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Viewers have compared Meirelles’ visual 
dynamics to other crime films, including <i>Pulp Fiction</i> and <i>Boogie 
Nights</i>. His use of title cards to divide <i>City of God</i> into a series of 
vignettes echoes the approaches of&nbsp; Quentin Tarantino and P.T. Anderson.&nbsp; 
Shape-shifting transformations from slick, sharp images to chaotic camera moves 
parallel Martin Scorsese’s <i>Goodfellas</i> (remember Henry Hill’s herky-jerky, 
coke-fueled paranoia as he struggled to whip up a dish of perfect spaghetti 
while whisking off his latest illicit shipment?). </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The humble Meirelles concedes that such films 
have been influential, even throwing a few more references into the mix. “I 
would also include Ken Loach’s films on this list,” the 44-year-old director 
offers. “Robert Altman as well, in the way he uses many characters. Also Mike 
Leigh, in terms of his not using professional actors.”&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Indeed, the majority of Meirelles’ 
inexperienced cast members were recruited directly from Rio de Janeiro’s slums, 
or <i>favelas</i>.&nbsp; “We did an acting workshop and had 200 boys coming every 
day. Me and Katia (Lund, co-director) were there eight hours a day. It was a lot 
of work. Then we rehearsed the film, after the workshop. We called a coach from 
Sao Paolo, Fatima Toledo, who prepared the actors.”</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Such intense preparation created a natural 
acting style that somehow gels with the stylized editing and choreography in <i>
City of God</i>. Unlike, say, the Matrix films, where special effects create a 
dimension completely detached from reality, <i>City of God</i> uses its fancy 
flourishes to immerse us <i>into</i> reality from different perspectives, then 
grounds itself with the unpretentious performances. We watch the cast of 106 
children convey images of cocaine and pot manufacturing, soccer-playing,&nbsp; 
oceanside smooching, and cold-blooded shootouts, all from the here-and-now 
perspective of someone watching a six o’clock news flash.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Leandro Firmino da Hora, 23 years old at the 
time of production, is a standout as the amoral, trigger-happy “Little” Ze 
Pequeno, even though he had never acted before <i>City of God</i>.&nbsp; Alexandre 
Rodrigues, another unknown, is equally good as Rocket, an aspiring photographer 
who lacks the stomach for crime. Whether plotting to hijack a bus or taking a 
stab at store-robbing, Rodrigues’ inherent friendliness and good nature assure 
us that he will never follow through with such misdeeds. He suggests that 
perhaps Rocket will transcend the favelas and find a life outside of them.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>City of God</i>’s documentary-like realism 
takes on a disturbing immediacy, and its take-no-prisoners, tot-facilitated 
violence is often tough to take. One notorious scene involves Lil Ze’, the 
psychopathic teenage ruler of the slums, as he intimidates a wannabe gang of 
tiny pre-adolescents called The Runts. After shooting one pint-sized gangster 
through the foot, Ze’ orders another member to brandish his gun and kill a 
playmate. It’s a sickening, heartbreaking spectacle. The whimpers and tears look 
agonizingly real.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">“That was totally Fatima’s work,” acknowledges 
Meirelles. “She did it. Sometimes when she was rehearsing with the kids, she 
didn’t want me to see what she was doing. One day, she asked me to leave while 
she worked two days with the boys. Then she called me to see that scene 
rehearsed, where one boy shoots the other, and is crying. I was shocked. I said, 
‘you’re a monster.’ Then she said, ‘Cut,’ and the boy immediately stopped 
crying. He went out to play football, then came back and did it again. It was 
all acting.”</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>City of God</i> also drapes itself in layers 
of subplot, resulting in a complex web of detail that can only be fully absorbed 
through repeated viewings.&nbsp; One surreal scene, for instance, shows Lil’ Ze’s 
ritual transformation from child to man, as he visits a sinister witch doctor’s 
candle-lit cathedral.&nbsp; “This amulet is your protector,” the elder explains, 
placing a necklace around the killer’s neck. Many viewers might easily miss the 
significance of this witch doctor’s insistence that Lil’ Ze not fornicate while 
wearing the amulet. Watch <i>City of God</i> a second time, however, it becomes 
clear that the hood’s violation of this command is the catalyst for his undoing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">“The scene with the witch doctor,” explains 
Meirelles, “comes from a religion brought to Brazil from Africa, called <i>
Candonble</i>, that incorporates a lot of saints and entities, like gods that 
protect the sea and the winds. Different archetypes called orixas.&nbsp; In this 
scene, a very mean orixa – presented through the witch doctor - gives Lil’ Ze’ 
his power. But he is told that he can’t screw anybody with that amulet on. Later 
he rapes a girl. We don’t see the rape actually happen. Instead, there are three 
seconds showing only the amulet.” </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meirelles’ enthusiasm for his movie doesn’t 
overshadow the filmmaker’s grounded insistence that <i>City of God</i> was a 
group project, requiring the talents of a dedicated team. Katia Lund, credited 
as co-director, was hired on the strength of her street-savvy documentary, <i>
News from a Private War</i>, which observed Rio’s slum gangs with the type of 
gritty starkness that Meirelles wanted. For the curious, Meirelles explains why 
Lund’s name is not attached to the film’s best director Oscar nomination, 
despite her title as co-director.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">“Before <i>City of God</i>, I did two other 
co-directed films, where I split all of the decisions. With this film, however, 
I had worked on the project for three years before hiring Katia. She worked for 
6 months to creating the acting workshop, then only four months on the film. Our 
relationship is kind of like that of pilot and copilot. She was not involved in 
the editing and cinematography, and all of the final decisions were&nbsp; mine.”&nbsp;
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meirelles and Lund have continued combining 
their talents for a Brazilian television series called <i>City of Men</i>, 
described by the former as “a mix of comedy and drama concerning two boys.” 
Don’t expect to find the program on your boob tube any time soon. Although he is 
currently attempting to market <i>City of Men</i> to the U.S. and U.K., 
Meirelles laments the fact that such countries “are not used to watching 
subtitled television.”</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The director’s current focus, however, is the 
Oscar race, although he doubts his ability to steal the statue from <i>Ring</i> 
-leader Peter Jackson in the best director category.&nbsp; Meirelles is more 
optimistic about the chances of Daniel Rezende, up for best film editing.&nbsp; It’s 
easy to understand his reasoning: <i>City of God</i> takes the gonzoid, 
anything-goes editing scheme of <i>Natural Born Killers</i> and shoots it out of 
a cannon. Furious montages couple 16 and 35-millimeter film stocks with digital 
video, Matrix-style angles swerve 180 degrees, and grainy, hand-held camerawork 
sticks us right onto the grimy favela streets.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">“I love the editing process,” Meirelles 
proclaims. “For me, it’s the best part of filmmaking. But the credit should go 
to Daniel. During shooting, I would edit in my own apartment every day, coming 
back from the set to spend an hour with him, watching his work. There’s a system 
we use while working together.&nbsp; I get all the dailies and watch them, then put 
little ink dots on interesting images or interpretations. A green dot means, 
this is interesting. But a red dot means, this absolutely <i>has </i>to be in 
the film!</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">“Daniel was 23 years old when he edited the 
film. He's brilliant. He used to work as a cameraman doing auditions for actors, 
then took on production assistant duties for me. I really think he deserves the 
Oscar. His work is really original. ‘Lord of the Rings,’ is very well edited, 
but it’s a classic action movie. Daniel’s style, in comparison, is very fresh.”
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With <i>City of God</i> currently backed by 
Miramax’s thunderous promotional machine, Meirelles has been fielding press 
interviews around the clock.&nbsp; “Sorry if I’m slowing down,” he expresses quietly 
from a car cell phone, “but I’m tired. I’m on my way to the airport, where I’ll 
fly to London in two hours.” His current project is <i>The Patient Gardener</i>, 
a thriller starring Ralph Fiennes.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Before Meirelles puts his receiver down, he 
explains some unfinished business concerning the acrobatic chicken that evades 
Lil’ Ze’s fire pit during <i>City of God</i>’s opening shots.&nbsp; Staring anxiously 
as plucked comrades are immersed into boiling water and gang members salivate in 
expectation of a poultry-rich supper, the beaked bird’s performance overshadows 
those of his human counterparts as he tears down the street to evade being 
served up on a plate.&nbsp; Was a chicken-trainer on hand to elicit such expressive 
antics?&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">“Believe it or not,” Meirelles laughs, “that 
scene was completely improvised.&nbsp; In fact, it was done in one take. It was by 
chance that we pulled it off. Maybe the chicken heard that we were improvising. 
It definitely wasn’t planned.”</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With that closing comment, Meirelles’ cell 
phone cuts out, and the director of <i>City of God</i> tends to his travel plans 
in the City of Angels.</font></p>
