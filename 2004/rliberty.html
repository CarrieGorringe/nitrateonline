            <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="6">Chasing Liberty<br>
            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 9 January 2004</i></font><p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">As a 37-year-old male, it’s safe 
			to say that I’m not in the target market for <i>Chasing Liberty</i>. 
			Nonetheless, I feel compelled to note the film’s positive traits:</font></b></p>
			<ul>
				<li><font face="Verdana" size="2">The opening song is <i>not</i> 
				performed by the film’s star Mandy Moore. Tom Petty’s spirited 
				nasal whine is preferable to Moore’s pretty but personality-free 
				warbling any day. </font></li>
				<li><font face="Verdana" size="2">The scenic European locations 
				were photographed in focus.</font></li>
				<li><font face="Verdana" size="2">The other performers managed 
				to hit their chalk marks with a good degree of accuracy and 
				memorized their lines or at least read any cue cards clearly.</font></li>
				<li><font face="Verdana" size="2">The filmmakers chose to rip 
				off one of the best romantic comedies every made: William 
				Wyler’s <i>Roman Holiday</i>. </font></li>
			</ul>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s the final point that is also
			<i>Chasing Liberty</i>’s fatal weakness. If you’re going to steal a 
			classic storyline, you’d better do something new with it or populate 
			it with people viewers would actually want to see together.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">No such luck here. Gregory Peck has 
			recently passed on, and Wyler, writer Dalton Trumbo and the 
			one-and-only Audrey Hepburn could politely be described as 
			permanently unavailable. Their replacements can’t help but leave a 
			discerning filmgoer feeling nostalgic to the point of necrophilia.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The revamped setup features Moore 
			as Anna Foster, a President’s daughter who has become disenchanted 
			with her life in the spotlight. Dad (Mark Harmon, more concerned 
			with sneaking a cigar than foreign policy) is too busy trying to run 
			the United States to figure out how to deal with his daughter’s 
			urgent needs for privacy and romance. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Some presidential children might 
			have weighty concerns: For example, Amy Carter was bothered by 
			nuclear warfare. Anna, however, just wants to get to third base 
			without the intrusion of Secret Service agents. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While a competent actress, Moore 
			doesn't give Anna enough charm to make her rather limited goals seem 
			compelling. Considering that any one associated with U.S. leaders is 
			a potential terrorist target, her complaints about excessive 
			protection seem rather petty.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">You could say, &quot;But this film is 
			aimed at teens.&quot; But so are the <i>American Pie </i>films, and 
			despite their over-the-top crassness, those have flashes of 
			creativity and likable characters: Two essential elements missing 
			here. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Things don't get much better as 
			Anna leaves the country. When the Chief Executive takes the family 
			on a diplomatic trip to Prague, Anna gets upset because even in 
			Europe, her father has a whole legion of Secret Service agents 
			hovering around her. She thinks she's ditched them by running off 
			with a hunky British motorcyclist named Ben (Matthew Goode, 
			demonstrating all the humanity of a fence post). Little does she 
			know that he's on the Secret Service payroll, too.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While it might not be that likely,
			<i>Chasing Liberty </i>could have come dangerously close to being 
			fun by letting Anna actually ditch her protectors and handlers as 
			Audrey Hepburn did in <i>Roman Holiday</i>. Because Ben's security 
			net is always there, there isn't much that can happen: funny, scary 
			or otherwise. In <i>Chasing Liberty</i>, both &quot;Old Europe&quot; and &quot;New 
			Europe&quot; come across as equally dull. Without any sort of narrative 
			tension or any trace of wit. For example, here is an exchange 
			between the First Lady (Caroline Goodall) and Anna:</font></p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The First Lady: How's your 
				heart?</font></p>
				<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Anna: It's a little bit broken.</font></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">All of this is delivered with a 
			cold seriousness that belies the ludicrousness of the debut (and 
			hopefully final) script by Derek Guiley and David Schneiderman. The 
			attempts at humor, involving a love-hate relationship between Secret 
			Service agents Jeremy Piven and Anabella Schiorra, make a viewer 
			long for the comedy and romance of <i>Freddy vs. Jason</i>. Piven 
			spits out a few one-liners that seem to come off the cuff. One 
			suspects he's deviating from the script and becomes eternally 
			grateful.&nbsp;</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"> <o:p>
