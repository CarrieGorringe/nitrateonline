			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the film <i>Sweet Ecstasy</i>, 
			the young Elke Sommer looks up at the camera with star sapphire eyes 
			gazing from beneath a mound of wild, unruly white-blond hair. She 
			plays a tigerish young thing named ... Elke, who lives as she wants, 
			loves as she wants, and sets two men who are interested in her 
			against each other, one of whom is almost killed.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Sweet Ecstasy</i> came out in 
			the U.S. in 1962, six years after the release of <i>And God Created 
			Woman</i> caused an international sensation. In that film, the young 
			Brigitte Bardot played Juliette, who lived as she wanted, loved as 
			she wanted, and set two men (brothers, to be precise) who are 
			interested in her against each other, one of whom is almost killed. 
			(A third man, played by Curd Jurgens, is also interested in Juliette 
			but knows when to put the brakes on.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That's not the only similarity the 
			two films have. They both take place in French coastal towns (<i>Sweet 
			Ecstasy</i> on the Cote d'Azur, facing the Mediterranean). Christian 
			Pezey, who plays the younger of the two men in <i>Sweet Ecstasy</i>, 
			bears a marked resemblance to Jean-Louis Trintignant, the younger 
			man in the Bardot film. In both films, there's a scene where the 
			lead female character dances provocatively to exotic music. (Also, 
			both female characters are blond, Bardot having dyed her hair blond 
			to play Juliette.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The character of Elke in <i>Sweet 
			Ecstasy</i> states upfront that she is &quot;incapable of loving anyone&quot;, 
			meaning she is incapable of having emotions for someone. Bardot's 
			Juliette in <i>And God Created Woman</i>, because she has no 
			inhibitions about herself, was seen as being detached and, 
			therefore, amoral, a misinterpretation of the instinctive, 
			unaffected (in terms of actorly mannerisms) persona which came 
			across in the film. It was not indicative of an absence of feeling. 
			(Although Bardot, towards the end of her acting career, would 
			increasingly hide beneath long blond hair and black eyeliner makeup, 
			whether she was appearing in a Western or a modern-day story.) <i>
			And God Created Woman</i> made instant celebrities out of &quot;B.B.&quot; (a 
			trained classical dancer who had appeared in mostly bit parts and 
			supporting roles) and her director, Roger Vadim. By 1962, Bardot had 
			shown she could act, in Henri-Georges Clouzot's <i>La Vérité</i> 
			(tragically unavailable in the U.S., at the moment), and was about 
			to appear in Jean-Luc Godard's new film&nbsp; <i>Contempt</i>; Vadim had 
			made his modern day version of <i>Les Liaisons Dangereuse</i>, and 
			his remarkable vampire drama <i>Blood and Roses</i>, both with 
			then-current wife Annette Stroyberg (who, in the latter, is seen 
			floating across the grounds of a country house, in a silvery couture 
			dress, as a party is breaking up during the early morning hours).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Christian Pezey's character, 
			Olivier, is first seen entering a theater where rehearsals are being 
			held for something called <i>Les Chemins Dangereuse</i> (Dangerous 
			Roads). His sister, Claire (played by Claire Maurier), is staring in 
			it; backstage, she asks him what the matter is. &quot;Are you in love?&quot; 
			&quot;No. Just depressed,&quot; Olivier replies. (Yes, <i>Sweet Ecstasy</i> 
			has been dubbed by anonymous drones into English.) Sister Claire, 
			naturally, scolds him (&quot;That is the end!&quot;); Olivier then meets 
			Barbara (Vittoria Prada), a nice girl to whom he offers a lift in 
			his roadster, hence to nearby Villefranche, where they run into the 
			juvenile delinquents.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Albeit they're juvenile delinquents 
			who say things like, &quot;We've got the yacht for the weekend!&quot; They're 
			more like bohemian types, spawned by rich families. The nominal 
			leader is Maddy, played by Pierre Brice, who bears a resemblance to 
			the young Alain Delon in <i>Purple Noon</i>. He and Olivier engage 
			in some banter on morality, after which Maddy suggests that Olivier 
			go a round with Elke, even though up until then Elke had been 
			Maddy's girl. This leads to the one scene which probably scandalized 
			American audiences in 1962 -- Elke and Olivier are accelerating from 
			Phase One to Phase two when, oops! Elke's blouse pops open. (Not to 
			worry, you don't get to see too much of anything.) Then Olivier 
			turns into a wet blanket: he doesn't want to engage in THAT sort of 
			empty love. Elke, understandably, responds by telling him to go play 
			with the fishes, and you can't blame her -- a gentleman usually 
			doesn't get a woman that hot and bothered and then refuses to be 
			attentive to her needs (which is seen in some quarters as sadistic). 
			The movie hedges its bets, however -- an earlier scene has already 
			shown that Maddy and Elke have conspired against Olivier, deciding 
			that Olivier is too good for his own good, and that Elke will serve 
			as the corrupting force. The film's original French title was <i>
			Douce Violence</i> -- <i>Tender Violence</i>.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This was the second of two films 
			the director Max Pecas made with Elke Sommer -- the actress is more 
			recognizable as Elke Sommer in the first film, <i>Daniella by Night</i>, 
			a murder mystery that Radley Metzger's Audubon Films, the American 
			distributor, sold as a saucy romp through the clubs and fashion 
			houses of Paris. For the 1959 film <i>Un Mundo para mí</i> -- which 
			starred Agnes Laurent, another &quot;nouveau Bardot&quot; -- Metzger 
			completely re-edited and cut in boodles of new footage, releasing it 
			as <i>Soft Skin on Black Silk</i>. It looks like some clipping was 
			done on <i>Sweet Ecstasy</i>, too -- characters will walk off-camera 
			and, in the next shot, magically appear at an airport miles away, 
			with no explanation as to how they got there. Along with the 
			oops-my-blouse-popped-open scene, <i>Sweet Ecstasy</i> features a 
			surfside tussle between Maddy and Elke, a scene where Elke is tied 
			up and then auctioned off to the highest bidder, and another where 
			she is trapped and almost burned alive. Maddy and Olivier, 
			inevitably, get riled and settle their differences between each 
			other in a sort-of duel involving platforms raised and lowered by 
			cranes and a building that's under construction. Charles Aznavour 
			co-wrote the incidental music for the film, which also uses two 
			songs recorded by French rock star Johnny Hallyday (taken from his 
			1961 album <i>Viens Danser Le Twist</i>, the French title for the 
			Chubby Checker song <i>Let's Do the Twist</i>). (Hallyday can 
			currently be seen in the film <i>Crime Spree</i>, opposite another 
			French pop singer, Renaud -- they actually have a scene where their 
			two characters keep switching between radio stations that are 
			playing songs recorded by Renaud and Johnny Hallyday.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While <i>Sweet Ecstasy</i> may not 
			be as risque as it once was, I wouldn't exactly say that the film 
			has turned entirely quaint. I've always liked Elke Sommer, and, 
			having now seen this film, am rather glad that she broke out of the 
			Bardot wannabe mode and found her own screen persona. Just as a good 
			part of the success of <i>A Shot in the Dark</i> has to do with her 
			portrayal of the housemaid Maria, whom everyone is convinced is a 
			murderer (save for Peter Sellers' Inspector Clouzot), whatever edge
			<i>Sweet Ecstasy</i> retains has to do with her portrayal of a 
			wanton seductress, fiery and changeable, gradually deciding that she 
			would like to stay with one man and one man only. I'm sure she was 
			probably glad to throw the teasing comb away after this film, 
			though.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Time has been somewhat kind to both 
			Sommer and Bardot's careers. Bardot famously ended her film career 
			in 1974 (in her last big feature role, she, literally, sent her 
			screen persona up in flames), devoting herself to the foundation she 
			set up for the protection of animals. (And taking time to write a 
			memoir -- which is another story.) Sommer is still active as a 
			performer, having appeared in two noteworthy Mario Bava films, 
			including <i>Lisa and the Devil</i>, with its remarkable dreamlike 
			structure, and giving a chilling performance as Magda Goebbles in 
			the miniseries <i>Inside the Third Reich</i>, opposite Rutger Hauer 
			and Derek Jacobi.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And <i>Sweet Ecstasy</i> contains 
			one scene where two water-skiers tear off across the Bay of Cannes, 
			the U.S. Navy's Mediterranean fleet clearly visible in the 
			background, while, on the soundtrack, Johnny Hallyday can be heard 
			howling, &quot;Il faut saisir sa chance quand elle passe&quot; -- seize the 
			chance when she comes. You can't get more blissfully Sixties than 
			that.</font></td>
