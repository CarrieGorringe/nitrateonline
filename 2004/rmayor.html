            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>, 11 June 2004</i></font><p class="MsoNormal">
			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">My last encounter with George 
			Hickenlooper was his excursion into an ill-fated fictional arena. (&quot;<i>The 
			Man From Elysian Fields</i> is a cold, bliss-less work that groans 
			along thinking itself some important comment on how life throws us 
			some beguiling curves.&quot;) George, who takes his criticism like a 
			saint, sent me a single sentence email &quot;I'm sorry you didn't like my 
			picture.&quot; As George is the one of less than a handful of filmmakers 
			(let alone my readers) who ever responded personally to me, I 
			emailed him back a promising &quot;Maybe next time.&quot;</font></b></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Well, next time 
			is here, and the director-writer is back in exemplary documentary 
			mode (<i>Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker's Apocalypse</i>) with an 
			entertaining look at one of La-La-Land's most unusual figures, an 
			increasingly sad personality heretofore unknown to the likes of 
			cultural (and especially east coast) music nomads such as myself, 
			but probably just as unfamiliar to many other, more enlightened 
			folk, particularly those not residing in what I like to call the 
			Other Planet, but which is more commonly called Los Angeles.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Despite it's 
			title implications, <i>The Mayor of Sunset Strip</i> is not about a 
			local politico, although the life of pop star impresario Rodney 
			Bingenheimer, as explored in this 96-minute retrospective covers a 
			waifish man-child up the alternative music ladder to where he is 
			today—a fifty-something on the verge of being cast-off in a society 
			that, like too many television executives, is concerned about 
			demographics, of appealing to that 18-24 (i.e, the kids with the 
			money) market.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Rodney is the man 
			who would promote a thousand (well, maybe a few less) unknown punk 
			rock bands into superstar status. He's unselfishly furthered other 
			now-mainstream attractions that, yes, I do recognize. Damn it, I 
			have their music on my iPod, too. As the Prince of Pop atop a 
			20-year reign as a KROQ radio personality, Rodney's slim frame and 
			small stature belie a bulging rolodex that reads like a who's who of 
			rockdom. He knows &quot;them&quot; all, the folks who have adorned countless 
			covers of <i>Rolling Stone</i>, and then, he knows some more. He 
			introduced America, or made it really, really want to listen to such 
			luminaries as David Bowie, Blondie, The Ramones, The Sex Pistols, 
			Van Halen, The Go-Go's, Joan Jett, Dramarama, No Doubt, Coldplay, 
			and Oasis. My affinity for listening to all-news radio had me miss 
			out, until now, an American classic, a top-tier DJ who has launched 
			many a musical battleship.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hickenlooper says 
			he caught first notice of his film's subject when he turned on a 
			radio late one night and heard a unique, high-pitched, child-like 
			voice unlike other standard-issue baritone announcers. Personally, I 
			think he realized that he and Rodney both had the same number of 
			letters in their names. Karma.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The movie follows 
			the radio wonder about town and fills in choice historical tidbits. 
			Child of a failed marriage, tossed out in the streets as a teenager, 
			but still a child devoted to his sailor dad and shapely, waitress 
			mom. We see rock concert footage of Rodney introducing a main 
			attraction, of him schmoozing with Nancy Sinatra (who considers him 
			a &quot;sweet boy&quot;), of home movies of him growing up in Mountain View, 
			and driving around in an aging Nova. We share a pack rat's personal 
			mementos, walls of memorabilia and gold records, a kitchen cluttered 
			with empty Coca-Cola bottles, his mother's ashes nearby. We turn the 
			pages of his family photo albums, meet his famous friends and his 
			childhood acquaintances. We cringe at his frugal lifestyle (his 
			favorite restaurant isn't Spago, which opened just about the same 
			time Rodney took to the airwaves, but Denny's and IHOP), and revel 
			in his interesting connection to The Monkees. Seems he auditioned 
			when that rock quartet was being manufactured in the fall of 1965; 
			he missed the final cut (duh), but made some bucks as David Jones' 
			double. This gig also made him an unlikely groupie/babe magnet; 
			allowing him to get laid by association with some of the 
			generation's hottest acts. We watch Rodney popping up in old 
			television shows (arrows humorously point his mop top out), 
			frolicking in the love and peace 1970s, becoming a cuddly guy in the 
			1980s, and championing underground music for two decades. We get 
			filmed testimonials from Cher (Hickenlooper superimposes her name on 
			the bottom of the screen, just in case you don't know who she is), 
			David Bowie, Ray Manzarek (of The Doors), Mick Jagger, Alice Cooper, 
			among others.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hickenlopper 
			follows Rodney around town as a friend (they've known each other 
			since 1997), not as someone examining something under an E! 
			microscope. There's a growing warmth as each frame unreels. He gets 
			his &quot;star&quot; to reflect on his life, past and present, with some 
			terrific anecdotes about the L.A. club scene. The director has an 
			occasional off-screen voice-over, as interviewer, trying to get 
			deeper into his subject, even to asking him point blank if he's 
			worried about how he'll come off in this film. Rodney, without a 
			lawyer's assistance, smartly provides no comment. What will be, will 
			be. Sure, we finally see Rodney raise an eyebrow and get hopping mad 
			at former Dramarama (which Rodney helped to find fame and fortune) 
			band member Chris Carter, one of the film's producers, when Carter 
			takes a DJ job with KROQ's competitor. Rodney's anger rises as deep 
			as the virtual knife is jabbed in his back.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Although not 
			entirely bittersweet, there is a pale sadness that rises up in the 
			film's throat in its final third. <i>Mayor of the Sunset Strip</i> 
			is a nostalgic merry-go-round. It's quaint, charming, and often 
			entrancing. You're riding the best horse on the ride. And the music 
			couldn't be better.</font></td>
