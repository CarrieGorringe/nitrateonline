            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 23 January 2004</i></font><p>
			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Viewing <i>Win a Date with Tad 
			Hamilton!</i> is about like watching a marginally talented relative 
			in a school play. It's foolish to expect Tony Award caliber results, 
			but you feel at least some pleasure in seeing the cast and crew get 
			through the process without any glaring slipups. You might be able 
			to count genuine highlights on the fingers of one hand, but they are 
			there.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Australian director Robert Luketic 
			(<i>Legally Blonde</i>) appears to be aiming for modest goals and 
			generally meets them. There are light chuckles throughout but 
			nothing that couldn't have been accomplished in the 30-minute 
			sitcoms that screenwriter Victor Levin (<i>Mad About You</i>) 
			usually pens or leading man Topher Grace (<i>That 70s Show</i>) 
			usually stars in.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Grace plays Pete, a grocery store 
			clerk from Fraziers Bottom, West Virginia who can't understand why 
			Rosalee Futch, the woman he's been pining for all his life, is so 
			enamored with film star Tad Hamilton (Josh Duhamel) and his sappy, 
			sweet films. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The fellow that Rosalee and her 
			amorous pal Cathy (Ginnifer Goodwin, <i>Mona Lisa Smile</i>) pine 
			after is a much different person when the cameras aren't rolling. A 
			spoiled partier who's constantly endangering his wholesome façade, 
			Tad has to change his act in order keep working.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At the behest of his beleaguered 
			handlers (Nathan Lane and Shawn Hayes), Tad agrees to take a lucky 
			fan on a date for a charity. Needless to say, Rosalee wins. </font>
			</p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At this point, giggles do come 
			despite the fact that the script appears to be written on tracing 
			paper: guessing how the film will go takes no effort. Helping 
			enormously is Grace's delightfully low-key take on Pete. When he 
			nervously warns Rosalee to guard her &quot;carnal treasure&quot; during her 
			time with Tad, it's his frustrated expression, not the line that 
			gets the laugh.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">From here, the film takes a mildly 
			interesting turn when Tad actually falls for Rosalee and the 
			seemingly uncluttered lifestyle she embodies. He actually moves to 
			her hometown and buys a house. This doesn't make Pete's unrequited 
			affection for her any less painful. To their credit, Duhamel, 
			Luketic and Levin avoid the obvious fish-out-of-water clichés (Tad 
			takes surprisingly well to his new surroundings). </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still, it might have been nice if 
			Luketic and Levin had come up with enough comic business to properly 
			fill the length. Bosworth is suitably earnest, but it might have 
			been more interesting if the more colorful Goodwin had been cast as 
			Rosalee or if Levin had awarded Cathy the date. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The mild satire that runs 
			throughout <i>Win a Date with Tad Hamilton!</i> sometimes works, but 
			for the most part doesn't have anything to say about small town life 
			or Tinseltown follies that hasn't been said better by say, oh, Billy 
			Wilder or maybe even Jay Leno on a rare good night.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's a shame that the material 
			reach up to the performers' level of talent. <i>Win a Date with Tad 
			Hamilton!</i> isn't as lame as most January releases, but it's 
			hardly a dream date.</font></td>
