			</font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>, 27 February 2004</i></font><p>
			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;No Europeans were harmed in the 
			making of this film.&quot;</font></b></p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Oh, that's supposed to be funny?</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Tell that to the 982 Frenchmen, 533 
			Germans, and 24 Italians who died of acute uglyamericanitis watching 
			this drivel at preview screenings last month. None of them were 
			teenagers.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And that youth market is exactly 
			where the makers of <i>Eurotrip</i> expect the fewest casualties, an 
			R-rated T&amp;A teaser (for sexuality, nudity, language and drug/alcohol 
			content) from the producers of <i>Road Trip</i> and <i>Old School</i>. 
			But not the director, Jeff Schaffer, a first time helmer who slaps 
			together four Hudson High (Ohio) School graduates, raging libidos, 
			rabid English soccer hooligans, robot mimes, a torture-obsessed 
			dominatrix (Lucy Lawless), nude beaches, hot-to-trot married 
			Europeans, kinky sex, sausage jokes, a &quot;Creepy Italian Guy&quot; (<i>SNL</i> 
			underling Fred Armisen), an absinthe-green fairy pixie, and the pope 
			(nothing's sacred) in a cross-continent expedition of mythically 
			nonsensical, albeit good-natured, proportions.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The springboard is Scotty Thomas 
			(Scott Mechlowicz), one love-struck lad who has fallen head over 
			internet heels for one bodacious German blonde-haired babe, Mieke 
			(Jessica Boehrs) after apparently being unceremoniously dumped at 
			graduation by trampy sweetheart Fiona (Kristn Kreuk) for a hunky 
			rock singer (Matt Damon, oh my god), who warbles a snappy song 
			(&quot;Scotty Doesn't Know&quot;) about the dumpee's disposability. I guess 
			Ben Folds' &quot;Song for the Dumped&quot; wasn't available.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Silly (and drunken) Scotty 
			unfortunately thinks that Mieke is a Mike and thus a male cyber pen 
			guy putting the whammy on him, hoping for some snuggle up, summer 
			time boy-on-boy romance. Lo and behold, Mr. America is red-blooded 
			heterosexual, and instead disses her in a ranting email, which leads 
			to the breaking of screenwriting rule number 1. Writer/producers
			<span style="color:black">Schaffer, Alec Berg, and David Mandel (who 
			screwed up, massively, translating Dr. Seuss's immortal classic <i>
			The Cat in the Hat</i>) have Mieke block Scotty's email address. Now 
			kids (at least those in <i>Eurotrip</i>) may not be terribly smart, 
			but nearly every person (even those in the Midwest) under 30 is well 
			versed in traveling the world wide web. When Scotty hits the send 
			button and later realizes his error (so much for getting in 
			blondie's hot pants), he tells his bosom-obsessed buddy and 
			soon-to-be traveling companion Cooper Harris (Jacob Pitts) that her 
			phone number is unlisted and he's left only to pay a personal visit 
			to Berlin to rectify the situation.</span></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color:black">OK, bear 
			me out. Mieke blocks ONE email address. Dummie Scotty doesn't think 
			to use ANOTHER screen name to contact and apologize. Or send 
			flowers, chocolates, or a new BMW? Maybe he's confusing mail 
			blocking with spam filtering? That Mieke is now sending everything 
			with the word Scotty in it to the junk heap? No, I think not. The 
			whole premise for the movie just got shot down in Act One.</span></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The two boys scrounge up enough 
			money ($118) together to catch a plane as far as London, figuring to 
			thumb a ride the rest of the way, and fill out a movie that would 
			otherwise be quite a bit shorter. They team up with fellow h.s. 
			mates Jenny (Michelle Trachtenberg, a.k.a. Dawn, Buffy's sister on&nbsp;
			<i>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</i>) and her up-tight twin brother Jamie 
			(Travis Webster), wherein the quartet experience drugs, sex, and 
			rock-n-roll as they attempt to wreck more embarrassment on Europe 
			than humanly possible.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Along their travels I discovered 
			screenwriting error number 2. Cooper has a cell phone that connects 
			him with a law firm in Ohio where he is a paid intern. His boss 
			believes the youngster is downstairs in the filing room. Right, and 
			I have a bridge to sell you. The kid gets a call either late morning 
			or early afternoon. Time difference between France and Ohio: six 
			hours. So, say 2 PM French time equals 8 AM Ohio time. Ding, ding, 
			ding! You do the math and tell me what lawyer is checking up on an 
			intern that early in the morning.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Peppered by a hip soundtrack, and 
			brief CGI sightseeing glimpses of London, Paris, Rome (where the 
			Coliseum is miraculously around the corner from the Vatican!), 
			Amsterdam, and beautiful (not!) downtown Bratislava (where poor Rade 
			Serbedzija pops up as a taxi driver navigating the city's war-torn 
			streets), <i>Eurotrip</i> was actually &quot;filmed entirely on location 
			in Prague&quot; according to the press notes. The foursome do add a 
			musketeer-like camaraderie to the blissfully short (92 minute) romp, 
			but the premise is thin and the jokes relatively lame. If you want 
			the real Europe, avoid <i>Eurotrip</i> and take a semester abroad.</font></td>
