			</font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan
            Lybarger</a>, 16 January 2004</i></font><p><b>
			<font face="Verdana" size="2">On paper, Randa Chahal-Sabbag's <i>The 
			Kite</i> would seem a typical story of teens from opposite sides of 
			the tracks who are doomed to fall madly in love. It's the kind of 
			familiar setup that could seemingly occur in any area or time 
			period. </font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What makes <i>The Kite</i> special 
			is its setting along the Golan Heights region of the current 
			Israeli-Lebanese border. In this environment, a <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>-style 
			match is more than unlikely, and some of the film's strongest 
			moments come from acknowledging that mere attraction won't 
			necessarily drive the distant lovers into each other's arms.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sabbag concentrates primarily on an 
			adventurous 15-year-old girl named Lamia (Flavia Bechara). Her 
			independent streak emerges early in the film when she chases after a 
			kite that has fallen on the Israeli side of the border near her 
			village. Her pursuit is both brave and foolhardy because she's 
			dodging mines, crawling through barbed wire and provoking nervous 
			Israeli soldiers who don't have any idea what to make of her 
			seemingly fatal pursuit.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Lamia's days of playing hooky from 
			school and goofing around with her brother Nabil are numbered 
			because the village's elders have determined she should marry her 
			cousin Samy. Her Druse community is split between the two sides of 
			the border, and all of the potential suitors are on the Israeli 
			side. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Marrying someone on the other side 
			means that Lamia will have to move there permanently. Because of the 
			armed checkpoint that the locals have to cross to get from one side 
			to the other, moving back and forth is a difficult proposition even 
			in calm times. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Watching over this arrangement is a 
			bored 17-year-old Israeli reservist named Youssef (Maher Bsaibes). 
			The locals don't have phones and can't casually stroll from one side 
			to the other to chat, so the people on both sides pick up megaphones 
			to yell messages back to each other. Because he, like them, is Druse, 
			Youssef, perched in his watchtower, has the odious task of jotting 
			down everything they say to each other. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The locals certainly notice Youssef, 
			but his Israeli uniform immediately fills them with contempt. Even 
			Lamia, who fancies the lad from afar, finds his involvement in the 
			&quot;enemy's&quot; army shameful. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">From here, Sabbag could have taken 
			her story into tediously overplayed territory but thankfully 
			doesn’t. The writer-director has described her film as a somewhat 
			stylized presentation of the situation at the border. In <i>The Kite</i>, 
			the conflict is presented a potentially volitile situation that 
			winds up becoming, at times, absurdly comic.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sabbag doesn’t deny the tragedies 
			that have occurred in the region and can’t be accused of 
			whitewashing them. For obvious reasons, she filmed <i>The Kite</i> 
			in<i> </i>a more tranquil region that’s geographically similar to 
			the Golan Heights. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Nonetheless, Sabbag concentrates on 
			her characters’ surprising quirks than on any ideologies. When the 
			women on Lamia’s side of the border disparage the scarf a woman on 
			the other side has purchased. At first, they express disgust that 
			she bought it on the Israeli side. But it later turns out that they 
			are dismayed because she could have bought something snazzier in 
			another Israeli city.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In addition, Samy, who would be an 
			unbearable ogre in most European or American movies, is an earnestly 
			likable lad who tries to make the disastrous marriage work. At 
			times, a viewer almost loses sympathy for Lamia because she has been 
			treating the undeserving Samy with contempt ever since she was 
			forced to make a prenuptial videotape.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It can take a while to get oriented 
			into <i>The Kite</i> because some of the cultural idiosyncrasies are 
			little tough to figure out, and because Sabbag diverts the viewers 
			attention for sideplots and dream sequences. This isn’t necessarily 
			a flaw because in the world Sabbag has created, the animosities are 
			so strong that it’s an adventure to merely fantasize about loving 
			someone from the other side.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Nonetheless, you won’t need a tour 
			guide to appreciate Sabbag’s humor or her affection for her 
			characters. <i>The Kite</i> took home three awards at last year’s 
			Venice Film Festival, and it’s the official Lebanese candidate for 
			this year’s Best Foreign Language Oscar. Sabbag’s uniquely Lebanese 
			take on life and love in the middle of conflict has a refreshingly 
			orignal appeal that crosses some formidable barriers.</font></td>
