            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by <a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias
            Savada</a>, 16 January 2003</i></font>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">I had already 
			written the first paragraph of this review minutes before the 
			preview screening had started. Hey, the trailer (since changed) gave 
			the impression this was some insipid frat-boy comedy heavy on toilet 
			and blind pet humor. Plus, it was a January release, generally 
			considered a dumping ground for the worst of the year's films. I 
			dreaded this arrival, not because&nbsp; it was from writer-director John 
			Hamburg (<i>Safe Men</i>, co-writer of <i>Meet the Parents</i> and
			<i>Zoolander</i>), but rather, expecting the worse, it would be a 
			sad reprise of last year's Ben Stiller fiasco <i>Duplex</i>, which 
			had easily made my ten-worse list of 2003. At best, I alluded to the 
			New York Mets and how every New Yorker marveled at the resiliency of 
			the 1969 version of that baseball team's rise from the ashes near 
			the bottom of the previous year's National League's standings to win 
			its first world series. Which season would <i>Along Came Polly</i> 
			fall into? Feast, or famine.</font></b></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Well, suffice to 
			say that <i>Polly</i> doesn't strike out. It's a solid two-base hit. 
			One for Stiller, the other for his co-star, <i>Friends</i>' Jennifer 
			Aniston. I'll also add in half a base for Philip Seymour Hoffman, 
			who does a marvelous spin as an ex-Brat Pack child actor turned 
			morosely self-involved schlub. His Sandy Lyle is, as often is 
			Hoffman's case, a scene-stealer, transfixing upon the audience a 
			perverted scheme to reinvent himself as a once and future star. He's 
			been suffering through decades trying to reclaim the glory that was 
			his following the release of the nonsensical nonentity <i>Crocodile 
			Tears</i>, a running gag title--not to mention that most fans think 
			he is dead (not a great ego booster)--that places it alongside John 
			Hughes' <i>The Breakfast Club</i>, when a look-alike poster shows up 
			within the film. He's vile, disgusting, egotistical, and Reuben's 
			best friend. But when it comes to eating pizza, he's the last person 
			you want to share a greasy pie with.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hank Azaria, 
			himself no stranger to thespian one-up-man-ship (witness his Agador 
			Spartacus, the Guatemalan houseboy, in Mike Nichols' <i>The Birdcage</i>), 
			never looked better, physically, as the buff, bronzed, and 
			long-haired Claude, a mentally-fractured French scuba instructor. 
			(My wife was convinced that Azaria's body was computer generated.) 
			The experienced diver is prone to discoveries involving the carnal 
			treasures of the opposite sex. His latest undersea expedition 
			uncovers the tropical attire of Debra Messing's Lisa Kramer, a.k.a 
			the bride of Reuben Feffer (Stiller), on the couple's St. Barts 
			honeymoon. Reuben's boss, Stan Indursky, is a flatulently outspoken 
			Jewish caricature (played with vulgar outspokenness by Alec Baldwin) 
			who does little to lift his abandoned-on-his-honeymoon employee's 
			diminishing fortitude. Oh, the humiliation!</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The pick-me-up 
			arrives via serendipity, when Reuben spots Polly Prince (Aniston), 
			an old seventh grade classmate and present-day carefree spirit who's 
			pouring wine (red, white, together) for patrons at a party she's 
			waiting. Far-fetched, you might say, that you'd run into someone 
			that distant in your past AND recognize them. Yeah, but it's called 
			a short cut to some people (the scriptwriter), or a shortcoming to 
			others, me included. I'll allow the benefit of doubt this and a few 
			other times, but the dumbest sequence in the film I forecast within 
			seconds: when you KNOW Reuben is going to drive his rental car 
			backwards into the sands of the Caribbean after he's been ditched by 
			his insecure bride.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Using a script 
			that relies too much on coincidence and fails to develop the 
			chemistry of its eccentric characters beyond their, well, eccentric 
			natures, means that Hamburg forces a pair of seemingly opposites to 
			attract. Reuben, a senior risk assessment analyst for a high-octane 
			insurance company, has sad cases of introverted, puppy love 
			butterflies and, more seriously and probably with too much comic 
			relief, Irritable Bowel Syndrome. On the flip side of the equation 
			is the worldly waitress Polly, whose penchant for spicy food and a 
			sight-impaired ferret takes its toll on their budding relationship. 
			Embarrassment, commitment issues (as pertaining to Reuben's failed 
			marriage), and Reuben's inability to tell Polly how her cuisine 
			selection flagrantly takes its toll on his digestive tract. He may 
			be interested in using his statistical computer assessment model on 
			both of the women in his life (or on a wise-cracking, 
			volcano-jumping, heli-skiing, earth-moving Australian bazillionaire 
			businesman, played by Bryan Brown, Reuben's company is trying to 
			insure), he never inserts himself into the program. Maybe his 
			workaholic, neurotic personality would have crashed t&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; he 
			system.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Putting the 
			inadequacies of the screenplay aside, Stiller does capture the 
			phobic essence of his character, and Aniston, having shown us that 
			she can successfully adapt to big-screen life outside (and, 
			soon-to-be, after) <i>Friends</i>, having successfully crossed over 
			to believable roles in the Jim Carrey comedy <i>Bruce Almighty</i> 
			and Miguel Arteta's blue collar indie <i>The Good Girl</i>. The 
			inevitably comic situation set-ups may not cover a lot of emotional 
			territory, but there is an earnest decision by both stars, 
			particularly Stiller, to carry their roles beyond the goofball 
			shenanigans thrust upon them.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For a January 
			release, <i>Along Came Polly</i> is an engaging trifle, flatulently 
			overwritten yet filled with enough eccentric characters and comic 
			timing to make it worth the risk.</font></td>
