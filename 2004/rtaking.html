            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 20 March 2003</i></font><p>
			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">When we first see Angelina Jolie, 
			she is lying in a grave. Not her's, someone else's. In <i>Taking 
			Lives</i>, she plays Illeana Scott, an F.B.I. profiler who, by 
			performing acts such as this, is able to determine that the grave, 
			found during excavation on a construction site, was dug to a very 
			specific length and width, and was made by someone who wanted to be 
			caught (hence the construction site locale). Her colleagues are 
			baffled.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The story has her character winging 
			to Montreal to help the local Sureté find a, yawn, serial killer, 
			and the filmmakers have the good sense to surround Jolie from the 
			start with three really good actors -- Tcheky Karyo (excellent in 
			last year's <i>The Good Thief</i>), Olivier Martinez, and, in his 
			first screen appearance in a while (at least around here), Jean-Hugues 
			Anglade (looking a little gaunt, but it has been over ten years 
			since <i>Betty Blue</i>). As policemen, their characters tend to 
			look just a little bit condescendingly at Illeana, which she defuses 
			with some ripostes in a couple of scenes that are genuinely funny . 
			In fact, the film, despite a tendency to try and create dramatic 
			tension and mood by having long stretches of dialogue delivered at a 
			near-mutter, turns out to be rather enjoyable for a time. The 
			director D.J. Caruso shows, as he did previously in <i>The Salton 
			Sea</i>, an ability to find the unusual in everyday surroundings 
			(and vice versa), and he can get an is-it-this, is-it-that? 
			speculation going and maintain it in an admirable fashion. As a 
			result, you give the film a lot of latitude, but there are also some 
			good things to be found in their own right. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ethan Hawke seems to have loosened 
			up, for the better, as an actor, playing an artist who spotted the 
			killer and even tried to save one of the victims, and there's one 
			remarkable scene between him and a character played by Kiefer 
			Sutherland who at first may be the murderer, but may also be after 
			the artist for something else. Gena Rowlands appears as a woman who 
			brings in a whole set of circumstances involving twin brothers, 
			possible dark secrets involving abuse, and a son whom she openly 
			tells the police is dangerous. (The elevator scene she appears in 
			provides the one really good, honest jolt in the film.) A 
			pre-credits sequence, a whole story in itself during which we see a 
			perfectly nice guy obliterated in a way which caused you to regard 
			it as perfectly heinous, is beautifully executed and sets things up 
			just so for everything that follows.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The scenes where characters are 
			shown skulking around through dank, semi-lit rooms full of 
			maundering furnishings and perfidies bring to mind similar odysseys 
			in <i>Seven</i>, but, with the display and examination of cadaver 
			photographs and even some cadavers themselves, corpses seem to have 
			become some sort of &quot;de rigueur&quot; stroke at the moment -- as if 
			displaying an inurement to ruined or decomposing flesh were some 
			sort of badge of initiation. (One of the reasons why it occasionally 
			strikes one as odd that no less than Philip Glass was obtained to 
			provide the music for the film, rather like seeing his name pop up 
			in the opening credits for <i>Candyman</i> 12 years ago. Glass' 
			music for <i>Taking Lives</i> isn't quite up there with his 
			shimmering, classic score for <i>Mishima</i>, but it's perfectly 
			fine otherwise.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But, oh, guys and gals, there is 
			the ending. Just about the only thing that has been said about this 
			film in advance was that it contained a real big surprise in the 
			very last scene. It's a surprise, alright. I haven't had such a 
			reaction to a movie in a theater since Jim Belushi turned up alive 
			at the end of <i>Traces of Red</i>. Aside from that (what? you think 
			I'm going to pull a spoiler, here?), the conclusion contains the 
			somewhat distasteful element of a man striking a terrified, and 
			pregnant, woman repeatedly, and in such a way so that she always 
			lands on the floor front-first. (Actually, that's alright, <i>
			because</i>... Ahem, that's all we're going to say about that.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As Illeana, Angelina Jolie, 
			speaking with a voice that bears just a little of the pang of her 
			Lara Croft accent, looks like she has prepared impeccably for her 
			role, but I also wonder if that is also putting a buffer between her 
			and the audience. Some actors immerse themselves in a role so fully, 
			but it is also so that they can express themselves emotionally in an 
			honest, truthful, and vibrant manner. In <i>Taking Lives</i>, Jolie 
			doesn't have that soft-focus, beautiful-on-a-pedestal quality that 
			she had, in full tilt, in <i>Beyond Borders</i>, where her work had 
			the opposite effect of making her look empirical rather than 
			believable. But it's still there, to some extent, in this picture. 
			Jessica Lange has related how, after the emotional work she put into
			<i>Frances</i>, Kim Stanley, with whom she worked in the picture, 
			advised her to make a comedy, right away. (Which she did: <i>Tootsie</i>.) 
			I'm still not ready to write off Angelina Jolie, but maybe she 
			should do a comedy?</font></td>
