            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>, 7 May 2004</i></font><p class="MsoNormal">
			<font face="Verdana" size="2">
			<span style="color: black; font-weight: 700">With a sequel (<i>Games 
			People Play: Hollywood</i>) already in post-production and other 
			cities laying in (fear, joy, Jello) that award-winning documentary 
			filmmaker James Ronald Whitney (<i>Just, Melvin: Just Evil</i>) may 
			send up their town, in the presumably singularly 
			one-cheap-trick-pony way of his initial effort <i>Games People Play: 
			New York</i>, just remember who Whitney is playing his game on: 
			Y-O-U. The film, which dragged itself into Washington's new E Street 
			Cinema (the second multiplex opened here by Landmark) on April 9th 
			and whimpered out a few weeks later, was welcomed by a local casting 
			call for the planned <i>Games People Play: The Bible Belt</i>. 
			Whitney strips away the gloss (and a good many of the contestants' 
			clothes) in this &quot;pilot&quot; for a way-off-network reality game show. 
			Beyond the titillation, there's not much to recommend the film, shot 
			over a 72-hour period and offering a $10,000 prize to the barest 
			(soul and otherwise) of them all. The only way anyone in the 
			audience will win is if they walk out on the film, seek out 
			management, and ask for their money back.</span></font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">
			<span style="color:black">This 97-minute &quot;documentary&quot; certainly has 
			a bite, but that's the problem. It's just one bite. When you're 
			hungry for something (new, erotic, comic), all you get is another 
			absurdist variation on what's already airing out there on today's 
			survival-fear factor-temptation island television grid. Back in 
			2001, director-writer Daniel Minahan took the genre to a whole new 
			dimension with <i>Series 7: The Contenders</i>, the first truly 
			original send-up of the survivor-based shows, with a deadly dose of 
			gladiator humor.&quot; With <i>Games</i>, it's time to bury reality 
			take-offs once and for all.</span></font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">
			<span style="color:black">Taking the dawn-to-dusk approach, Whitney 
			starts out one Thursday with the pre-audition queue in Tribeca, New 
			York City, and finishes off Sunday night with the winners being 
			named and the wool being pulled over our eyes. In the pre-selection 
			line outside the staging area from which six finalists ultimately 
			will be selected, a good many contestants, suitcases in hand, get 
			pissed off and tossed back on the street. They're not attractive 
			enough for even the first round of &quot;America's most uninhibited game 
			show.&quot; Sorry, Christine, the red clown nose didn't work for the 
			judges: television therapist</span> Dr. Gilda Carle (featured in 
			Whitney's <span style="color:black">Emmy-winning HBO documentary <i>
			Telling Nicholas</i></span>) and 
			actor-singer-entertainer-writer-producer Jim Caruso.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So while that 
			muffled, canned game show music plays in the background, the 
			auditions move forward in the foreplay, er, foreground with the 
			handsome twenty-somethings striking pretty poses, searching for low 
			budget fortune and fame. Briefly, they get a chance early on to 
			relive a painful, life-wrenching experience in their past: eating 
			disorders, suicide, rape, sodomy, etc. Basically, baring their inner 
			souls before shedding their outer garments. As this film is about 
			inhibitions, or lack thereof, the naked rumps, bare chests, rustled 
			hair, and more (or less, actually) greets &quot;Hour 4&quot; when there's a 
			honeymoon scene with an erotic &quot;final cut decider.&quot; More hijinks 
			ensue.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Bare butts, 
			russled hair, and true life moments more and less allow for the 
			judges to whittle down the 250 &quot;actors&quot; to the six who occupy most 
			of the driver's seat during the last hour. They are known as Joshua 
			Coleman (a Tourette's Syndrome survivor), bulimic Dani Marco, gay 
			dancer/male escort David Maynard, Scott Ryan (who would rather not 
			have David hitting on him), Sarah Smith (who earns high marks for 
			her chewing gum placement in a foot fetish episode), and parentally 
			abused Elisha Imani Wilson. The rest of the film plays out such 
			fantasies as the men asking complete strangers in Times Square for 
			urine samples (and getting a signed release); while the ladies 
			engage in (toilet) stall tactics, soliciting their women's room 
			neighbors for toilet paper, name, astrological sign, and bra sizes 
			in increasing point amounts. Candid Camera eyeglass cameras are de 
			rigeur, particularly in a segment called the &quot;Naked Trio,&quot; involving 
			two men (one a stranger), one woman, and a music stand. And a signed 
			release, of course. Another game is labeled &quot;Delivery Boy's Dream&quot; 
			turned nightmare.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The whole affair 
			is rather tawdry (and the film is being released un-rated). The 
			banal lyrics play up &quot;making love on camera in <i>Games People Play</i>,&quot; 
			but the reality of this film is a full-frontal, soft-core put-on. 
			The players are real (or are they), it's <i>Games People Play: New 
			York</i> that is a bit stranger in the head. One certainty in this 
			film: if you've sat through the entire film, you've lost the game.</font></td>
