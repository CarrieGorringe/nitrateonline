            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>, 27 February 2003</i></font><p>
			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">No doubt someone of the wrong 
			mindset or age who stumbles into <i>The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra</i> 
			will fume with dismay at the cheesy sets, hammy acting, dreadfully 
			low-tech &quot;special effects,&quot; black-and-white photography, glorious 
			monophonic sound, and atrocious script. Hopefully, most of you 
			should get the joke, like I did. We're the ones guffawing at this 
			deadpan send-up of the 1950s low-budget, B-movie science 
			fiction/horror films that we watched at drive-ins as kids, caught in 
			a film history class, Tivoed off the Sci-Fi Network, or discovered 
			in a public domain DVD megapack offering more creature features for 
			a price approaching the cost of a matinee ticket.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you don't get it from the 
			wink-wink hint &quot;Filmed in the miracle of Skeletorama&quot; qualification 
			as the film starts, there's that dupey two-color (i.e., black and 
			white) look of an old 15-chapter serial, and the inane, 
			tongue-deeply-in-cheek dialogue.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Betty: &quot;Scenery is lovely to look 
			at.&quot;</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Paul: &quot;If you like scenery.&quot;</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Oops, let me introduce our key 
			players, portraying Betty and Paul Armstrong. Where are my manners!
			<i>Lost Skeleton</i>'s director-writer (also a playwright and 
			artist) <span style="color:black">Larry Blamire</span> is Dr. Paul 
			Armstrong (&quot;I'm a scientist.&quot;). He's such a dedicated scientist that 
			he belittles himself for his inability to appreciate life's simpler 
			things, like cabins, or bicycles. His June Cleaver wife is portrayed 
			by Faye Masterson as a prim, caring woman, sexy in a 1950s way, 
			although the &quot;action&quot; is set in 1961. (Well there's a hint of 
			sensuality, but this is a perfectly prudish PG rated title.) Betty 
			happily tags along with her husband in search of a fallen meteor. 
			Out in the woods, the ever-smiling pair, who barely revel in their 
			poised ineptitude, are the kind of couple who gladly would have 
			displayed the modern conveniences of the Popeil Veg-O-Matic, that 
			late night, 1960s multi-purpose food cutter. (As Seen on TV!) 
			Blamire's dedication to the skewering he does to the genre is so 
			proper that not a speak of dirt dishevels Betty's polka-dot dress 
			and cardigan sweater, an outfit she wears day after day as she 
			accompanies her husband in his peculiar scientific quest. Because 
			that's what a scientist and his wife do. Not a hair on her 
			well-sprayed head moves out of place when she's absconded by the 
			dreaded three-eyed mutant (are those pants and shoes that actor 
			Darrin Reed is wearing?). And not a pearl is torn off her lovely 
			necklace. Don't forget those unscuffed high heels.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Who else is out camping in the 
			countryside in search of the outer space chunk and the atmosphereum 
			it contains? What the heck is atmosphereum? It's rare and 
			everyone—in the film—needs it. (Accept it or I'll sick a mutant on 
			you.) Dr. Roger Fleming (Brian Howe), the self-important &quot;mad 
			scientist&quot; character seeking the eponymous creation and falling 
			under the evil spell of that bony frame, an ominous voice-over who 
			needs atmosphereum to regain his exterior and overpower the world. 
			There's also Kro-Bar (Andrew Parks) and Lattis (Susan McConnell), 
			two human-looking aliens aboard a marooned spacecraft, which looks 
			like a painted paper towel tube because it probably is. That mutant 
			roaming about is an escaped pet of the extra-terrestrials. Jennifer 
			Blaire (Blamire's real-life wife) fills the paws of Animala, an 
			amalgam of four morphed forest animals (courtesy of a spackle, er. 
			space gun, er transmutatron) whose lack of table manners is made up 
			with the sensual look of an Apache dancer. Finally, we have Ranger 
			&quot;I don't believe in anything&quot; Brad (Dan Conroy), a lonely forest 
			ranger who suffers a (thankfully off screen) fate worse than a 
			horrible mutilation.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As for the meteor, which bears a 
			close relationship to upside-down cake? Don't worry. Paul finds a 
			safe place for it. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The joke, which you'd think might 
			wear out, is sustained fairly well by Blamire and his exuberantly 
			stoic cast, only flattening out in the middle of the film, but 
			returning for a crazed finale. With enough room left for tapioca!</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">No effort was spared to hide the 
			cheesiness of the effects and set design. And don't those strings 
			attached to the skeleton look amazingly real! The budget, somewhere 
			in the thousands of dollars (the skeleton was picked up off ebay for 
			$100), shows every penny on the screen. Look, there's one in front 
			of Betty right now! Obviously if you haven't gotten this schlock 
			shock parody by now, you won't…until you've become a victim of the 
			lost skeleton. Coming next, <i>The Trail of the Screaming Forehead</i>. 
			Honest. Maybe.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Columbia Pictures' TriStar unit, 
			which has the good fortune to champion the film's release, added a 
			lovely 7-minute Technicolor short subject, <i>Skeleton Frolic</i>, 
			before the feature. This 1937 release is a perfect complement 
			created by Ub Iwerks, a master animator who worked on the early 
			Mickey Mouse and Silly Symphonies cartoons. Columbia repertory 
			executive Michael Schlesinger (a devoted film fan who also directed, 
			uncredited. that studio's English language adaptation of <i>Godzilla 
			2000</i>) was the real driving force behind the film's expanding 
			release. Columbia: Give Mike a promotion. Everyone else: Go see <i>
			The Lost Skeleton of Cadavra</i>.</font></td>
