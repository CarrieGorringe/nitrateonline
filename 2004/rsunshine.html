			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's no secret that screenwriter 
			Charlie Kaufman is a clever writer. At times, Kaufman practically 
			advertises his wit. </font></b></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For example, in 
			Spike Jonze's <i>Adaptation</i>, he penned a movie about not being 
			able to adapt a book into a film and got away with it. He even had 
			the gall to make the lead character a warped version of himself and 
			to add in a make-believe twin brother for good measure. If that 
			weren't enough, he shifted perspective so that each Kaufman brother 
			took over the narrative at different times.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kaufman should 
			have fallen flat on his face with all the self-referential humor, 
			but instead fully earned an Oscar nomination for both himself and 
			his imaginary brother. No small feat.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kaufman might 
			have awed us with his finesse, but he didn't always make viewers 
			care. It was a bit difficult to get worked up over whether Nicolas 
			Cage would get his script done in <i>Adaptation</i> of if Chuck 
			Barris (Sam Rockwell) could eventually find his soul in <i>
			Confessions of a Dangerous Mind</i>.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thankfully, 
			Kaufman and the MTV-trained and French director Michel Gondry (who 
			helmed Kaufman's <i>Human Nature</i>) have easily overcome that 
			obstacle with <i>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</i>. 
			Kaufman's narrative gymnastics are still here. The film is told out 
			of chronological order, and the intricately enigmatic opening only 
			makes sense after you've completed the film.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In addition, he 
			and Gondry have created some deeply flawed but sympathetic 
			characters and have imbued the film with a romanticism that's 
			strangely compatible with the weirdness.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Offbeat, but 
			surprisingly effective casting helps. Jim Carrey and Kate Winslet (a 
			pairing that on paper seems weirder than the portal in <i>Being John 
			Malkovich</i>) play Joel Barrish and Clementine Kruczynski, a couple 
			whose two-year relationship has floundered. </font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Tiring of doing 
			little else but arguing with Joel, she secretly goes to Lacuna, Inc. 
			to get her memories of him permanently erased from her mind. When 
			Joel discovers he's been both dumped and &quot;deleted,&quot; he storms in the 
			clinic and walks out actually considering the same procedure for 
			himself.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The chairman and 
			founder of Lacuna is the brilliant Dr. Howard Mierzwiak (Tom 
			Wilkinson), who is as talented a salesman as he is a scientist. 
			Joel, not wanting to spend another Valentine's Day alone brooding 
			over the breakup and the snub, goes along with the procedure.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Unfortunately, 
			the doctor himself isn't doing the procedure. Instead, his 
			maladroit, lazy underlings (Kirsten Dunst, Mark Ruffalo, and Elijah 
			Wood) have been left alone with Joel. As they proceed (in a haze of 
			drugs and hormones), Joel becomes aware of his memories and suddenly 
			falls in love with Clementine all over again and tries to save 
			what's left of his recollections, botching the treatment.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The union at its 
			best less than ideal (Joel is repressed, and Clementine is impulsive 
			and drinks heavily), but Joel’s fight to keep what’s left of his 
			subconscious is weirdly compelling and at times deeply moving. As he 
			demonstrated in <i>The Truman Show</i>, Carrey can play heartbreak 
			with the same conviction that he can perform a fart gag in one of 
			his regular comedies. In some ways, he’s more sympathetic when he’s 
			performing in a more low key film like this one because he seems 
			more human. His manic energy will probably prevent him from ever 
			being convincing as an Average Joe, but in this film his outbursts 
			seem less freakish and more empathetic.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It it’s a change 
			of pace to see Carrey playing it straight, it’s a pleasant surprise 
			to see Winslet (sporting hair that's either blue or orange) handle 
			comedy. You can hear the British actress’s American accent slip a 
			couple of times, but she does seem to relish taking on a role that’s 
			more outrageous than Carrey’s.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent:0in">
			<font face="Verdana" size="2">In addition to coaching some terrific 
			performances all the way around, Gondry evokes a moody atmosphere 
			that's a nice complement to Kaufman's quirky whimsy. The sky is 
			usually cloudy, and the dwelling's and offices in the film look 
			convincingly lived in. The film doesn't look bland at all (with the 
			mopey but appropriate soundtrack and Ellen Kuras' grainy 
			cinematography that's not a possibility), but Gondry's quest for 
			style doesn't come at the expense of the story.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Another 
			interesting touch is that Gondry treats memory erasure not as 
			something exotic or high-tech, but instead presents Lacuna as an 
			ordinary outpatient clinic, albeit one with the most comically inept 
			support staff imaginable. </font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Gondry and 
			Kaufman may be getting a little philosophical here, too. The 
			bumblers who inadvertently torture Joel may literally sleep on the 
			job because the task itself is tempting but ultimately foolish. <i>
			Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</i> indicates that erasing 
			past horrors doesn't stop new ones from occurring, and that respect 
			of those we don't like may be more effective than neutralization.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kaufman, working 
			from an idea that he hatched with Gondry and French artist Pierre 
			Bismuth, reportedly spent somewhere in the neighborhood of three 
			years polishing this up while he was working on other projects. The 
			extra time is evident because there's a polish here that was absent 
			from <i>Human Nature</i> and <i>Confessions of a Dangerous Mind</i>, 
			and thankfully his old strengths still remain. There's a priceless 
			bit where Winslet encourages Carrey to have some booze stating, 
			&quot;It'll make the seduction less repugnant.&quot; </font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But it's nice to 
			see that he's decided to use his talent on something more rewarding 
			than simple mind games.</font></td>
