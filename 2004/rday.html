            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by
			<a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 4 June 2004</i></font><p>
			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The apocalyptic thriller <i>The Day 
			After Tomorrow</i> opens with a genuinely majestic traveling shot 
			that follows bits and pieces, large and small, of an ice flow back 
			to its source, an ice shelf on the Antarctic continent where three 
			dots that turn out to be a team of men can be observed. Are these 
			the scientists who will be instrumental in saving the human race in 
			the story that is to come? Wait a minute: they're DRILLING. Uh, 
			oh....</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But, wait again: one of them is 
			Jack Hall (Dennis Quaid), a climatologist who, with his two 
			colleagues, is taking core samples are part of findings that he will 
			present at an international conference in New Delhi, showing that 
			the polar ice caps have deteriorated to the point where a global 
			warming trend could start and create major changes in the planet's 
			weather. There is some talk about another ice age, some time off, 
			maybe in a hundred years, maybe a thousand. You don't want to start 
			a panic over these things. When Jack steps outside to meet a 
			colleague, Terry Rapson (the indispensable Ian Holm), there is a 
			light snowfall already in progress in New Delhi, and Japan is about 
			to get pelted by chunks of ice falling from the sky. Then the skies 
			darken over Los Angeles....</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Previously, the director Roland 
			Emmerich, working with Dean Devlin, brought us <i>Independence Day</i> 
			and a (disastrous) 1998 remake of <i>Godzilla</i>, films which used 
			the sight of mass annihilation and massive destruction in such a way 
			as to stoke the audience and give them something to get-off on, 
			again and again. <i>The Day After Tomorrow</i> takes a (plausible) 
			set up outlining what would happen if the planet was struck by a 
			catastrophic climate change, then goes one step further, showing 
			what would happen if the occurrence took place not over a matter of 
			aeons but over a matter of weeks, even days, from the manifestation 
			of multiple tornados to pressure changes which cause temperatures to 
			plummet in such a way as to flash-freeze everything, just like the 
			mammoth on display at the Natural History Museum in New York City 
			that Jack Hall's son, Sam (Jake Gyllenhaal), takes a gander at 
			before disaster strikes.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Anyone who spent any of their 
			formative years in the Seventies will be reminded, whether they like 
			it or not, of the ghosts of disaster movies past. You know what's 
			going to happen to two characters who exchange dialogue like, 
			&quot;Shouldn't you be monitoring the weather?&quot; &quot;This is L.A. What 
			weather?&quot; Jack's wife, Lucy (Sela Ward), is a pediatrician who must 
			tend after a child who cannot be moved without the aid of an 
			ambulance, a reminder of when Linda Blair grinned-and-beared-it as a 
			medical patient through most of&nbsp; <i>Airport 1975</i>. However, <i>
			Day After Tomorrow</i> moves gracefully through its multiple 
			plotlines involving Jack, Lucy, and Sam (Gyllenhaal again 
			distinguishes himself, showing how he can slip-across, as if by 
			sideways, a performance that proves ultimately solid and affecting), 
			who, with two friends, is attending an academic decathlon in New 
			York City just before the city is struck by a freak tsunami. There's 
			one beautiful shot of flocks of birds streaming through the skies, 
			and the subsequent images showing Manhattan being swept through and 
			submerged by tidal waters induce in one due amounts of awe and 
			terror.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">By comparison with the movies 
			Emmerich made earlier, <i>Day After Tomorrow</i> has one subtle but 
			distinct difference: some parts of the film may come across as hokey 
			to members of the audience (and they may be right), but there's 
			nothing hokey about the expression on Dennis Quaid's face when he 
			says that he made a promise to help his son, and he intends to be 
			true to his word (Quaid, with his performances in <i>Frequency</i>,
			<i>The Rookie</i>, and <i>Far from Heaven</i>, has turned into one 
			of our best actors around, right now); or in the way Ian Holm's 
			character says, hauntingly, to Quaid, &quot;Save as many as you can.&quot; At 
			times the camera turns to give us landscapes that have been 
			swallowed up by atomized debris or whited-out, and the film suddenly 
			fills up and becomes suffused with a mournful sense of melancholy 
			that's hard to shake-off or ignore. The picture may ostensibly be 
			about snow and ice and gales, but what it ends up being about is 
			interconnection, and the refusal of people to relinquish their sense 
			of humanity and compassion in the face of cataclysm. Given the 
			changes that have occurred in our social and political landscape 
			between now and when the <i>Godzilla</i> remake traipsed out, I 
			think this was entirely the right decision to go with. Movies can 
			function as a way to present us with a worse-case scenario, then 
			show how people can rise to the level of the occasion and overcome 
			it in the best way possible. <i>The Day After Tomorrow</i> may at 
			heart remain a pulp adventure thriller, but it seeks to shake us up 
			a little in a way that is legitimate, to reverse the 
			depersonalization that has been going on in movies of late, and to 
			recognize once more that cataclysm is something more than a lot of 
			light and noise timpaniing off of a theater auditorium screen.</font></td>
