            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 5 March 2004</i></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></b></font><p>
			<font face="Verdana" size="5">Parody</font></p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Director Philip Kaufman has made 
			a lot of entertainingly gutsy films like <i>The Great Northfield 
			Minnesota Raid</i>, <i>The White Dawn</i>, <i>The Right Stuff</i>,
			<i>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</i> and <i>Quills</i>. In all 
			of these flicks, he's managed to credit viewers with having brains 
			and to subvert and rework genres so the films are fresh and 
			creative.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">So what's he doing behind the helm 
			of <i>Twisted</i>? </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Apparently, even he needs to eat 
			once in a while.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The latest thriller starring Ashley 
			Judd is so tepidly by the book that it winds up becoming an 
			unintentional parody. Judd plays the type of female cop who seems to 
			exist only on screen. Jessica Shepard can clobber perps easily 
			(maybe excessively), but she has some personal issues that end her 
			upwardly mobile career. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As the film progresses, we learn 
			that she has apparently slept with half the male population of San 
			Francisco and frequently drinks her way into unconsciousness. How 
			she manages to keep up a well-toned bod with such a lethal regimen 
			is never fully answered.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The first real challenge she 
			encounters once she becomes a homicide inspector is a serial killer 
			whose crimes hit a little too close to home for Shepard. All of them 
			are former lovers and have the kind of beatings that she uses to 
			subdue criminals. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Because of her frequent lost 
			weekends and her family history (it seems Dad was a serial killer), 
			Jessica can't rule herself out as a suspect. Even she has doubts 
			about her innocence.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There's one clue that isn't 
			terribly incriminating, though. All the victims have cigarette burns 
			on their hands. Every San Franciscan in <i>Twisted</i> chain-smokes, 
			so it's not only a red herring but also a sign that Kaufman isn't 
			really committed. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Screenwriter Sarah Thorp (<i>See 
			Jane</i> <i>Run</i>) comes up with a workable setup, but Kaufman and 
			the cast seem to think that making a mainstream thriller requires 
			indifferent craftsmanship and the assumption that each viewer has 
			recently been lobotomized. A nasty misogynistic tone doesn't help 
			(can't Shepard be merely a competent professional instead of a 
			Freudian test case?).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's not enough for Shepard to 
			merely drop her car keys. She has to defy the laws of physics and 
			somehow release them in a way that makes them land out of reach 
			under the vehicle. Not only does this enable a dark figure to easily 
			creep up on her, it also gives her an opportunity to circumnavigate 
			her hand through a nest of rats. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The overkill of having both the 
			looming figure and those playful rodents generates more giggles than 
			chills. If that weren't enough to kill the tension of the scene, 
			Mark Isham's score (which seems more transposed than composed) 
			blares loudly as if it were advertising the attempted suspense. By 
			the time the killer's identity is revealed, viewers will either have 
			guessed it or stopped caring.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Both Andy Garcia as Shepard's 
			partner and Samuel L. Jackson as her mentor seem to be going through 
			the motions until more interesting gigs come along. Judd doesn't 
			seem that lucky. She's pretty much calcified her career with flicks 
			like this one.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kaufman's personal touch is 
			missing, as if he knew this thing wouldn't look good on a résumé. 
			The only signs that any entity other than computer was behind this 
			thing are a few scenes of mildly kinky groping (he did direct <i>
			Henry and June</i>) and a locale in Kaufman's hometown. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">On second thought, maybe there's 
			something symbolic about the sea lions that work their way into the 
			ending of the film. We may never know what is being symbolized, but 
			it ends the film on a funnier note than most of the alleged comedies 
			I've seen this year.</font></p>
