			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Winner of the Best Director 
			prize at this year's Sundance Film Festival, Morgan Spurlock's <i>
			Super Size Me</i> demonstrates graphically that fast food is bad for 
			you. If the idea is not so new, it's delivered in a manner that's 
			refreshingly aggressive, at once deliberate and antic. </font></b>
			</p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The premise seems simple: Spurlock 
			tasks himself with eating nothing but McDonalds, three meals a day, 
			for 30 days. As the film is inspired by the increasing obesity of 
			Americans, and its relationship to the seeming omnipresence of fast 
			food and fast food advertising, Spurlock also sets a rule for 
			himself: whenever a McDonalds clerk asks if he wants his order 
			&quot;super-sized,&quot; he agrees. The film repeatedly shows evidence of such 
			same, images that are at once familiar and startling: the anonymous 
			torsos of overweight individuals (the same shots you'll see in any 
			tv newsmagazine's report on the epidemic); adorable children singing 
			anthems to McDonalds, KFC, and Pizza Hut; and the many many 
			promotional devices that train youngsters to crave fast food, from 
			Colonel Sanders and Wendy to Ronald McDonald and the Hamburglar.
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The targeting of McDonalds, the 
			filmmaker insists, is not personal (he claims to like Big Macs). 
			Instead, Spurlock was inspired by the much-publicized rising obesity 
			numbers in the U.S., as well as the (unsuccessful) lawsuit by two 
			teenaged girls who claimed their overweight resulted directly from 
			their McDiet. The film more or less contends that such legal 
			wrangling neglects the importance of personal responsibility, even 
			in the face of colossal corporate irresponsibility. Though he 
			rejects &quot;frivolous lawsuits,&quot; Spurlock is more than willing to goad 
			viewers into taking personal responsibility. (At the same time, the 
			suggestion that, some day, it will be as socially &quot;acceptable&quot; to 
			harass &quot;fat pigs&quot; as it is to harass smokers now, leaves out a raft 
			of causes for obesity that are not overeating, not to mention recent 
			efforts to reduce harassment of overweight people, by airline 
			regulations or schoolyard taunts.) </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">More specifically and effectively, 
			Spurlock posits McDonalds as the best at what it does -- marketing 
			products that are convenient, relatively inexpensive, and unhealthy 
			to a population strapped for time, cash, and information. Taking the 
			sort of agitative documentary tack of his models (Errol Morris, 
			Michael Moore), he's more interested in prodding viewers to thought 
			or even action, by drawing attention to business excesses.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As Spurlock takes up his own 
			&quot;journey&quot; into weight gain, he and DP Scott Ambrozy travel across 
			the United States, with stops in some 20 cities, in order to sample 
			local McD menus (for example, Houston's McGriddle, combining the Egg 
			McMuffin and griddle cakes) and occasion interviews with a range of 
			eaters. Subjects include McDonalds customers and clerks, school 
			nutritionists and cooks, even Jared, the ubiquitous weight-loser 
			from the Subway commercials. (The stops at schools underline that 
			poor nutrition habits start early, encouraged by vending machines 
			and lunchroom fare that includes chips, ice cream, and sodas.)
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Do you eat fast food?&quot; Spurlock 
			asks a series of &quot;on-the-street&quot; interviewees, by way of introducing 
			the film. They invariably say yes, even as they also confess that 
			they also &quot;know&quot; it's not good for them. With 46 million McDonalds 
			stores open worldwide -- in malls, Wal-marts, schools, hospitals, 
			and airports -- the film contends (with the help of colorful 
			animated maps) that consumers face an onslaught of availability and 
			commercials. All this despite the generally common knowledge -- 
			voiced here by such notable talking heads as former Surgeon General 
			David Satcher, health advocate John Robbins (son of the 
			Baskin-Robbins Robbins, and sickly as a child, he says, from all the 
			ice cream he ate), and lawyer John Benzhaff (who brought the suit on 
			behalf of the teenaged girls) -- that French fries and shakes are 
			high in calories, fat, sugar, and salt. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To prepare himself and monitor the 
			results of his experiment, Spurlock meets with three doctors (a 
			cardiologist, a gastroenterologist, and an internist), as well as a 
			nutritionist and exercise physiologist, who all assure him that he's 
			&quot;above average&quot; with regard to health (cholesterol levels, weight, 
			cardiology, etc.). He also has the emotional support of his patient 
			girlfriend, a vegan chef by trade, who attests periodically during 
			the ordeal (and it quickly becomes an ordeal), as to his reduced 
			energy, mood swings, lack of concentration and flagging sexual 
			capacity. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Though Spurlock and his team of 
			doctors imagine he'll run into some trouble, no one quite 
			anticipates the awesome effects of full-on Mickey D's. Spurlock 
			begins the month with some gusto; biting into his first Egg McMuffin, 
			he grins, &quot;It's every eight-year-old's dream that I'm getting to 
			fulfill right now.&quot; Just a couple of days later, he's already 
			feeling the combined effects of the regimen and his decision to 
			behave like the &quot;average&quot; American (walking no more than a mile a 
			day): his chest feels tight and his head aches. In the parking lot 
			trying to down a Super Sized meal (the fries alone deliver 600 
			calories), he mumbles about his &quot;McStomach-ache.&quot; He groans, &quot;McBrick, 
			McGurgles, some McGas.&quot; And then, the gross-out effect: he grimaces, 
			gags, and pukes out the car window, the results documented on the 
			spot by the ever alert Ambrozy. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">By day five, Spurlock has gained 
			nine pounds (5% of his body weight, notes his horrified 
			nutritionist, who advises that he find a way to cut down on his 5000 
			calories a day, literally twice what he should be consuming). By day 
			eight, though eh indulges in his first Fish Fillet, Spurlock is 
			feeling &quot;bored&quot; by the menu and depressed; his dashboard is now 
			populated with McDonalds Happy Meals toys. Underlining the 
			connection between kids and fast food marketing, he shows a set of 
			pictures to kindergartners, some of whom recognize George 
			Washington, none Jesus Christ, and all, Ronald McDonald: no wonder 
			billions have been served, as they're trained from toddlerhood to 
			see the food as &quot;treats.&quot; (To underline the theme of &quot;Addiction,&quot; 
			included here as intertitle, Curtis Mayfield's &quot;Pusherman&quot; runs 
			under images of a demonic Ronald and ominous statistics.) </font>
			</p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Again, even as the warning isn't 
			new (see also, Eric Schlosser's book, <i>Fast Food Nation</i>), the 
			critique this time ranges from clever insults to appealingly 
			packaged insights. Some points are left undeveloped: one unhappy and 
			slightly overweight teen articulates the concern of so many, that 
			she'll never live up to the ideal of fashion models anyway, so how 
			can she help but be depressed and feel inadequate (this as the 
			screen fills with pop-up images of these models, crowding the real 
			girl out of her own interview). Another barely mentioned contention 
			has to do with President Bush's notoriously underfunded &quot;No Child 
			Left Behind&quot; initiative, here at fault for the closing down of 
			physical education courses, in order that more time might be spent 
			&quot;teaching for the test.&quot; </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film doesn't spend much time on 
			these overtly politicized positions; rather, it maintains its focus 
			on the fast food industry per se, as purveyor of ruinous products. 
			To this end, <i>Super Size Me</i> disparages the use of well-paid 
			lobbyists to protect the industry's interests, and makes a running 
			gag of Spurlock's inability to get in touch with a McDonalds rep. At 
			the same time, some ideas get short shrift, for instance, the 
			intersections of class and poor health, as cheap food tends to be 
			unhealthy, just as marketing in and to underclass communities tends 
			to be cynical and everywhere. (The faceless torsos and rear ends 
			that pass repeatedly before Ambrozy's lens tend to be clothed in 
			inexpensive fabrics and styles; reminding you that McDonalds 
			customers don't have lots of money to spend on fashion or food.)
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Spurlock is not interested in 
			deception or surprise-humiliation. (He financed the film with 
			profits from a money-for-stunts series he sold to MTV, <i>I Bet You 
			Will</i>, where participants know full well what they're getting 
			into, even if they engage in activities that viewers are encouraged 
			to ridicule.) He sets himself up as a &quot;guinea pig,&quot; and a stubborn 
			one at that. On learning that his health is at risk, he keeps on for 
			the entire 30 days, because he said he would. The result is 
			appropriately unnerving, and while McDonalds has protested the 
			portrayal of its tactics and products, it has also discontinued its 
			Super Sizing. </font></td>
