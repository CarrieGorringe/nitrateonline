			Unleashed<br>
            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 26 March 2004</i></font><p>
			<font face="Verdana" size="5">Image is everything </font></p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the sequel no one needs to 
			see, the Scooby Gang grapples with the stress of stardom. At film's 
			start, the Mystery Inc.-ers are emerging from a limo for a grand 
			exhibit opening at the Coolsonian Criminology Museum. Lit up like 
			movie stars, stepping onto a red carpet, thronged by Pat O'Brien and 
			fans too (a separate, clearly marked type for each member, like 
			they're in a boy band), they smile for cameras. One reporter, 
			Heather Jasper-Howe (Alicia Silverstone), pushes her way to Fred 
			(Freddie Prinze, Jr.). Asked for a comment, he grins broadly: &quot;The 
			people of Coolsville are the best in the world!&quot; </font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Right, and they apparently eat up 
			whatever pabulum is handed them, no matter how unimaginative and 
			uninteresting, dumb-as-a-bag-of-hammers Fred being number one case 
			in point. As a critique of celebrity culture, this first scene in 
			Raja Gosnell's <i>Scooby-Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed</i> is obvious 
			and derivative. While he's accompanied by his girl in lavender, 
			Daphne (Sarah Michelle Gellar), brainy chick Velma (Laura Cardellini), 
			Shaggy (Matthew Lillard), and Scooby (voiced by Neil Fanning), Fred 
			is all too happy to be spokesperson. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The movie continues to press this 
			theme -- the illusory nature of fame, the treachery of media, the 
			sad truth that, as Daphne observes, &quot;Image is everything&quot; -- once 
			the kids get inside the museum, where they are asked more questions 
			and pressed to pose for more pictures. The exhibit at hand is 
			comprised of super-villainish costumes collected by the gang over 
			the course of their exploits, including the Pterodactyl Ghost and 
			Black Knight Ghost. Just as they're getting used to be adored by 
			their public, disaster strikes: the Evil Masked Figure swoops in and 
			steals a couple of costumes, leaving chaos in his wake. Worse, the 
			entire calamity is caught on camera. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Faster than you can say &quot;10,000 
			Volt Ghost,&quot; the gang is vilified in the media and Fred's face is 
			all over tv screens calling the people of Coolsville names (Heather, 
			perversely ambitious and not a little mean, takes a quotation &quot;out 
			of context&quot;). The next time they step outside, a couple of little 
			boys riding bikes pause to call them &quot;losers.&quot; Oh dear oh dear. Fans 
			are so fickle. And so the Scoobies have a double mission this time: 
			solve the theft mystery and salvage their reputations. Aiding them, 
			perhaps, is the Museum's curator, Patrick (Seth Green, essentially 
			playing Oz, once more), on whom Velma develops a serious crush (but, 
			you might object, she's obviously gay; then again, he's a little 
			girly, so maybe that's how the writers are working this out). </font>
			</p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In order to provide enough material 
			for the film's 91-minute running time, the plot sidetracks long 
			enough for Daphne to dress up Velma for a date with Patrick. As the 
			boys wait below, Velma appears at the top of a stairway, squeezed 
			into a red pleather jumpsuit, with heels and bouffy wig, and without 
			glasses. She looks awful, not to mention desperately uncomfortable 
			(and Cardellini's cartoon voice is truly painful here). The ensuing 
			ride in the Mystery Machine hardly quells the tension, as the 
			double-daters (not including Scooby and Shaggy) arrive at the Museum 
			to find that every single monster costume has now been stolen. 
			Patrick makes a quick exit (so awkward that you might almost imagine 
			Green was rushing off to appear in another movie, as he's the only 
			one here with a career beyond the Scooby franchise, even if it is 
			made up of serial supporting parts). </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Eventually the group comes to find 
			out that the unknown villain is stealing the costumes to transform 
			into corny, badly CGI-ed Ghostbusters-style monsters, by means of a 
			machine hidden in some &quot;bad part of town,&quot; in a basement. It's not 
			much of a plot, but to its credit, it doesn't involve Scrappy Doo. 
			Sidelines involve Daphne playing Buffy (that is, martial-artsing the 
			monsters for a minute that can only make you yearn for Sunnydale) 
			and Scooby and Shaggy worrying that they're just tagalongs, not 
			carrying their own heroic weight (this even as Shaggy notes, by way 
			of credentials, &quot;Creepy is my middle name&quot;). </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Apparently meaning to assert their 
			usefulness, the two go undercover, Scooby in a pimpsuit and Afro wig 
			at a seedy bar, dancing to &quot;We Wanna Thank You (The Things You Do).&quot; 
			Annoying and unoriginal on its own, this bit also recalls the kids 
			becoming hiphop zombies in the first <i>Scooby</i> movie: blackness 
			continues to signify &quot;otherness&quot; in the Scooby world. (In this 
			context, it's honestly difficult to interpret the appearance of 
			Ruben Studdard during the closing credits, to sing &quot;Shining Star.&quot;)&nbsp;
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Eventually, Scooby and Shaggy do 
			discover the villain's lair (the villain who may or may not be Peter 
			Boyle, Tim Blake Nelson, or someone else; everyone here looks a 
			little bereft of purpose), whereupon they are beset by gizmos and 
			ghosts. None of these appear to exist in the same space as Shaggy, 
			but then again, neither does Scooby: for all the reported money 
			spent on digital effects for the sequel, the results are shoddy. 
			During one traumatic episode, Shaggy and Scooby try on differently 
			gendered bodies: when both are most plainly faking it, they look 
			most compatible. </font></td>
