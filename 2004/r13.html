            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 7 May 2004</i></font><p>
			<font face="Verdana" size="5">Demons Closing In On Every Side</font></p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>13 Going on 30</i> is best 
			when it's adorable. Put another way, it's most effective and most 
			fun when Jennifer Garner acts like she's 13. The story that gets her 
			to that point is contrived, of course, but it's hard to care about 
			that when you're watching her eyes widen as she looks down to 
			&quot;discover&quot; her bouncy new breasts, or galumph across a room bursting 
			with combined nervousness and delight. As Jenna, Garner embodies a 
			joy that's all too rare on recent movie screens, in adults or kids.
			</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The frame for her charms goes like 
			this: Jenna is suddenly awakened from her 13-year-old incarnation (Shana 
			Dowdeswell) into a 30-year-old body (Garner), stunned to see her 
			adult body and apartment full of designer furniture and expensive 
			outfits. She also finds, much to her horror, that she has a 
			&quot;boyfriend,&quot; a self-absorbed galoot of a New York Ranger (Samuel 
			Ball) who's wandering around her apartment with only a towel around 
			his waist. &quot;Gross!&quot; she sputters, rushing out the door in her 
			nightgown and a pricey jacket she grabs on her way to the elevator 
			of her fancy high rise apartment building.&nbsp;</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jenna's confounding initiation 
			occurs just after her younger self has made a fairy-dusted wish to 
			be grown up and popular (inspired by the catchy title of a women's 
			magazine article, &quot;30, Flirty, and Thriving&quot;). The occasion for the 
			dusting is her 13th birthday, a present from her best friend and 
			next-door neighbor Matt (Jack Salvatore Jr.). He wants only to make 
			her happy, even if it means understanding that she prefers the 
			company of the snotty girls, especially the super-selfish Tom-Tom 
			(Alexandra Kyle), to him. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The girls arrive at the &quot;party,&quot; 
			scheming to exploit Jenna's willingness to write a class project for 
			them, while she bobbles about like a puppy dog, eager to please at 
			any cost. Matt (whose point of view secures your own sympathy for 
			Jenna, even when she's less than sensitive to his needs) can only 
			watch in horror as the girls Jenna wants so desperately to please 
			abuse her trust, tell her they're playing a &quot;game,&quot; and leave her 
			waiting for them, blindfolded in a dark closet.&nbsp;</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Their cruelty is compounded by 
			Jenna's previous ultimate cuteness, again viewed through Matt's 
			doting and unnoticed gaze. He spots her energetic preparations for 
			her party, including her rehearsing the steps to the video for 
			&quot;Thriller.&quot; This image -- Jenna emulating Michael Jackson in 1987 -- 
			is revisited a few scenes later, after she has begun to assimilate 
			into her 30-year-old life. As her initial excitement at being a 
			grown-up wears off, Jenna starts feeling pressured by her career and 
			oh yes, that romance with the hockey player. (Garner's elaborate 
			gasping and cringing when he begins to disrobe recall Lucille Ball's 
			charismatic comedy.) </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Attending yet another party, this 
			time promoting her magazine, <i>Poise</i>, Jenna is enjoined by her 
			boss (Andy Serkis, in the flesh, without digital effects) to liven 
			up the proceedings: everyone is white, skinny, and bored. Jenna 
			knows just the thing: she approaches the DJ (the only black man in 
			the room) and asks him to play &quot;Thriller.&quot; Within minutes, she has 
			all the self-conscious stiffs dancing those ingenious monster steps 
			along with her. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;This moment is extra-adorable, not 
			to mention a triumph of hygienic, manic crossover. Tellingly, the 
			delight of the scene (it's hard not to smile along with Jenna's 
			uncontainable pleasure), has to do with its evacuation of any 
			weirdness, sexuality, or Michaelness. Jenna's naïve understanding 
			that Michael was &quot;not like other guys&quot; is here recovered from 
			today's more cynical interpretations. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Even his famously precise dance is 
			here reclaimed and rejuvenated by Garner's sweet clumsiness, set 
			against the earnest group choreography, a show that is at once giddy 
			and hopeful, the kind of show put on by so many kids in 1987. It's 
			also the occasion for Jenna's reunion with Matt (now played with 
			awkward warmth by Mark Ruffalo), with whom she has lost touch. More 
			specifically, she dissed him on that 13th birthday so badly that he 
			never spoke to her again. Now he's a scruffy, downtown, 
			independent-minded photographer (who will, of course, help her 
			redeem the stodgy slickness of <i>Poise</i>), exemplifying the moral 
			course from which Jenna has strayed, as she has so aggressively 
			pursued cool-girlness.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">You see the lessons she will learn. 
			While it's been described as a sort of distaff <i>Big</i>, Gary 
			Winick's follow-up to <i>Tadpole</i> slightly shifts the terms of 
			Penny Marshall's film. Jenna's primary relationship, the unfulfilled 
			romance with Matt, is saved, unlike Tom Hanks' impossible adult 
			relationship with Elizabeth Perkins. And Jenna's successful 
			challenges to the magazine business as usual (that is, corrupt, 
			cutthroat practices) are inspired by her childlike enthusiasm for a 
			time that, literally speaking, didn't occur for her (namely, 
			college). </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The movie's concept -- prepackaged 
			nostalgia for youthful, if unreal, guilelessness -- is surely 
			seductive. Here's a girl who has missed everything that might have 
			brought her from 13 to 30, including the maliciousness she has 
			committed in order to become as successful as she ever wished. 
			Rather than knowing of, much less bearing responsibility for, her 
			personal and professional history, she is able to paste together 
			nonexistent memories in order to remake herself in a present that in 
			itself doesn't really exist (the film reconstructs it, after all, as 
			a 13-year-old's crazy dream). It's the perfect fantasy of executive 
			success: all the perks, no guilt.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">She's estranged from her parents 
			(including her wonderfully patient mother [Kathy Baker]) and has no 
			notion of the other-women's-husbands she's bedded in order to attain 
			her brilliant career. This lack of experience allows her to remain a 
			safe point of identification, innocent by definition. To make her 
			position clear, <i>13 Going on 30</i> offers up a recognizable 
			villain, in Jenna's supposedly best friend, Lucy (whose name used to 
			be Tom-Tom, now played by [Judy Greer]). The obvious representative 
			of how nasty fast-paced careerism can be, Lucy is two-faced with all 
			stops out. The fact that she's only emulating her more &quot;successful&quot; 
			girlfriend, Jenna, leaves poor Jenna looking like she's in Captain 
			Kirk's alternative universe, trying desperately to undo her bad 
			self's malevolence. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">No doubt, the film's formula tends 
			to the tedious (Jenna must learn lessons, Matt must feel betrayed 
			again, their romance must undergo twists and turns). But for all 
			that, the girly stuff is all about Garner's big smile and gangly 
			grace. At a slumber party with her 13-year-old girl neighbors, 
			30-year-old Jenna shares her delirious first kiss with Matt (which 
			takes place on a playground, no less). As the girls ooh and ahh and 
			press for details, Jenna is wound-up with possibilities. Such 
			moments are gallantly enchanting, even, on occasion, thrilling.
