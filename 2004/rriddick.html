			Riddick<br>
            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, </i></font><i>
			<font face="Verdana" size="1">11 June 2004</font></i><p><b>
			<font face="Verdana" size="2">In <i>The Chronicles of Riddick</i>, 
			Vin Diesel, hell-bent on mythologizing himself, stands in the middle 
			of it all, trying very hard to look terribly important. He's 
			reprising his character from the 2000 film <i>Pitch Black</i>, and 
			he was much better in more quieter, less over-inflated surroundings. 
			Riddick is notorious, everyone is after him, yet he doesn't appear 
			to have done anything of particular note -- he's famous without 
			having to have done anything. Riddick can see in the dark, and if 
			the contact lenses that give his eyes a metallic sheen are anything 
			like the ones Alec Baldwin had to wear in <i>The Shadow</i>, Diesel 
			would not have been able to see a thing on the set.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The movie itself starts out in a 
			highly unappealing way. Invading spacecraft descend from the skies 
			upon a peaceful, prosperous planet and start blowing everything and 
			everyone to bits for reasons that are never entirely explained. 
			Riddick, it turns out, is the one, the only one, who can route these 
			interlopers, for reasons that are also never entirely explained. The 
			merciless invaders, who favor grays and blacks, are Fascists and 
			ride around in attack craft that look like giant office staplers.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The only thing that keeps the movie 
			from becoming totally loathsome is that, on a narrative level, it's 
			blitheringly nuts. Characters, wearing elaborate but ridiculous 
			costumes, strut around on sets that look like they were copied from 
			David Lynch's film <i>Dune</i>, delivering long, ropey strings of 
			dialogue that sound idiotic and which we can understand only half of 
			the time. This certainly undoes some of the performers -- Colm Feore, 
			who used to appear in good movies, cheaply smirks his way through 
			the role of an evil overlord, Thandie Newton plays a sub-Lady 
			Macbeth who burns eyeliner in around her eyes, an unrecognizable 
			Linus Roache plays a character who... </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Anyway, elsewhere the movie can't 
			decide what it's supposed to be at times -- first it's an 
			apocalyptic drama, then it goes gallivanting off to more dank, 
			dismal environs on a penitentiary planet, then there's an 
			(implausible) escape and a gallop back to where things started and a 
			conclusion that renders Riddick as a sort of &quot;Conan&quot;-like 
			scoundrel-turned-king (and a few other things that I will not reveal 
			here, you'll have to see it for yourself). The action sequences go 
			off like flashbulbs in your face, and are staged so close to the 
			camera that you can't follow what's going on. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Which leaves us with Judi Dench, 
			who flits through the movie -- literally (she's semi-transparent, 
			and floats) -- as an &quot;Elemental&quot; who's sort of a home team rooter 
			for Riddick. Dame Judi seems a little surprised and intrigued over 
			being asked to appear in this enterprise, but she doesn't loaf her 
			way through the role -- she does a perfectly fine job, giving the 
			picture its one, and only, aspect of prestige. The only thing is, 
			you have to sit through the rest of the picture in order to see all 
			of her performance, and that's not easy.</font></td>
