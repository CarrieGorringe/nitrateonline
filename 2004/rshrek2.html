            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 21 May 2004</i></font><p><b>
			<font face="Verdana" size="2">The Oscar-winning ogre is back for 
			another adventure, and thankfully the folks behind this one haven't 
			forgotten what made the first <i>Shrek</i> such an entertaining 
			flick. <i>Shrek 2</i> has preserved the irreverence of the first 
			film and has easily bested the technology used to make the initial 
			installment.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">During the prologue, you can marvel 
			at how when Prince Charming (a delightfully self-satisfied Rupert 
			Everett) rides to the rescue of Princess Fiona (Cameron Diaz), you 
			can see the breath of both the prince and his steed as they gallop. 
			They're only trudging through ice for a quick half-second dissolve, 
			but it's gratifying that that the folks behind this went to all the 
			trouble so that their make-believe world was convincingly realized.
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The rest of the journey is equally 
			well-executed, but as viewers of the first film already know, the 
			Prince is a little late. Fiona is now happily married to the smelly, 
			crude but somewhat noble Shrek (Mike Myers) and is an ogre herself.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Unfortunately, Fiona's royal 
			parents (John Cleese and Julie Andrews) know nothing about her new 
			spouse and invite the couple to come visit them in their home in Far 
			Far Away. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Shrek, knowing that locals there 
			will greet him with the same pitchforks that they do outside his 
			swamp, isn't eager to go. But love and the insistence of his 
			annoyingly steadfast friend Donkey (Eddie Murphy) lead him to visit 
			the distant land that looks strangely like contemporary Los Angeles 
			(complete with a Tower of London Records).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Needless to say, Shrek's 
			apprehensions are justified. The opening dinner with Shrek, Fiona, 
			Donkey and the In-Laws is an unmitigated disaster, and the King even 
			hires the dreaded hit cat Puss in Boots (voiced with sly bravado by 
			Antonio Banderas). Hatred of his new son-in-law isn't the only 
			reason the King is stooping so low. He's made a Faustian pact with 
			Far Far Away's popular Fairy Godmother (voiced with perfect faux 
			sweetness by Jennifer Saunders) to give his daughter to her son, who 
			just happens to be Prince Charming.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thankfully, nothing progresses as 
			intended, and there are charmingly wicked gags throughout <i>Shrek 2</i> 
			that amply reward any viewers willing to pay attention. Watch what 
			happens when the fairy tale creatures all enter Shrek's home to 
			house sit (some have a bit of a problem with the door). And 
			definitely keep an eye out for what happens when a coach parks at a 
			street corner for half a second.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While many film wags have 
			attributed the box office clout of the first <i>Shrek</i> to its 3D 
			computer animation technique in place of traditional 2D hand drawn 
			animation, it is worth noting that the makers of both <i>Shrek</i> 
			and the Pixar movies also place strong emphasis on material and 
			character. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As much eye candy is displayed here 
			(and there's a lot), if Banderas' turn as Puss in Boots wasn't so 
			endearing and funny, <i>Shrek 2</i> would be nothing but a pretty 
			bore. The characters are dynamic. For example, Puss in Boots is 
			flamboyant, when not being felled by a hairball, but knows how to 
			subdue opponents with soft, doe-like eyes when they are obviously 
			more than a physical match for him.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Fortunately director Andrew Adamson 
			subordinates all of the cool effects to the story, and writers J. 
			David Stem, Joe Stillman and David M. Weiss (working from the late 
			William Steig's character) come up with enough insanity for two or 
			three films. They also manage the rare feat of being sarcastic 
			without being smug. When they do pull at our heartstrings, it 
			doesn't feel phony. They also deserve extra credit for coming up 
			with what may be the only funny gag involving flatulence in recent 
			memory.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">One of the oddly refreshing aspects 
			of both <i>Shrek</i> films is that unlike a lot of animated films, 
			viewers are led to sympathize with the less attractive, or nerdier 
			characters. Animation great Chuck Jones once lamented that too many 
			of his peers were emphasizing that &quot;pretty is good, and ugly is 
			bad.&quot; Frankly, I'll take the ogre version of Princess Fiona over 
			Princess Jasmine any day.</font></td>
