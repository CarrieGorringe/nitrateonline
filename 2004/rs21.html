            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>, 11 June 2004</i></font><p class="MsoNormal">
			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's disheartening when the 
			headline article in today's <i>Washington Post</i> examines the 
			American abuses against those detained in Camp X-Ray at Guantanamo 
			Bay, Cuba. Elsewhere in the front section there's an update on the 
			techniques used by U.S. interrogators on the Iraqi prisoners at Abu 
			Ghraib. Such ill-treatment of prisoners is a decades-old, if not a 
			centuries-old, practice throughout the supposedly civilized world 
			that straddles a moral dilemma that has been hidden, revealed, 
			condemned, condoned, and often ignored.</font></b></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The worst example 
			of such torture against an innocent group was the destruction of six 
			million Jews by Hitler and his minions during World War II. Since 
			that war ended, one of the worst civilian massacre in Europe was the 
			Bosnian Serb killings of thousands of Muslims. During the Cold War, 
			the East German STASI destroyed the lives of hundreds of thousands 
			of German citizens. <span style="color: black">Hava Kohav Beller's 
			documentary <i>The Burning Wall</i> was the first film I recall in 
			which incarcerated citizen and state operative are reunited years 
			after the fact in an effort to make sense of the earlier madness.</span></font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">
			<span style="color: black">In that film, this riveting segment was 
			but one small aspect dealing with the “rebuilding” of post-WWII 
			Germany. In a new film, <i>S21: The Khmer Rouge Killing Machine</i>, 
			former Cambodian captives and captors look toward each other, with 
			heads bowed in excruciating shame or anger, over nearly all of its 
			105-minute length. It's fitting that such a horribly fascinating 
			reconnection is unreeling at Washington's Avalon Theatre, which is 
			also rebuilding on its past glory, where <i>The Burning Wall</i> was 
			shown earlier this year.</span></font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>S21</i> is a 
			film by Rithy Panh, a noted, award-winning documentary filmmaker 
			since the late 1980s, who was forced to work in the Khmer Rouge 
			labor camps between the age of 11 and 15. In 1979 he escaped to a 
			refugee camp in Thailand and eventually settled in France, where he 
			received his cinema degree. Like his other films, Panh uses the war 
			in Cambodia as a launching ground to exorcise inner demons that 
			still haunt him, and as a springboard to understanding the mindset 
			and policy of organized elimination by the Communist Party of 
			Democratic Kampuchea, or the <i>Angkar</i> as is it referred to 
			throughout <i>S21</i>. This appears to be the first of his films 
			commercially released in the United States (by indie-savvy First Run 
			Features, which picked the film up prior to its New York Film 
			Festival showing last fall).</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
			<font face="Verdana" size="2">The Cambodian atrocity that murdered 
			1.7 million Cambodians, with the ex-leaders only now facing changes 
			before an international tribunal, is examined in <i>S21</i>, the 
			code name used as for Tuol Sleng, an interrogation enclave (now a 
			genocide museum) during the Communist rule of 1975-1979. Some 17,000 
			people were abducted, imprisoned, questioned, tortured, and killed 
			under the “security bureau” superintendent and guards. Of those 
			thousands, 3 people survived, with Panh bringing two of them 
			face-to-face with 11 guards or other former Khmer Rouge personnel 
			who attended to the dictatorial desires of the <i>Angkar</i> and the 
			“needs” they believed the inmates deserved.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
			<font face="Verdana" size="2">The straightforward documentary style 
			reveals the layers of abuse (and the incredible wealth of 
			painstakingly typewritten torture and medical records; large, 
			heavy-wood-backed mug shots; and devastatingly revelatory 
			photographs the obsessive prison authorities kept) that were 
			delivered to the men, women, and children at the behest of Him Houy, 
			deputy head of Santébal, the regime's internal security police, and 
			Prâk Khân, a member of the interrogation group. Both now claim 
			responsibility for their sins in front of survivors Van Nath, a 
			painter whose talent curried favor with Duch, the prison's boss, and 
			Chum Mey, now a public works department mechanic. As the film opens, 
			a tearful Houy is shown with his parents, who tell how their son was 
			a good boy taken away and indoctrinated in the evil, cultish ways of 
			the communist rulers. The other guards (all were male) echo this 
			discipline-intensive methodology, that as young boys they were 
			brainwashed by the <i>Angkar</i>. If they did not obey, they would 
			likely become victims themselves. Nath pushes these crushers of 
			humanity to better explain the evil they visited on their innocent 
			targets. The guards' collective conscience is troubled with the 
			torture and murder they committed; Houy alone hopes for a cleansing 
			away of the bad karma that has haunted him for 25 years.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-autospace: none">
			<font face="Verdana" size="2">Nath, whose artwork reflects the 
			horrors he is forced to recall, consoles Chum Mey, who was 
			imprisoned for two months before the fall of Phnom Penh, as they 
			revisit the torture chamber of their past. “We survived. We are 
			terribly lucky.” I wondered, sadly, that such luck must be 
			accompanied by so many agonizing memories. The demons of <i>S21</i> 
			are brought to us with a determined director's hand. The handcuffs. 
			The blindfolds. The harsh beatings and whippings. The psychological 
			humiliation. The blood-taking, whereby inmates were basically bled 
			to death; Mâk Thim, a doctor in the prison infirmary, remembers 
			these poor souls' deaths, breathing like crickets, their eyes 
			bulging. The entire insensitivity, which one guard, incredulously 
			bares before the camera “We didn't do it for fun.” Hard, very hard, 
			to fathom, when we learn there were three groups of guards -- mild, 
			hot, and rabid -- with some undoubtedly getting a sadistic kick out 
			of their evil endeavors. No, there is no fun in Rithy Panh's horror 
			tale. Especially the guards' semi-cathartic recreations of some of 
			their daily routines on imaginary prisoners. It is not a film -- 
			which unflinchingly captures a still festering wound on humanity -- 
			you are likely to forget.</font></td>
