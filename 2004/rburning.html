			<a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>, 5 March 2004</i></font><p>
			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>The Burning Wall</i>, which had 
			a one-week run at the Avalon Theatre in Northwest Washington, DC, in 
			late January, takes the splitting of Germany in the aftermath of 
			World War II and puts a cinematic face on it. Ultimately, it's a 
			happy one, with the Berlin Wall crumbled in 1989. Yet for four 
			decades the cold war erected the now dissolved German Democratic 
			Republic (for those who flunked geography: East Germany), fashioned 
			a communist regime that ultimately monitored five-and-one-half 
			million people (about a third of its population), and mounted a 
			terror state that destroyed too many dissident minds, bodies, and 
			souls. <a name="OLE_LINK27" target="_top">More a grand and sprawling historical 
			artifact than a documentary with a cinematic edge, here is a 
			conventional yet engrossing piece that molds a complex number of 
			issues into an understandable educational effort.</a></font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Director-writer Hava Kovah Beller, 
			a German-born, Israeli-raised, but long-time New York resident, a 
			dozen years ago made <i>The Restless Conscience: Resistance to 
			Hitler Within Germany 1933-1945</i>, an Oscar-nominated feature. As 
			before, she has done solid, exhaustive researching, and determinedly 
			relates her non-fictional drama using a massive amount of still 
			photographs, moving images (including newsreels and government 
			films), and talking heads. (Some of the shots also appear in <i>Good 
			Bye, Lenin!</i>, Wolfgang Becker's award-winning sweet social comedy 
			surrounding the collapse of the Berlin Wall.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Over most of the film's nearly 
			two-hour length, the GDR is on trial nearly every minute, 
			particularly in its persecution of Robert Havemann, a German 
			intellectual who joined the Communist Party a year before Hitler's 
			rise to power, was subsequently imprisoned by the Nazis for his 
			political leanings (but convinced the authorities of his value as a 
			scientist to their cause, and then, secretly, did his best to 
			sabotage the war materiel he helped create), and ultimately arrested 
			by the totalitarian state in 1973 on charges of conspiracy to commit 
			treason. The abusive police organization that operated at the behest 
			of the GDR and its communist leaders was the STASI, which operated 
			with immunity under party general secretary Erich Honecker as it 
			conducted surveillance, psychological warfare, and other dirty, 
			rotten things in destroying the lives of hundreds of thousands of 
			German citizens.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Beller moves her study along in 
			mostly chronological order: the ashes of the Great War, the 
			splitting of Germany following the Potsdam Conference; the East 
			German hope of a new social order; the Berlin work strike of June 
			1953, the first open protest in the Soviet Bloc; the rise of the 
			East German dictatorship; the Soviet crushing of the 1956 Hungarian 
			independence attempt; the erection of the Berlin Wall in August 
			1961; the Czech reform movement; etc. The segment on the Wall's 
			construction and early years recalls all those past, horrifying 
			documentaries, where escape attempts too often resulted in a fatal 
			shot in the back or the agony of becoming enmeshed in a mass of 
			barbed wire. Thousands perished over the course of the Wall's 
			existence.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Among those interviewed include: 
			Günter Grass, revealing how he became a Hitler Youth at 15; Pastor 
			Ehrhart Neubert, who couldn't fathom his father's political 
			convictions; actress Corinna Harfouch talking about childhood 
			indoctrination; songwriter Bettina Wegner talks of the constant 
			surveillance and harassment by STASI and the effect it had on her 
			family; Czech leader Vaclav Havel and former West German president 
			Richard von Weizsacker provide political insight from within the 
			higher circles of leadership. One of the most damning appearances is 
			made by a former operative within STASI and the horrifying tactics 
			he used in the name of the dictator state.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>The Burning Wall</i> may not 
			have the glorified style of an Errol Morris film, yet not a frame of 
			film is wasted in telling its story of lives tortured, drugged, 
			humiliated, and terrorized by fascist, pro-communist ideology. Of 
			heroes one day, traitors the next. This extended history lesson 
			about an era in German history is more than a dummie's lesson about 
			the moral and political post-WWII struggles that was the rise, and 
			eventual fall, of the GDR.</font></td>
