            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>, 27 February 2004</i></font><p class="MsoNormal">
			<font face="Verdana" size="5">True Story</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">I awoke this 
			morning troubled with the violently repugnant imagery and 
			overwhelming, cruel power of producer-director Mel Gibson's <i>The 
			Passion of the Christ</i>, even though it has been several days 
			since my one, and probably only, viewing of the film. The hype, the 
			controversy, and now the release on Ash Wednesday of the Greatest 
			Story Ever Told…according to Mel (who co-wrote the screenplay with 
			Benedict Fitzgerald, a screenwriter adept at literary adaptations) 
			has been a struggle to examine on a strictly literal or cinematic 
			level. Friends who know I'm an occasional film critic have asked me 
			my opinion. At other times, there has been smaller discussions 
			within some of the critics' circles to which I belong. This is not a 
			film to be dismissed lightly.</font></b></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Nor is it a film 
			that can be reviewed, or watched, like most others. Rated R, for 
			&quot;sequences of graphic violence,&quot; it's nearly endless, slow-motion, 
			close-up observation of the pummeling, flagellation, and other 
			flesh-rending attacks on the man who would be the son of God is 
			never as violently poetic as <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>'s opening 
			battle sequence, but it is more than thrice as long. Parents are 
			warned that they should not bring their children to this film 
			(without at least viewing it once themselves); it's affect may be 
			even more traumatic on younger, pre-teen minds.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Did I like it? 
			No. It's a relentless, frightening, agonizing propaganda effort 
			adapted from the New Testament (i.e., the Biblical gospels according 
			to Matthew, Mark, Luke and John) an influenced by Anne Catherine 
			Emmerich (1774-1824), an Augustian nun and mystic. Did I say 
			relentless? I meant RELENTLESS. The only respites during the film's 
			last, ever-agonizing 90 minutes are a handful of flashbacks to 
			calmer times in the life of Jesus, as a child and later grown, that 
			director of photography Caleb Deschanel, a four-time Oscar nominee, 
			shoots in a softer, catch-your-breath frame. Otherwise the torturous 
			trek to the cross is so over-realistic (including dialogue only 
			spoken in Aramaic and Latin, with English subtitles accompanying) 
			that that it will turn most devoutly Catholic patrons to emotional 
			tears, and turn the stomachs of other nominally religious viewers. 
			Why? Because in the course of a two-hour visitation on the 
			scripture, you are presented with an agonizing vision of Jesus of 
			Nazareth's last 12 hours leading up to and including his painful 
			nailing to the cross. I'm praying that most of the Catholics who see 
			the film remember that God (who, unlike an eerie Satan, is missing 
			in action from the cast) planned the crucifixion to salvage 
			humanity, and that Jesus, well aware of the ultimate salvation that 
			lay ahead, puts up no resistance to his tormentors, the Jews or the 
			Romans, who both share in the torture.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">That the Jews, 
			collectively, are once again blamed for the death of Jesus is not a 
			point that can be handled in an easy-going manner, and there will be 
			more than a handful of people who find the film abhorrently 
			anti-Semitic. I am more concerned about how the film might affect 
			simpler minds to do hateful things. While the Vatican has downplayed 
			their role in the centuries-old debate about the Jewish involvement 
			in the death of Christ, the tragedy of <i>The Passion of the Christ</i> 
			might be in how it might persuade the wrong type of individual to 
			act in an unexpected manner. Film can be a very persuasive medium 
			for all the wrong reasons. Some kid watches <i>Jackass the Movie</i> 
			and immature adolescents are imitating the outlandish, dangerous 
			stunts in communities in Colorado, New Hampshire, and Florida. It's 
			not a big stretch to believe that there will be some under-educated, 
			even ignorant, viewer who will construe <i>Passion</i> as grounds to 
			fight back against the Hebrews for the role they purportedly had in 
			this tale of agony and, too little, ecstasy. Enough blood has 
			already been shed.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There are no 
			&quot;based on a true story&quot; taglines seen at the start of <i>The Passion 
			of the Christ</i>, but many will accept this as the gospel. 
			Remember, this is a propaganda film with the calculated power to 
			evangelize. I'm not learned enough to make any claim on how 
			&quot;accurate&quot; Mr. Gibson is to prevailing Catholic feelings, but the 
			wide brushes of extended realism in which he paints this film will 
			undoubtedly influence thousands. <i>The Passion</i> is ultimately a 
			very personal effort to put a visual picture on a story that has 
			riled theologians for centuries. Experts stewed in various religious 
			backgrounds have often considered the death of Christ a Jewish 
			atrocity and cause for centuries of persecution. Gibson makes no 
			effort to whitewash. And while not your typical Hollywood production 
			(although the crew and cast—Jim Caviezel as Jesus, Maia Morgenstern 
			as Mary, and Monica Bellucci as Magdalen—are highly professional), 
			it is a high octane project that has stroked the established studios 
			all the wrong ways and created such a contempt that all the major 
			distributors declined to release the film. Gibson hired Newmarket 
			Films (which distributed or platformed <i>Memento</i>, <i>Donnie 
			Darko</i>, <i>Whale Rider</i>, <i>Y Tu Mama Tambien</i>, <i>My Big 
			Fat Greek Wedding</i>, and <i>Monster</i>) to handling the bookings 
			of the film, and opening day and pre-release private screenings 
			alone brought in more than $27 million. Thanks to the power of the 
			masses and the support of the Catholic church, the $30-million film 
			is a guaranteed financial success (it became one on its second day 
			of release), and the eventual DVD sales will make the winnings in 
			the last Mega-Million lottery look like chump change.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is the True 
			Gibson Story version of the death of Christ, in all is re-created
