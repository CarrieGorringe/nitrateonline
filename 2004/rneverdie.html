			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">King David (DMX) lies in a 
			coffin, embedded in white satin, his Armani suit perfectly creased, 
			his arms crossed over his chest. &quot;We reap what we sow,&quot; his 
			voiceover intones while the camera pulls out and circles him. 
			&quot;That's what the Bible says.&quot; Beat. &quot;Payback's a motherf*cker. I 
			think James Brown said that.&quot; </font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">King's funeral opens <i>Never Die 
			Alone</i>, but his throbbing self-consciousness drives it. James 
			Gibson's screenplay, based on one of Donald Goines' pulp novels, has 
			King inflict every sort of evil a man might imagine. King is a pimp, 
			a dealer, a gangster and a bully, hateful towards women, coldly 
			vicious toward men. (Goines was himself a baleful character, thief, 
			heroin addict, murder victim at 36, currently resurrected in 
			allusions by hiphop artists.) As King recounts posthumously, he 
			returned to New York from Los Angeles after 10 years of self-exile, 
			with a plan in mind to right the many wrongs he inflicted on most 
			everyone he knew. It's telling that the only people he feels 
			compelled to reimburse are men, but most every man in his retro-noiry 
			world espouses such casual misogyny.&nbsp;</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">King's search for redemption is 
			figured as a distinctively secular spirituality: he travels with a 
			Bible that he's hollowed out in order to store his own audiotapes, 
			dictated while driving east and comprised of sordid tales and foul 
			language. Perpetually dissatisfied and bad-tempered (his daunting 
			demeanor enhanced by X's distinctive growl), King's real problem -- 
			the one that seals his fate, as it were -- is that his decision to 
			settle his earthly debts comes too late. His former associates, at 
			least as treacherous and untrusting as he is, aren't about to 
			forgive him, no matter how much interest he offers on the money he 
			owes (he's quaintly convinced that his quarter of a million dollars 
			is something of a fortune). These include the mightily colorful 
			kingpin of everything (heroin, women, and apparently, smoky club 
			singers), Moon (Clifton Powell) and his young henchman, Mike 
			(Michael Ealy, popular pretty boy of the <i>Barbershop</i> movies).&nbsp;</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The latter carries a special grudge 
			against King, having to do with a big old scar on his cheek, which 
			he touches ominously, head lowered, whenever King's name comes up. 
			It's not hard to guess what Mike's grudge is about, but what the 
			film lacks in subtlety, it makes up for in grim, aggressive style, 
			its embrace of its sensational literary roots. Directed by Ernest R. 
			Dickerson (Spike Lee's former cinematographer and director of <i>
			Juice</i> and <i>Our America</i>), and shot by Matthew Libatique on 
			&quot;special stock,&quot; the film a peculiar blend of harshness and 
			darkness. Shadows seep through every crimson interior King enters; 
			even the film's flashbacks to sunny California are oversaturated 
			with gloomy expectation, permeating the grainy color. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">These flashbacks are generated by 
			those audiotapes, which King bequeaths to the last man to see him 
			alive, Paul (David Arquette). Hanging out at the Blue Room to soak 
			up thuggish local &quot;color,&quot; Paul's a wannabe journalist looking for 
			&quot;the story&quot; that will put him over. When he sees King go down in a 
			knife fight outside the bar, Paul rushes him to the hospital in his 
			big old pimp car, Holy Bible on the passenger seat and weapon in the 
			glove compartment. When the doctor brings the bad news that King has 
			died, he also says Paul's the recipient, via King's deathbed 
			declaration, of all the dead man's worldly goods: the car, his heavy 
			gold crucifix, and the tapes that he's stashed inside the Bible.
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The story King tells apparently 
			fulfills all of Paul's fantasies of thug life, from the 
			movie-inspired catch-phrasing (&quot;Enter the motherf*ckin' dragon,&quot; 
			breathes King, as he stands on a threshold) to Moon's desirous 
			mantra: &quot;What else is there? Money, pussy, and money.&quot; Paul's more 
			than ready to consume this tale, living in an uptown apartment 
			decorated with Wu Tang and Miles posters, and dating an upscale 
			black girl (Aisha Tyler). She finally dumps him when he misses their 
			anniversary dinner in order to take King to the hospital. Tired of 
			what she calls his &quot;whole slumming thing,&quot; she cuts deeper still, 
			accusing him of using her as &quot;part of your research.&quot; Paul doesn't 
			even bother to talk her out of leaving (apparently, he can't help 
			himself: &quot;I need to find out how this man died,&quot; he whines). 
			Frankly, girlfriend's assessment sounds about right. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Paul's mini-meltdown rather pales 
			in comparison to the film's other major narratives, namely, King's 
			excursion to L.A. and Mike's vengeance against Moon (whose contract 
			on Mike results in the inadvertent murder of Mike's schoolgirl 
			sister, another plot point that comes as a ferocious non-surprise). 
			The beachy scenes have King picking up a pretty blond actor, Janet 
			(Jennifer Sky), whose coworkers on a <i>Baywatch</i>-y tv series 
			provide King with a ready set of users. Their addictions make him a 
			fortune selling junk and reinforce his general sense that everyone 
			is weak, pathetic, and beneath contempt, including Janet, whose 
			heroin habit is the result of his switching up her coke. As he tells 
			it, for the eager reader Paul, no woman can resist him. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Given Paul's own predicament, it's 
			easy to see how this appeal to rage and resentment works. He begins 
			to see in King a kind of &quot;nobility,&quot; a self-recognition that 
			elevates him above common crook. This is, of course, the sort of 
			ominous self-consciousness that Goines portrays in so many of his 
			anti-heroes, men who inhabit a bleak underworld and commit all forms 
			of mayhem, yet comprehend themselves and their environments in stark 
			moral terms. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">King's next and most visibly 
			pathetic victim is Juanita (Reagan Gomez-Preston). When King first 
			spots her, he narrates, she's serving drinks and going to college, 
			or, as he puts it, &quot;Everything a man could want, beautiful, 
			intelligent, uncorrupted.&quot; Predictably, he has to turn this 
			situation around; that is, he notes on spotting her, &quot;I promised 
			myself that she'd be mine.&quot; His seduction involves various 
			corruptions, from unleashing her passions (&quot;They're all freaks to 
			begin with&quot;) to impressing her mama with his claims to an &quot;exports&quot; 
			business, to, at last and apparently inevitably, exchanging 
			Juanita's coke stash (which he's provided) for heroin. 
			Pathologically incapable of intimacy, King can only destroy anyone 
			who shows vulnerability or desire, or worse, as is the case with 
			Juanita, disrespect. By the time she's turned into a runny-nosed, 
			shattered junkie, he's way past caring. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Looking at her so willing to debase 
			herself for a hit, King is reminded of another woman he ruined, back 
			in NYC. At this point, as he tells it, he's had enough of his own 
			damage. As Paul listens avidly, even obsessively, trying to find an 
			answer, King heads back east and the film picks up where it began, 
			this time framed by Paul's creepy captivation. This is the end of 
			King and the film's most devastating revelation, that his incredible 
			story, so enthralling and revolting, is produced in its reception.
