            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 13 March 2004</i></font><p>
			<font face="Verdana" size="5">Newsworthy&nbsp; </font></p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Nicholas (Paul Bettany) is cold, 
			figuratively and literally. He washes his newly shorn head with icy 
			river water, his breath visible and his blue eyes pale as the 
			graying sky behind him. Shivering and frightened, he's also on the 
			run. Stylishly cryptic flashbacks indicate why he's in this state: a 
			priest in 14th-century rural England, he's done wrong by his 
			parishioners, having bedded one of the lush young girls in a barn, 
			where the lovers were discovered, in flagrante delicto, by a large 
			man. </font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At the start of Paul McGuigan's <i>
			The Reckoning</i>, Nicholas is utterly alone. Looking over his 
			shoulder even as he contemplates suicide, he takes a breath. Still 
			regarding himself as a man of God, his sinfulness and banishment 
			notwithstanding, he can't quite bring himself to do it. And then, he 
			finds a sort of redemption, whether by accident or God's will, when 
			he meets a troupe of players. They've been making their way by 
			performing Bible stories -- Cain and Abel, the Crucifixion -- for 
			various village populations. Recently, their audiences have been 
			increasingly distracted and uninterested, at least in part because 
			their own lives have become increasingly complicated. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Nicholas' eagerness to be adopted 
			into the group leaves them immediately suspicious: they've got a 
			pattern of performance and particular roles assigned, and he'll just 
			gum up their works. Or so they believe. Adapted by Mark Mills from 
			Barry Unsworth's novel, <i>Morality Play</i>, the movie focuses on 
			the ways that faith can be overwhelmed by circumstance and 
			deliberate deception. From the start, the relationship between 
			Nicholas and the players is fraught with distrust and mistaken 
			apprehension. He first comes on them just as their leader, Martin 
			(Willem Dafoe), appears to be murdering his own father, a mercy 
			killing enacted as awful ritual by firelight, with Martin dressed in 
			a costume that gives him bizarre breasts (women not being allowed to 
			perform on stage, the troupe maintains this costume and a wig for 
			the man who plays all female roles). </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Taken aback, Nicholas makes up a 
			story to explain his bad timing, then asks for admittance into the 
			group (as Martin himself observes, traveling alone &quot;in these times&quot; 
			is dangerous). While the others -- including the outspoken Tobias 
			(Brian Cox) -- dislike this obvious liar straight away, Martin and 
			his sister Sarah (Gina McKee), take different kinds of shines to the 
			interloper -- he's looking to secure a friendly voter when matters 
			for the troupe are put to &quot;democratic&quot; tests, and she's intrigued by 
			Nicholas' obvious differences from the men she travels with, his 
			apparent education and delicacy (when he claims he's a farmer, she 
			checks his soft hands). More than that, she appreciates, even as she 
			distrusts, his mystery. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">All agree, grudgingly, to bring 
			Nicholas along, whereupon the players' internal balance of power 
			shifts. It's not long before he confesses his crime (part of it, 
			anyway, hanging on to his &quot;mystery&quot; just a bit longer, though you 
			won't be hard pressed to guess the rest), at the same time that they 
			come upon another crime in a town where they've just arrived. A 
			local healer, Martha (Elvira Minguez), is accused of murdering a 
			young boy. As she is mute, she has no means to make a defense, 
			though she insists on her innocence, in particular when she is 
			interviewed by Martin and Nicholas, who visit her in prison in order 
			to gather information for their new production, a play based on the 
			local murder. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When the troupe initially proposes 
			the play -- &quot;The Murder Of Thomas Wells&quot; -- as a means to garner an 
			audience (and profits), they are plainly running up against 
			tradition (the repetition of known plots, pantomimed as Martin 
			narrates). Their rehearsal and costume preparation provide <i>The 
			Reckoning</i>'s strangest moments, a montage sequence that takes on 
			tres moderne visual aspects, brief, stylized tableaux that recall 
			R.E.M. and <span style="color:black">Tarsem</span>'s music video for 
			&quot;Losing My Religion.&quot; (Even more striking and strange, as Martin 
			warms up, Dafoe demonstrates his singular torso and yoga poses, 
			remarkably bent and contorted.) </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Even more disturbing, they are 
			performing a kind of newsworthy &quot;truth.&quot; Though they believe 
			Martha's version (why is unclear), they still go on with the plot as 
			the town's legal processes have deemed it -- she's the evil 
			seductress who kills the boy, alone in the woods, for the purse he's 
			toting for his mother. The performance results in drama among the 
			viewers, however, and so Nicholas -- intrepid and driven by his own 
			personal guilt -- undertakes to find out what &quot;really happened.&quot; 
			Call him the first tabloid reporter, utterly invested in public 
			opinion even as he openly brooks the established power structure.&nbsp;</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Opposing Nicholas' investigation -- 
			which takes all kinds of yucky turns, having to do with cemeteries, 
			plague, and child abuse -- is the local feudal fop, Lord Robert De 
			Guise (Vincent Cassel, who played another version of this villain in
			<i>Brotherhood of the Wolf</i>). Protected by his own priest on a 
			payroll, Father Damian (Ewen Bremner), as well as his 
			looming-on-horseback palace guards, De Guise feels invulnerable to 
			charges against his authority (as this is represented in the verdict 
			against Martha). And so, he resents even the hint of a question, 
			which means that Nicholas is a nuisance. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Nicholas finds more trouble as well 
			as potential support in an emissary from the king, engaged in a 
			parallel investigation of nefarious goings-on. As the players' 
			performance challenges the official &quot;truth,&quot; <i>The Reckoning</i> 
			raises significant questions concerning how news and history are 
			shaped by those with the power to name them. As the dead boy's 
			mother collapses in horror on seeing her child's murder enacted 
			(twice) and the audience surges with excitement, the play takes on 
			its own immediacy and reality. Disappointingly, <i>The Reckoning</i> 
			lapses into near-farcical sensationalism, undermining the truth of 
			its fictions. </font></td>
