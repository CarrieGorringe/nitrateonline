			<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Word is 
			circulating -- via a Sundance premiere and promotional campaign -- 
			that Ashton Kutcher reveals &quot;depth,&quot; along with a newly shaggy face, 
			in <i>The Butterfly Effect</i>. How remarkable and encouraging, this 
			report submits, that the erstwhile &quot;dude&quot; has at last found his 
			performative footing. How has he hidden it so well until now? </font>
			</b></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In fact, the 
			question proposed by the film is rather less mundane than this. It 
			has to do with time travel, in particular, with the consequences of 
			changing the past. Other images are famous for posing this question: 
			what happens if Edith Keeler does cross the street in &quot;City on the 
			Edge of Forever&quot;? Or Reese doesn't travel back to impregnate Sarah 
			Connor? And how does Marty McFly get away with ripping off Chuck 
			Berry, anyway? How does any one of these events change or sustain 
			history, fictional as that history may be? And what many other 
			events are affected in turn? And what if another event in the chain 
			shifts slightly, so that the whole thread of history must readjust, 
			again. How many alternative histories are circulating at any given 
			moment, assuming a moment might be understood to stand alone? </font>
			</p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">These are the 
			sorts of dilemmas that shape <i>The Butterfly Effect</i>, an 
			ambitious, if rather incoherent, second film by Eric Bress and J. 
			Mackye Gruber, also the writer-directors of <i>Final Destination 2</i> 
			(itself a bizarre, darkly humorous excursion into uncanny 
			what-if-ness). At the center of <i>The Butterfly Effect</i> is Evan 
			(Kutcher, who, for all the &quot;depth&quot; hype, isn't precisely revealing 
			chops here). Afflicted with a genetic predisposition for altering 
			the relation between time and space (his father is institutionalized 
			for proclaiming a similar demented-seeming belief in his ability to 
			reshape memory-as-history. (Note: this basic idea is potentially 
			awkward, as any memory is subjective, not the same for everyone on 
			any given scene.) </font></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Evan begins 
			the film as a whiz-kid psych major troubled by his inability to 
			remember chunks of his childhood -- except when he reads his journal 
			entries, which are mostly lead-ups to what happened that he doesn't 
			remember. As the film envisions his experience, Evan reads the 
			journal, the scrawled words pop off the page and dance a bit, the 
			space around him warps, and whoosh, he's back in the memory. As a 
			boy (played by John Patrick Amedori), Evan is now (then) armed with 
			his present knowledge, whatever that &quot;present&quot; might be: the concept 
			is more than a little squishy here. </font></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">During his 
			first leap-back, aided by his college roommate Thumper (Ethan Suplee 
			in spiky hair and goth makeup), Evan recalls that the neighbor girl 
			he adored, Kayleigh (Irene Gorovaia as a child, Amy Smart in the 
			Ashton Kutcher present) was sexually abused by her alcoholic, 
			amateur-porn-filmmaker father (Eric Stoltz, as yucky as he's ever 
			been). But the situation isn't so simple that he can just save 
			Kayleigh. He must also contend with -- rescue, punish, contain -- 
			other players in his not-quite-personal psychic morass. These 
			include Kayleigh's malicious brother Tommy (who grows up to be 
			William Lee Scott) and another kid from round the way, the much 
			beset Lenny (Elden Henson), as well as Ashton's mom Andrea (Melora 
			Walters), who is at once strangely circumspect regarding her 
			husband's illness and incarceration, and whiny and apparently 
			clueless when it comes to her son's situation. </font></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ostensibly 
			through his college studies (what school is this?), Evan has found 
			this route, not only to revisit the past, but also to change it. He 
			injects his 20-year-old sensibility into his child-body, and so, for 
			instance, telling off Kayleigh's bad dad so soundly that he agrees 
			never to even think about abusing his daughter, on the spot (the 
			scene doesn't address the likelihood that abuse has occurred 
			earlier, or that this single intervention might not stop other 
			incidents). In other words, the time loop business is not very 
			worked out -- not only is Evan's version of events presumed here to 
			be the only version, but also, his control over each episode somehow 
			affects his brain cumulatively. Indeed, his psychiatrist, the 
			occasionally reasonable Dr. Renfield (Nathaniel Deveaux), suggests 
			that Evan is headed for a kind of protoplasmic meltdown. </font></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">No matter. 
			Evan is hooked on revising until he gets it right (not an unlikely 
			metaphor for scriptwriting). His modifications range from horrific 
			to fiendishly comedic: the first &quot;corrected&quot; past, for instance, is 
			garishly pastel, the &quot;ideal&quot; college movie turned into a nightmare. 
			Evan is a yellow-sweatered fraternity brother, in love with a pink-sweatered 
			Kaleigh. That Tommy is a puppy-killing psychotic just released from 
			prison almost seems like the least of their problems. </font></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The more 
			profound implication here is less about particular possibilities, 
			than the very idea of multiple possibilities -- all slightly or very 
			distasteful in different ways. Each time Evan fusses with a specific 
			event in the past, trying to achieve a &quot;perfect&quot; present, something 
			else goes wrong. So, if Kayleigh is not a hooker with tracks up and 
			down her arms, Evan's in prison for murdering Tommy, or poor Lenny 
			is so fundamentally damaged that he can't leave his bedroom (which 
			makes Lenny's mom really mad at Evan). Though the plot points and 
			personalities Evan has to coordinate might seem many, in fact, they 
			hardly account for the many more probable fallouts of his tinkering. 
			The movie's focus is excessively local -- there are no Hitlers or 
			Elvises or Skynets here, just a series of minor and major disasters, 
			each making someone's life unbearable. </font></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This tight 
			focus is, in fact, the primary strength of <i>The Butterfly Effect</i>. 
			At first full of himself and his righteous ability to tell off 
			Kayleigh's monstrous dad, Evan comes to see that his godlike 
			influence is, in its limited way, monumentally repercussive. Finding 
			himself personally responsible for lives and deaths, he begins to 
			feel increasingly empathetic. At the same time, the fact that no one 
			else appears to have much to say about what happens (it's all inside 
			Evan's throbbing brain, the power, the effects, the memories) is a 
			perennial problem of time-travel movies. Here, the travel is 
			subjective to a nearly pathological degree. Evan's &quot;lesson&quot; becomes 
			a function of his effects on those around him, who become mere 
			objects to be shuffled about during his learning curve. </font></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There are any 
			number of bad ideas in this film -- the warping scenes are 
			elaborately corny, and the ill effects of Evan's changes look 
			increasingly like an extreme version of the &quot;World Without George&quot; 
			in <i>It's a Wonderful Life</i> -- child abuse, prison rape, missing 
			limbs, dead babies, cancer, on and on. Everyone Evan knows 
			(admittedly a small circle for this film's purposes) is affected by 
			his choices. The time travel concept is not so extraordinary, the 
			means of dramatizing it is mostly silly, and Kutcher's efforts to 
			emote can be distracting. And still, the film is surprisingly 
			entertaining, precisely when it turns extreme. Complicating the 
			relation between subjective and objective experience, remaking 
			memory so that it might pass for &quot;collective,&quot; is, after all, what 
			movies do, by definition. </font></td>
