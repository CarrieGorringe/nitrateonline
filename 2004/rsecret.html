            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 13 March 2004</i></font><p>
			<font size="5" face="Verdana">Icky </font></p>
			<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mort Rainey (Johnny Depp) talks 
			to himself. He first appears in <i>Secret Window</i> in his car, his 
			voice-over ominous, both immediate and abstract: &quot;Turn around. Turn 
			the car around and get the hell out of here, right now.&quot; He does it, 
			the camera aimed through the windshield and so tight on his face 
			that you have no idea where he is or what he's turning from. That 
			is, until he turns again, spinning his vehicle back toward the motel 
			that he was, apparently, trying to leave. Screeching to a stop, he 
			grabs a room key, screeches to the room, and bursts in the door, 
			whereupon he confronts a couple entangled in bed -- all three 
			parties flailing, loud, livid. </font></b></p>
			<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The scene cuts to &quot;six months 
			later,&quot; and Mort lies passed out on his sofa. Wrapped in a tattered 
			bathrobe, his hair flies about his face even when he's still, which 
			he is not for long. Comes a knock at the door, and with that, the 
			descent into the sort of madness that afflicts characters -- 
			especially writers -- in Stephen King stories. Based on a novella, 
			David Koepp's film manages about an hour's worth of decent 
			creepiness (helped by Philip Glass's menacing score, as well as Fred 
			Murphy's adroitly moody cinematography) before it spins into an 
			ordinary and too-obvious-ahead-of-time finale. </font></p>
			<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Whatever its visual and soundtrack 
			merits, <i>Secret Window</i>'s foremost asset is the wondrous Depp. 
			Mort Rainey -- so ignominiously named -- is alternately twitchy and 
			glib, annoying and charming. A mystery writer, he has followed up 
			his ill-planned assault on his even-then-estranged wife Amy (Maria 
			Bello) and her lover Ted (Timothy Hutton) with an extended hole-up 
			at his isolated home in upstate New York. Depressed and unable to 
			write, he sits in front of his laptop and stares at the screen (last 
			word before the blinking cursor: &quot;I&quot;), talking it over with his dog, 
			Chico. &quot;No bad writing,&quot; he says at last, wearily deleting the 
			partial paragraph with a decisive keystroke. </font></p>
			<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Or maybe it only seems decisive. 
			This non-exchange actually comes after that knock at the door, very 
			decisive indeed, by one John Shooter (John Turturro), a Mississippi 
			farmer come to town to accuse Mort of &quot;stealing&quot; his story. That it 
			happens to be a story about an angry man murdering his estranged 
			wife is hardly coincidence; neither is it an accident that Shooter's 
			name is Shooter, or that he wants Mort to &quot;change the ending,&quot; that 
			is, make it perfect, the way he originally wrote it. Vaguely ruffled 
			(though it's hard to tell, as he just looks generally ruffled), Mort 
			insists he has proof of authorship, a 1995 <i>Ellery Queen</i> 
			magazine with his name on the story. John threatens violence 
			(colorfully, as in, &quot;I'll burn your life and everyone in it like a 
			cornfield in a high wind&quot;) if Mort does not produce said proof 
			within three days. </font></p>
			<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Baffled by John's aggression and 
			appearance (especially his rather distinctive hat), Mort is yet 
			inclined to take the charge seriously. This because he has a history 
			of plagiarism (though, as he repeats, &quot;It was just that one time&quot;), 
			and because property -- as a concept -- has recently become 
			important for him, owing to the breakup with Amy. First, he's not 
			yet signed divorce papers, and resents that she's living in their 
			house in Riverdale (spying on her in the driveway with Ted, he 
			quotes Talking Heads: &quot;This is not my beautiful wife&quot;). Second, he 
			resents Ted's incursion, accusing him of covetousness: &quot;I know how 
			you like my things!&quot; </font></p>
			<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">While Mort appears oddly able to 
			handle Shooter's recurring visitations (feigning courage, he 
			brandishes a fire poker, and then a shovel), he's increasingly 
			unable to cope with the specter of Amy and Ted's romance. She hardly 
			helps, either, calling regularly to wonder about her own decisions 
			and ask for forgiveness: &quot;It's my fault,&quot; she cries, or again, &quot;Do 
			you think things would have been different if we hadn't lost the 
			baby?&quot; (As a device to &quot;explain&quot; the couple's distress, this 
			unexplored tidbit of history is exceedingly trite.) Dreading Amy's 
			calls, Mort resorts to childish tactics, unplugging the phone or 
			making faces at the receiver when she does get through. At the same 
			time that she's working her distraught manipulations, Ted makes an 
			unannounced appearance, asking that Mort just sign the papers and 
			get it over with. &quot;I don't respond well to intimidation,&quot; Mort 
			whines. &quot;It makes me feel icky.&quot; </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana"><i><font size="2">Secret Window</font></i><font size="2"> 
			is, above all, about how icky Mort feels. Fortunately, as the plot 
			generated by this subjective state turns increasingly predictable, 
			Johnny Depp turns increasingly inventive and effectively comic. As 
			he's done in the past (see: <i>Sleepy Hollow</i>, <i>Dead Man</i>,
			<i>The Astronaut's Wife</i>), the actor makes the uncanny seem both 
			familiar and startling. His face contorts and his fingers flutter, 
			suggesting depths of feeling -- betrayal, desire, delusion -- that 
			extend beyond the film's conventionally bloody machinations. </font>
			</font></p>
			<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">These grind into gear when, 
			bothered by Shooter's bullying and unconvinced that the local 
			Sheriff (Len Cariou) has enough on the ball to protect him, Mort 
			calls on a Manhattan detective he's hired previously, Ken Karsch 
			(Charles S. Dutton). Skeptical regarding the claim and Mort's sickly 
			pallor, Ken makes his own demand:&quot; &quot;I still need to know the truth. 
			Is he a regular wacko like you've had before?&quot; The truth is it's 
			hard to be a celebrity writer, as King has depicted more than once. 
			It's also hard to be a wacko, by the way, as well as a plagiarist.
			</font></p>
			<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Mort's efforts to live down his 
			past might make for an intriguing and timely predicament (as Jayson 
			Blair is this very week making the talk show rounds, promoting his 
			book about being a plagiarist at the <i>New York Times</i>). Even 
			more interesting, perhaps, is the difficulty of plagiarizing from 
			oneself, surely a subject with which King has some experience, as <i>
			Secret Window</i> makes obvious. </font></td>
