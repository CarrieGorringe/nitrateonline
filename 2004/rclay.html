			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>The Clay Bird (Matir Moina)</i>, 
			the first Bangladeshi film (technically it's a 
			French-Bangladeshi-Indian co-production) commercially released in 
			the United States, is a poignant tale set in East Pakistan (now 
			Bangladesh) of a family ripped apart by their country's political 
			upheaval in the late 1960s. The husband and wife team of Tareque and 
			Catherine Masud—both writing (their first fictional feature), he 
			directing (his first), she producing (ditto) -- have been involved 
			with numerous documentaries for nearly a decade. The story, based on 
			Tareque's childhood experiences in Faridpur (Catherine is a native 
			Chicagoan), centers on a charming boy, Anu (Nurul Islam Bablu), 
			whose father, Kazi (Jayanto Chattopadhyay), a stubbornly zealous 
			Muslim fundamentalist, too weak to opt for change, is the 
			disintegrating core of their lower-middle-class family. Kazi's 
			independently-minded wife, Ayesha (Rokeya Prachy) is kept under a 
			too watchful eye of her husband (which catches her participating in 
			an anti-dictatorship rally) and his steadfast ways. Their son, 
			accused of celebrating too many colorful Hindu festivals, is sent 
			off to a <i>madrasa</i>, a fiercely Islamic school, where he is to 
			be indoctrinated more to the liking of his father. Shorn of his hair 
			and chastised by one of his teacher for not having a truly Muslin 
			name, Anu finds solace in Rokon (Russell Farazi), a fish-hating 
			classmate, who frees himself of the oppressive structure by playing 
			with an invisible ball. A friendship is born when Anu tosses the 
			ball back.</font></b></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film crosses 
			back and forth between the growing friendship between the two boys 
			and the remaining family back home in Faridpur, who suffer under 
			Kazi's intimidating rule, an isolating and ultimately unnecessarily 
			tragic situation for Ayesha and Anu's younger sister Asma (Lameesa 
			R. Reemjheem), This despite the behind-Kazi's-back help of Milon (Soaeb 
			Islam), Kazi's younger brother, a liberal humanist-activist 
			concerned about the growing unrest that seems closer to home with 
			each passing day.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Anu's gift of a 
			bright blue clay bird to Asma is a metaphor for the hope of freedom 
			from the tyranny that has imprisoned their family, of the 
			anticipation that freedom and democracy, however painful, however 
			many lives may be lost in its expectation, may bring a better 
			understanding and acceptance of the people, community, nation, and 
			world in which we live. That extremism is a painful master. Among 
			the many folk songs performed in the film (and music does play an 
			important role in <i>The Clay Bird</i>), included amongst those by 
			the riverside singers that travel from village to village is <i>
			Pakhita Bondi Ache</i>, a ballad which further reflects on the theme 
			of hopelessness: &quot;The clay bird laments: 'Why did you infuse my 
			heart with longing, if you didn't give my wings the strength to 
			fly?'&quot;</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film, 
			finished in 2002 and shown at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2002, 
			where it won the International Critics' Prize for best film in the 
			Directors' Fortnight program, still had trouble, initially, finding 
			its footing on its native land. Bangladesh censors banned the film, 
			believing it could &quot;hurt the religious sentiment of one section of 
			society.&quot; Perhaps someone thought that Kazi's character shouldn't 
			have been cast in such a disparaging light. That ban, battled by the 
			country's press and through the Internet, was overturned by an 
			appeal board and the film smashed box office records when it 
			premiered in Dhaka in mid-October 2002.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As enlightened as 
			our American society can be (and its far from perfect on its part of 
			the globe), <i>The Clay Bird</i> provides a personal glimpse at a 
			very common occurrence in the Muslim/Hindu corner of the world, 
			encapsulating the conflict and contradiction that has made parts of 
			our world a hostile place for freedom. It's something we all, even 
			in the United States, need to learn from. Tareque Masud has crafted 
			an emotionally powerful, sadly poignant, and tragically melancholy 
			story as seen through the eyes of a child trying to understand the 
			inhumanity attacking him from all sides. <i>The Clay Bird</i> is a 
			incredibly humbling experience that you'd be a fool to miss.</font></td>
