			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Along with being what must be the 
			longest poo-poo joke routine in the history of movies, <i>Envy</i> 
			must also be the only movie to build an extended comic riff around 
			flan. Ben Stiller and Jack Black play Tim and Nick, longtime friends 
			who live with their wives and families on the end of a suburban 
			cul-de-sac, right under the high voltage towers, and who commute 
			every day back and forth from their office jobs at a 3-M plant 
			(which is lit and looks like the office Tom Hanks escaped from at 
			the beginning of <i>Joe Versus the Volcano</i>). Just when they're 
			about to irrevocably turn stultified, Nick gets an idea one day for 
			a product, a spray that can make animal feces instantly disappear -- 
			&quot;Vapoorize&quot;, which the public, then the world, embraces. Rather than 
			move, Nick simply builds a bigger house where he already lives, with 
			an outdoor carousel and a white horse that keeps wandering over to 
			eat apples in Tim's yard. When they have dinner at Nick's house, 
			they eat off of fancy tableware, at the conclusion of which, for 
			dessert, out come the plates of flan -- which, in the film, looks 
			like sponge cake with runny caramel sauce spooned on top. Tim's 
			already burgeoning sense of inadequacy (he passed on the chance to 
			invest in &quot;Vapoorize&quot;) is made even worse when his young son says, 
			forlornly, &quot;Boy, I liked that flan. I wish we had flan.&quot; Like the 
			word &quot;poo&quot;, the word &quot;flan&quot; is used in the movie as if just having 
			the characters say it would be enough to provoke gales of laughter 
			from the audience, just as Tim's gaudy, ostentatious spending is 
			supposed to make us believe that we should laugh at him because he 
			doesn't have the sense to possess good taste.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Envy</i> is also one of the 
			ugliest-looking Hollywood movies to come along in years -- decrepit 
			colors, mostly browns, as if the whole thing had been left out on 
			the back stoop for too long. (Which it has -- the movie was supposed 
			to have been released last year.) The director Barry Levinson 
			evidently saw this as his chance to make a Farrelly brothers movie, 
			the visual scheme part and parcel of the movie's idea to create 
			laffs by showing how everyone can be gauche and outrageously gross. 
			Long routines are built around the disposal of an animal carcass, 
			and around one character getting shot in the back with an arrow and 
			trying to get someone to pull it out. There's even a recurring song 
			(terrible) that comments on the action like the one in <i>There's 
			Something About Mary</i>. And, of course, in one of those missing 
			plot details by which pictures like this so precariously hang, 
			nobody ever has &quot;Vapoorize&quot; tested to find out where the excrement 
			GOES after it disappears. Mostly, we're stuck watching one joke 
			after another go down in flames, like fighter planes on the horizon 
			during World War Two. The film's biggest joke, though, is that 
			Black's character, Nick, never acts out of maliciousness -- he 
			spends his wealth, but he's still nice.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jack Black, to his credit, never 
			compromises his character by giving him an ingenuous moment. 
			Christopher Walken almost manages to make the impossible character 
			he's got work -- a barfly and bum who aids Stiller's Tim in 
			elaborate plans of revenge. (I almost expected Walken's character, 
			&quot;the J-Man&quot;, to turn out to be a figment of Tim's imagination -- 
			and, in an earlier incarnation of the movie, maybe he was.) Ben 
			Stiller, though, is turning into a comedian who, when in doubt, 
			flails his way through a movie, like a thresher through a wheat 
			field. Some performers can do this gracefully, but Stiller doesn't 
			have the grace, or time, to do so (this is the third would-be comedy 
			he's been in this year), the result of which is that he becomes 
			depressing and tiresome to watch. Bad enough, considering that he's 
			working in a film which is blighted from the get-go.</font></td>
