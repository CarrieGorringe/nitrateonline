</font><i><font size="1" face="Verdana">interview by <a href="../kj.html" target="_top">KJ 
Doughton</a>, 16 April 2003</font></i></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">David Carradine has opened an 
industrial-sized vat of whoop-ass over his long and checkered career, so it’s 
not surprising that a tinge of anxiety would precede an encounter with the 6 
foot 2 inch star of <i>Kill Bill</i>.&nbsp; Fortunately, this icon of both the cinema 
(<i>Bound For Glory, The Long Riders</i>) and the small screen (<i>Kung Fu</i>) 
appears sedate and talkative as he reclines in a swanky room at Seattle’s 
Fairmont Hotel.&nbsp; </font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">White smoke trails upward from a cigarette, one 
of many that Carradine will pull from a silver smokes case and light up over the 
course of the next forty-five minutes. Smoking, it seems, was key to a bonding 
experience he shared with <i>Kill Bill</i> director Quentin Tarantino during 
production, which resulted in much of the spectacular wordplay that concludes 
the film. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;When we were in pre-production in Beijing,&quot; 
Carradine explains, sitting cross-legged in a hotel chair, &quot;I got a call one 
evening in my hotel room. It was Quentin. He said, ‘Do you smoke cigars?’&nbsp; I 
said, ‘Yeah.’ He said, ‘There’s a cigar lounge here at the hotel. Will you meet 
me there?’ So we met there, smoked cigars, and had this conversation about 
Superman and superheroes, and all that. Six days later, there was a re-write to 
the script. And there it was, in the movie.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The resulting monologue from this inspired 
stogie session is the capper to <i>Kill Bill</i>, a speech delivered by 
Carradine that covers parenting, goldfish, life, death, and the romantic regrets 
of a hardened-yet-human killer.&nbsp; Of course, there’s also the part about why 
Superman is the toughest badass hero of ‘em all.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Such dialogue delights, but doesn’t necessarily 
surprise. After all, Tarantino’s comic book fixation has left its mark on his 
work as consistently as the funnies brand newspapers each day. Tony Scott’s <i>
True Romance</i> (which Tarantino scripted) featured a comic store slacker as 
its hero, and even the submarine actioner <i>Crimson Tide</i> (also directed by 
Scott, but partially penned by Tarantino) gave us Denzel Washington singing the 
praises of Marvel Comics’ Silver Surfer.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What <i>is </i>surprising about Tarantino, 
however, is his open, improvisational approach to such unique movie moments.&nbsp; 
According to Carradine (who knows a thing or two about the methodry of legendary 
directors, having played the lead in Martin Scorsese’s <i>Boxcar Bertha</i> in 
1972), the set of <i>Kill Bill</i> was a testing ground for tinkering, revising, 
and experimenting. &quot;Most of the time (during filmmaking),&quot; Carradine laments, 
extending his cigarette with jade-ringed fingers, &quot;the director has a 
preconceived notion of what he’s gonna do. And he’ll do it, come hell or high 
water, even if it’s not the greatest idea any more.&nbsp; Maybe the location isn’t 
right, or maybe the chemistry between the actors isn’t there. But he’ll do it 
anyway.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;But Quentin is open to changing with the wind, 
and he did it with his writing right up until the very end.&nbsp; That whole final 
monologue changed, like five times.&nbsp; The last time it changed was the day that I 
came in to do it!&nbsp; I had the whole thing committed to memory, and he just threw 
it out the window and started over.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Carradine reflects on such challenges not with 
frustration, but with a deep respect for the moviemaking auteur behind classics
<i>Reservoir Dogs</i> and <i>Pulp Fiction</i>. Part of this appreciation springs 
from gratitude: Tarantino put the actor’s career on the &quot;in demand&quot; track with
<i>Kill Bill</i>, much as he raised the value of Pam Grier’s stock from depths 
of obscurity by casting her in 1997’s <i>Jackie Brown</i>. Like Grier, 
Carradine’s status as a genre icon – not only as martial arts wanderer Caine in 
the long-running seventies T.V. series <i>Kung Fu</i>, but also as a hero of 
pulpy B-movie classics like 1975’s <i>Death Race 2000</i>- put him on 
Tarantino’s radar early on.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Quentin had read my autobiography, had seen my 
movies, and was a <i>Kung Fu</i> fan,&quot; Carradine informs with a grin, revealing 
perfect teeth. &quot;In fact, he collects 16 mm prints of the series, and <i>Shane</i> 
(1966), too. And he could actually recite <i>Americana</i> (1981), a picture I 
directed. I guess in that respect, I had a lot of influence on Bill’s character.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;With Bill, however, Quentin got me out of what 
I’ve done my whole career, which is to <i>construct</i> a character.&nbsp; Like, ‘Oh, 
I’m a folk singer,’ or, ‘I’m the guy who started the Civil War.’ But Quentin 
kept opening me up to just <i>be</i> there.&nbsp; It was not a constructed 
performance.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Kill Bill</i> presented the veteran onscreen 
shit-kicker with another challenge, as well.&nbsp; Following Miramax’s decision to 
slice the film into two halves and release each as a separate entity (<i>Kill 
Bill Vol. 1</i> surfaced in October, 2003), Bill would ultimately appear only as 
a malevolent voice in the first installment.&nbsp; Nonetheless, his title character 
looms large and casts a commanding shadow.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;It was originally conceived as one movie,&quot; he 
explains of the two-film extravaganza. &quot;Quentin was gonna keep Bill out of it 
for awhile and build up this idea of him as an incredibly powerful, cruel, 
monstrous guy. Then, you meet him and he’s likeable and charming. There was one 
point, where there was a close-up of me at the end of the first movie. Then, 
(Tarantino) took that back out and though, &quot;I’m gonna keep this a complete 
mystery (until the second film).&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In <i>Kill Bill Vol. 2</i>, Carradine’s main 
man becomes flesh to eventually dominate the story.&nbsp; Bill is revealed as a 
storyteller, spinning yarns in front of a firepit, behind a wet bar, and on the 
front porch of a Texas chapel.&nbsp; While the character is proficient with hands, 
feet, and weaponry, Carradine is seldom seen exercising such fighting skills. 
His strength comes from the script’s tasty wordplay, instead. Whether offering a 
fellow assassin advice on how to survive martial arts training with an 
unforgiving teacher (&quot;Do what he says, or he’ll snap your neck and back like 
twigs), or reflecting on his own bloodstained past (&quot;Some things can never be 
undone&quot;), Carradine’s villain is a memorable, magnetic force.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;It’s hard to talk about the process,&quot; he 
comments of Bill’s transition from unseen foe to prominent presence. &quot;Putting it 
into two movies totally changed the concept.&nbsp; The result is that you have two 
very different movies.&nbsp; The first movie is pure action, but the second moves a 
lot faster, actually. The cutting is choppier - more Tarantino-styled and ‘get 
it on!’- but the content is rambling all over the place.&nbsp; That’s more of what 
we’re used to with Tarantino.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Asked which of the two <i>Kill Bill</i> films 
is his personal favorite, Carradine flashes his impressive, smiling choppers and 
exhales another cloud of cigarette smoke.&nbsp; &quot;I actually like the second movie 
better,&quot; he laughs. &quot;But, of course, I’m <i>in</i> it.&quot; </font></p>
