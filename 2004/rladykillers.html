            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 26 March 2004</i></font><p>
			<font face="Verdana" size="5">In the age of Montel </font></p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Marva Munson (Irma P. Hall) 
			lives and prays in the Baptist Bible Belt. She reveres her dead 
			husband, whose portrait looms from over the fireplace, and she will 
			suffer neither fools nor &quot;that hippity hop music&quot;: &quot;Do you know what 
			they call colored folks in them songs?&quot; she harrumphs for Sheriff 
			Wyner (George Wallace). &quot;Niggers: I won't say it twice. Two thousand 
			years after Jesus, 30 years after Martin. In the age of Montel.&quot;
			</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Pious, earnest, and broadly drawn, 
			Marva is the first black character in a Coen brothers movie to 
			occupy center stage. For a minute, anyway, until her doorway is 
			darkened by Professor Goldthwait Higginson Dorr, III (Tom Hanks). 
			Doffing his white hat and sweeping aside his white cape, Dorr 
			smiles, presuming his intellect will overwhelm this sweet old lady. 
			When she insists that she only means to let her extra room to a 
			&quot;quiet man,&quot; he reassures her, sort of, &quot;Madame, you are addressing 
			a man who is quiet, and yet, not quiet, if I may offer a riddle.&quot; 
			Twitchy and sly, Professor Dorr is given to spasms of self-satisfied 
			laughter and flights of poetry, in particular, by Edgar Allen Poe (a 
			favorite being &quot;To Helen,&quot; wherein the Professor adopts the 
			yearning, melodramatic pose of &quot;The weary, wayworn wanderer,&quot; 
			endeavoring to impress his hostess with his bookishness). </font>
			</p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Based on the 1955 Ealing Studios 
			movie of the same name, <i>The Ladykillers</i> sets up a contest 
			between earthly cunning and spirited faith, where the loser has no 
			idea that he's losing, even as it's happening. At first, <i>The 
			Ladykillers</i> looks to be the sort of antic, violent comedy for 
			which the Coens are renowned, even beloved. Dorr's scheme is 
			outwardly straightforward: he tells Marva that his decidedly odd 
			crew is a Renaissance music ensemble in need of rehearsal space. Her 
			root cellar, he exults, is &quot;more than perfect.&quot; In truth, the crew 
			(assembled by means of a &quot;Help Wanted&quot; ad in the local paper, plans 
			to rob the collection room of a riverboat gambling establishment by 
			tunneling from the cellar to what Dorr terms &quot;repositories of free 
			lucre.&quot; </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Each team member is assigned a 
			specific task, and each is potentially offensive in his own way, 
			especially with regard to their decorous landlady. Casino 
			maintenance worker Gawain MacSam (Marlon Wayans) can't stop himself 
			from cursing in her Christian home; the General (Tzi Ma) 
			chain-smokes; demolitions expert Garth Pancake (J.K. Simmons) tends 
			to bluster and set off explosions inadvertently; and the 
			tunnel-digging muscle, Lump (Ryan Hurst) sweats and grunts, unable 
			to put sentences together. (An erstwhile football player, Lump's 
			dismissal from his last team is revealed in spastic flashback, shot 
			from inside the kid's helmet as he's conked in the head: thunk.)
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Predictably, these assorted 
			wannabes fight among themselves, jockeying for positions and shares. 
			Alone among the &quot;merry band of brothers,&quot; Pancake has a sweetheart, 
			Mountain Girl (the resourceful Diane Delano, who deserves better 
			than this one-note role). Pancake reports that they met at a weekend 
			seminar for Irritable Bowel Syndrome sufferers, a plot point that 
			introduces a series of farty, uncontrollable body gags (when Pancake 
			refers to his condition as &quot;IBS,&quot; Gawain is befuddled: &quot;You be 
			what?&quot;). While <i>The Ladykillers</i> is at least partly about 
			immoderation and self-interest, this bit of metaphor is, in a word, 
			unoriginal. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's hard to say who is the most 
			flamboyant, though Dorr, being the group's pompous, self-selected 
			spokesman, has most opportunity to exhibit his preposterous 
			mannerisms. Of the many self-involved individuals who populate Joel 
			and Ethan Coen's movies, Dorr ranks among the most precious and 
			least sympathetic. This has to do with Hanks' mustering of a notably 
			obnoxious affect, as well as Dorr's opposition to Marva, who remains 
			indomitable and sensible even as Dorr presumes his own superiority.
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Much as Dorr tries to limit the 
			interactions between Marva and the men, a curiously complex 
			relationship develops between Marva and Gawain. This despite the 
			film's concerted efforts to reduce it to slapstick, as in the 
			currently rotating promotional clip, when Marva slaps Gawain silly 
			for using foul language in her Christian home. Again, it's a simple 
			gag, premised on stereotypes, without challenge. &quot;Youth ain't no 
			excuse for nothing,&quot; she asserts, even as Gawain begins to lose hold 
			of his rebellious pose, seeing in her a version of his own mama. For 
			the other men, he points out, Marva is just another gullible black 
			lady, but to him, she represents culture, history, and personal 
			guilt all at once. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>The Ladykillers</i>, as Tom 
			Hanks has pointed out in more than one recent interview, needs a 
			formidable woman to counter the would-be &quot;killers.&quot; Marva provides 
			appropriate resistance, even as she has to spend so much of the film 
			off-screen, to allow the men to go on about their hijinks. Astute in 
			her way (&quot;I know mischief when I see it,&quot; she warns the sniveling 
			Dorr), she also sees what she needs to see in order to make sense of 
			the chaos around her. Marva's fist appearance in the film, back at 
			Sheriff Wyner's office, lays out her worldview, which is less 
			correct than it is convincing. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">By contrast, Dorr's cynicism looks 
			almost disingenuous. This even though the film, like other Coen 
			brothers projects, assumes a somewhat condescending stance with 
			regard to her church ladies group, affection for her cat Pickles, 
			and devotion to her husband (whose portrait changes expressions, as 
			if judging the scoundrels who have infested his home). That she 
			remains a mystery to Dorr and the others -- not to mention the fact 
			that she's played by Hall -- grants Marva her own sort of dignity, 
			but the movie doesn't provide much in the way of explanation or 
			empathy. She's as unsubtle a character as any of the others, but 
			considerably less discomforting. In the age of Montel, maybe that 
			counts as progress. </font></td>
