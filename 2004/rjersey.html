            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../kj.html" target="_top">KJ Doughton</a>, 27 March 2004</i></font><p class="MsoNormal">
			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Jersey Girl</i> might not be 
			Kevin Smith’s most original movie, but it’s daring all the same. 
			Why? Because Smith, long a hero of subversive vulgarians and jaded 
			potheads, has come to realize that good ol’ love of family – and the 
			sacrifices inherent to successful parenting and marriage – are every 
			bit as dramatic and “true” as clerk-store philosophy and chasing 
			lesbians. As a bonus, it’s also the first life-affirming family 
			values film in recent memory to use the term “coke whore.” </font>
			</b></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Critics will slam 
			Smith’s movie for being cliched (it’s far more familiar territory 
			than <i>Dogma</i>), but the reality is that <i>life</i> is often 
			mundane, and predictable. Such is the price that Joe Family Man 
			proudly pays to bring home the bacon, and Smith knows this. The 
			director is a parent himself, and the cold winds of mortality have 
			touched him via the passing of his father last year (<i>Jersey Girl</i> 
			is dedicated to Smith’s beloved “Pop”).&nbsp;</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Such 
			life-changing loss also impacts the fast-lane routine of <i>Jersey 
			Girl</i>’s hero, Ollie Trinket (Ben Affleck), a slick music 
			publicist with over 100 clients. Whooping it up with celebrities in 
			New York, Trinket occasionally drops in on his grizzled, alcoholic 
			dad (George Carlin, legendary comedian but an underrated actor whose 
			expressive, lived-in eyes can elicit a wedding’s worth of emotions).
			</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The elder Trinket 
			lives a humble but proud existence driving a street-sweeper in New 
			Jersey, and he’s a bit surprised when his typically self-involved 
			son brings a new flame over to visit. Gertie (Jennifer Lopez) is an 
			energetic firecracker of a book editor, whose spunk and honesty 
			immediately find favor with the Old Man. “I was gonna dump him,” she 
			says of Ollie, “but maybe I should sleep with him a few more times 
			and stick around.” Before the night is over, father, son, and 
			soon-to-be spouse are downing beers at the nearby watering hole.
			</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ollie and Gertie 
			marry, but the union is short-lived and tragic. While giving birth 
			to their daughter, Gertie suffers an aneurysm and dies abruptly on 
			the delivery table. Ollie barely recovers from this jolting trauma, 
			plunging into his work and leaving his infant in the older, wiser 
			hands of his dad. But the widow’s pain surfaces inconveniently, 
			during an important press conference. Angered by an impatient crowd 
			of journalists, Ollie lambastes the masses as “jerk-offs writing for 
			worthless rags.” Big mistake. </font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Following this 
			outburst, Ollie is booted from his big-shot publicity company, 
			settling in with dad for the next few years to ride shotgun in the 
			street-sweeper as a public works employee. Meanwhile, Gertie Jr. 
			(Raquel Castro) grows into a bright-eyed seven-year old with 
			raven-haired curls and a heart-melting smile. But she’s not perfect. 
			“Go back in and flush the toilet,” Ollie insists when her bathroom 
			responsibilities go unfinished. Meanwhile, when the father seizes an 
			opportunity to return to his old, big-city ways, Ollie must again 
			choose between small-town stability and living large.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Smith has stated 
			that Affleck acts as his onscreen doppelganger (think DeNiro and 
			Scorsese as inebriated fraternity brothers, and you get the idea), a 
			pretty-boy star impersonating the director’s own life experiences 
			and perception for the camera (<i>Chasing Amy</i>). But this time, 
			the casting choice seems wrong. We can buy a homely, insecure 
			nebbish like Woody Allen trying to discreetly purchase a copy of 
			“Orgasm” magazine from a busy bookstore, but when Smith has Affleck 
			renting porno tapes at a video outlet, it’s tough to suspend 
			disbelief. You see, Ollie has been celibate since his wife died, and 
			he’s hard up. Put someone like, well, Smith himself (whose casual, 
			rumpled, teddy-bear appearance is like an East Coast Michael Moore) 
			in the picture, and it rings true. But Mr. Bennifer? No way.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And when the 
			video store he stumbles into turns out to be managed by gorgeous Liv 
			Tyler, who sympathizes with Ollie’s plight and offers him a “mercy 
			jump,” we know we’re in a universe created only in Hollywood.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But so what? Even 
			if the leads seem a tad too photogenic for this messy story, the 
			film’s main themes ring true. Ollie must repeatedly make decisions. 
			Work or family? New York or New Jersey? Show-biz glitz or down-home 
			grit? And when he weathers traffic and other assorted obstacles in 
			an effort to attend Gertie’s school play, this paternal mission is 
			suspenseful. We sense his love for Gertie, and see what’s at stake, 
			even if the setup is familiar. </font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For those old 
			school <i>Clerks</i> fans crying “sellout,” Smith throws them a 
			consolation prize by slathering his “nice” story with fecal-covered 
			fart jokes and profane prick references. When Tyler confesses to 
			being a serial masturbator, Ollie asks, “Don’t you get carpal 
			tunnel?” And to the director’s credit, such parenting pleasantries 
			as diaper changing are confronted head-on (“Wipe from front to 
			back”). </font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">One’s take on <i>
			Jersey Girl</i> will depend on audience expectations. For those 
			willing to break away from the numbing, depression induced drone of 
			such downers as <i>Mystic River</i> and <i>Dawn of the Dead</i>, 
			Smith’s life-affirming valentine to fathers and daughters might 
			serve as an uplifting Prozac for the eyes. Kevin Smith has weaned 
			himself of doper gags and explored a new course while weathering 
			life’s unpredictable path. But expect the ol’ profane jester to keep 
			emerging, even as this View Askew guru continues getting older. 
			After all, think of what he could do with colostomy bags, Attends, 
			and stool softeners.</font></td>
