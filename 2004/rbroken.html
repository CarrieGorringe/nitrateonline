			<font face="Verdana" size="5">Endless loss </font></p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Maya Ullman (Maya Maron) wears 
			wings when she performs. An aspiring singer-songwriter, she prepares 
			for a gig by donning black legging, a dusting of face glitter, and a 
			pair of black gossamer wings. Backstage, just before her band's spot 
			in a local contest, her mother, Dafna (Orli Zilberschatz-Banai), 
			tells her she has to come home. Dafna's been called for a night 
			shift at the hospital where she works as a midwife, and 17-year-old 
			Maya has to babysit 11-year-old Ido (Daniel Magon) and six-year-old 
			Bahr (Eliana Magon, who dubbed Lilo's voice in Hebrew for <i>Lilo &amp; 
			Stitch</i>). </font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At the start of <i>Broken Wings</i>, 
			Maya declares Maya declares her independence, telling her mother 
			that she won't give up her chance at potential stardom, and then, in 
			the next moment, she appears riding her bicycle through the dark 
			streets of Haifa, her broken wings quivering behind her. She arrives 
			home just in time to help Dafna jumpstart the unreliable family car 
			by pushing it down a hill. Thus established as a dependable, if 
			reluctant, &quot;angel,&quot; Maya puts her siblings to bed and shuts herself 
			in her bedroom to listen to the contest on the radio. When her band 
			performs, the good-looking guitarist Yoram (Danny Niv) sings the 
			song she wrote -- not very well, but poignantly. Maya smiles, 
			imagining what might have been. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meantime, Maya's twin brother, Yair 
			(Nitai Gvirtz), comes home late, after riding the subway all night. 
			He's dropped out of high school (where Maya is also struggling), and 
			has taken a job handing out advertising flyers to passengers. It's 
			no coincidence that for this gig, he dresses as a mouse, with 
			enormous head and scrawny tail. The costume, like Maya's wings, 
			designates an emotional state. He feels small and trapped, he's quit 
			playing basketball (which he apparently loved), and he's stopped 
			interacting with his family, except for brief exchanges with Maya, 
			whom he calls &quot;Skeleton,&quot; referring to her emaciated appearance, 
			itself an allusion to her emotional neediness. The girl is starving 
			for attention, even as Yair is rejecting it. &quot;Your words are 
			meaningless,&quot; he tells a school counselor. &quot;This conversation does 
			not exist and you don't exist.&quot; No surprise, he rejects her 
			suggestion that he needs psychological treatment. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The cause of the family's pain and 
			privation isn't novel, but it is resonant: nine months earlier, 
			their father died of an allergic reaction to a bee sting, suffered, 
			it so happens, while he was out for an afternoon with Maya. This 
			explains her special agony, her sense of guilt, her persistent 
			efforts to please her mother. It also explains, to an extent, 
			Dafna's unwillingness to comfort her daughter, and instead, to 
			expect perpetual repentance. The mother's attitude is less cruel 
			than it is a function of trauma; she's so wrapped up with surviving 
			her own long hours and paying rent for their tiny apartment that she 
			hardly notices Maya's pain; and when a doctor, Valentin (Vladimir 
			Friedman), shows her kindness, Dafna is unable to respond 
			coherently, angry one minute and devastated the next. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Broken Wings</i>' investigation 
			of profound emotional damage is, predictably, most poignant with 
			regard to the younger children. Increasingly fractious and confused 
			by their mother's (and sister and brother's) distance, little Bahr 
			has taken to locking herself in the bathroom to avoid going to 
			school, and Ido has picked up an odd hobby: after school, he takes 
			his video camera to an empty public swimming pool, where he tries to 
			tape himself falling. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While first time filmmaker Nir 
			Bergman solicits moving performances from his actors (see especially 
			Maron, who manages to be both delicate and steely at the same time), 
			the film leans heavily on visual symbolism to make its points. If 
			only Dafna could spend time with her own children instead of 
			birthing others; if only Maya could share her feelings with her 
			family, rather than pouring her heart into a song they won't hear; 
			if only Ido would stop throwing himself onto cold concrete. </font>
			</p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">These bits of metaphor accumulate, 
			of course, leading to a literal tragedy that pulls the family back 
			together. While the melodrama can be overbearing -- Maya's tears on 
			hearing her song played back to her, Yair's stoicism crumbling when 
			a friend threatens suicide, Dafna's eventual realization that she 
			has to be the adult -- <i>Broken Wings</i> is most effective when it 
			steps back from overt representation. Its interest in suffering and 
			loss emerges in an environment suffused with misfortune and misery. 
			Though the movie never directly references the Israeli-Palestinian 
			conflict, its implications are everywhere. As Maya, Dafna, and Yair 
			must learn to forgive one another, they are survivors -- of sudden 
			trauma and endless loss. </font></td>
