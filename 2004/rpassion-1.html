			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><br>
			<b>When Jesus (James Caviezel) first appears before Pontius Pilate (Hristo 
			Naumov Shopov) in <i>The Passion of the Christ</i>, they engage in a 
			bit of conversation concerning the nature of truth. Jesus has 
			already been slapped, punched, and chained by the High Priest 
			Caiphas (Mattia Sbragia) and his minions, as well as jeered by a 
			throng of Jewish citizens. But now the Roman procurator, who 
			famously sent thousands of Jews to crucifixion, is looking for a 
			reason to end the abuse, to let the Galilean go.&nbsp; </b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And so, he questions the prisoner, 
			out of the mob's earshot, as to why his &quot;own people have delivered&quot; 
			him up to be killed. &quot;Are you a king?&quot; asks Pontius. Answering in a 
			roundabout way, as Jesus tends to do, eventually admitting that he 
			has been born to &quot;give testimony to the truth&quot; (the dialogue is 
			spoken in Latin and Aramaic, subtitled in English, so some 
			additional interpretive filter is in place). Pilate, here 
			represented so that he is reflective as well as brutal and cruel, 
			wonders aloud, &quot;What is truth?&quot; Jesus provides him no solid answer, 
			and the film cuts outside. Pilate returns to the balcony with his 
			charge, announcing to the increasingly agitated assembly that he 
			finds &quot;no cause&quot; in the man for punishment. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The crowd wants blood, the 
			Pharisees want dominion, and Pilate, it appears, just wants to keep 
			his job. Feeling stuck between non-options (an uprising by the Jews 
			or an uprising by Jesus' followers, despite the fact that he 
			commands the local Roman military that might quash either), he sits 
			with his back literally against a wall. His wife Claudia Procula 
			(Claudia Gerini) approaches, and he asks what she thinks about 
			truth: can she recognize it when she hears it? Not unlike the Son of 
			Man, she answers her fretful husband in allusive circles: &quot;If you 
			will not hear the truth,&quot; she says, &quot;no one can tell you.&quot; </font>
			</p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This problem of truth -- how it 
			might be defined, known, or told -- underlies most all of Mel 
			Gibson's film. Tracing Jesus' last 12 hours on earth, <i>The Passion 
			of the Christ</i> raises multiple questions regarding truth, faith, 
			and history, their intersections and distinctions. How can one gauge 
			the truth of the gospels (Gibson based his screenplay on Matthew, 
			Mark, Luke and John, and -- reportedly -- on writings by the nuns 
			Mary of Agreda and Anne Catherine Emmerich)? How does desire or 
			circumstance affect memory, legend, and religious belief? And how 
			can anyone process imagery so suffused with violence and suffering?
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The violence takes various forms -- 
			flagellation, scourging, crucifixion -- all horrific and bloody, 
			wrenching, masochistic and sadistic. While it surely has a place 
			within the trajectory of Gibson's career choices (the <i>Mad Max</i>es, 
			the <i>Lethal Weapons</i>, <i>Braveheart</i>), it also achieves a 
			kind of awful poetry, partly through cinematographer Caleb 
			Deschanel's stunning evocations (inspired by Caravaggio and 
			Michelangelo, among others) and partly through the many moments of 
			overwrought slow motion, allowing careful inspection of details -- 
			fluids oozing, skin ripping and swelling, limbs giving way, tears 
			falling. Such horrors make up the bulk of the film's 126 minutes. 
			The plot is pain. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While this kind of literalization 
			is hardly unusual in Christian iconography, here it also serves 
			particular purposes. Some seem obvious, if highly contested: 
			evangelical sorts are calling the film a teaching and converting 
			&quot;tool,&quot; to be used for years to come, other viewers worry that it 
			will lead to less sanguine offscreen effects, igniting anger and 
			prejudice, a longing for vengeance against those deemed 
			&quot;responsible&quot; for such relentless, monstrous cruelty. It's not even 
			that the violence is intolerable or unfamiliar -- more vicious, more 
			visceral, and faster paced violence appears on movie screens 
			regularly -- but the effect in this instance is strangely mixed, at 
			once intense and underwhelming. Intense because it is inexorable and 
			underwhelming because it is so literal and solicitous, inviting you 
			to look on its surface, to appreciate its art and orthodoxy.&nbsp; </font>
			</p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The movie provides its own internal 
			audiences, in the horrible crowd that is more and more moblike 
			(their faces are ugly, when revealed for any few seconds) as it 
			calls for crucifixion, and the Roman soldiers are unspeakably mean, 
			laughing while they whip -- there seems enough mindless malice to go 
			around. The sympathetic viewers, however, are almost harder to 
			watch, as Mary (Maia Morgenstern) and Mary Magdalene (Monica 
			Bellucci) repeatedly collapse against one another, trembling, their 
			eyes beseeching, unbelieving but compelled to believe. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Among the most effective moments is 
			one that has Mary leave the others, wander down a walkway and stand 
			in the foreground, her head turned away from the spectacle of her 
			son's scourging by the loutish Roman soldiers (their commander has 
			to stop them, they are so overtaken by their sadistic lusting). As 
			the beating becomes a pale blur behind her, Mary's face becomes the 
			narrative, more compelling and more resourceful an image than the 
			ongoing assault.&nbsp; </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At issue here is the way that 
			violence makes its own kind of truth, even as representations of 
			violence reframe presumptions of truth. Jesus' bloodied body 
			incarnates a reality, but its metaphor resonates more deeply, beyond 
			the presumption that only Christians who know their Bible will truly 
			appreciate what they're seeing. Mary and Mary Magdalene's reactions 
			are something else -- they allow observation and empathy, sorrow and 
			anguish. The film can't quite accommodate their metaphor, however, 
			their sacrifice remains &quot;other&quot; than the obvious, literal, embodied 
			loss of life. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Questions as to what comprises 
			&quot;truth&quot; (complicated by questions of culpability, perspective, and 
			intention) have accompanied the lengthy run-up to <i>The Passion of 
			the Christ</i>'s Ash Wednesday release, igniting cable-news 
			controversy and invaluable (and seemingly endless) press coverage. 
			For nearly a year, stories have circulated that the movie is 
			anti-Semitic or will instigate anti-Semitism like olden-days passion 
			plays, that it reflects Gibson's Traditionalist Catholicism (even 
			his father Hutton's Holocaust-denying bent), that it will &quot;upset&quot; 
			Jewish viewers. When, last January, Bill O'Reilly asked Gibson to 
			address this last question, the filmmaker said, &quot;It may. It's not 
			meant to. I think it's meant to just tell the truth.&quot; Even the leak 
			that the Pope saw and liked Gibson's movie is premised on this idea 
			that it tells a truth: &quot;It is as it was.&quot; </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But whose truth is it? The movie 
			appears, for the most part, to adopt Jesus' point of view, by 
			definition reimagined by storytellers and interpreters over 
			thousands of years, including Gibson, whether or not the &quot;Spirit&quot; is 
			working through him, as he claimed. It opens in the Garden of 
			Gethsemane, where he is first tempted by Satan (Rosalinda Celentano), 
			then arrested and dragged off to Jerusalem for his mock trial and 
			torture by Roman soldiers. Occasional flashbacks attributed to Jesus 
			show him with disciples (in particular John of Zebedee [Hristo 
			Jivkov], Peter [Francesco De Vito], and Judas Iscariot [Luca 
			Lionello]) and Mary, in which he asserts his love for them, as well 
			as knowledge of his fate. (Just how free will and God's plan fit 
			together is another question.) </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Other flashbacks take the 
			perspectives of Mary and Mary Magdalene, suggesting that they share 
			the same sorts of memories, involving revelation, inspiration, and 
			dread. None appears to have imagined the full extent of the 
			crucifixion's awfulness, and this is one of Gibson's stated goals, 
			to make clear the agony Jesus (must have) endured, to give viewers 
			an &quot;experience&quot; that approximates the Passion, a pain they will 
			remember and believe (in). Amid the devotion to this cause, that <i>
			The Passion of the Christ</i> uses such familiar means to this end 
			-- slow motion, reaction shots, huge score, lingering images of 
			viciousness and distress -- suggests a strange dearth of 
			imagination, as if distrusting that viewers might see metaphor as a 
			means to truth. </font></p>
