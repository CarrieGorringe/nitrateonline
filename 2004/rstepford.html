            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 11 June 2004</i></font><p>
			<font face="Verdana" size="5">Implants </font></p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Uptight workaholic and TV 
			network powerhouse Joanna Eberhart (Nicole Kidman) &quot;barely knows&quot; 
			her two kids and has left her husband Walter (Matthew Broderick) 
			feeling impotent. That's not to say she's a ball-buster exactly, but 
			she does have her priorities skewed. She has a styling, sharp-edged 
			haircut and the niftiest of black suits, but she has no life that 
			she can identify. </font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Her paucity of spirit is odiously 
			illustrated during the first five minutes of <i>The Stepford Wives</i>, 
			when, before an audience of like-coiffed TV execs, she offers up her 
			latest reality program, <i>I Can Do Better</i>. The pilot has wussy 
			Omaha husband Hank (Mike White) learning his wife prefers a bevy of 
			XXX-actors to him. (She can do better.) He shows up at the 
			presentation with a gun that he's recently used on his wife. (Just 
			how he gets in the door with it is unclear -- shoddy security at 
			this corporate HQ.) Joanna is duly punished for setting up the 
			network for lawsuits out the wazoo: she's fired (&quot;We have 
			shareholders,&quot; moans her boss, suddenly a moral ground, or at least 
			a monetary one). </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Worse, Walter moves Joanna and 
			their nondescript kids to Stepford, Connecticut, where the community 
			is gated, the driveways are long, and the vast lawns are manicured. 
			Understandably groggy following her electro-shock therapy 
			(apparently, this explains how Walter entices her to these upscale 
			boonies in the first place), Joanna doesn't quite notice how scary 
			the place really is. Even after being greeted at their gargantuan 
			front door by demonic-seeming flower-basket-pocketbook-holding local 
			snoot Claire (Glenn Close), Joanna goes along the next morning to 
			&quot;workout&quot; class, where she leans wanly against the wall as the 
			Stepford wifeys wear pastel sundresses, wave their arms to 
			approximate exercise, and smile way too brightly.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Though it's instantly clear that 
			the wives aren't precisely thinking for themselves, Joanna is 
			shocked, shocked (!) to see one of them sputter out of control at 
			the hoedown, where Claire and her foofy crew slap their knees and 
			whoop with glee when the square-dancing starts. The fun comes 
			crashing to a brief halt when one of the gals, Sarah (Faith Hill, 
			with little to do here except look strained and thin), sputters into 
			a robotic meltdown, spinning in circles and yelping, &quot;Do-si-do! Do-si-do!&quot; 
			and spewing literal sparks. This little performance does get 
			Joanna's attention, but when Walter calls her out one night for 
			being a bad (self-absorbed, career-minded, and castrating) partner, 
			she wakes up the next morning raring to wear pink and bake a kitchen 
			full of cupcakes. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Because she is so utterly and 
			annoyingly guilt-trippable, Joanna hardly seems in need of 
			Stepfordization by the Men's Association. And yet, there they are, 
			snarkling over the upcoming procedure, indoctrinating Walter, 
			hanging out at what is reportedly the same mansion used in the first 
			and far superior version of this movie. Headed by Mr. Claire, that 
			is, Mike (Christopher Walken), the Association is comprised of 
			&quot;drooling nerds&quot; who smoke cigars, drink booze, and play with 
			remote-controlled cars. Aside from being called &quot;King&quot; while having 
			sex with bosomy wives in lavender negligees, such tedious activities 
			appear to be the extent of their life ambitions. Welcome to the 21st 
			century, guys. And oh yes, grow up. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In other words, Ira Levin's campy 
			concept, already dated in 1975, now looks positively Neanderthal. 
			And ostensible efforts at updating only muck up the works more 
			profoundly. As if dealing with Walter's tedious retardation is not 
			enough, Joanna must also confront the stereotypical spectacle of her 
			as-yet-unturned neighbors, ornery-Jewish-feminist-author Bobbi 
			(Bette Midler), married to slovenly Dave (Jon Lovitz) and fabulous, 
			highlighty-haired gay man Roger (Roger Bart), married to stodgy gay 
			Republican Jerry (David Marshall Grant). The logic here is baffling 
			-- Dave or Jerry don't begin to fit in with the rest of the twitty 
			husbands. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Though an overtly gay <i>Stepford 
			Wives</i> is certainly conceivable (as the original film is all 
			about dragging feminine stereotypes), Frank Oz's evidently rewritten 
			and recut incarnation (script attributed to Paul Rudnick) doesn't 
			have the necessary teeth. That's not to say that Joanna's catty 
			quotient isn't much improved when she's around Bobbi and Roger, but 
			alas, she's prone to losing track of her skeptical and self-knowing 
			trajectory. Slipping in and out of resistance and submission modes, 
			Joanna becomes increasingly incoherent, as does the film (which 
			looks hacked together with a chainsaw, especially when the final 
			coda comes up, undoing Katherine Ross' nasty legacy with a seeming 
			happy ending that might best be described as witless). </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The remade Roger wears a suit and 
			stands at a flag-draped podium, where he announces, &quot;I believe in 
			Stepford, America, and the power of prayer.&quot; Bobbi 2 is blond and 
			wasp-waisted, determined to ensure her chubby sons have every food 
			item their hearts desire. Perhaps most unbelievable of all, Joanna's 
			internet research leads her directly to a correct conclusion. </font>
			</p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Or... wait. The movie can't even 
			come to its own conclusion about what the procedure involves. For a 
			minute, it appears that, as before, it's the result of a wife's 
			murder and replacement with a robot. But maybe it's drugs. Or maybe 
			it's brainwashing. Or maybe it's microchips implanted in the brain. 
			But this logic (absurd as it is) is undermined at film's end with a 
			&quot;twist&quot; that looks awfully like blaming the victim. This muddle 
			seems a likely result of the rumored disagreements on the set and 
			last-minute reshoots. The parody is stale, the jokes unfunny, and 
			Glenn Close tries too darn hard. </font></td>
