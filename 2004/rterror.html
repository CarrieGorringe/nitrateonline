            Avery</a>, 2 January 2004</i></font><p><b>
			<font face="Verdana" size="2">The subjects of the recent documentary
			<i>Cinemania</i> -- a handful of New Yorkers who have devoted their 
			lives to seeing two, or more, movies every day -- are vetted with 
			the inevitable question at one point as to whether they dream of 
			movies. Rainer Werner Fassbinder said that the reason he made so 
			many movies was so that, making one right after the other, it would 
			begin to feel like he was making, or in, one continuous movie, that 
			his life would become a movie. The filmgoers in <i>Cinemania</i> 
			respond that, yes, they did dream of movies, sometimes in 
			black-and-white, usually in the standard screen ratio used before 
			the advent of Cinemascope and widescreen formats (dreaming in 
			Cinemascope and color seems anathema to them). One of my own 
			recurring dreams, not in the form of a movie, is of traversing 
			through what is supposed to be a great multiplex, past many 
			entrances, until, finally finding one, entering an auditorium only 
			to find that the seating is arranged in such a way as to make it 
			impossible to get a good view of the screen or to have an enjoyable 
			experience (note the element of peril and foreboding in this 
			account). Personal dreams don't always come to mind while watching a 
			film, but they did while looking at <i>Experiments in Terror</i>, a 
			collection of short films most of which unfold in their own sort of 
			dreamtime or dream-like circumstances -- a woman displaced in 
			reality, a troubled young girl in a mysterious house, creatures 
			rocketing from Earth to Alpha Centauri and back again. The Hollywood 
			&quot;dream factory&quot; is represented as well -- William Castle, who made 
			going to the movies to become mutually scared in the dark not only 
			fun but a wholesome, all-American activity; the magnificent William 
			Marshall, fanged and unstoppable; and those two inimitable screen 
			ladies, Allison Hayes and Martine Beswick. <i>Experiments in Terror</i> 
			-- which was presented in special theatrical engagements earlier 
			this year, and has just now made its debut on DVD -- also serves as 
			a pleasant reminder that, at a time when movies are getting more and 
			more timid (with big-screen versions of <i>Starsky and Hutch</i> and
			<i>Thunderbirds</i>, with human actors playing the Tracys clan, 
			coming our way in 2004, whether we like it or not), that people are 
			still stretching the boundaries and doing some genuinely interesting 
			things with film.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">One of the biggest surprises in the 
			collection is <i>The Virgin Sacrifice</i> a short 1974 film by the 
			director J.X. Williams, whose career is about to get a big boost 
			through the re-release of his 1965 feature <i>Peep Show</i>, which 
			outlines a conspiracy theory of Laocoönian proportions. Starting out 
			with all the banality of a porno loop before the action really gets 
			started, <i>Virgin Sacrifice</i> somersaults into a grand-scale, 
			bona-fide late-Sixties, early-Seventies freak-out, at times both 
			spacey and ravishingly beautiful.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Lloyd M. Williams' <i>Ursula</i>, 
			filmed in 1961, uses faded, watercolor hues reminiscent of early 
			Technicolor to tell the story of a young girl and a patrician woman 
			whose attempts to teach the girl right and wrong have gone seriously 
			awry. Of the more recently-made films, Kerry Laitala's <i>Journey 
			Into the Unknown</i> uses the magnificent Paramount Theater, in 
			Oakland, California, as the entrance to a rabbit hole that sends us 
			down into an alternate universe, one that's part film-noir, part 
			Academy Leader variations, all with splashes of lysergic color. 
			David Sherman's <i>Tuning the Sleeping Machine</i> also goes all out 
			for the abstract and atmospheric, with spectral glimpses of <i>Faust</i>, 
			John Barrymore as Svengali, and Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee in
			<i>The Curse of Frankenstein</i> showing up like glimmers over 
			burning flames. All the way over on the other side of the spectrum 
			is <i>Dawn of an Evil Millennium</i>, which Damon Packard made on 
			super-8 film stock and which shows gushing (literally) demonic 
			creatures swaggering and then blasting themselves, turbo-charged, 
			across time, space, and <i>over</i> space and distance, while the 
			soundtrack teases you with sound effects and half-comprehensible 
			bits of dialogue to try and get a handle on what's going on (this is 
			not meant as derogatory -- you can just sit back and enjoy the play 
			of images in the film).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hollywood arises through some 
			vintage trailers, and there to be found is William Marshall, 
			magisterial in <i>Blacula</i> -- he had stature in the film because 
			he was always more interesting than the characters who were supposed 
			to be the nominal protagonists (and it was surely meant that way). 
			Allison Hayes, fifty feet tall and looking for her worthless, 
			philandering husband (and boy is she mad!). And does anybody 
			remember why Ralph Bates' Dr. Jekyll turned into Martine Beswick's 
			Sister Hyde after he drank the potion? (Considering that it's 
			Martine Beswick, though, WHO CARES???) The most interesting 
			inclusion is newsreel footage made of the producer William Castle 
			interviewing people going in and out of his new picture <i>Homicidal</i>.
			<i>Homicidal</i> attracted some notoriety when &quot;Time&quot; magazine said 
			that it was not only better than the movie it was trying to imitate,
			<i>Psycho</i>, but also included it in the magazine's list of the 
			ten best films of 1961. (This gives you some idea of how wigged-out 
			some people were over Hitchcock's movie when it was first released.) 
			Castle had theaters set up a &quot;Coward's Corner&quot; where patrons could 
			get their money back if the picture proved too frightening (and, in 
			fact, the film does have one genuinely hair-raising moment); 
			Castle's interviews also including asking several people if they 
			would reveal the surprise ending to <i>Homicidal</i> or not (they 
			say &quot;no&quot; -- one character is revealed to actually be another one, 
			but the only way the movie would've worked was if it was the other 
			way around).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The short film that opens <i>
			Experiments in Terror</i> is Peter Tscherkassky's <i>Outer Space</i>, 
			and it's brilliant. The film, made in widescreen and 
			black-and-white, literally flickers to life in the middle of the 
			screen, gradually assembling the main elements: a woman, night, a 
			house, her walking through the front door and into the house. Sound 
			of music, the voice of her teenage son. The image becomes unstable 
			-- super-imposures, reverse negative, sprocket holes and the film's 
			audio track snake across the frame, stretches of image degradation 
			such as burns or decomposure, the magnetic hum of the soundtrack 
			going on and off, then on, again -- as if the film we were watching 
			was experiencing difficulty as it is being shown to us, or had come 
			back from the processing lab really, really bad. Then, things crash 
			in -- a cascade, avalanche, assault. What we see, the setting, the 
			character of the woman, flickers in and out, and long moments when 
			the screen goes blank, as if attempting to obliterate the setting 
			and person we were seeing on the screen. The menace comes from 
			without, but it's not a monster or a psychopath or some commonplace 
			anomaly -- the film itself becomes the intruder, the menace, the 
			element that seeks to do harm, and the character of the woman fights 
			back, even as the attempt is made to displace her, to displace the 
			way and means in which she exists, the filmic image that we are 
			watching from our remove as an audience. The kicker comes at the 
			end, when, as what we are watching quiets down, we hear voices on 
			the soundtrack after the assault of errant sight and noise: she can 
			be heard saying, &quot;The first time, it was...&quot; Then the authoritative 
			voice of a man, as that of a police detective, asking, &quot;This wasn't 
			the first time?&quot; Breathtaking.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The closing film.... The American 
			Dental Association made a big push in the 60s and 70s to promote 
			better dental care, including making short films for distribution to 
			schools or as P.S.A.'s on television, and the distribution of little 
			red dye tablets that, when dissolved, showed where plaque was or was 
			not being cleaned from your teeth. Anyway, someone came up with the 
			insane idea of doing a short dental care film in the form of a 
			haunted house movie, and that's all I'm going to reveal about it, 
			here -- sometimes, the audience has to have the benefit of 
			discovering some things, and some priceless gems, themselves.</font></td>
