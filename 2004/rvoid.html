            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>, 23 January 2004</i></font><p class="MsoNormal">
			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">So, maybe you read the 1988 
			international bestseller <i>Touching the Void</i> by Joe Simpson, 
			the heart-rending true-life tale of the near death experience he and 
			fellow mountain climber Simon Yates experienced atop the 
			21,000-foot, extremely isolated Siula Grande peak in the Peruvian 
			Andres. And maybe a few of you remember reading that Sally Fields' 
			Disney-based production company Fogwood Films and Castle Rock's Alan 
			Greisman optioned the book back in 1997 as a possible Tom Cruise 
			vehicle (with a believable British accent?), where after the project 
			went into turnaround (i.e., Hollywood limbo-land, where it should 
			stay) as of September 2000. And even fewer of you have actually 
			climbed a mountain. <i>Touching the Void</i> will make you think 
			hard about taking a big walk up the wild side of any stack of rock 
			as daunting as that shown here.</font></b></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But, damn, until 
			you witness the bone-crushing, blue-lipped, ice-encrusted treatment 
			within which Academy Award-winning director Kevin Macdonald (<i>One 
			Day in September</i>) has framed this fiercely entertaining dramatic 
			documentary, you have no idea how exciting and emotionally draining 
			the resulting cinematic climb up and particularly down can possibly 
			be. You will envision their terror, again, that engulfed both 
			Simpson and Yates, maybe not as the nominally interviewed talking 
			heads explaining their action (kept to a educational minimum), but 
			rather as they are seamlessly re-enacted by Brendan Mackay (Simpson) 
			and Nicholas Aaron (Yates). Macdonald tensely reconstructs the 
			incredible 1985 climb up and agonizing descent with an 
			edge-of-your-seat urgency that makes you root for their lives and 
			enduring spirit as if your own existence depended on it. Your 
			fingernails will be bitten down to their cuticles--by the person 
			sitting next to you. If you've seen hundreds of E! Entertainment 
			simulated retellings via this Mysteries &amp; Scandals or that True 
			Hollywood Story, you may think you know what <i>Touching the Void</i> 
			might be like as a viewing experience. But you can add up all the 
			impact those shows may have had on your coach potato life and it 
			will pale in comparison to the 106 minutes you spend frozen to your 
			seat watching this engrossing struggle of two human beings over the 
			crushing forces of nature that bear down on them.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So, the two 
			Brits, having ascended a three-and-a-half day climb up the west face 
			of the Siula Grande, with unseen <i>cinéma verité </i>cameramen 
			trekking right beside them, find their climb down a worst case 
			episode of mission impossible, as Simpson misses a step and his 
			lower leg is driven into his kneecap. Unable to walk, crippled in 
			pain, and the weather outside far from delightful--its night time, 
			blistery cold, and you can't see the nose in front of your face--the 
			trip home won't be a walk in the park. There's also no food or 
			water, and dehydration is settling in. Simpson's leg, and 
			confidence, is shattered. When the climbers (and the audience) 
			should be home in a warm bed or cuddled up near a warm fire, instead 
			we're all shivering together, much to the credit of Mike Eley, as 
			director of photography, and Keith Partridge and Simon Wagen for 
			their &quot;climbing photography.&quot; And then, as they say, is when the 
			agonizing story really begins.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Combining their 
			separate segments of rope, Yates begins lowering his companion 
			downward in the darkness, 300 feet at a time. The seemingly steady 
			progress is broken when Simpson basically falls of the mountain, 
			dangling in the freezing air and unable to signal his friend. 
			Presuming the worst (it's hard not to under these harsh 
			circumstances), the rope is cut and each climber is left to his own 
			inner strength to remove himself off the frozen landscape and out of 
			their hellish nightmare: Yates on the snowcapped exterior, Simpson 
			from within the mountain's icebound caverns. I doubt that anyone 
			watching the film with me took a breath during these tense, 
			gut-wrenching moments when both men brush up against their own 
			mortality.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Using the actual 
			mountain (briefly, when weather conditions allowed), but generally 
			filming in the Alps, the expedition still proves treacherous to any 
			climber, especially one followed by a film crew that has to deal 
			with its own fiascos, such as frozen cameras, fogged lenses, and 
			just general safety issues when your shooting a film at twenty below 
			zero. To those hardy individuals and rugged individualists (you have 
			to admire them for their sheer lunacy who explore (and film) the 
			tops of the world at threat to their life and limb, <i>Touching the 
			Void</i> is the quintessential document to these dedicated sportsmen 
			and, in the case of those that have now climbed to that highest 
			mountain in the sky, a fitting memorial.</font></p>
