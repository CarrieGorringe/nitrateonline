            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 6 February 2004</i></font><p>
			<font face="Verdana" size="5">Hot Voodoo </font></p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">During the first moments of <i>
			The Dreamers</i>, American student Matthew (Michael Pitt) finds love 
			at the Cinémathèque Française. The camera pans over the audience, 
			light from the screen spilling over their upturned faces. And what 
			is movie that so enthralls them? Sam Fuller's <i>Shock Corridor</i>, 
			a film that not only inspired the Nouvelle Vague, but also 
			brilliantly challenged U.S. political institutions and moral 
			presumptions. </font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">However, following this first 
			scene, <i>Shock Corridor</i> is disappeared from <i>The Dreamers</i>, 
			its famous excesses -- its indictments of U.S. racism and sexism, 
			the war against North Korea, the newspaper business, and psychiatry 
			-- lost in a shuffle of other excesses (which have led to the film's 
			NC-17 rating). And while these will not be surprising for viewers 
			who know something about Bernardo Bertolucci, neither will they 
			challenge anything resembling the status quo. The latest movie from 
			the director of <i>Last Tango in Paris</i> is all about reaffirming 
			wistful memories of a place and time -- Paris, May 1968 -- when 
			revolution seemed possible and worthy, even if the crass 
			commercialists and cynics have long since won out. The frustration 
			of <i>The Dreamers</i> lies in its easy lapsing into such 
			unimaginative nostalgia, as if recalling the moment is enough: no 
			questions need be asked, of participants, observers, or chroniclers.
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Matthew's personal revolution tends 
			to obscure the student demonstrations of 1968, because, the film 
			suggests, he's a kid -- sensitive, smart, cinephilically inclined -- 
			who's distracted by immediate gratifications. (This following the 
			minute when he's drawn to the student protests and speeches by film 
			professors and Cinémathèque curator Henri Langlois, as well as the 
			exhortations of Jean-Pierre Léaud himself, only, of course, 
			considerably older than he was back then.) Matthew's more 
			captivating objects of affection arrive in the form of twins Théo 
			(Louis Garrel) and Isabelle (Eva Green). These crass French kids see 
			the foreigner as an object for their own game-playing, and so they 
			gambol on Parisian streets, accompanied by the soundtrack to <i>The 
			400 Blows</i>, in love with the spring weather, the future 
			stretching before them, each other, and themselves. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The idea -- or better, the image -- 
			of the twins surely resonates with the sort of self-involvement that
			<i>The Dreamers</i> proceeds to investigate, but these kids are so 
			languid and lovely, so immersed in each other as reflected images, 
			that they also pose a risk and seduction for the naïve and intense 
			American. And so, they invite him inside. First, he enters their 
			home, specifically, the classically lovely apartement where they 
			live with their bored-seeming, sophisticated mother (Anna 
			Chancellor) and poet dad (Robin Renucci). At first Matthew is 
			enchanted by the dinner table &quot;philosophical speculating,&quot; Isabelle 
			and Théo smoking ceaselessly, he in black turtleneck, but of course. 
			Matthew even imagines himself quick enough to step in, regarding the 
			ways that all lines intersect and all things connect -- Matthew is 
			surprised to learn that the performance he thought was solidly smart 
			and entertaining has only bored Isabelle and Théo. His perspective 
			apparently needs some adjustment, and he's all too willing to shift 
			-- or go through the motions of shifting -- in order to impress his 
			new friends. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When the parents leave for a 
			month's vacation, the kids hole up together, immersing themselves in 
			dense discussions of the relative merits of Hendrix and Clapton, or 
			Keaton and Chaplin. By way of increasingly heavy-handed 
			illustration, the film repeatedly reveals the sources of their 
			potentially clever allusions, as well as having the kids name the 
			films in question. Thus, Isabelle brings up Jean Seberg in <i>
			Breathless</i>, and the film shows that; she performs a scene from
			<i>Blonde Venus</i> and the film shows that (the memorable Dietrich 
			in a gorilla suit scene). Rarely does <i>The Dreamers</i> trust its 
			audience to grasp a reference -- all are spelled out, such that any 
			deeper context -- what movies meant in the '60s, for the Cahiers du 
			Cinema and others, how movies intersected with sexual or political 
			revolutions -- is laid out like a roadmap, ironically leaving little 
			room for viewers' own &quot;dreaming.&quot;</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As a surrogate viewer, Matthew 
			provides simultaneous judgment of and seduction by the twins, whose 
			&quot;corruption&quot; is suggested in their incestuous intimacy (they never 
			quite sleep together on screen, though Matthew's erect penis is 
			shown, as he serves as mediating lover for the siblings). Once he 
			proves himself able to keep up -- literally, during a run through 
			the Louvre emulating the one enacted by the three youngsters in 
			Godard's <i>Bande à Part</i> -- Matthew finds himself accepted. This 
			moment is underlined by cuts to Tod Browning's <i>Freaks</i>, as 
			Isabelle and Théo chant, &quot;One of us, one of us.&quot; Got it. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This thematic interest in the ways 
			that movies reflect and also shape lived experience is exacerbated 
			by the kids' sexual experimenting. The camera lingers on their 
			exquisite, lithe bodies - bodies that plainly haven't spent much 
			time outside the privileged existence the film depicts -- in ways 
			that are not so much shocking as they are deferential and, after a 
			while, redundant. Matthew unknowingly deflowers Isabelle (girls 
			losing various forms of virginity being a favorite topic of 
			Bertolucci's), the boys gaze longingly and also competitively on one 
			another, and Isabelle begins to unravel. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This last may be this unoriginal 
			film's least interesting lift: the crazed young girl, driven over a 
			series of edges by cruel young men (Théo is obviously selfish and 
			angry, Matthew is only self-absorbed enough not to look out for her 
			very carefully). Isabelle's increasingly self-destructive tragedy 
			doesn't reveal anything you haven't seen or thought of before, 
			especially if you have even a passing familiarity with the array of 
			films cited by <i>The Dreamers</i>. </font></td>
