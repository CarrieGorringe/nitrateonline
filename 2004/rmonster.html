            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../kj.html" target="_top">KJ Doughton</a>, 23 January 2004</i></font><p>
			<b><font face="Verdana"><font size="2">Patty Jenkins’ </font><i>
			<font size="2">Monster</font></i><font size="2"> shines its 
			headlights onto the gruesome wreckage that piles up when romantic, 
			youthful ideals are shattered by desperation and despair. Before 
			leaving a trail of seven bodies in her wake, real-life Florida 
			man-killer Aileen Wuornos ached to be discovered by Hollywood. “I 
			always wanted to be in the movies,” she confesses as a slide-show of 
			her baby pictures flickers across the screen to introduce the film. 
			“Who would discover me?”</font></font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s ironic that this grungy, 
			bloated poster child for failure, nourished only by immature dreams 
			of fame, is portrayed in <i>Monster</i> by Charlize Theron, the very
			<i>real </i>embodiment of all that Wuornos hoped to be. In films 
			including <i>Cider House Rules</i> and <i>The Devil’s Advocate</i>, 
			the genetic perfection of Theron’s delicate cheekbones and striking, 
			sultry eyes is distracting. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">No doubt aware of this, the actress 
			uses <i>Monster</i> as an antidote to her own attractiveness. This 
			time, the woman onscreen is a meaty aggressor, looking grizzled and 
			leonine in her bulging forehead, thinning hair, and arrowhead teeth. 
			The whole package comes wrapped in tattered jeans, a black biker’s 
			tank top, and a pack of Marlboros. It’s the gnarliest, most 
			convincing reverse-makeover since Robert DeNiro’s cellulite-enhanced 
			turn as Jake La Motta in <i>Raging Bull</i>. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To Theron’s credit, the 
			transformation is much more than prosthetics and makeup. The lead 
			character in <i>Monster</i> walks with a defensive, hip-swaying 
			swagger. She treats sex like as a businesslike habit, as impersonal 
			as brushing one’s teeth (“I’ll blow you if you want,” she 
			nonchalantly offers a landlord after failing to get the rent in on 
			time). Her unstable affect jumps from bubbly dreamer to loose cannon 
			in three seconds. There’s a real performance here. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like so many star-struck young 
			women drawn like moths to the flames of celebrity wealth and fame, 
			Wuornos’ wings were scorched by a series of violations. Raped by a 
			family friend at age eight, the golden-haired child was then beaten 
			by her father after reporting the offense. Such abuse led young 
			Wuornos to prostitution by age thirteen. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana"><i><font size="2">Monster</font></i><font size="2"> 
			begins several years later, as Wuornos sits beneath a freeway 
			overpass with gun in hand. She’s considering suicide, but not before 
			one last beer. After entering a gay bar, the rain-soaked hooker 
			spots an impish young lesbian named Selby (Christina Ricci), and her 
			life is changed forever.</font></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Selby is the physical antithesis of 
			Wuornos. Her hair is goth-black, her manner giddy and flirtatious. 
			An injured arm is covered in plaster. But both women are immature 
			dreamers, yearning to be rescued from their unhappy lots in life. 
			Living with fundamentalist family friends that try to “cure” her 
			lesbian leanings, Selby searches for empathy. Long since warped into 
			damaged goods by a lifetime of low expectations and systematic 
			degradations, Wuornos’ quest is for any shred of acceptance or love 
			she can dredge up. Shaping their respective shards of hope into a 
			defensive shield against the outside world, Selby and Wuornos become 
			lovers.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana"><i><font size="2">Monster</font></i><font size="2"> 
			is no fairy tale, however, and there are no “happily ever afters” 
			for this volatile duo. To pay the bills on a string of ramshackle 
			hotel rooms they inhabit, Wuornos returns to what she knows best, 
			picking up johns from nearby freeways. One customer, an oily, 
			flask-carrying hayseed, shackles his date and beats her nearly to 
			death. It’s a sickening spectacle, and when Aileen reaches for a gun 
			and blows the attacker away, we can empathize completely. Like a 
			howling coyote or some possessed banshee, the avenging assailant 
			celebrates her kill with a triumphant scream. It’s chilling.</font></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Fueled by her contempt for such 
			vicious johns while astonished at how easily it is to take a life, 
			Theron’s unemployable, unlikable, uneducated subject begins killing 
			her customers and lifting their wallets. It’s a quick fix for fast 
			cash, allowing she and Selby to survive. After all, how valuable is 
			human life, really? “People kill each other every day,” Aileen 
			reasons. “For politics. For religion. For all kinds of reasons.”</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Predictably, such serial slaughter 
			comes crashing to an end, as this angry, imbalanced shooter goes to 
			trial for her misdeeds. After spending over a decade of infamy 
			festering on Death Row, Wuornos was executed by the State of Florida 
			in 2002. Dubbed “America’s First Female Serial Killer,” Wuornos also 
			became the subject of two disturbing documentaries directed by Nick 
			Broomfield. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In Broomfield’s films, it was hard 
			to identify with his subject, a dim opportunist who brazenly 
			flaunted her behind-bars fame. With <i>Monster</i>, however, it’s a 
			different story. Has another film ever conveyed the urgent 
			desperation of a mind on the brink of ruin with such authenticity? 
			We watch Theron’s prostitute wander through employment agencies, 
			being asked, “Do you have any experience,” and coldly denied a shot 
			at “straight” income. Then again, when this volatile personality 
			throws her resume in a prospective employer’s face, cursing like a 
			particularly profane sailor, our sympathy is challenged. It’s a 
			tribute to Theron’s range that we can understand Wuornos’ choices, 
			even as we wince at her poor judgment.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The new millenium has given us a 
			startling number of films dealing with the damaging cycle of human 
			violence. <i>Mystic River, In the Bedroom</i>, and <i>City of God</i> 
			are but three examinations of how murder and abuse result in waves 
			of dysfunction and suffering that spread like a disease, from 
			generation to generation. Does the world need another example of 
			this unpleasant truth? Perhaps not. But <i>Monster</i> creates an 
			even more gripping effect, by explaining a killer’s actions and 
			letting us vicariously crawl beneath her blotchy skin. For the 
			millions that pick up the newspaper each night and ask, “How could 
			someone do such a thing,” <i>Monster</i> provides some answers.</font></td>
