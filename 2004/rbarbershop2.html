			Back in Business<br>
            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 6 February 2004</i></font><p>
			<font face="Verdana" size="5">Put Your Back Into It</font></p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Barbershop 2: Back in 
			Business</i> begins with a little history. The camera descends 
			through an array of fireworks, lighting up the sky over a street 
			scene titled &quot;July 4, 1967, Southside Chicago.&quot; A drunken Uncle Sam 
			staggers in an alley, a jokey allusion to the national celebration, 
			but also an emblem of the national turmoil of the time, the dire 
			divides of class and race, the eruptive distrust between 
			generations. Just then, another figure stumbles through the scene -- 
			it's Eddie (Cedric the Entertainer), the charismatic, mush-mouthed 
			raconteur whose opinions regarding Rosa Parks ignited minor 
			controversy in 2002.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">On the run from a pair of cops, 
			young Eddie slams into the Uncle Sam (one more comic-political swipe 
			at the elderly emblem), then dashes into the first open door, Calvin 
			Sr.'s (Javon Johnson) barbershop. When the proprietor agrees to hide 
			him from his pursuers, Eddie later explains to Calvin Jr. (Ice Cube) 
			35 years later, he feels not only indebted to his new friend, but 
			also like he's found a &quot;home.&quot; </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">These first five minutes grant 
			Eddie and the barbershop some specific background, of resistance and 
			community. They also make <i>Barbershop 2</i> look like it will be 
			different from the 2002 original, which, save for Calvin's 
			occasional references to his father, is firmly situated in the 
			present, namely the son's personal struggle over whether to keep or 
			sell the shop he's inherited. But what follows is not very different 
			from what came before. Calvin will face another version of the same 
			dilemma, and he'll come to a similarly right decision. In between, 
			he'll trade japes with the same characters and hang out in the same 
			place: the barbershop. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Once again, the central issue is 
			real estate. Whereas the original had Calvin's personal finances in 
			turmoil, here the concerns are more widespread, in particular, the 
			gentrification of the neighborhood where his shop has been in 
			business for so many years. This year's crisis is initiated by the 
			incursion of a Nappy Cutz franchise across the street, courtesy of 
			the Porsche-driving developer Quentin Leroux (Harry Lennix). The new 
			joint has a fancy website advertising milk baths, shiny new 
			appliances, and a basketball hoop. What it doesn't have, of course, 
			is a sense of history, loyalty or community. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the moral and social economy 
			assumed by <i>Barbershop</i>, this lack makes Nappy Cutz the enemy; 
			even worse, it's part of a broader urban development program, 
			including the buyouts of other local vendors and the political and 
			financial advancement of the slick Alderman Brown (Robert Wisdom). 
			Standing opposed to the &quot;progress&quot; are solid citizen Calvin and his 
			bickering headcutters -- sassy Terri (Eve), pretty Ricky (Michael 
			Ealy), gentle &quot;African&quot; Dinka (Leonard Earl Howze), and the &quot;Eminem 
			of the barber world,&quot; Isaac (Troy Garity). Also back for another go 
			is straight-laced Jimmy (Sean Patrick Thomas), now working for 
			Alderman Brown, and increasingly squeamish about the deals getting 
			made. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As before, the film allots brief 
			moments to assorted interactions: Isaac and Ricky compete, Jimmy and 
			Terri argue, Calvin tries to control the chaos (he goes so far as to 
			prohibit profanity in the shop, for a minute, to create&nbsp; &quot;family&quot; 
			atmosphere). Skipping from moment to moment, the movie is attentive 
			to local detail (girls jumping rope, folks on the street), less 
			concerned with plot. Calvin drops into a series of mostly unrelated 
			situations during the day, visiting Miss Emma (Jackie Taylor), now 
			in danger of losing her daycare business; caring for his own baby; 
			and chatting with his infinitely patient wife.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And of course, the movie lingers in 
			the shop long enough to let Cedric riff on President Clinton, Mike 
			Tyson, and R. Kelly. That Eddie's story is fleshed out repeatedly 
			during the film's flashbacks -- he's in love with a beautiful woman 
			he meets on the subway, he's down with the Black Panthers (at least 
			until they talk about killing and dying to make a point), he's a 
			dismayed observer of the riots following Dr. King's assassination -- 
			such that his running commentary is grounded in experience that's 
			both nostalgic and evocative. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While these peeks into Eddie's past 
			grant him specificity, and situate his cynicism in some Forest 
			Gumpian experience (as if to say, &quot;He's been there, so he has the 
			right to speak&quot;), he meets his match in the present day, in Gina 
			(Queen Latifah), who appears briefly, to exchange insults at a 
			barbeque-to-support-the-barbershop. Here they perform for an 
			enthusiastic audience, Gina noting Eddie's resemblance to Shamu, and 
			Eddie noting another woman's resemblance to Chewbaca. It's an 
			old-school throwdown, rowdy, friendly, and good fun. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Indeed, such moments illustrate 
			both <i>Barbershop</i>s fundamental appeal, an appreciation of 
			ritual and exchange, a generosity of spirit. And oh yes, along with 
			all that comes the flipside ethos, for Latifah has signed on not 
			only for this moment, but also to pitch her own spin-off 
			franchise-to-be, the movie <i>Beauty Shop</i>, featuring Gina and 
			her own crew of chatty beauticians, in a shop next to Calvin's. Ah 
			well, it's the American Way.</font></td>
