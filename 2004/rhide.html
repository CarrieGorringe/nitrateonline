            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>, 27 March 2004</i></font><p class="MsoEnvelopeReturn">
			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The central character in this new 
			film from the makers of the Emmy-nominated <i>A Life Apart: Hasidism 
			in America</i> is Menachem Daum, who with 
			co-producer-director-writer Oren Rudavsky, has sculpted a touching 
			self-portrait of his family, one he believes is in need of some 
			spiritual healing. Following its world premiere at the New York 
			Jewish Film Festival in January, the film has a small pre-Passover 
			window opening at Washington's Avalon Theatre, where the local 
			community can learn about faith and tolerance after the holocaust, a 
			suitable subtitle descriptor. It is the middle film of a planned 
			trilogy dealing with the theme of &quot;Barriers and Boundaries&quot; in the 
			Jewish world.</font></b></p>
			<p class="MsoEnvelopeReturn"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The 
			filmmakers have actually crafted two films over the course of a 
			single 85-minute sitting. The first and shorter, which bookends the 
			other, concerns a father's strained relationship with his sons and 
			his attempt to reconcile what he believes to be their unworldly 
			views with his own brand of &quot;secular humanism.&quot; Daum, whose bearded, 
			teddy bear appearance reminds one of a subtler variation of Francis 
			Ford Coppola, has the camera follow him on a journey of discovery 
			that evolves into an inner film seeking resolution to a 
			half-century-old secret. One hidden in a barn under a pile of hay. 
			This portion of <i>Hiding and Seeking</i> dives straight into a 
			hidden ancestral history that Daum hopes will solve his family's 
			present day problems.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoEnvelopeReturn"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Daum's 
			sons, Tzvi Dovid and Akiva, are fulltime Talmudic scholars who have 
			made <i>aliya </i>to Israel from their native Brooklyn. They live to 
			study the Torah and Talmud, and remove all secular interests from 
			their lives. Their father's concern is based on an audiotape of one 
			of their sect's scholars, proclaiming vehement hostility toward all 
			non-Jews. He fears that his own father's belief &quot;not to trust the 
			gentiles&quot; has skipped a generation -- as if a recessive 
			&quot;isolationist&quot; gene might now be bearing fruit. Confronted with the 
			audio clip, the boys downplay their mentor's ideology as somewhat 
			removed from their own, but the troubled parent believes an 
			excursion into the family's historical roots will help softened 
			their views.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoEnvelopeReturn"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Daum, the 
			son of Holocaust survivors who landed in Schenectady, New York, in 
			1951 before moving with his parents to Borough Park, is married to 
			Rifka, who, from appearances, barely puts up with her husband's 
			filmmaking study and keeps her screen time to an unfortunate 
			minimum. Her aging, infirm father, Chaim Federman, was one of three 
			brothers secreted away by a gentile Polish family during World War 
			II and his story, ultimately, plays out as the most memorable. It is 
			the Daum (mother, father, and two sons, but not the many 
			grandchildren) family's trip to the back streets of Zdunska Wola and 
			the dirt roads of Dzialosyce, a small town near Krakow, that 
			dovetails the father's views so succinctly -- that a gentile world, 
			even one of promised (but ultimately not delivered) financial 
			riches, can save a Jewish soul or two or three during one of our 
			planet's darkest hours. Ultimately, a soul-filled restitution is 
			made, even of the treasure delivered is figuratively a non-tangible 
			asset.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoEnvelopeReturn"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The 
			film's drawbacks are few, but obvious. The female side of the 
			family, save Rifka, whose original appearance finds her in the 
			kitchen, seems relegated to second class status, glimpsed in still 
			photographs or 8mm home movies. Perhaps the ladies were busy with 
			other tasks, but their absence is regrettable. We never see the 
			sons' wives; their sister makes a brief appearance, I think. A 
			single granddaughter (one of 14 grandchildren) becomes the sole 
			connection of the future generation to its past as the film draws to 
			its emotional climax.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoEnvelopeReturn"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film, 
			shot on digital video, is also narrated by Daum, while Rudavsky 
			worked exclusively behind the camera as director of photography. 
			John Zorn's modest score perfectly supplements the music of the late 
			Shlomo Carlebach, a humanist who greatly influenced Daum. 
			Carlebach's treatise of hope and tolerance for all mankind is noted 
			briefly in a 1989 concert of him performing before a receptive, 
			vastly non-Jewish audience in Warsaw. I saw him once, back in the 
			1960s, at a summer camp, and the experience was magical.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoEnvelopeReturn"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If the 
			film is a humanist's vision (&quot;No one faith has all the answers,&quot; 
			Daum reminds us.), it is also is a genealogist's dream come true -- 
			of spiritual and historical discovery despite insurmountable odds. 
			There is a higher power at work here that allows snippets of memory 
			to blossom into a tearful reunion. Having traced my family roots for 
			nearly a decade (and I have more &quot;cousins&quot; on my wife's side than my 
			own), the ancient discoveries found in a forgotten cemetery (located 
			with the assistance of Kamila Klauzinka, a non-Jew who has been 
			helping people like the Daums find their ancestors) overgrown with 
			decades of decay and neglect, are worth the viewing alone. That 
			there are living remnants that are just around a dusty bend in the 
			road make <i>Hiding and Seeking</i> an even better study of both 
			personal discovery and religious intolerance. Perhaps after 
			watching, you'll agree that &quot;whoever saves one life, saves the 
			world.&quot;</font></td>
