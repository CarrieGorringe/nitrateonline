			</font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 30 January 2004</i></font><p>
			<font face="Verdana" size="5">Played out</font></p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Gosh Pacey, maybe I don't think 
			you can Dawson can pull it off.&quot; For a minute, Francesca (Scarlett 
			Johansson) lets slip an uncanny comprehension of context. The movie 
			she's in -- <i>The Perfect Score</i> -- recycles familiar high 
			school stories, from <i>Breakfast Club</i> to <i>Dawson's Creek</i>, 
			in particular the sort where a motley ensemble comes together under 
			duress. Here, Francesca is responding to fellow seniors Kyle (Chris 
			Evans) and Matty (Bryan Greenberg), who have asked her for help in 
			stealing the answers to the SAT, to be administered on Saturday. 
			This because she happens to be the beautiful and disaffected 
			daughter of the man who owns ETS (Educational Testing Service) in 
			Princeton, where they all happen to reside, and thus has all kinds 
			of access. </font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yes, she resists at first. And yes, 
			she comes around. Also yes, the others involved in the caper have 
			their own motives for doing the wrong thing. Aspiring architect Kyle 
			wants to get into Cornell, Matty wants to make it to University of 
			Maryland where his offscreen girlfriend is already enrolled and 
			apparently cheating on hi. Straight-A girlie Anna (Erika 
			Christensen) freezes on tests, basketball star Desmond (Darius 
			Miles) needs to make a minimum score to get his scholarship, and 
			stoner Roy (Leonardo Nam) overhears Pacey and Dawson scheming in the 
			boys' room. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Unsurprisingly, each kid learns a 
			special lesson. Equally unsurprisingly, said lessons involve hookups 
			for the chosen few, namely, the white kids. Until she meets the 
			blandly handsome Kyle, Anna is an overachiever who submits to her 
			stuffy parents' desires (she's headed for Brown, she's ranked second 
			in her class) even as she also pursues her own interests, sort of: 
			she's yearbook photographer, which lands her conveniently at the 
			basketball game, shooting pictures as Des is shooting hoops, and so 
			also conveniently makes an associate of his, if not exactly a 
			friend. The poor girl hasn't experienced what passes for &quot;normal&quot; 
			activity in high school movies, that is, as she puts it, she hasn't 
			&quot;broken curfew&quot; or &quot;made out on a rooftop.&quot; That she gets to do both 
			when she participates in the elaborate key-stealing plot liberates 
			her, of course, to the point that she impresses the elaborately 
			freethinking Francesca the next day as resembling a &quot;slut&quot; -- girl 
			power, yeah! </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Just so, Francesca is a 
			tough-seeming bright girl whose rage at her father (who is serially 
			bedding young women closer to her age than his) inspires her to join 
			in the outlaws (this after, as Matty observes by way of an odd dis, 
			she's been &quot;folding [her]self up in a web page because daddy doesn't 
			love [her] enough&quot;). When Kyle and Matty first approach her in the 
			library, the camera swoops up her legs beneath the desk (from no 
			one's point of view), revealing her strawberry-patterned 
			underpantsed crotch, in order to -- I'm guessing here -- demonstrate 
			her seductive rebelliousness: she sits like a boy, legs uncrossed. 
			But Francesca's appeal lies not so much in her pop-punky outfits, 
			however, as in her self-awareness: she knows she's a cliché, saying, 
			&quot;The poor little rich girl story is a little played out.&quot; </font>
			</p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Directed by Brian (<i>Hardball</i>) 
			Robbins, <i>The Perfect Score</i> includes a rudimentary political 
			critique of the U.S. educational and testing system. Well-known 
			concerns are voiced by unsurprising spokespeople: Des calls the SAT 
			racist, Francesca notes its sexism, while Roy adds on that the most 
			successful test-takers are Asians of a certain class background. The 
			point, of course, is that the test doesn't measure potential so much 
			as it measures willingness to play by a certain set of rules. This 
			in conjunction with a high school sports system that promotes gifted 
			athletes even when they don't actually complete their class work, 
			along with legacy admissions policies and class biases, add up to 
			good reasons for the kids to fight back. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Such reasons only make the kids 
			likely candidates for ethical rehabilitation, for this movie is not 
			about to condone cheating, no matter how corrupt the institution 
			they're trailing against. <i>The Perfect Score</i> is, at its heart, 
			the corniest of retreads -- the one where the rebels come to respect 
			the broader system after all: they want to go to school, make money, 
			consume product. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To reach this end, the film makes 
			liberal use of stereotypes, from Kyle's slacker older brother Larry 
			(Matthew Lillard), still living over their parents' garage, to the 
			bad girlfriend who's left Matty available, to Des' ostensibly strict 
			mom (the always excellent and always underused Tyra Ferrell, 
			Doughboy and Ricky's mom in <i>Boyz N the Hood</i>), who insists 
			that he go to college instead of turning pro. She's the only adult 
			figure who might be termed &quot;positive,&quot; though she's also one of the 
			precious few with more than one or two lines to speak. But her 
			interest in her son's experience seems late; somehow, she's missed 
			that he hasn't done his high school class work for four years.&nbsp;
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Amid all this formula-mongering, 
			Roy is a little bit of something else. That's not to say he doesn't 
			subscribe to stereotypes: he's a video-gamey geek and wannabe 
			designer, a math whiz who's lost his mother and is now awkwardly 
			lusty around girls. Calling himself the &quot;Ghost&quot; (&quot;Because I hear 
			things and see things and nobody hears or sees me&quot;), Roy smokes dope 
			incessantly and underachieves on purpose. Smart and smart-mouthed, 
			he's disposed to heady philosophizing (the SAT isn't difficult, he 
			asserts, because &quot;<i>These</i> questions all have answers&quot;), and 
			egregious splats of physical humor (falling out of trees). </font>
			</p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like most high school outsiders, 
			the Ghost brings perspective to the rituals his fellow students take 
			so seriously. As the film's mostly cynical narrator, he remarks 
			their evolving relationships (from a distance) and, when asked about 
			his fondest dreams, imagines an alternate universe where he's a 
			superhero, part man, part reptile. If only <i>The Perfect Score</i>, 
			so pedestrian and predictable, had spent some time in that universe.
