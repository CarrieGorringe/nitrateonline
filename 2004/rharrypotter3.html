			Prisoner of Azkaban<br>
            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>, 4 June 2004</i></font><p class="MsoNormal">
			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yes, one of our beloved literary 
			characters, courtesy of J.K. Rowling, heretofore heir to a cinematic 
			fortune just under (and soon to be much, much over) $3 billion, 
			endures some enlightening growing pains in his third excursion to 
			the big screen, dvd, and beyond. Don't be alarmed, though, because 
			he's not yet Harold Potter. He's still Harry, and I (and you) should 
			all be wild about him, a maturing 13-year-old student at the 
			esteemed Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He's returning 
			for his third year of magical study with his delightfully bewitching 
			friends Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger, on the trail of darker 
			adventure and direction (than in predecessors <i>Harry Potter and 
			the Sorcerer's Stone</i> and <i>Harry Potter and the Chamber of 
			Secrets</i>), while keeping much of the same eye-catching scenery 
			and supporting characters intact. Chris Columbus has moved out of 
			the director's chair (yet still keeping a watchful eye as one of the 
			film's executive producers), replaced by Mexican-born and raised 
			Alfonso Cuarón, who takes a determined and deliberately more 
			sinister leap into the world of one of cinema's big-budget fantasy 
			franchises. The choice is Cuarón, whose last film was the 
			award-winning <i>Y tu mama también</i> (which also garnered an Oscar 
			nomination for best screenplay), is inspired, and was more a 
			decision based on <i>The Little Princess</i>, his enchanting, 
			four-hankie, 1995 adaptation of the classic children's book by 
			Frances Hodgson Burnett (released by Warner Bros., which also 
			handles production/distribution for the <i>Harry Potter</i> films).</font></b></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So what is Harry 
			(dependable Daniel Radcliffe) up to when his latest adventure 
			begins? Well, the prototypical likable lad is on the brink of 
			adolescence and, like many young male teenagers, he is tempted to 
			experimentation under the bedcovers. Steve Kloves, who has channeled 
			all of Rowling's <i>Harry Potter</i> novels to the screen (and 
			continues to imbue his adaptations with humor and humanity), pokes 
			fun at the coming-of-age tradition of nocturnal emission, casting a 
			bright, new comic light for the kid who used to live in the closet 
			under the stairs. This small chuckle at the expense of Uncle Vernon 
			(Richard Griffiths) segues into a bigger guffaw as Aunt Marge (Pam 
			Ferris) pushes her potty mouth to Harry's limit and quickly learns 
			that egos aren't the only things than can be inflated. It's a 
			wonderfully edited sequence by Steven Weisberg (who also cut 
			Cuarón's <i>The Little Princess</i> and <i>Great Expectations</i>), 
			slowing inflating the comic effect. Moments later, the bridge from 
			summer vacation to school and studies is taken aboard the spirited 
			Knight Bus, a frantic triple-decker ride through London by Ernie, 
			the vehicle's myopic driver, a droll ticket taker, and a 
			wisecracking Shrunken Head, replete with Jamaican accent. No Muggles 
			allowed.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">With so much 
			slapstick on the front end of the film, most of the remaining comedy 
			is of the nuanced, wit, and amusing prop variety (all very funny). 
			Also, no sooner does Harry learn of the escape of Sirius Black (Gary 
			Oldman, one of Hollywood's most lovable nasties, q.v. <i>The 
			Professional</i>, <i>The Fifth Element</i>, <i>Lost in Space</i>, <i>
			The Contender</i>, etc.), the eponymous inmate jailed a dozen years 
			earlier, Harry and his close friends Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione 
			(Emma Watson) find that life at Hogwarts has taken a somewhat dismal 
			turn toward self preservation because the escaped wizard is seeking 
			out Harry.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Despite the 
			enormous cast, many of our old favorites and new additions are 
			reduced to extended cameos. Returning, ever too briefly, are Mrs. 
			Weasley (Julie Walters); Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon taking 
			over the headmaster chores from the late, great Richard Harris); 
			Professor Minerva McGonagall (Maggie Smith); Professor Snape (Alan 
			Rickman); and members of the Dursley residence, including the 
			aforementioned Uncle Vernon, plus Aunt Petunia (Fiona Shaw) and 
			Dudley (Harry Melling).</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Newly minted 
			roles are Madam Rosmerta (Julie Christie), caretaker of the Three 
			Broomsticks pub in Hogsmeade; Divination Professor Sibyll Trelawney 
			(Emma Thompson), a ditsy, thickly spectacled Berkeley Bohemian type; 
			and, when he finally shows up, Sirius Black. David Thewlis, a 
			20-year veteran thespian, returns to the fantasy realm (after last 
			year's forgettable <i>Timeline</i>) with a sturdy role as the 
			slightly disheveled, but completely earnest Professor R.J. Lupin, 
			the new Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher who helps Harry 
			perfect his Patronus Charm, takes a keen liking to the student, and 
			is foiled by a startling, dark secret.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The lovable giant 
			Hagrid (Robbie Coltrane) is back, promoted to Care of Magical 
			Creatures teacher, and he's got a Hippogrif (a magical half-horse, 
			half-eagle) name Buckbeak that takes a liking to Harry and a 
			disliking to bleach blond school bully Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton). 
			With all the real dangers about, I wish Harry or Ron or Hermione 
			would just turn their odious classmate into a frog. The Whomping 
			Willow gets major screen time, for snatching a few careless birds, 
			announcing seasonal changes, or giving Harry and Hermione an 
			amusement ride they won't soon forget. There's a bit of 
			rain-drenched Quidditch for sports fans, a map like none you'd find 
			at mapquest.com (which becomes the title design for the end 
			credits), a werewolf (twice in one summer!), shape-shifting Boggarts 
			that are tamed by laughter and comic intentions, and the Cloak of 
			Invisibility, helping Harry to sneak in and out generally unnoticed 
			(damn those footprints in the snow).</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I won't get into 
			the story line (hey most of you have read the book, right?), other 
			to say that you might feel a sense of déjà vu about two-thirds of 
			the way through the 142-minute film.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Let's talk about 
			the scary parts. While the film is rated PG (for frightening 
			moments, creature violence, and mild language), the ominous 
			Dementors are a flock of grim reapery, ice-inducing, soul-sucking 
			creatures that nearly paralyze Harry to the edge of death on more 
			than one occasion. They also are likely to menace children under 
			10-years-old with a few scares. Don't be surprised to see a few 
			youngsters cower under a parent's umbrage, probably asking mom or 
			dad to tell them when these beasties are gone. These nightmarish 
			beings approximate the shadowy, unearthly shapes in <i>Ghost </i>
			that escorted bad guy Tony Goldwyn to an after-death location 
			considerably deeper than six feet under.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This 
			well-intentioned disclaimer aside, the cast and crew of <i>Harry 
			Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban</i> are to be congratulated for a 
			more adult vision than the earlier films, and a (slightly) shorter 
			one. Some fans might be distracted by the darker visual palate, but 
			the spellbinding landscape is definitely familiar, the humor 
			elevating, the effects wondrous, and the characters filled with 
			enough eccentricities for plenty of entertainment value. In a summer 
			barely begun and <i>Shrek 2</i> already speeding past the 
			quarter-billion-dollar boxoffice gross mark in just two weeks of 
			release, <i>Azkaban</i> is poised to overtake the green ogre and be 
			not only the most successful yet of the orphan wizard's cinematic 
			tales, but possibly one of the year's biggest hits.</font></p>
