			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Great cast. Award winning 
			director. High hopes.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yet…. Word on the street was not 
			good (only one press screening to boot), plus it's been sitting 
			around for a year and a half awaiting release. I'll chime in that 
			yes, sadly, it's a groggy thriller. <i>Twisted</i> is one of those 
			haven't-I-seen-this-before? films who fault is squarely placed on a 
			derivative script by Sarah Thorp. This is her first big writing gig, 
			as her film <i>See Jane Run</i>, which she wrote AND directed back 
			in 2000 is still unreleased. <i>Twisted</i> is 96 minutes that are 
			soggier that the watered down streets of San Francisco where Philip 
			Kaufman pedantically directs his stars about a handful of serial 
			killings, only to shoot himself in the foot after he slips on the 
			wet pavement. He can't gather his troops together to overcome the 
			screenplay's gaping holes and badly written characters. Like Humpty-Dumpty,
			<i>Twisted</i> is falling off the box-office wall, taking a quick 
			tumble to the home-video vault. Kaufman, who helmed such masterworks 
			as <i>The Right Stuff</i> and <i>The Unbearable Lightness of Being</i>, 
			as well as the somewhat over-directed <i>Rising Sun</i>, another 
			good cop-bad cop film that, at least, got better reviews that his 
			current effort. Unfortunately it appears that Kaufman as left the 
			building; seems he got lost in one of those Golden Gate fog banks. 
			Philip, please call us when you find a good script and find your 
			cinematic footing.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ashley Judd is back as the damsel 
			in distress, starring with Samuel L. Jackson (both appeared together 
			in Joel Schumacher's <i>A Time to Kill</i>, which top billed 
			recently-absent-from-the-screen Sandra Bullock and Matthew 
			McConaughey), and Andy Garcia. Judd takes center stage as Jessica 
			Shepard, a newly crowned police homicide detective partnered with 
			Mike Delmarco (Garcia). Shepard, a strong willed, too ballsy cop who 
			can outdrink most of her compatriots, has a penchant for secretive 
			bar hopping and playfully violent one night stands. She is in 
			(failed) therapy over anger management issues with Dr. Melvin Frank 
			(David Strathairn), a borderline creepy psychiatrist. Her parents, 
			victims of a haunting murder-suicide, left her to grow up under the 
			tutelage of John Mills (Jackson), her dad's ex-partner and now 
			police commissioner. For a trained detective, it's incomprehensible 
			that she can't understand why she is constantly blacking out at home 
			after single glasses of wine from the same bottle.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The script's finger points the 
			crimes at everyone in the theater except for the pimply kid selling 
			popcorn at the concession stand. The killer, who is knocking off men 
			Shepard has taken to bed, likes to extinguish cigarettes on his 
			victims' hands. So, of course, there have to be the perfunctory 
			remaining male cast members who blow smoke-filled McGuffins screen 
			left and screen right: ashtrays overflowing with cancer sticks, a 
			clicking lighter that reminded me of the clock ticking within the 
			belly of <i>Peter Pan</i>'s crocodile. There were so many of these 
			tar-and-nicotine plot devices on screen that several members of the 
			audience developed emphysema during the course of the film's 
			screening. There's also one dreadfully horrid spooky dream 
			sequence—death by guns in this one—badly scripted and badly wrought.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There are plenty of sour grapes, 
			too. As the film begins, an alleged murder-rapist played by Leland 
			Orser puts the screws to Shepard before she kicks the crap out of 
			him. Turns out he's the slimy heir to a pharmaceutical fortune and 
			the only male member of the cast who hasn't slept with the 
			protagonist. He's got a hot shot lawyer, who, naturally, has had sex 
			with you know who. Who else? Me (I wish. No, just my fantasies 
			taking over for a minute. Hey, what red blooded guy wouldn't want a 
			hot night with Ashley?) Oh, the other suspect is Jimmy Schmidt (Mark 
			Pellegrino), a hot-headed street cop who wants a bigger time share 
			with the tempestuous temper queen.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">San Francisco still belongs to 
			'Dirty' Harry Callahan. <i>Twisted</i>, this town ain't big enough 
			for the two of you. Scram!</font></p>
