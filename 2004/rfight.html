            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>, 16 April 2004</i></font><p class="MsoEnvelopeReturn">
			<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Being an online film critic means 
			receiving a regular slew of local press screening notices and an 
			occasional email from someone with a small film who wants feedback. 
			That's what I'm here for, of course. You get the good, the bad, or 
			the ugly in about 800 words about 50 times a year from yours truly. 
			In mid February I got that irregular email from Donald Whittier, a 
			good ole boy raised in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. A successful 
			local entrepreneur, real estate developer, and Tae Kwon Do expert, 
			he grew up making Super8 home movies. He's now graduating to the 
			&quot;big time&quot; with <i>Fight Circle</i> (<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.fightcircle.com/" target="_top">fightcircle.com</a>), 
			billed as &quot;America's first feature-length martial arts film.&quot; You 
			can't watch it in the theatres, on cable television, or on dvd from 
			your local blockbuster. It's only on your computer, and you better 
			have a broadband connection to boot. To build word of mouth, Don's 
			pounding the world wide web and offering critics a free pass. For 
			the rest of you, it's seven bucks for a 9-chapter, 89-minute, 750+ 
			megabyte streaming video excursion. One recent weekend, the website 
			was offering it at 50% off. Bargain matinee. It's been available for 
			your viewing since 2:04 pm on February 4th, for those of you taking 
			notes. People are interested, at least, over 70,000 visitors having 
			watched the film's trailer within the first few weeks of the 
			ultra-low budget, larger intentioned project's availability (&quot;<i>FC</i> 
			has its own score&quot; Whittier proudly exclaimed in a recent instant 
			message), most of those viewers brought in by web advertising, 
			banner ads, and geek website Fark.com.</font></b></p>
			<p class="MsoEnvelopeReturn"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As for 
			the film, like with most circles it's pointless. Granted, I've seen 
			worse on budgets way above those that Mr. Whittier has pieced his 
			picture together. In <i>Fight Circle</i> there are a series of 
			fights using sticks, fists, hands, feet, swords, etc., out in the 
			lush, green woods where everyone runs around barefooted and lives in 
			tents and other assorted structures. The first brief battle finds 
			the boastful Gabby (Jim Coyne), one of the sparsely-clothed warriors 
			that troll the forest, defeating the mighty Undan and returning with 
			the spoils -- a necklace snatched from the great one's neck. 
			Meanwhile Nemo (Ad Santell, a.k.a. the film's director of 
			photography) and his impatient, yet feisty female cousin Paky have 
			small talk about this fight circle thingee (she wants in, maybe -- 
			her dad was a member. Or maybe she saw Uma Thurman in <i>Kill Bill</i> 
			and wants a piece of that action.). Physically, it's a small round 
			&quot;c (as in male <u>c</u>hauvinist)-shaped&quot; clearing with scrawny tree 
			saplings and flat&nbsp; stones dotting its circumference. The 
			metaphysical circle, however, has apparently fallen on spiritual 
			hard times (everyone's opting for the country club just outside the 
			forest, perhaps), but one Zen-like character warns that &quot;the fight 
			circle only kills young men and creates monsters.&quot;</font></p>
			<p class="MsoEnvelopeReturn"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Goody, 
			now you think there might be some neato special effects. Maybe 
			something nasty out in the medieval woodshed? Well, the only thing 
			wooden is the acting, and some of that is real nasty. There's a 
			hooded guy who frees Nemo (or is it Mullag?) and Paky. When did they 
			get tied up anyway, and why? Seems everyone roaming the woods has an 
			axe to grind.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoEnvelopeReturn"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Low 
			rumble percussion and occasional bagpipe soundtrack/score (by Robert 
			Hunt) bombards the numerous fisticuffs, grunts, and groans that 
			erupt every few minutes. &quot;The circle is not about killing,&quot; one of 
			the contestants&nbsp; remarks.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoEnvelopeReturn"><font size="2" face="Verdana">&quot;So 
			what,&quot; I answered back. (Seems I can do that when it's an audience 
			of one.) Let Paky get the Gordon Liu treatment from the older guy 
			who rescued her and her cousin, who is page to the real Undan 
			(Runyon Woods), who's not dead at all, just retired to a job 
			coaching from the muddy sidelines.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoEnvelopeReturn"><font size="2" face="Verdana">As for 
			bad guys, there's Kas (Kas DeCarvalho), a well toned specimen in 
			leather skirt with a marine's physique and a clean-shaven head. He 
			snaps necks as if they're about to go out of season. In the full 
			circle game he's not playing fair.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoEnvelopeReturn"><font size="2" face="Verdana">So Mullag 
			(Thomas Shanks) and Paky (Anna Henke) train on their own agenda, 
			with the young lad boasting that he's cooked 10,000 more meals than 
			she ever has, and she's told to put all the stones back in the 
			river. Huh? What kind of lessons are we learning? Great parables are 
			had to come by, even if easily accessible on the internet.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoEnvelopeReturn"><font size="2" face="Verdana">There's a 
			lame story line about Mullag pining away amongst the pine trees for 
			Paky, wounded in one of those forest encounters and then running off 
			to heal, or get revenge, but instead finds the handsome Trebor (Sam 
			Hargrave), a master like Undan. Paky, it seems, had stolen Undan's 
			revered chronicle, but it takes Trebor over a year to berate her for 
			the theft, but she does learn the warrior's way in the meanwhile. 
			It's all rather silly. There's talk about levels. Fighting levels. 
			Paky, starting in the amateur league, obviously dreams of a Friday 
			Night Fight at Madison Square Garden.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoEnvelopeReturn"><font size="2" face="Verdana">In tune 
			with the budget, the screenwriting could have used a heavy dose of 
			rewrite. Micro funded doesn't mean it has to be low caliber. On the 
			plus side, the digital production looks and sounds fine, even those 
			handful of by-the-campfire night shots. Chapter Seven's face off 
			against Trebor and Kas is nicely choreographed and provides the only 
			startling plot twist in the film. Unfortunately, nothing comes of 
			it.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoEnvelopeReturn"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Because 
			of the forest dampness, <i>Full Circle</i> might be considered moss 
			see entertainment. (That's the late night humor setting in.) As for 
			the characters that tread about it's arbor field, they're mostly 
			forgettable. For producer-director-writer Donald Whittier, no doubt
			<i>Full Circle</i> was a nice learning experience, but that doesn't 
			mean everyone on the internet need sit in on this class project.</font></td>
