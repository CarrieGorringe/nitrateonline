            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 20 March 2004</i></font><p>
			<font face="Verdana" size="5">Twitchers </font></p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Don't call it a remake. While 
			Zack Snyder's zonky fun zombie flick is properly respectful of 
			George Romero's <i>Dawn of the Dead</i> (which means that it's not 
			trying to update or improve on the original), it does come with its 
			own energetic innovation. Starting with the infamous premise 
			(flesh-eating zombies at the mall), the new version then twists it 
			up into increasingly perverse knots.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The plot you know begins simply, 
			even innocuously: Ana (Sarah Polley) is coming off an extra-long 
			shift at the hospital, where a patient has been admitted into ICU 
			with &quot;a bite.&quot; It sounds odd, but she's tired, and the doctor who's 
			supposed to be in charge is too busy. And so Ana heads home to the 
			burbs, the camera tracking her progress from so far overhead as 
			reduce the houses and backyard pools to little abstract shapes. She 
			exchanges sweet hellos with a neighbor girl on roller skates, has 
			shower sex with her husband, and misses a tv news bulletin that you 
			imagine warns of the coming threat. Early the next morning, 
			following a sudden and gruesome neck-gnawing, hubby turns on Ana. 
			Squeezing through the bathroom window, Ana looks out on the chaos -- 
			houses burning, cars crashing, people screaming and bleeding. </font>
			</p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ana's escape is narrow, of course. 
			It's also nerve-wracking and, for an instant, as her lurching 
			getaway is filmed from the hood of her car, creepily comical. Teary 
			and dazed, she's also resilient in the way that slasher films' Last 
			Girls tend to be, enduring a few more brutal assaults before she 
			makes her way to the Crossroads Mall. Here she meets up with the 
			sundry types who will comprise the film's core survivors: surly cop 
			Kenneth (Ving Rhames), practical-minded electronics salesman Michael 
			(Jake Weber), and erstwhile banger Andre (Mekhi Phifer) and his very 
			pregnant Russian wife Luda (Inna Korobkina). Inside, this group 
			meets a trio of security guards, headed up by bossy CJ (Michael 
			Kelly), who initially tells newcomers, &quot;Find someplace else!&quot; </font>
			</p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When CJ finally agrees to let the 
			bedraggled band stay in the mall (and only after the three white 
			guards disarm the two black guys), he decides to maintain order by 
			forbidding them from &quot;stealing&quot; from the stores where no one will 
			ever shop again. This question of order is at the center of Romero's
			<i>Living Dead</i> films, where inadvertent teams must contend not 
			only with the undead fiends looking to rip them up, but also the 
			tensions and antagonisms among themselves. Here, with the formula so 
			well established, the set-up is minimal, and the action is more 
			elaborate, and considerably faster. (Not so hyper-fast as in <i>28 
			Days Later</i>, but more certainly vigorously than in the first <i>
			Dawn</i>, where they rode escalators just like ordinary consumers: 
			here, they crouch, leap, and slam up against glass doors, to leave 
			artful bloody smears.) </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This action is complicated by some 
			clever incorporations of images and ideas from other horror movies 
			familiar to the new <i>Dawn</i>'s presumed audience, including <i>
			It's Alive!</i> (1974), <i>Road Warrior</i> (1981), <i>Aliens</i> 
			(1986), and (yay!) <i>Tremors</i> (1990). Such reshuffling is 
			indicated early on, when CJ and his boys first reveal their massive 
			tv monitor bank to the newcomers. All stand rapt, exhausted from 
			their own recent escapes and awed by the extensive atrocities before 
			them. Along with the flaming piles of zombie bodies, the newscasts 
			feature on-the-spot interviews with authority figures, the same guys 
			who pronounced procedure in the first <i>Living Dead</i> films, the 
			General (Scott Reninger), the televangelist (Ken Foree), and the 
			Sheriff (Tom Savini), who declares one unstill undead body a &quot;twitcher.&quot;
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Sheriff's brusque attitude 
			impresses Bart (Michael Barry), the security guard most in need of 
			macho self-definition by way of naming others other -- the twitcher 
			calls for an immediate finish by the Sheriff's preferred method: 
			&quot;Just shoot 'em in the head.&quot; This last initiates a brief debate 
			between the guards, over whether you can believe what you hear on tv. 
			Lacking other sources of information, the mall-bound viewers are 
			stuck with the screens in front of them, just like you. And these 
			screens put on the only imaginable show, wherein, as CJ notes, 
			&quot;America always sorts this shit out.&quot; (Patriotism can serve the most 
			bizarre of purposes.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That said, the mall-squatters are 
			soon beset by a series of outside forces: throngs of zombies out in 
			the parking lot and a truckload of other survivors, to introduce new 
			potential victims into the mix, among them Frank (the great Matt 
			Frewer), good-hearted -- and already bitten -- father to pretty 
			Nicole (Lindy Booth). Most of these latecomers are quickly 
			dispatched, with the terminally cynical Steve (Ty Burrell), so mean 
			and ambiguously sexed that he's plainly targeted for grisly death. 
			This is too bad, though, as his nasty wit zaps up the mostly 
			straightforward dialogue: asked if the last people he saw &quot;outside&quot; 
			were dead, he snaps, &quot;Deadish. They sort of fell down and then got 
			up and started eating each other.&quot; It's as good a description as any 
			of these humanish monsters.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For, aside from claims that they're 
			walking the earth because there's &quot;no more room in hell&quot;, the 
			zombies' most obvious function is to critique the consuming 
			practices of their previous selves. Lost in the suburbs, they spent 
			their precious time alive driving from one point of purchase to 
			another, with the mall offering the most bang for any given buck. 
			Now, as zombies, they swarm and stalk, unable to imagine any 
			activity beyond eating, an activity that by definition can never 
			satisfy their endless hunger. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As admirably spunky as the 
			survivors may be -- Ana, Kenneth, and Michael are especially 
			sympathetic and challenged, as they figure out what their previously 
			unknown talents -- they're only putting off the inevitable. (And the 
			film's snarky comedy and impressively visceral violence is 
			relentless, even through the final credits sequence.) This insight 
			into cultural ends is the most disturbing aspect of this sort of 
			film, and what <i>Dawn of the Dead</i> gets so right: their efforts 
			to survive make them human, but they can only, finally and 
			perpetually, confront more of the same, deadish or aliveish. </font></td>
