			Himself<br>
            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 26 March 2004</i></font><p class="MsoNormal">
			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">When a typical film deals with a 
			dark subject like suicide, you’d expect to hear moody strings 
			droning over the soundtrack and an atmosphere that exudes lonely 
			gloom. As <i>Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself</i> starts rolling, we see 
			a solitary figure stuffing pills down his throat and turning on the 
			gas of his stove. The strings start to blare more loudly, and the 
			character’s self-inflicted gloom seems imminent. </font></b></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">A viewer who’s 
			only watching this scene casually might imagine that we’re in for 
			yet another dreary flick like <i>The Hours</i> or <i>Sylvia</i>. But 
			as a would-be rescuer comes rushing into the apartment, cries over 
			the scene and scampers about looking for a phone, a seemingly 
			lifeless arm rises and hands him the chordless receiver. </font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s an obvious 
			sign that the audience is in the hands of that not-so-melancholy 
			Dane, writer-director Lone Scherfig. Her previous movie, <i>Italian 
			for Beginners</i>, featured three on-screen deaths in the first 
			30-40 minutes, but ultimately felt droll and sunny. And even though 
			that film was shot under the austere demands of the Dogma 95 
			manifesto (all handheld cameras, no prerecorded soundtrack, etc), 
			Scherfig ended up with a movie that seemed more sweet and 
			intelligently uplifting than arty.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This time around 
			Scherfig has switched to a Scottish setting (although she actually 
			shot most of it back in her native land) and is working with more 
			conventional production techniques, but her quirky handling and 
			low-key humor are still in force. </font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Her title 
			character, played by Jamie Sives, is driving everyone else around 
			him crazy with his quest for do-it-yourself demise. He gets kicked 
			out to the suicide recovery group sessions because he’s so 
			obnoxiously unrepentant. When the facilitator Moira (Julie Davis) 
			asks him what would happen if all humanity killed themselves, he 
			offhandedly answers, “There’d be no more group.” </font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">He even chews out 
			his earnestly well-meaning older brother Harbour (Adrian Rawlins), 
			who rescued him in the opening frames, because he finds his own 
			continued survival humiliating. Harbour, on the other hand, probably 
			envies Wilbur’s humiliation because he may have terminal cancer and 
			a new wife named Alice (Shirley Henderson) and a stepdaughter (Lisa 
			McKinlay) who stand to lose him almost as quickly as he’s entered 
			their lives.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the hands of a 
			less idiosyncratic filmmaker, this situation would play like a 
			typically maudlin film that would normally run on Lifetime instead 
			of in a theater. Scherfig doesn’t always play the setup for laughs (Harbour’s 
			explanation of Wilbur’s death wish is pretty harrowing), but when 
			she does, it makes the somewhat contrived premise more agreeable and 
			even convincing. </font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The story moves 
			along predictably, but Scherfig consistently chooses to make 
			Wilbur's evolution from a selfish whiner into a mensch seem more 
			gradual and less strident. For example, despite his destructive and 
			rude disposition, women flock to Wilbur because a strange magnetism 
			that briefly trumps his thoughtlessness. Somehow no one from these 
			legions of potential mates, including Moira <i>and</i> Alice, 
			manages to straighten him out through seduction. It doesn’t hurt 
			that Sives has the range to make Wilbur’s eventual attitude shift 
			believable. </font></p>
			<p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent:0in">
			<font face="Verdana" size="2">The script by Scherfig and fellow Dane 
			Anders Thomas Jensen has some juicy exchanges, but there are a few 
			gags that are probably funnier in Copenhagen than they are in 
			Glasgow (confusing Rudyard Kipling with some sort of pickling 
			technique just doesn’t translate). The tone shifts downward and 
			sentimental toward the end, and <i>Wilbur Wants to Kill Himself</i> 
			might have benefited from the firmer ensemble approach that Scherfig 
			adopted in <i>Italian for Beginners</i>. In that film, the eventual 
			pairing of certain characters didn’t seem forced because each match 
			had just the right amount of setup. This time around, the subplots 
			seem a bit underdeveloped, so their resolutions seem abrupt.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still, <i>Wilbur 
			Wants to Kill</i> himself demonstrates that Scherfig has a 
			delightfully warped sensibility that can make stock tales lively and 
			can also make films that are filled with death but are still weirdly 
			life affirming.</font></td>
