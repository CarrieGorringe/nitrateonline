			</font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 4 June 2004</i></font><p><b>
			<font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Raising Helen</i> can probably best 
			be described as a reworking of <i>Jersey Girl</i> with better acting 
			and more assured handling. The core idea isn’t that interesting, but 
			at least the people involved seem more committed and up to the task.
			</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Basically, comparing the two films 
			is like getting the same sundae at McDonald’s from one employee 
			whose mind is somewhere else and another who has the routine 
			mastered. Either way, the nutrition’s not there, and there’s no 
			surprise to speak of, but one tastes a little better.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s exactly the sort of movie 
			you’d expect from Garry Marshall, who gave us <i>Pretty Woman</i> 
			and <i>The Princess Diaries</i>. The core flaw of <i>Raising Helen</i> 
			is that Marshall and screenwriters Jack Amiel and Michael Begler 
			offer nothing that hasn’t been seen before. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The setup sounds like a leftover 
			pitch from the TV sitcoms that Marshall used to churn out in the 
			70s. Kate Hudson stars as Helen Harris, an up and coming drone at a 
			high-powered modeling agency whose career of schmoozing and partying 
			in the right places dominates her entire life. It’s a safe bet that 
			if she shows up at a family gathering, she’ll be late (if at all) 
			and on her way to another hip soirée to help plug another client.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That quickly changes when her 
			sister Lindsay (Felicity Huffman) dies in an accident and wills the 
			care of her children to Helen. This seems like an odd decision 
			because Helen’s older sister Jenny (Joan Cusack, in a typically show 
			stealing turn) lives for being a mother and has room for Audrey 
			(Hayden Panettiere), Henry (Spencer Breslin, <i>The Kid</i>) and 
			Sarah (Abigail Breslin, <i>Signs</i>). </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Helen is initially terrified of 
			having surrogate motherhood thrust upon her, but curiously answers 
			the call of her dormant maternal instincts. From here, everything 
			comes preassembled. You know when the kids will act up or when Helen 
			will bungle something or when Marshall expects you to get moist in 
			the eyes. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s rather telling that when the 
			woman who accompanied me to the screening missed reading some of the 
			opening credits, she asked me after the ending if <i>Raising Helen</i> 
			was a Garry Marshall film. Several of his stock performers like 
			Larry Miller and Hector Elizondo have amusing bits, and the tone, 
			content and style are pretty much set in granite. Marshall doesn’t 
			shake anything up for fear of violating the principles that made his 
			hit films popular.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The cast thankfully keep the 
			enterprise from feeling completely stale. Hudson may not be pushing 
			herself too hard, but she is sufficiently appealing to make waiting 
			though the rest of the film. As he did with <i>My Big Fat Greek 
			Wedding</i>, John Corbett takes a generic love interest role (in 
			this case a friendly Lutheran pastor who takes a liking to Helen) 
			and injects enough sly charm to keep the romance from feeling 
			completely rote. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The kids are game, and featuring 
			real-life siblings like the Breslins gives <i>Raising Helen</i> a 
			feeling of authenticity that’s missing from the rest of the movie. 
			To Marshall’s credit, he has a decent understanding of his potential 
			audience (unlike <i>Jersey Girl</i> director Kevin Smith, who 
			unsuccessfully tried to juggle sentimentality and vulgarity) and 
			what they might want it a film. It’s too bad the unexpected isn’t 
			part of his formula.</font></td>
