            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 16 January 2004</i></font><p>
			<font face="Verdana" size="5">A quarter mile at a time </font></p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Having survived his three 
			minutes worth of pseudo-notoriety on MTV's <i>Undressed</i>, Jay 
			Hernandez has gone on to greater and lesser endeavors. Though he was 
			sharp as Kirsten Dunst's wrong-side-of-the-tracks boyfriend in <i>
			crazy/beautiful</i> (2001), he's currently reduced to loyal 
			multiculti sidekick in <i>Torque</i>. That is to say, along with 
			Will Yun Lee, Hernandez provides bookends of street-cred color for 
			pretty white star Martin Henderson. </font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's no coincidence that this 
			formula sounds familiar. The producer of <i>Torque</i>, Neil Moritz, 
			also brought you <i>The Fast and the Furious</i> and <i>2 Fast 2 
			Furious</i>, both of which put Paul Walker in the white boy seat, 
			surrounded by various folks of color, from Asian to black to Vin 
			Diesel. This time, the wheels are generally fewer in number -- 
			motorcycles instead of cars -- but the element of speed remains 
			paramount. That is, the boys' bonds, however considerable, are 
			secondary. The point here -- again and again -- is racing and 
			exploding. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film begins as Cary Ford 
			(Henderson) rolls back into L.A. after six (apparently very long) 
			months in Thailand, where he was avoiding trumped up drug charges. 
			During his absence, the landscape has not really changed, but his 
			name is turned to mud for everyone but his boys, Dalton (Hernandez) 
			and Val (Will Yun Lee). The first scene has Ford making trouble with 
			some racing cars on an otherwise empty stretch of highway, ending in 
			a daring wheelie in between the cars that had the specially-invited 
			bikers at the preview screening whooping. He goes on to fight them 
			at a gas station, where he sticks up for a cute little kid (Hayden 
			McFarland) and hooks up with Dalton and Val. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Cozy as this opening sequence may 
			be, it's soon revealed that Ford has other reasons for coming back 
			to the States. He's looking for Shane (Monet Mazur), a beautiful 
			bike shop owner still fuming that he walked out six months ago (you 
			hear about this six months thing repeatedly, as you also hear 
			references to &quot;Thailand&quot; in connection with sushi and as &quot;chinkland&quot; 
			-- both corrected by heroic and politically correct Ford, who knows 
			the differences among Asian cultures). </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Complicating our hero's effort to 
			&quot;make things right&quot; with Shane are his run-ins with a couple of 
			feuding biker gangs, the Hellions, led by macho prick Henry James 
			(Matt Schulze) and the Reapers, led by Trey (Ice Cube). It turns out 
			that Ford has history with Henry James (something about the snarly 
			villain leaving Ford with two easy rider-style bikes with gas tanks 
			filled with crystal meth), as well as friction emerging with Trey's 
			tetchy brother Junior (Fredo Starr). When Junior turns up dead, Ford 
			is fingered by James' girl over-pierced, black-lipsticked China 
			(Jaime Pressly), and everyone -- from cops to feds to Reapers -- 
			believes her. This despite the fact that she's the surliest, most 
			untrustworthy-acting eyewitness on the planet. Still, there's 
			something to be said for Pressly's perversely compelling screen 
			presence: lolling and leaning, the girl is as creepy as she is 
			unpersuasive. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ford again goes on the run, this 
			time with Shane and the bookend boys in tow (for a minute, renowned 
			&quot;ladies' man&quot; Val has his own tagalong, played by Christina Milian, 
			though aside from showing her lovely midriff, she has precious 
			little going on here). Aside from posse action by the Reapers and 
			the Hellions, Ford suffers pursuit by a pair of FBI agents, the 
			black-Chucks-wearing McPherson (Adam Scott), who thinks he's too 
			cool for school, and his infinitely patient, occasionally skeptical 
			partner, Henderson (Justina Machado). As everyone picks up on Ford's 
			trail at some point or another, the film crosscuts around from crew 
			to crew, as if building &quot;tension.&quot; </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But honestly, who cares? At 81 
			minutes, <i>Torque</i> hardly needs tension or dialogue or even 
			character -- the types are so well-worn that they more or less 
			resist complications. When Ford announces that he's off to beat the 
			bad guys by referencing <i>The Fast and the Furious</i> (&quot;I live my 
			life a quarter mile at a time&quot;), it's apt that Shane comes back, in 
			faux-weighty close-up, &quot;That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.&quot; 
			In other words, the movie doesn't mean to be anything more than it 
			is: the movie is essentially a series of riding and driving stunts 
			(some actual and most CGI), one more outrageous than the other, and 
			&quot;plot&quot; (that is, any sort of reasonable cause and effect) only gets 
			in the way. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Among the motorcycle highlights: 
			Ford chases Shane through neon-filled streets; Trey chases Ford atop 
			a speeding train; Ford chases Henry James through city traffic; 
			bikes catch fire, bikes explode, bikes crash through windows and 
			over cops' heads. The cuts are speedy, the angles impossible, the 
			action cartoonish. None of this should surprise anyone who knows the 
			previous work of director Joseph Kahn. While the loud and silly <i>
			Torque</i> is his feature film debut, his utter lunacy is 
			established by some 200 music videos, including Eminem's &quot;Without 
			Me,&quot; Destiny's Child's &quot;Say My Name,&quot; and Cube's &quot;The World Is 
			Mine.&quot; </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Such formative background -- 
			setting images to beats, short-handing story, privileging fashion -- 
			is visible everywhere in <i>Torque</i>. The narrative does, of 
			course, wind down to the inevitable rip-roaring showdown between 
			Ford and Henry James (with completely video-game-style riding), but 
			the zanier, earlier climax is more to the point. Shane's biker chick 
			catfight with China begins with each arranged in front of a 
			&quot;product&quot; hugely placed: China looking mean in front of a &quot;Mountain 
			Dew&quot; ad, Shane's blond hair blowing before a &quot;Pepsi&quot; poster. They go 
			on to ludicrous stunty violence, lots of wild riding and vaulting 
			off handlebars and over gas tanks. All of which only goes to show 
			that, for all their sneery bonding, Dalton, Val, Trey, and Ford got 
			nothing on the girlies. </font></td>
