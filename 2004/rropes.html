            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 20 February 2004</i></font><p>
			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Boxing promoter Jackie Kallen has 
			an impressive record. In addition to succeeding in a field that is 
			heavily dominated by men, she's also managed champions in six 
			different weight classes.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's too bad the move &quot;inspired by&quot; 
			her life doesn't match her overachiever reputation. Whereas Kallen 
			is an original and has a uniquely interesting story, <i>Against the 
			Ropes</i> is tepid and routine. It also doesn't help that leading 
			lady Meg Ryan seems really out of her element in Kallen's milieu.
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Vainly struggling with a Midwestern 
			accent that's never quite convincing, Ryan plays Kallen as a 
			secretary who knows a lot more of training and promoting boxers than 
			the baboonish men she works for. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Any credibility this film tries to 
			establish is lost early on. In real life, Ryan may be a tough 
			customer, but onscreen she just doesn't project the right sense of 
			authority, and the actors playing the boxing world heavies are 
			saddled with cartoonish roles that don't give them much room to 
			work. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As the film progresses, Kallen 
			moves up to being a potential player when Larocca (an appropriately 
			menacing Tony Shalhoub), the tyrannical czar of the sport, sells her 
			a losing fighter's contract for a measly dollar. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kallen takes the challenge, but 
			discovers that the fighter was so lousy because he was on drugs and 
			hangs out with the dangerous folks who sell it. In fact, the 
			chemicals have screwed him up so much that a seemingly ordinary thug 
			named Luther Shaw (Omar Epps) beats the fighter worse than his last 
			opponent.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kallen immediately sees potential 
			in the criminal and helps him turn from an outcast into a serious 
			contender with the assistance of a no-nonsense veteran coach (the 
			film's first-time director Charles S. Dutton). As Luther starts to 
			pose a credible challenge to Larocca's current champ, Jackie starts 
			hogging the spotlight and inadvertently starts alienating the fellow 
			who's made her what she is.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">All of this feels more like a 
			hackneyed showbiz tale than a credible telling of a remarkable 
			woman's life. If you like boxing or know a little something about 
			the sport, prepare to have your intelligence insulted. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The final bout features just about 
			every boxing movie cliché you can imagine. It's almost as if 
			screenwriter Cheryl Edwards (<i>Save the Last Dance</i>)<i> </i>and 
			Dutton were following a checklist to make sure they had included all 
			of them. I may be just a film critic, but even I know a manager on 
			the outs with a former client isn't going to be allowed into the 
			ring to give him a much-needed pep talk. Even <i>Rocky</i> avoided 
			that nonsense.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It doesn't help that the only 
			remotely three-dimensional male characters in the film are Luther 
			and a sympathetic sports reporter played by Timothy Daly. Without a 
			sense of dynamics with these antagonists, the film never seems to 
			develop any real narrative drive. It just sits there listlessly 
			because the battle of the sexes presented here is monotonous.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I've been reading a bit about 
			Kallen after seeing the film, and it's really troubling when the 
			real person is so much more interesting than her fictional 
			doppelganger. The real Kallen was a former journalist, married and 
			was raising children while she was working. She also recently 
			battled a heart attack and come back in an astonishing manner.
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If you want to see a movie about 
			women who have succeeded in the testosterone drenched world of 
			athletics, I'll be happy to recommend some far move entertaining and 
			believable films. <i>Heart like a Wheel</i>, <i>Love and Basketball</i> 
			and <i>Girlfight</i> are all three films that take both the sports 
			and the women who have transformed them seriously. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The latter is especially intriguing 
			because that film's writer-director Karyn Kusama has a 
			well-developed visual style, an authentic eye for detail and a drive 
			to tell stories that don't follow the sports movie template. All of 
			these things are missing from <i>Against the Ropes</i>.</font></td>
