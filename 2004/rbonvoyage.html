            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>, 7 May 2004</i></font><p class="MsoNormal">
			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Some viewers of Jean-Paul 
			Rappeneau's latest film, the $30-million <i>Bon Voyage</i>, have 
			likened it to&nbsp; feature-length episode of <i>F Troop</i>, that 
			mid-1960s post-Civil War military farce that extended the bumblings 
			and profiteering schemes that situation comedy writers two decades 
			ago envisioned of the still pioneering days in the American Midwest. 
			It's an unfair comparison.</font></b></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">First off, it's 
			the wrong war: <i>Bon Voyage</i> starts in the confusing months 
			leading up to France's entry into World War II. Second, there are no 
			cowboys and Indians. There's also only one American.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The obvious 
			dissimilarities aside, I'll agree there are amusing bumblings, a 
			handful of military types, and even some profiteering afoot. There's 
			also comedy, drama, mystery, fun, intrigue, and fate-filled chaos 
			rolled up in a slam-bang story, flavored with Rappeneau's own 
			childhood recollections of his country's defeat by the Germans.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Rappeneau, whose 
			output as a director is a mere seven features since 1966, apparently 
			likes to take his time between projects. Without a doubt, his most 
			appealing film was 1990's <i>Cyrano de Bergerac</i>, starring Gerard 
			Depardieu. Among that hulking Gallic sex symbol's nearly 150 roles, 
			his only Oscar nomination was for Rappeneau's version of the 
			oft-filmed Edmond Rostand classic about a man with a famously 
			elongated nose. Obviously indebted to the director, Depardieu is 
			back starring in <i>Bon Voyage</i>, after having a bit part in 
			1995's <i>Le Hussard sur le toit</i> (US: <i>The Horseman on the 
			Roof</i>), Rappeneau's stylish 19th century romantic tale set 
			against the European cholera outbreak. Depardieu, like the rest of 
			the cast, merrily engages in respective stereotype within the realm 
			of sophisticated farce. Love-struck minister Jean-Etienne Beaufort 
			(Depardieu), opportunistic movie star Vivianne Denvert (Isabelle 
			Adjani, looking terrific behind those false eyelashes as she closes 
			in on the half-century mark), idealistic scientist's assistant 
			Camille (Virginia Ledoyen), rascally hoodlum Raoul (Yvan Attal), 
			struggling writer and sad puppy sap-to-a-crying damsel Frédéric 
			Auger (Grégori Derangère, Rappeneau's alter ego with a passing 
			resemblance to <i>ER</i>'s Noah Wylie), and determined, 
			back-stabbing journalist Alex Winckler (Peter Coyote).</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The charm of <i>
			Bon Voyage</i> is in its dapper dialogue, sparkling wit, marvelous, 
			historically-sensitive production design (Catherine Leterrier) and 
			fluid camera work (veteran Thierry Arbogast), and delicious, 
			well-orchestrated movement that teems throughout the feature. There 
			are a handful of widescreen exteriors that evoke the desertion of 
			Paris and the overwhelmed masses in Southern France as the German 
			invasion commences; they're breathtaking on their own merits, but 
			help to frame the <i>Bon Voyage</i>'s frantic pacing. Early in the 
			film, the young Frédéric, called to the aid of the gossip-repellant 
			movie star (who prefers Jeanne Lanvin's <i>Scandale</i> perfume to 
			the real thing), finds himself caught in a rainstorm in someone 
			else's car with a broken windshield wiper. Circumstances preclude 
			him from contacting the authorities about the dead body in the car's 
			trunk, yet fate causes him to swerve, hit a police call box, the 
			have the boot lid pop open. Quite amusing.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Oblivious to the 
			headlines that scream of the impending war, Vivianne goes about with 
			her self-serving agenda, leaving Frédéric in jail (writing his 
			novel), and eventually heading south to the relatively safe haven of 
			Bordeaux. There, the entire cast comically stagger over each other 
			in the escalating tales of murderer-set-free (and the vengeful dead 
			man's nephew who pushes this chapter to a wild melee in the posh 
			Hotel Splendide dining room), German spies chasing after a secret 
			chemical weapon (wherein newsman Winckler shows his true stripes), 
			upper class &quot;humilation&quot; (i.e., more vindictive lies and generally 
			harmless evasions by the faux-faced Vivianne), and 
			love-among-the-ruins (in which Camille removes her glasses and shows 
			what an intelligent, stunning young woman she is) that populate the 
			second half of the film.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film's 
			well-orchestrated climax finds the German espionage network hot on 
			the trail of Camille, her mentor, Professor Kopolski (Jean-Marc 
			Stehlé), and their precious cargo attempting to flee to safety in 
			England, but forced through capitulating French authorities to 
			bypass more than one political roadblocks. Nothing a head-butt and 
			friendly chit-chat can't help overcome. Within such an abundance of 
			intertwined drama, Rappeneau has tossed in an ample dose of comedy. 
			&quot;Many comedies collide—the comedy of power, the comedy of personal 
			interests, the comedy of love,&quot; Rappeneau offers in the film's press 
			materials.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Bon Voyage</i> 
			is a film drenched in rich character and drunk with the buffoonery 
			of life amid chaos and circumstance. It's a rousing Gallic gem.</font></p>
