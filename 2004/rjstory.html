            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 2 January 2004</i></font><p>
			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Despite a uniquely captivating 
			setting and the reassuring presence of Toni Collette (<i>About a Boy</i>,
			<i>The Sixth Sense</i>), <i>Japanese Story</i> never feels 
			convincing enough to be engaging. </font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Cinematographer Ian Baker's (<i>A 
			Cry in the Dark</i>) breathtaking images of the rugged and 
			forbidding Western Australian landscape -- specifically the desert 
			region known as the Pilbara -- only seem to emphasize that the 
			humans in this film aren't as interesting the hills and wastelands.
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The people in this tale seem to 
			fight or fall in love on cue. Any viewer whose watch stops during a 
			screening of this can reset it by synchronizing it with the plot.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Collette plays a brusque, 
			no-nonsense geologist named Sandy Edwards, who has the thankless 
			task of carting around Japanese businessman named Tachibana 
			Hiromitsu (Gotaro Tsunashima). Tachibana is visiting the region for 
			more than a simple vacation, and Sandy's associates hope to strike a 
			lucrative pact with Tachibana's crew.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If the matter were left simply 
			between the two of them, no deal would be struck. Sandy speaks no 
			Japanese, and Tachibana's English is limited, although it's doubtful 
			he'd speak much even if he were fluent in the language. When he's 
			calling home on his cel phone, he complains about her loud, butch 
			behavior. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Needless to say, it's not love at 
			first sight.</font></p>
			<p style="text-indent:0in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Because of 
			his insistence on seeing the most remote landmarks, the two wind up 
			with their vehicle stuck in a sinkhole. After the two finally work 
			together long enough to get back on the road, they start bonding. 
			From here, a thin but mildly interesting setup quickly goes south.
			</font></p>
			<p style="text-indent:0in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The mishaps 
			that happen when they are both in and out of love seem irritatingly 
			telegraphed. After a few minutes, it gets tiring guessing what the 
			characters discover about each other or even what their next lines 
			will be.</font></p>
			<p style="text-indent:0in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The nudity 
			doesn't help. While Collette and Tsunashima at least look committed, 
			it seems more of an act of desperation, as if screenwriter Alison 
			Tilson and director Sue Brooks had run out of ways to show the two 
			were hitting it off despite the fact that Tachibana is married.
			</font></p>
			<p style="text-indent:0in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">True, 
			movies like <i>Monster's Ball</i> and <i>Last Tango in Paris</i> 
			needed the sex scenes in order to be effective. But <i>Japanese 
			Story</i> never really achieves the intellectual or visceral weight 
			to lead viewers to believe that its couple has teamed up for any 
			reason other than boredom.</font></p>
			<p style="text-indent:0in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It seems 
			like a cheap shot to compare this flick with Sofia Coppola's <i>Lost 
			in Translation</i>, but with both films feature <i>Brief Encounter</i>-like 
			relationships and cultural clashes and share 2003 release dates.
			</font></p>
			<p style="text-indent:0in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">One of the 
			things that made <i>Lost in Translation</i> work was the 
			writer-director's loose, improvisational approach. She made the 
			eventual boding between Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson appear 
			unaffected and natural. It is preordained, but it doesn't feel like 
			it. </font></p>
			<p style="text-indent:0in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Coppola 
			also managed to achieve more emotional peaks by leaving her actors' 
			clothes on. There's more passion in Coppola's longing than in Brooks 
			and Tilson's consummation. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The final act of <i>Japanese Story</i> 
			seems to be Brooks and Tilson's attempt at jolting viewers, but it 
			rings false and fits poorly with what came before. Tilson does 
			deserve some credit for understanding Japanese social customs, and 
			there is a funny sequence where Sandy and Tachibana have the 
			misfortune of being stuck with an old man who, try as he might, 
			can't help but spout racist slips of the tongue.</font></p>
			<i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Japanese Story</font></span></i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
			is a movie I desperately wanted to like. After all, it has won 
			dozens of awards back in its native Australia and has been 
			omnipresent on the festival circuit. Nonetheless, on this side of 
			the Pacific, it goes over about as well as Yahoo Serious and 
			vegemite. </font></span></td>
