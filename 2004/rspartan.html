            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 13 March 2004</i></font><p>
			<font face="Verdana" size="5">You are they&nbsp; </font></p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;You had your whole life to 
			prepare for this moment. Why aren't you ready?&quot; Poor Curtis (Derek 
			Luke). How could he be ready for this question, leveled by special 
			ops trainer Robert Scott (Val Kilmer), at the moment Curtis pauses, 
			breathless and sweaty after chasing a scampering energizer bunny of 
			a target, Sergeant Black (Tia Texada), through the woods for miles? 
			Scott sighs, smirks a little, and offers a challenge: &quot;If your 
			mission is to quit, then do it now.&quot; Curtis sucks it up, taking off 
			once more in pursuit of the young sergeant now sprinting into the 
			trees. </font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Curtis' perseverance, not to 
			mention his marked desire to please, makes him a superior recruit, a 
			man who will not quit. It also makes him a likely subject for David 
			Mamet. In <i>Spartan</i>, the writer-director extends his famous 
			preoccupation with masculine preoccupations into the murky workings 
			of the U.S. government. Within this milieu, the film argues, 
			toughness is measured not by innovation or creativity, but by 
			obedience. Real men respect the chain of command, in part because it 
			complicates responsibility: the men who wield guns, mount assaults, 
			and kill people are not the men who give the orders. Violence is 
			abstracted then, its effects removed from both agents and 
			administrators. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At once topical and complex, this 
			setting is apt for Mamet, celebrated for his contemplations of male 
			privileges and frailties, including <i>House of Games</i> (1987), <i>
			Homicide</i> (1991), <i>The Spanish Prisoner</i> (1998). The focus 
			on <i>Spartan</i> is the taciturn, self-possessed Scott, whose lack 
			of moral accountability begins to give way when he's assigned to 
			sort out an impossibly convoluted case. At the top of his 
			profession, a lifer with no compunctions, Scott is called on to find 
			Laura Newton (Kirsten Bell), missing daughter of the man who appears 
			to be the president. Kidnapped from her residence at Harvard, the 
			girl (as in, &quot;We need the girl,&quot; &quot;The girl is in the house,&quot; and 
			&quot;Where's the girl?&quot;) seems to be in the hands of sex-slave traders 
			with a penchant for blonds, en route (&quot;in the pipeline&quot;) to Dubai. 
			The U.S. operatives hope to find her before classes start again on 
			Monday, when the situation will be transformed, in their clever 
			phrasing, to &quot;Meet the press.&quot; </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Scott takes the assignment without 
			hesitation, perhaps stirred (it's hard to tell, he's so stoic) by 
			the suggestion that his work will be &quot;off the meter.&quot; This phrasing 
			by Burch (Ed O'Neill), suggests that he recognizes in Scott the man 
			he needs: &quot;I need a man, a man who can unquestioningly follow 
			orders.&quot; Scott's that man: &quot;The door is closed,&quot; he says, meaning 
			that they are literally alone in a closet and, more importantly, 
			that good soldier Scott is not anticipating the subterfuges and 
			betrayals to come. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Such cryptic man talk is famously 
			Mamet's specialty. And, as is often the case, William H. Macy (as 
			Burch's second, Stoddard) delivers such dialogue as if it is from 
			another planet, which makes it simultaneously endearing and 
			chilling. That's not to say that Kilmer doesn't do well, though as 
			he's on screen for most of the picture, he has a lot more of it to 
			handle, and some of it just turns silly: &quot;I ain't a planner. I ain't 
			a thinker,&quot; he spits, &quot;I never wanted to be&quot;; or, when he's seeking 
			cover from his own men, &quot;You gotta get me to the tall corn&quot;; or once 
			more, to Curtis, who's asking too many questions, &quot;You gotta set 
			your motherfucker to receiver.&quot; (Throughout the movie, Luke's 
			insistent, subtle warmth sets Curtis apart from his fellow global 
			warriors, as he's not so adept at lying through his teeth; he's also 
			given to a weird kind of faith, as when he reports to his superior 
			officer that he's seen &quot;the sign,&quot; which has particular meaning 
			here, as well as evident metaphorical meaning.) </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Repeatedly and helpfully, the 
			language in <i>Spartan</i> distracts from its pedestrian, if 
			moderately oblique, &quot;thriller&quot; plot. This takes Scott and Curtis 
			from one isolated location to the next, as they almost find the girl 
			but just miss her time after time. Some of these turns feel familiar 
			from other movies (or even tv's <i>24</i>), as when Scott kidnaps a 
			prisoner, Tariq Asani (Saïd Taghmaoui), who has connections to the 
			slave trade. That Tariq is impressed by Scott's frankly incredible 
			brutality suggests that, as &quot;evil&quot; as he and his compatriots are 
			supposed to be, the U.S.-trained soldier is more monstrous, or at 
			least more ingenious. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Other plot turns are more odiously 
			preposterous, as identities of enemies and friendlies become 
			increasingly unclear. One involves a saving grace embodied by 
			international (here Swedish) reporters (this <i>Three Days of the 
			Condor</i>-ish faith in the press to do right when governments do 
			not seems almost quaint). Another odd changeup involves a female 
			Secret Service Agent, who accosts Scott with a moral mission (as 
			opposed to the missions he had in mind, either to quit or not). As 
			they dance around the issue of who's doing what to whom, she stops 
			Scott short: &quot;There is no they, you are they.&quot; </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At this point, Scott's own sense of 
			who's who is pretty much destroyed: he starts to wonder if maybe he 
			is they. And so, the movie's primary question shifts, from &quot;Where's 
			the girl?&quot; to &quot;Who are they?&quot; As this pronoun gaming becomes more 
			compelling than the action that sets it up, the men, by definition 
			in Mamet, can't know who they are. </font></td>
