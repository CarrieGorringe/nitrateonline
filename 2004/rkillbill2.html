            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../kj.html" target="_top">KJ Doughton</a>, 16 April 2004</i></font><p><b>
			<font face="Verdana" size="2">In <i>Kill Bill Vol. 1</i>, Uma 
			Thurman’s Bride hacked her way through half of an elite killing 
			group known as the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DiVAS).&nbsp; Her 
			vengeful mission? To kill Bill (David Carradine), cruel leader of 
			the team and the man who fired a bullet into her brain four years 
			prior.&nbsp; <i>Kill Bill Vol. 2</i> chronicles The Bride’s continued 
			blood-spattered climb up DiVAS’ criminal hierarchy, working towards 
			its top man.&nbsp; Once a member of Bill’s elite assassin team herself, 
			she knows that other ex-colleagues must also be dispensed of, like 
			Michael Madsen’s bloated Budd (AKA Sidewinder) and Daryl Hannah’s 
			lanky lady pirate Elle Driver (AKA California Mountain Snake).</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The second <i>Kill Bill</i> 
			installment revisits The Bride’s fevered quest, and also resolves 
			the teasing plot points left dangling from part one. For instance, 
			what has become of The Bride’s daughter?&nbsp; What does Bill look like? 
			And why exactly did he shoot The Bride and leave her for dead during 
			a wedding rehearsal in El Paso, Texas so many years ago?&nbsp; </font>
			</p>
			<p><font face="Verdana"><i><font size="2">Kill Bill Vol. 2</font></i><font size="2"> 
			immediately answers the last question in its opening black and white 
			scenes, showing The Bride preparing her wedding to an 
			underachieving, Texas record store proprietor.&nbsp; Bill crashes the 
			chapel rehearsal, revealing himself as a suave, flute-playing gent 
			with cowboy boots and a loaded revolver.&nbsp; Resentful of his 
			ex-lover’s plans for getting hitched to another man, the boss’ cruel 
			streak goes into overdrive as he and other DiVA crewmembers massacre 
			the rehearsal congregation.</font></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After this lengthy prologue, the 
			film launches us forward in time, picking up after The Bride’s rude 
			awakening from a four-year coma and her brutal extermination of DiVA 
			assassins O-Ren Ishi (Lucy Liu) and Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), 
			as depicted in <i>Vol. 1</i>.&nbsp; By the time her saga is over, 
			Thurman’s heroine will endure a shotgun’s blast of rock salt, a live 
			burial, and the most knockdown, drag-out womano-a-womano catfight 
			ever filmed.&nbsp; Meanwhile, viewers will revisit her early training at 
			the hands of Chinese kung fu master Pei Mei (Gordon Liu), where she 
			is taught the Five-Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique, a deadly 
			combat move that The Bride will later use to her advantage on more 
			than one occasion. Thurman conveys each emotion on this 
			rollercoaster journey with equally convincing effect, whether it be 
			the claustrophobic horror of being buried six feet under in a 
			pine-box coffin, or the surprised joy of discovering a long-lost 
			love.&nbsp; </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meanwhile, <i>Kill Bill Vol. 2</i> 
			is full of magnetic villains, complex cartoons who wax philosophical 
			one minute, then gouge out the eyes of their opponents the next. 
			This intelligent volatility generates a sustained suspense 
			throughout the movie. Even during its most delicate or seemingly 
			benign moments, the threat of danger hums like an electrical current 
			throughout <i>Kill Bill</i>.&nbsp; Take Daryl Hannah’s Elle Driver, who 
			almost makes one forget Charlize Theron’s Oscar-snagging turn as 
			Eileen Wuornos in <i>Monster</i>. Director Quentin Tarantino 
			completely extracts the tentative sweetness that Hannah brought to
			<i>Roxanne</i> and <i>Splash</i>, replacing it with the nasty, 
			hardened heart of a traitor willing to poison her mentor, or sick a 
			snake on a one-time squeeze. All golden hair, rock-star smoker’s 
			lips, and black eye patch, Hannah’s statuesque witch permanently 
			burns her scowl into viewers’ brains.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Madsen is equally good as Budd, the 
			trailer-inhabiting bouncer employed at a Barstow, California strip 
			club so empty and remote that there’s no one around to bounce. 
			Wasting away in a desert hovel where he drinks margaritas from glass 
			canning jars, Budd still has the attuned, hyper-vigilant senses of a 
			wary wolf.&nbsp;&nbsp; This bloated brother of Bill – long since estranged 
			from the sibling over a woman – can sniff out a silent stalker and 
			pelt her with a blast of firepower to the chest.&nbsp; Shades of Madsen’s 
			sinister Reservoir Dog Mr. Blonde, Budd is a playful torture artist. 
			“Wakey, wakey, eggs and bakey,” he croons, rousing an enemy from 
			sleep only to bury her alive moments later.&nbsp; Using silent, subtle 
			tongue movements and squints, Madsen cues us into the fact that 
			Budd’s pickled synapses are still firing, without giving away 
			exactly which sinister thoughts are twisting in his brain.&nbsp; Like all 
			of Tarantino’s best villains, Budd’s unpredictable, sickly-sweet 
			creepiness is both funny and terrifying.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The malevolent spirit of 
			Carradine’s Bill towered over <i>Kill Bill Vol. 1</i>, even though 
			his face was never shown.&nbsp; A hand caressing a sword case, and his 
			eloquent, menacing voice were enough to paint him larger-than-life.&nbsp; 
			This time around, Carradine and Tarantino throw viewers a curve ball 
			and break the rules, showing the ruthless man’s redeemable human 
			side while reminding us of his violent capabilities. In one amazing 
			scene, Carradine makes sandwich assembly seem both artful and 
			intimidating, dipping his knife into mustard then slicing off bread 
			crusts the way he might carve up a victim, waxing philosophical 
			about life and death all the while.&nbsp; Bill emerges as the film’s most 
			complex character, a man who regrets his past, even as he 
			realistically faces up to it.&nbsp; “I over-reacted,” Bill tells The 
			Bride, explaining why he shot her in the head.&nbsp; “There are 
			consequences to breaking the heart of a murderous bastard.” All the 
			while, his self-defense skills equal those of Carradine’s seventies 
			television hero Caine, from <i>Kung Fu.</i> </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Cinemaphiles will have a field day 
			dissecting which movies Tarantino has lifted from, referenced, and 
			paid homage to <i>in Kill Bill Vol 2</i>. Ever since film critics 
			cried foul over his alleged cribbing of&nbsp; the <i>Reservoir Dogs</i> 
			heist plot from Ringo Lam’s obscure Chinese actioner <i>City on Fire</i>, 
			viewers have delighted in determining the inspirations for the 
			director’s subsequent films, scenes, and characters.&nbsp; An obvious 
			influence on <i>Kill Bill</i> is Japanese shockmeister Takashi Miike. 
			No only did <i>Volume 1</i>’s bodyguard Go Go resemble a similar 
			schoolgirl-assassin from Miike’s <i>Fudoh – The Next Generation</i>, 
			but a scene from the second <i>Bill</i> outing, filmed from inside a 
			toilet bowl, has much in common with a potty shot from <i>City of 
			Lost Souls</i>. (Fortunately, Tarantino spares us the floating turds 
			that framed Miike’s version.)&nbsp; </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana"><i><font size="2">Kill Bill Vol. 1</font></i><font size="2"> 
			was a pure action movie, in love with collisions of violent 
			movement.&nbsp; <i>Vol. 2</i> relaxes the pace, allowing for extended 
			monologues.&nbsp; Those who lamented the first film’s lack of wicked word 
			exchanges should delight in Carradine’s final soliloquy, which 
			touches on everything from the life and death struggle of a goldfish 
			to the mythology of Superman. </font></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">From the adrenaline-spewing 
			swordplay of his movie’s's first half, Tarantino ultimately spins a 
			tale of love, reflection, and parenthood. The director is everything 
			that Hollywood cinema needs right now, able to find art in seemingly 
			antiquated genres and toss out fresh images the way Spiderman shoots 
			webs. <i>Kill Bill</i> finds Tarantino at the top of his 
			rebel-rousing game, with both guns blazing and taking no prisoners.</font></p>
