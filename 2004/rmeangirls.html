			<a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 21 May 2004</i></font><p>
			<font face="Verdana" size="5">New Meat </font></p>

			</blockquote>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When Cady (Lindsay Lohan) attends 
			her first day of high school, she's shaken to see just how strictly 
			the other kids adhere to their habits. This leads to one of <i>Mean 
			Girls</i>' repeated metaphors: as she's spent her childhood being 
			home-schooled by her anthropologist parents in Africa, Cady 
			envisions her new classmates as inhabitants of a &quot;wild&quot; habitat. 
			Under her narration, they turn into subjects in a Discovery Channel 
			special, scampering, growling, and pouncing, as if scrapping for 
			access to the water hole.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Chicago burbs, it turns out, 
			are not so different from Cady's previous experience. Still, her 
			ability to read social signs is somewhat less acute than she once 
			assumed. Luckily, she's soon adopted by fellow mavericks, lesbian 
			goth Janis (Lizzy Caplin) and flamingly gay Damian (Daniel Franzese). 
			They helpfully draw her a virtual map of the cafeteria terrain, 
			pointing out the &quot;Asian nerds,&quot; the &quot;Varsity Jocks,&quot; the &quot;Cool 
			Asians,&quot; the &quot;Unfriendly Black Hotties.&quot; Looking out over her new 
			environment, Cady wonders whether she will ever fit in. Looking with 
			her, you can only hope she doesn't. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Most aggressive among the packs, à 
			la the Heathers, are the Plastics, comprised of Queen Bee Regina 
			(Rachel McAdams) and her wannabe minions Gretchen (Lacey Chabert) 
			and Karen (Amanda Seyfried). When Regina takes a liking to &quot;new 
			meat&quot; Cady, Janis and Damien send her forth on a mission, to 
			infiltrate the enemy pod and return with information. Little does 
			Cady know that Janis has a personal history with Regina (&quot;She's a 
			life ruiner!&quot; hisses Janis), or that she will develop her own 
			personal investment, in the form of a crush on Aaron (Jonathan 
			Bennett), Regina's ex. Of course, as soon as Regina perceives this 
			interest, Uber-mean-girl immediately re-possesses Aaron, apparently 
			so malleable before her wiles that you might wonder just what Cady 
			sees in him. (And then the camera grants a lingering, Cady's point 
			of view shot of his beautiful face, and you know what's set her 
			young heart a-quiver.) </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As <i>Mean Girls</i> is fond of 
			pointing out, high school mating rituals resemble those of the 
			African savannah. Cady's multiple efforts -- to please Damien and 
			Janis, exact revenge on Regina, and attract Aaron's attention -- are 
			convoluted and daunting. In Girl World, Cady soon learns, power is 
			primal and morality is inverted: lying to get what you want is a 
			time-honored tradition, ensuring a rival's public humiliation a 
			triumph of social skills. In Girl World, you learn early how to get 
			what you want: Cady's initiation involves a visit to Regina's home, 
			where she's shocked to see Regina's younger sister shaking her 
			skinny little white booty in sync with Kelis' &quot;Milkshake&quot; video. 
			This performance -- the child acting out an excessively 
			self-confident, and notably black female, sexuality -- alarms Cady 
			at first, though she will soon learn how to adorn her own body for 
			similar display. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In Girl World, Cady learns the 
			value of sabotage (convincing Regina that a foot cream is a face 
			cream backfires: &quot;All we've done is make Regina's face smell like a 
			foot!&quot;) and manipulation (pretending to be bad at math, in order to 
			convince Aaron to tutor her: &quot;All the work is right,&quot; observes her 
			teacher skeptically, &quot;Just the answers are wrong&quot;). &quot;It may look 
			like I've become a bitch,&quot; Cady reassures in voice-over, &quot;But that's 
			only because I'm acting like a bitch.&quot; </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Directed by Mark Waters (Lohan's <i>
			Freaky Friday</i> director), Tina Fey's script (based on Rosalind 
			Wiseman's <i>Queen Bees and Wannabes: Helping Your Daughter Survive 
			Cliques, Gossip, Boyfriends and Other Realities of Adolescence</i>, 
			a self-help book for mothers, a concept that only exacerbates the 
			convoluted process of typing teens as objects of study) reveals the 
			many ways that kids mimic even as they resist &quot;grownup&quot; behaviors. 
			The girls' phone conversations, arranged in split screens to 
			showcase their deviousness at any given moment, build to weird 
			little climaxes, for instance, the discovery of a third party 
			(another girl) listening in, and so some dire secret has been 
			revealed. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The girls' increasingly bad 
			behavior tends to cow adults in the vicinity: Regina's insecure 
			mother (Amy Poehler) only wants to maintain her youth (which she 
			sees in a faux connection with her daughter, who overtly resents and 
			reviles her); math teacher Ms. Norbury (Fey) tries to maintain her 
			distance (even as she sees that Cady is a math whiz who should put 
			out for the school team, made up of nerdy boys who'd love to have a 
			girl along); and principal Mr. Duvall (Tim Meadows) occasionally 
			takes up a Joe-Clarkish baseball bat in his efforts to maintain a 
			mostly superficial order. His complete inability to control or even 
			anticipate anything that happens around him (&quot;The girls have gone 
			wild!&quot; wails one supposed monitor, as the camera pans absolute chaos 
			in the hallways) only underlines the film's central point: unhappy, 
			confused kids grow up to be unhappy, confused adults. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The struggle for Cady, as for <i>
			Heathers</i>' Veronica (Wynona Ryder) before her, involves the 
			discovery of her own decently girlish identity. By the time she 
			comes to worry about lying to everyone from her parents to her 
			friends to the deftly ironic Ms. Norbury, Cady's options appear 
			limited. She's no longer a designing interloper in Girl World, but a 
			full-fledged member. As per generic conventions, Cady will figure it 
			out. But this familiar story is helped considerably by the fact that 
			her figuring is framed by Fey's snarky worldview. In Girl World, as 
			in any feral environment, &quot;When you get bitten by a snake, you're 
			supposed to suck the poison out.&quot; </font></p>
