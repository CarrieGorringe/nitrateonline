            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>My Baby's Daddy</i> is one of 
			the first new movies of the year, and it's an inauspicious start. 
			Miramax appears to be doing a hit-and-run release of this in the 
			theaters, just as they did last year with <i>DysFunktional Family</i>, 
			the Eddie Griffin stand-up comedy movie. Griffin is in this new 
			picture, as well, but his scenes appear to have been pared down 
			considerably, as if someone got concerned that, with his large 
			eyeglasses, dazed look, and nasal dialogue delivery, he might 
			suddenly turn into Urkel from <i>Family Matters</i>.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Griffin, Anthony Anderson and 
			Michael Imperioli play three Philadelphia guys, friends since 
			childhood, whose girlfriends all get pregnant and have babies at the 
			same time. Rather than get married, the three guys begin sharing the 
			responsibilities and duties of parenting the new offspring. This 
			leads to many scenes involving many jokes about pee-pee, caca, and 
			women's breasts -- fact, that seems to be what ALL the jokes in the 
			movie are about. However, as it rounds the final lap towards the 
			finish, the picture goes all earnest as it shows the three men 
			having to face the fact that they're no longer &quot;players&quot; but 
			fathers, which wouldn't be so bad if the men didn't sound more 
			infantile than the kids.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film, in its present state 
			(there is much indication, with regards to characters, plot points, 
			and character motivations coming out of nowhere, that the film has 
			made many trips back and forth to the editing room), doesn't so much 
			as progress from scene to scene as move from bit to bit -- some of 
			the scenes look more like skits, and unfinished ones at that. The 
			relentlessly crude humor in the context of raising babies becomes 
			genuinely off-putting (rather like the creepy, off-color jokes that 
			kept turning up in last year's &quot;family&quot; entertainments like <i>
			Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas</i> and the grotesque film version 
			of <i>The Cat in the Hat</i>), but the film also traffics in naked 
			racial stereotyping, particularly in its presentation of the Asian 
			family belonging to the girl (Bai Ling) hooked up with Anderson's 
			character. (By contrast, there is no satirizing whatsoever of 
			whatever family Michael Imperioli's character has.) The girlfriend 
			of Griffin's character is frankly presented as a, ahem, slut, as if 
			sluttishness were funny in and of itself (and we're also supposed to 
			get off on it, too). Vulgarity has its place, and there's nothing 
			wrong with asking guys to take responsibility for their actions, but 
			the tone of the film is so cruddy that, if this is about as well as 
			the film can do towards giving the characters something funny and 
			worthwhile to do, why should we be asked to hold it in any high 
			regard when the film wants us to take them seriously in the end? The 
			guys have been, literally, dumped on (there are spit-up jokes, too) 
			for most of the film's duration.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">During the first nine minutes of <i>
			DysFunktional Family</i>, Eddie Griffin jokes about the airliners 
			used in the September 11 terrorist attacks, Osama bin Laden, 
			hostages in the Middle East, and how blacks have been &quot;hostages&quot; in 
			America for &quot;450 years.&quot; As the film cuts to show audience members 
			chortling madly, Griffin proceeds to talk about women's &quot;juicy 
			asses,&quot; paddling a girl on the behind during a &quot;family reunion,&quot; 
			Michael Jackson being physically beaten by his father, and how 
			Griffin's own mother used to physically beat him. (And that, gentle 
			reader, is where I draw the line.) Griffin also incessantly uses a 
			derogatory word for African-Americans during his routine, justifying 
			it by saying that the more you use it, the less power the word has. 
			(No, it just makes you sound ignorant and inarticulate, and, 
			besides, Richard Pryor had something to say about THAT in his 1982
			<i>Sunset Strip</i> concert film, and nothing Griffin says makes me 
			want to think otherwise.) With its crude descriptions of breast milk 
			and its anything-for-a-laugh scene where, through the magic of CGI, 
			infants are shown talking as dirty as the adults do, I still don't 
			think that the problem with <i>My Baby's Daddy</i> is that the 
			filmmakers are being insensitive or are stooping to deliberately 
			work with such low material, but, rather, that they consider this to 
			be the best they can do -- the jokes and characters and situations, 
			however tasteless they may be, are considered to be perfectly 
			presentable and acceptable. Whatever this may indicate with regards 
			to the lowering of standards in our society I will leave to others 
			to deliberate. In the meanwhile: if you don't like it, don't laugh.</font></td>
