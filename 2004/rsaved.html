            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 4 June 2004</i></font><p>
			<font face="Verdana" size="5">God only knows </font></p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I've been born again my whole 
			life,&quot; says 17-year-old Mary (Jena Malone) at the start of <i>Saved!</i> 
			For her, such longstanding faith translates to self-confidence, a 
			sense of knowing where she's headed, always. About to be a senior at 
			American Eagle Christian High School, Mary's feeling extra blessed 
			to be playing keyboards with the Girl Gang for Jesus (better known 
			as the Christian Jewels) and in virginal love with her beautiful 
			boyfriend Dean (Chad Faust). </font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As <i>Saved!</i> is a high school 
			romantic comedy refitted to poke moderate fun at Christian 
			evangelism, Mary will, in short order, endure a crisis involving 
			sex. Specifically, it involves generous, loving sex, bestowed by 
			Mary on Dean in an effort to dissuade him from believing he's gay. 
			Her rationale is at once crazy and understandable: Dean outs himself 
			as he and Mary are frolicking underwater in a swimming pool. So 
			startled by his confession, Mary hallucinates a visitation from 
			Jesus Himself, urging her to &quot;save&quot; poor Dean; she reads this 
			counsel as a mission, and plops herself upon poor Dean, who rushes 
			to hide his gay porn mag when she arrives unannounced in his 
			bedroom, then goes through the proper motions. When Dean can't give 
			up his magazines after all, his parents send him off to a Christian 
			&quot;treatment facility,&quot; and Mary faces senior year without her boy, 
			and pregnant. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">She takes the obvious decision, to 
			hide her swelling belly under increasingly big sweaters, several 
			adorned with Christmas or Easter decals, as the film is clunkily 
			organized around &quot;holidays&quot; (&quot;Lucky for me,&quot; Mary says, &quot;Pregnancy 
			was about as common as the flesh-eating virus; no one knew what it 
			was&quot;). That her mother Lillian (Mary-Louise Parker) doesn't pick up 
			on her daughter's changing body appears to be the result of her own 
			distraction, an illicit (unmarried) relationship with the high 
			school's high-on-Jesus principal, Pastor Skip (Martin Donovan). 
			(He's introduced literally back-flipping onto the auditorium stage, 
			pumping his crowd: &quot;Are you down with the G.O.D.?&quot;) Skip and Lillian 
			feel guilty about their mutual desire, but they also can't quite 
			figure out how come it feels so good. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Their dilemma mirrors that of the 
			kids, of course, as poor Mary embodies so sweetly, so earnestly, and 
			so intelligently. &quot;Why would God make everyone different if He 
			wanted us all to be the same?&quot; she asks, and even the baby 
			evangelicals are beginning to feel her pain. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Toward the end of resolving this 
			dilemma within 92 minutes, for Mary anyway, <i>Saved!</i> provides 
			her with an appropriate second object of affection, Pastor Skip's 
			skateboarding champion son Patrick (Patrick Fugit). As he identifies 
			Mary as a principled outcast amongst the less than self-reliant 
			lambs, Patrick takes it upon himself to &quot;save&quot; her, by way of asking 
			her on a date. Also vying for Patrick's attention is Mary's &quot;best 
			friend&quot; and the film's anti-goody-two-shoes, Hilary Faye (Mandy 
			Moore, working against that sticky image established in <i>A Walk to 
			Remember</i>). </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Though she premises her Miss 
			Popularity title on frequent and very visible declarations of faith, 
			Hilary Faye is as mean a girl as ever walked a high school movie 
			hallway. And the movie uses her to its best advantage: at once 
			supercilious and insecure, she's the poster girl for self-serving 
			Christianity. And indeed, the film has part of its most fun with 
			her. &quot;I'm saving myself until marriage,&quot; she announces during the 
			girls' target practice at the Emmanuel Shooting Range (promotional 
			tagline: &quot;An Eye for an Eye&quot;), &quot;And I'll use force if necessary.&quot;
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The other students ritually quake 
			at such pronouncements, and Hilary Faye knows how to use her clout 
			to get what she wants; among her most dedicated acolytes are Tia 
			(Heather Matarazzo) and Veronica (Elizabeth Thai), both dyeing their 
			hair blond to match their idol's, and pleased when Mary's moved 
			&quot;out&quot; of favor as they can scurry in to fill her spot. Mary, for her 
			part, has some help in her resistance from Hilary Faye's brother 
			Roland (Macaulay Culkin). In a wheelchair since a childhood accident 
			(he reports that Hilary Faye calls it a &quot;miracle&quot; that she found him 
			at the base of the tree from which he fell), Roland is as cynical as 
			his sister is pious (that is, both front at least a little). Though 
			she has purchased and drives a van equipped to accommodate Roland's 
			chair, she resents him mightily, asking why he has to &quot;make people 
			feel so awkward about your differently abledness.&quot; While she speaks 
			the language, she hasn't quite grasped the concept. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Where Hilary Faye sees a chance at 
			small-pound power in each one of American Eagle's religious 
			spectacles, Roland tends to observe from a distance. During one of 
			these moments -- he's escaped the auditorium for a breather outside 
			-- he meets the new girl, Cassandra (Eva Amurri), the film's other 
			beam of energetic light school's only &quot;Jewess,&quot; fond of dramatic 
			goth makeup, cigarettes, and tucking up her skirt. Struck by one 
			another's perceptible outsiderness, Roland and Cassandra start a 
			romance, sexy, smart, and among the film's most compelling 
			relationships; she brings out his rebelliousness, even outfits her 
			car so he can drive it, and he offers her devotion. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Rather like Roland, <i>Saved!</i> 
			is stuck at the level of observation. Directed by Brian Dannelly, 
			and written by Dannelly and Michael Urban, the film's comedy is 
			restrained, more concerned with referencing the high school movie 
			clichés (the girl spats, the fumbling adults, the ridicule of 
			airheaded hotties and elevation of thoughtful dissenters, the diva's 
			comeuppance, and, of course, the prom showdown) that it loses track 
			of its initial focus on this question of what it means to be 
			&quot;saved.&quot; </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Or maybe more specifically, what it 
			means to be in the business of saving, which has preoccupied 
			institutional religion forever (if only to be financially solvent). 
			That religion as a business has recently discovered the youth market 
			is hardly surprising, and neither is it that the high school movie 
			formula combines with this particular object of parody so easily. 
			The fears that make kids want to be saved are everywhere on display 
			in <i>Saved!</i>: absent parents, sexual mythologies, demonization 
			of others, isolation and alienation. That the movie does offer some 
			viable alternatives to spiritual and moral conformity -- in the 
			shapes of families, in sexual preference and differently abled sex 
			-- is to its credit. That it does so within a nice-girls win, 
			bad-girls suffer formula, is less imaginative.</font></td>
