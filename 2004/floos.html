</font><i><font size="1" face="Verdana">interview by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan 
Lybarger</a>, 7 May 2003</font></i></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Anita Loos (1888-1981) made a name for 
herself at a time when most of her fellow screenwriters were toiling in 
anonymity and few women were part of the workforce. She started writing scripts 
for D.W. Griffith in the early silent era and continued to work well after sound 
films became the standard.</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">She also wrote plays, and her novel <i>
Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</i> (1925) created an international sensation. It 
inspired not one but two films, the second of which practically immortalized 
Marilyn Monroe.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While Loos' name is easy to find in some 
dictionaries and encyclopedias, her actual legacy and her personal life are 
harder to determine. She cultivated a devil-may-care image that was at odds with 
her working techniques and private difficulties. She also left behind an 
enormous collection of screenplays, short stories and one act plays that have 
never seen the light of day. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Until now.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Loos' niece, Mary Anita Loos's (who is also a 
prominent writer) has unearthed volumes of her aunt's writings and has teamed up 
with <i>Without Lying Down</i> author Cari Beauchamp to edit and annotate <i>
Anita Loos Rediscovered: Film Treatments and Fiction by Anita Loos</i>. 
Beauchamp is no stranger to Loo's life and work because, Frances Marion (the 
subject of Beauchamp's previous book) was a close fiend of Anita Loos. Contacted 
at her home in Los Angeles, Beauchamp explains why Loos' work is still vital and 
entertaining and why her legacy is so important. </font></p>

<p style="text-autospace: none"><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">Dan 
Lybarger:</font></i></b><font size="2"> What excites me as a film geek is that 
the book features scripts from the Silent Era, which have not been available 
previously.&nbsp; </font></font></p>
<p style="text-autospace: none"><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">Cari 
Beauchamp:</font></i></b><font size="2">&nbsp; They are difficult to find, and even 
when you find them, they're certainly not published. It's very rare that they're 
published. I know how surprised I was even as a film historian to actually read 
the full silent scripts and realize how incredibly extensive they were. That's 
what I like about the book, too. </font></font></p>
<p style="text-autospace: none"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The first set (in 
the book), which is literally these two-page little stories, which aren't not 
scripts at all. And yet they were perfect for Griffith because that's what he 
did. He didn't use scripts. He used stories and then was truly able to control 
the direction.</font></p>
<p style="text-autospace: none"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But then as we 
move on, even in the late teens, I've been able to read scripts, for instance, 
like<i> Poor Little Rich Girl</i> and scripts for the Mary Pickford films, which 
surprised me were 50 to 60 pages long. It was very surprising, like a <i>Scarlet 
Letter</i>, of course, which was a revelation to me because it was not just a 
script as we would think, with many more stage directions than anything we would 
dare see today. A screenwriter wouldn't dare put in &quot;close-up midrange shot&quot; and 
literally do a very ornate set decoration. In the script &quot;camera cuts to 
close-up of church bells tolling,&quot; telling folks not only the director how to do 
their job, but the editor as well.&nbsp; </font></p>
<p style="text-autospace: none"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Screenwriters 
today have been humbled over the years. They wouldn't dare put things like that 
in (laughs). Or they certainly wouldn't bother because they know they'd be 
changed. </font></p>
<p style="text-autospace: none"><font face="Verdana" size="2">One of the things 
just like that in terms of and what you see in Anita's and other people's of 
that time, the writer would go write the script, and at M-G-M in the early 30s, 
it was the writer and (M-G-M production chief Irving) Thalberg. If the writer 
was a respected enough, Thalberg would call in the writer, and they would cast 
the film. This was certainly true of Anita and Frances Marion. They would cast 
to the film, and then and only then would the director be assigned. That was 
certainly true with Thalberg until his death in 1936..</font></p>
<p style="text-autospace: none"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Of course it 
wasn't until Thalberg died that the producer got credits. But even then the 
producers had much more power than the directors. And they would try to follow 
in Thalberg's footsteps of doing the same thing of having their writer turn in 
the script and then the cast and then pulling in the director. Because (the 
director) was who was available on Monday. It was very much a staple.&nbsp; </font>
</p>
<p style="text-autospace: none"><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font size="2">&nbsp; 
You can't totally dismiss the auteur theory, though. Look at Hitchcock.</font></font></p>
<p style="text-autospace: none"><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CB:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
Remember when that came in. We're talking (Andrew) Sarris, and we're talking at 
first about people who are talking about European directors. We're looking at 
late '50s early '60s for the auteur theory. That's part of the roller-coaster 
for how filmmaking has changed of the years. The director as a power doesn't 
come in until the early '60s. And then it comes to full crescendo to a fault in 
the '70s. Yes, there was Hitchcock and Lean, but those were the exceptions.
</font></font></p>

<p style="text-autospace: none"><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font size="2">&nbsp; 
How did you get the project with this new book started? </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CB:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
In the course of writing <i>Without Lying Down</i>, I was able to meet Mary 
Anita Loos, Anita's niece, and sole heir. I originally went to her because I 
knew that Anita had left occasional datebooks and things. And she and Frances 
wrote some movies together. They wrote a play together. They were friends from 
1917 on for 50 years. I knew if Mary Anita had any papers, she was then in her 
early 80s and remembered Frances, so I went to find her and spent hours going 
through papers, and we became very friendly.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And when I had finally finished my research, 
Mary Anita finally said to me, “Oh, by the way, maybe you could help me. I have 
some more papers. They don’t have anything to do with Frances.” I said, “What do 
you mean?” She said, “Anita left me boxes and boxes of her material that I’ve 
never really been through and maybe you can help me figure out what they are and 
when they were done, etc.” </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">So I made arrangements to go back to visit, and 
we spent the day going through these boxes of manuscripts, many of which were 
just a couple of pages. Many of which were fully written out plays. And then 
there were one-act plays, and there were magazine articles. It was an absolute 
treasure trove of material. So I ended up changing my schedule and spending a 
week going through all of this with her and ascertaining that some of these were 
absolute gems and that we would try to see the light of day with it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At the time it just seemed very natural to go 
to California UC Press because I knew they would appreciate what it was. I 
wouldn’t have to deal with agents or proposals or anything like that. I could 
simply tell them that we have all these papers by Anita Loos that have never 
been published before. And they knew who Anita Loos was and would appreciate 
what we were doing with it. So that’s pretty much what happened.</font></p>
<div class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center">
            <hr size="1">
            </div>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
(The one-act play) <i>It Pays to Advertise</i> had me rolling. </font></font>
</p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CB:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
Isn’t that divine? It was things like that when I was reading (the material) for 
the first time. I was just gasping and laughing. I was drawn to it for many 
reasons. One of which I had been irked a bit by Anita for presenting herself as 
this “devil-may-care” person who was “I’d do this stuff even if they didn’t pay 
me for it.” “All I do is just dash this stuff off.” I always somehow knew this 
wasn’t true. It was truly affirmed to me when I saw the multiple numbers of 
drafts in some of these boxes. The way she would go back and rewrite. </font>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">On one page, there would be a pencil (mark) and 
two colored pens. She had agonized over every word she was using. It was 
important to me to be able to present this and show the incredible care she put 
into her writing. Some of the things that never did see the light of day were 
real gems, and some were multiple variations of them. We went through them all 
and sorted them out and sorted them out again. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The other thing to me was that (the selections) 
not just that they be particularly delightful representations of her writing but 
they expand (over) 50 years of her writing so they could show the way the styles 
had changed, the way she changed. There’s some dramas in there. There’s some 
personal character portraits. The variety of types of writing she did.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
Her later stuff seems even more cynical than the early stuff. </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CB:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
So much of what she was writing about relationships she was either figuring out 
her own relationships, or if she couldn’t get the upper hand in real life, she 
could get it in her writing and in her characters.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
Like the Clark Gable character that Jeanette McDonald subdued in <i>San 
Francisco</i>.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CB:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
Exactly. Or if she cared too much in private life, in her writing she could 
pretend that she didn’t care. </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
As a guy, I’d have to say her presentation of men has a different tone than I…</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CB:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
Oh, jeez. When you take it to a certain peak, she is <i>beyond</i> cynical. I 
mean she says that all men are pimps one way or the other. All they do is use 
us, and yet she doesn’t have that much of a higher regard in her writing for 
women than she does for men.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
The one that really stuck with me was <i>It Pays to Advertise</i>. I love how 
the husband in it is absolutely worthless.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CB:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
He’s barely a straight man (laughs). It makes <i>Dinner at Eight </i>look like 
straight melodrama (both laugh).</font></font></p>
<div class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center">
            <hr size="1">
            </div>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font size="2"> I 
also liked her short story about the fellow with the philosophical pretensions 
who thinks his romance is going to be a passing thing (<i>The Heart That Has 
Truly Loved</i>). She gave it a twist ending you couldn’t get away with in a 
movie.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>CB:</i></b> She loved writing on occasion 
things that were blatantly unfilmmable. Or like <i>The Moving Pictures of 
Blinkville</i>, she could just make fun of it all (the film business). And it 
was as much therapy for herself as anything else. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
She has story about a clique of Hollywood women, and you wonder who’s she really 
talking about, especially one character who has this almost insane attraction 
toward her dog.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CB:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
It’s the great old line. “Everything is material.” And she was surrounded at the 
studio by those kind of women: the starlets and the people who were so desperate 
to get on the screen. That was the raison d’etre to just to be there no matter 
what in. No matter how.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">He tongue is so often in her cheek. It’s as if 
she’s trying to pull something off or get her little jabs in one way or another. 
She was obviously too clever for her own good sometimes, obviously. </font></p>
<div class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center">
            <hr size="1">
            </div>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
Was it difficult to write about a subject her who wasn’t always forthcoming 
about her own history?</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CB:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
Oh, no, by that time I had access (to the manuscripts). It’s frustrating in a 
way, but you see I had her own notes about what had really happened. I had her 
notes to herself about a particularly miserable New Year’s Eve when (her husband 
John) Emerson goes off with somebody else. And of course, (there were) people 
like Mary Anita, who had seen her in the throes of these depressions. So when 
you go back and read <i>A Girl Like I</i> she presents herself as this 
“devil-may-care” gamine who could care less about anything. You know it’s a 
balance in between. I’m sure there are times when she really felt that.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And yet there’s so many other things about her. 
I love that she’s this tiny little thing, who’s always at the height of fashion, 
who was so careful about those things that. You just don’t have 4’ 11” size 
three. She does all that, cares about her hair. She goes off to the spa, weighs 
106 (pounds) and freaks out because she’s so “obese.” She cares deeply about how 
she presented herself. I find that, knowing everything else about her, very 
endearing. If that was somebody else, I would find it boring; I would find it 
superficial if that was all they cared about. But with Anita, it becomes very 
endearing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
But she had plenty of reason to be cynical about men.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CB:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
But she always set herself up for being in control and then blame herself for 
being in control. Remember, one of the attractions about Anita to me is that 
she’s very much a modern day woman, and we have to remember when she was living 
at a time when these things were not accepted or even expected of women. Her 
desire for freedom, her desire for work, he friendships with other women is 
another thing I find wonderful and fascinating. For as much care as she put into 
herself, she had her criteria for women is that they didn’t take themselves too 
seriously. </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I love that she adored Marion Davies and that 
she couldn’t stand Mary Pickford. One of her best friends, of course, was 
Paulette Goddard, who was just this screen goddess. She was absolutely gorgeous. 
As long as you were smart and funny. I know women to this day who won't be 
friends with women who are that much more attractive than they are. They're just 
intimidated by another woman's good looks. And Anita never was. In some ways, 
she would have little respect for her own sex, and in other ways she adored them 
and just reveled them. She certainly loved her friendships. They were very 
important to her.</font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
In many ways, you're continuing the work you have done in <i>Without Lying Down</i>.
</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CB:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
Yeah, we're just looking at it in a different way, looking at a different 
person. But I was fortunate enough to have had that background and all that 
research already done. And my knowledge of these people, whom I affectionately 
call &quot;my dead girlfriends&quot; because I've spent so much time with them myself 
(laughs), perhaps in a perverse little way.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
Without the publication of <i>Without Lying Down</i>, it's doubtful <i>The 
American Heritage Dictionary</i> would have an entry for Frances Marion.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CB:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
The ripple effect of that book has been so fabulous on two levels: One is I 
can't believe how many people I continue to hear from who never knew these women 
once walked the earth. But also what it means to them today. I meet women who 
say I'll never feel alone again knowing that this many women (were involved in 
filmmaking). Behind me at my desk, I mean when I start going &quot;Oh, my God, what I 
am doing writing-wise, etc?&quot; I turn around and I have portraits of June Mathis, 
Frances Marion and Anita Loos behind me. I just look and go &quot;whoa, of course, I 
can do it.&quot; It's great knowing what those women give other women is quite 
wonderful. And, of course, that could happen, and I wouldn't know about it. The 
fact that I hear about it makes it all the richer. </font></font></p>

<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
You didn't go over this in the book, but it might be interesting to compare 
Clair Booth Luce's play of <i>The Women</i> to Anita Loos' script.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CB:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
It is really just fascinating, and I am just perverse enough to have sat with 
Claire's play in my lap and watched the movie. And then of course had the play 
and the (film) script next to each other. Everybody has to have a hobby 
(chuckles). I know that's weird. I've done it, and it made me appreciate Anita's 
skill all the more.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Claire's play is downright bitchy, without as 
much of the humor. The women come off as just a little more stereotyped. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Anita's main charge wasn't to change the play 
at all. Her main charge was to get it past the censors. Many of the changes were 
the double entendres, so she was the perfect choice. By 1939, Harlow, had since 
passed on by this time, but (Anita) had written six films for Harlow, who was 
the 30's queen of the double entendres. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
&quot;Can you see through this dress?&quot;</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CB:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
Exactly. Is that just not divine? &quot;Thanks. Then, I'll take it.&quot; Anita adored 
&quot;Baby&quot; as they all called her and really appreciated her and appreciated her 
skill. And appreciated the fact that Jean was &quot;I'll laugh with them. They're not 
going to laugh at me, cause I'm laughing with them.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">One of the films that's good like that is <i>
Bombshell</i>, where she literally makes fun of the characters that some people 
perceive her to be. (Anita) really loved Jean and loved writing for her. That 
was a really great match, Anita and Harlow.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Harlow wasn't used in that way. Anita hated 
couldn't stand and just hated the way she thought that (Harlow) was being used 
by her mother and stepfather. </font></p>
<div class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center">
            <hr size="1">
            </div>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font size="2"> I 
interviewed a screenwriter named Irving Brecher (<i>Meet Me in St. Louis</i>), 
who liked Anita had worked with producer Hunt Stromberg (<i>The Women</i>), and 
he praised Stromberg to the skies.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CB:</font></i></b><font size="2"> I 
mentioned in one of my essays that she adored Hunt as much as anybody after 
Thalberg. She and certainly most of the women writers worshiped Thalberg in 
large part because they felt respected by him in a way they didn't by other 
people there. They felt that even when he didn't agree with them, he listened to 
them first. That was unfortunately a rarity.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">He loved, as she affectionately called him, &quot;Stromby.&quot; 
He was without a doubt their best producer. I did love putting in the stuff 
about (producer) Bernie Hyman and (his) always changing his mind. How 
frustrating that must have been. Can you imagine if you were Anita, and here 
she's been writing movies for over 25 years, and the producer she's been working 
with turns to the secretary and says, &quot;Wait a minute. What do you think of the 
script?&quot; Anita just died, and rightly so. That was the bottom line. That's why 
she left Hollywood. It was just too insulting.</font></p>

She and Frances Marion left around the same time.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CB:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
They became script doctors. That was it.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
It was a shame because these two women really built the industry.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CB:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
And they didn't even need that acknowledgement, but they did need their work 
respected, and they didn't feel they had that. They felt used because their 
scripts weren't wanted. They were just there to doctor everybody else's, and 
after having had the power they had had, i.e. the incredible power to <i>cast</i> 
films, not just write original stories or adaptations, to pick the director of 
the film and to be on the set of their movie. It was considered to be <i>their</i> 
movie. To then be put in a writers room and produce nine pages a day or whatever 
it was or not to produce anything but to read these other things and see if you 
can punch it up. Here's Anita who's done all this stuff punching up the third <i>
Thin Man<span style="font-style:normal">.</span></i> This was not good. They 
weren't paid as much was they had been, so they left at slightly different times 
and in slightly different ways, but they both left the business.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Anita loved being a New Yorker, when she moved 
to New York, and her first play was <i>Happy Birthday </i>with Helen Hayes, 
which was a huge success, so she arrived as a successful playwright, and she 
loved that role. By then Emerson was in the sanitarium, and she was her own 
person with her own life. She had her own apartment across the street from 
Carnegie Hall and stayed there for 40 years. Thank you very much and established 
a very nice life for herself. </font></p>

It was very unusual for a screenwriter to be as public as Anita Loos was.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CB:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
It amazed me going through <i>Photoplay</i>s (of the 1920s), and the trades of 
the days mentioned them, but there were pictures of Anita Loos and Frances 
Marion in the fan magazines and in the gossipy columns. There were these pages 
of &quot;three dot&quot; journalism. &quot;Someone's doing this. Someone's doing that.&quot; So 
you'd have Greta Garbo dancing with Jack Gilbert, and then you'd have Anita Loos 
in Paris, and Frances Marion's doing this. The screenwriters got as powerful and 
played as attractively, and their pictures would be in there. The picture that 
ran in the book of Frances and Anita with going dressed in costume for a William 
Randolph Hearst costume party ran in <i>Photoplay</i>.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I was particularly pleased by the cover (of my 
book) photo, especially the way the eyes look out at you. That's one of Mary 
Anita's photos, and it was signed, &quot;Love, Auntie,&quot; which makes it particularly 
sweet. It's the one, Mary Anita kept on her desk.</font></p>

It's important to remember that Mary Anita has a formidable reputation of her 
own.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CB:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
Absolutely. And thank you for mentioning it for me. What that woman went 
through, and her story is just incredible. She was married to Richard Sale. They 
had a child, who was born at a pound and a half. Mary Anita didn't tell me about 
a lot of this. I went to the Academy (of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences) and 
found the press clippings. Here's 1948, and this tiny little blurb, and Louella 
Parsons covered Mary Anita, that this little baby had been born remarkably 
premature at only a pound and a half, and &quot;our prayers are going out to him,&quot; 
assuming that he didn't have long to live.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">He's still with us today, God love him, Edward 
is. He's in a wheelchair. He's never been able to really walk. But he's an 
incredible musician, and Richard Sale, Mary Anita's husband, proceeded, like so 
many other men in Anita's life, took to the bottle. Mary Anita arranged her life 
so that she would stop making movies with Richard. She and Richard had produced 
television and movies. So she set herself up in a little house with a swimming 
pool so that Edward could swim every day for his exercise and muscle 
development, and proceeded to writing novels, which sold millions. They were the 
first of the so-called &quot;super paperbacks.&quot; She did a trilogy of California 
trilogy with sexy pictures on the cover, and they sold millions. That's where 
her family, i.e. her and Edward, together.</font></p>

We're lucky because there are lot of writers of Anita Loos' prominence who don't 
have relatives in a position to preserve their legacies.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CB:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
That was part of the joy of this. I was going through these boxes knowing full 
well that Mary Anita's opened them and not really gone through them. Mary Anita 
made me feel really special by saying, &quot;Somehow I always knew somehow I'd always 
keep them, and someday, somehow, somebody would come along.&quot; And when (Anita) 
would write first names, I could say, &quot;This was from this; this was from a book 
published at such and such&quot; because I knew these things—don't ask me my own 
children's birthdays (laughs), but I know Mary Pickford's.&quot; In some instances I 
was struck by the pristine conditions of these manuscripts that I knew that 
Anita had kept them this neat. You could feel her almost speaking. She kept it 
this neat in the hops that somebody would find them and see them published.</font></font></p>

You described multiple drafts and even handwritten corrections.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CB:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
That's what made it a challenge, and that's how I became the &quot;lucky winner.&quot; I 
retyped them on to disk for publication. That's why I know what they are and 
where they are.</font></font></p>

Frances Marion was exceedingly lucky in that group because she had a wonderful 
relationship with Fred Thompson, but a lot of the men in Anita's life were like 
this John Emerson guy.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CB:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
In fact, when I first met Mary Anita, and we talked about Frances. Mary Anita 
had met Frances and knew her. But after she had talked about how Anita had 
respected Frances and adored her at certain levels, she also said that she was 
very jealous at Frances. In some ways that's why I was drawn to both Frances and 
Anita because one of them had one thing, and the other had another. They were 
different. Mary Anita said that at the heart of it, Anita was frankly jealous of 
Frances because of her happy home life and her ability to be so comfortable 
within her own skin. Frances knew who she was and was not as sensitive to (other 
people's opinions). Anita was more dependent on what other people felt and 
thought. </font></font></p>

And what's amazing is that she got approval from some of the most unlikely 
sources. To think that H. L. Mencken inspired her to write <i>Gentlemen Prefer 
Blondes</i>.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CB:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
The other result of <i>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</i> was that it brought these 
incredible other people into her life. She first met (Aldous) Huxley because he 
literally sent her a fan letter. As did H. G. Wells, having read <i>Gentlemen 
Prefer Blondes</i>, and that's how they came into her life. </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I don't know how many times I've read it. You 
do have to go back to the book. It's certainly not the Marilyn Monroe movie. 
Nothing like it. You laugh out loud.&nbsp; I remember I was alone on the beach 
reading it and laughing out loud. I had found a used copy in a store in 
Jacksonville, Florida. I had an afternoon to kill, so I'm reading it. And 
there's all these people around me, and I keep laughing out loud. They keep 
looking and wondering &quot;who's this weird woman all by herself laughing out loud?&quot; 
It's just so ribald. It's hilarious and clever.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
How would you compare it to the Marilyn Monroe film and the book?</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CB:</font></i></b><font size="2"> 
The Marilyn Monroe film. The character isn't like Lorelei. Dorothy isn't even 
like Dorothy. It's sendup. The book sends up scenes. (Anita) used &quot;The 
gold-digger with the heart of gold.&quot; So in that part it's the same. There are 
things like where Marilyn sings &quot;Diamonds are a Girl's Best Friend,&quot; which are 
just beyond divine. But at the same time it's not the book. Every line is so 
finely crafted. And she caught a wave with that book. You can read it today. Of 
course, it's a very period piece. But at that time in the 20's, it just caught a 
wave at that moment with the flappers. What everybody was feeling or 
questioning, she just managed to catch the wave at the perfect time and poke fun 
at it.</font></font></p>

How did Frances Marion and Anita Loos differ in their writing?</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CB:</font></i></b><font size="2"> I 
don't think it did much. They were both incredibly able. They could do comedy, 
and they could do drama, and they could pull the heartstrings. They both had 
that ability, which is why their work stands out, is to make their secondary 
characters three dimensional. </font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Frances said when the worked together, and I 
love this little quote, &quot;Anita would start early in the morning, and Frances 
would drag herself in at 6 a.m.&quot; (laughs).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I know John Sayles, who can write incredibly 
quickly, who could turn out a script in under 30 days, and it's good. Both 
Frances and Anita were very social people who had a lot friends. They both were 
early risers, and they both wrote pages before nine in the morning and off and 
on again till nine at night.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Both of them had hired help who took care of 
the more mundane things other writers might actually deal with (laughs). </font>

It must be nice to have a corner on this sort of study.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><font size="2">CB:</font></i></b><font size="2"> I 
just wish there was money in this corner (laughs). It's very satisfying in all 
respects except financially. The Anita thing brings me particular satisfaction 
because I feel like as I say in my preface, or whatever, that I feel like this 
isn't a standalone, although you could read it that way, but I feel like it puts 
a bookend to her works. Don't read this in spite of her other works. Read those, 
too. In between all of them you'll have the full picture of Anita. It's part of 
her, but this is the part she left out. I feel like I've completed the picture.</font></font></p>
