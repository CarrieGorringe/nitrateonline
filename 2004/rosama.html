            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../kj.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 26 December 2003</i></font><p>
			<font face="Verdana" size="5">Immutable </font></p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Osama</i> begins looking like 
			a documentary. Taking the firsthand view of camera turned on a 
			women's protest demonstration, the film observes hundreds gathered, 
			in mostly light blue burqas, wielding signs and demanding the 
			opportunity to work. A street boy, Espandi (Arif Herati) approaches 
			the unseen filmmaker, offering to guide him and to bless him with a 
			dose of smoky, protective incense, just as the Taliban arrive, 
			shoving and brutally hosing down the women. As the women are dragged 
			off, arrested, and worse, the cameraman also finds himself 
			assaulted: the frame goes dark. </font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The chaos of this opening scene is 
			surely jolting. But the composition and rhythm are simultaneously 
			beautiful and abstract, the women's clothing wafting as they run or 
			fall, the Taliban horde made up of turbaned and bearded, murky 
			figures. When the camera takes up the perspective of a 12-year-old 
			girl (Marina Golbahari) and her mother (Zubaida Sahar), who barely 
			escape the brunt of the men's aggression, the film locates its 
			protagonist. With her father killed in &quot;the Kabul war,&quot; and her 
			uncle in &quot;the Russian war,&quot; responsibility for supporting the family 
			will soon fall to the girl. When her mother loses her temporary 
			employment as a nurse (her elderly patient dies), the girl must cut 
			her hair and pretend to be a boy, named Osama, in order to support 
			not only her mother, but also her grandmother (Hamida Refah). 
			Touchingly, Osama keeps one of her braids, planting it in a 
			flowerpot she keeps by her bed. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The first film to be made in 
			Afghanistan since the reported removal of the Taliban, Siddiq 
			Barmak's <i>Osama</i> concerns the regime's many offenses, 
			especially against women. Young Osama's endeavors to hide her 
			identity are fraught with her own uncertainty -- she's not sure how 
			to behave, as boys' routines and culture are so wholly other than 
			her own. She has the wrong shoes, her voice is too high, and she has 
			no concept of how to pray, as all boys must do daily, in groups. 
			Though she's instructed occasionally by her employer, a man who knew 
			and served with her father, Osama will never be able to keep up with 
			the demands exacted by minute-by-minute surveillance. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Spotted at an afternoon prayer, 
			Osama is rounded up the next day for Madrassa religious and military 
			school: the Taliban trains all boys for Bin Laden's ongoing wars. 
			Given that they know nothing else, the boys are all more or less 
			eager to learn what it means to be &quot;a man,&quot; that is, how to pray, 
			how to fight, how to dominate, and how to perform ablutions (this 
			lesson goes on for some time, to underline Osama's fear of 
			discovery). Returning to her mother's house each evening, Osama 
			changes gears abruptly, working as a girl, by serving food at a 
			wedding (held with the groom in absentia, exiled to Iran), populated 
			entirely by women. When the Taliban come by, the women cover 
			themselves with their burqas and pretend to be wailing at a funeral, 
			which, by implication, they might as well be -- whether married, 
			widowed, or single, women have no say over any of their own 
			activities or expectations. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Unsurprisingly, Osama is unable to 
			maintain her deception. At school, though she does her best to act 
			&quot;tough,&quot; climbing trees even though she's afraid, enduring the 
			taunts of boys who find her &quot;girlish,&quot; she is eventually dealt a 
			traumatic punishment for tree climbing: hung by a rope inside a well 
			for hours, as she sobs for her &quot;mother.&quot; This incident leads 
			directly to the onset of her menstruation. Hoisted from the well, 
			she has blood on her legs, and while the Mullahs do not have her 
			stoned -- as they do an unfaithful wife -- they do allocate for her 
			a terrible fate. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Though the premise of Osama's tale 
			is categorical -- life for women and girls is horrendous -- it is 
			rendered in a series of telling images. When Osama's mother gets a 
			ride home from her client on his bicycle, neglecting to hide her 
			ankles beneath her gown, the Taliban stop them and accuse her of 
			offense. Cinematographer Ebrahim Ghafuri's camera never even shows 
			their faces, just her feet, at first with ankles visible, then 
			covered, shrunk up into her skirt. Or again, when, following her 
			mother's out-loud wish that god had never created women, Osama's 
			grandmother tries to soothe her, stroking her head while she tells a 
			story where gender is mutable (if you walk under a rainbow, you can 
			switch to boy or girl), the camera holds on the girl's face. It 
			hardly matters that the narrative is so overstated or that the 
			tragedy is so overwhelming. Her face, haunted and grim, offers a 
			simple, resonant, immutable truth. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A recurring image speaks to the 
			life Osama will never have, though she imagines it. In this dream, 
			she's in prison, the camera sliding across the bars, to reveal blue-buqa-ed 
			women bowed down in horror and submission. And yet, she also sees 
			herself, jumping rope, an activity she attempts in &quot;real life,&quot; but 
			never has space or time to practice. The scene is punctuated with 
			the thunk-thunk-thunk of the rope hitting the floor, as the mobile 
			frame emphasizes the irony of the space she has in the prison of her 
			dream. The diurnal magic and utter impossibility of this simple 
			child's game are unforgettable. </font>
