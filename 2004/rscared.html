			<a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 16 April 2004</i></font><p>
			<font face="Verdana" size="5">All too real </font></p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Children are running. The day is 
			bright, the field where they scamper is golden. Accompanied by a 
			speedy violin track, the camera barely keeps up as the kids hurtle 
			forward, their bare legs dark amid the sunburned cast of the 
			grasses. Maria (Giulia Matturo), younger and smaller than her 
			fellows, stumbles, and her older brother, nine-year-old Michele (Guiseppe 
			Cristiano) goes back to fetch her. This means that he loses the race 
			-- for it is a race, not a flight from danger -- and so must pay up, 
			that is, he must perform a feat of daring, named by the contest 
			winner. </font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Michele agrees -- or rather, 
			submits -- walking across a rickety rafter in the abandoned 
			farmhouse where the children spend their summer afternoons. Just 
			when he seems about to fall, he regathers himself, reciting to 
			himself a tale of courage that he has conjured himself, about an 
			agile &quot;Lizard Man&quot; who, on teetering, becomes &quot;the Glass Man, 
			because, if he falls, he breaks.&quot; Michele does not fall or break. 
			Indeed, he goes on to demonstrate a bravery that is at once unusual 
			for its moral sensibility, but also typical of children who have not 
			yet learned to fear what the world has to offer. Michele's story 
			becomes increasingly complicated. It is not enough to say that he 
			loses innocence by exposure to bad behavior and obvious selfishness, 
			though this is surely true. He also loses faith in the adults who 
			are supposed to look after him. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Michele's self-narration -- in the 
			form of stories he tells himself at night, under his covers with a 
			flashlight -- punctuates Gabriele Salvatores' <i>Io non ho paura</i> 
			(<i>I'm Not Scared)</i>. A solemn, succinct consideration of the 
			ways this child learns to interpret human motives, to make sense of 
			events that appear to have no sense, the film is adapted by Niccolò 
			Ammaniti from his novel. Set in the Basilicata and Puglia regions of 
			southern Italy, it paints a portrait of inevitable disillusionment 
			that is at once grim and romantic, broadly allegorical and all too 
			real. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This adventure begins just after he 
			and his playmates leave the farmhouse. Headed home, Maria discovers 
			she has lost her glasses, whereupon her generous big brother runs 
			back to retrieve them. On spotting the glasses, Michele discovers a 
			terrible truth: a boy in a hole. More specifically, he catches a 
			glimpse of a thin, pale leg beneath a blanket, barely visible at the 
			bottom of a pit, covered over by a rudimentary panel. Horrified, 
			Michele rushes home, in search of some sense of order. His mother 
			Anna (Aitana Sánchez-Gijón) prepares dinner, his often absent father 
			Pino (Dino Abbrescia) appears at last, smoking with a cigarette 
			holder and giving Michele a model gondola that is too fragile to 
			play with. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Unable to forget the boy in the 
			hole, Michele soon goes back. His first encounter with Filippo (Mattia 
			di Pierro) is wholly alarming: as Michele peers into the darkness of 
			the pit, suddenly the other boy's face appears, seeming to mirror 
			Michele's own. Both children scream and fall back: cut to a shot of 
			Michele on his bicycle, pedaling furiously away from the farmhouse. 
			Gradually, Michele's curiosity gets the better of him; he returns 
			again to the pit. &quot;Are you alive?&quot; he asks of the limp form before 
			him. &quot;Agua,&quot; comes back a weak voice. Michele lowers a pot of water 
			on a rope, and in the days to come, returns with bread he buys at a 
			local shop (this after imagining that a starving boy might want 
			chocolate first). Blinded, chained by his leg, and desperately 
			enfeebled by his weeks alone, in utter darkness, Filippo is 
			simultaneously frightening and pathetic, absolutely vulnerable and 
			stunningly resilient. He is the Lizard Man and the Glass Man. </font>
			</p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The boys learn they are the same 
			age (in the fifth grade) and share interests in model cars and comic 
			books, their evolving sense of interdependence and trust parallels 
			Michele's increasing distrust in his parents. For the most ghastly 
			aspect of this story that becomes Michele's is his realization that 
			adults -- in particular his parents, as well as his father's 
			unpleasant &quot;business associate,&quot; Sergio (Diego Abatantuono) -- lie, 
			steal, and abuse those who depend on them. As Michele tries to 
			figure out how Filippo has come to be hidden in this hole, he also 
			comes to see danger in his once-familiar surroundings. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Though the plot occasionally 
			lurches into melodrama, Italo Petriccione's striking cinematography 
			and Massimo Fiocchi's delicate editing provide nuance for Michele's 
			emotional and physical journeys. Most provocatively, <i>Io non ho 
			paura</i> reveals the reasons children can't help but be afraid, 
			despite the efforts of most adults to protect them, to preserve 
			their inexperience and trust for as long as possible. When Filippo 
			asks Michele, &quot;Are you my guardian angel?&quot; the answer can only be, 
			no: children are not angels, only children. As such, they are 
			imaginative, courageous, and observant. And they are scared for good 
			reasons.</font></td>
