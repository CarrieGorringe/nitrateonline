            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 6 February 2004</i></font><p>
			<font face="Verdana" size="5">Can't Hold Us Down </font></p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">If nothing else, the Superbowl 
			Reveal has underlined the longstanding U.S. faith in a link between 
			morality and sports spectacle. And, just in case the current scandal 
			has you fretting over the strength of this link, here comes 
			upstanding nostalgic reinforcement. Disney's <i>Miracle</i> is an 
			unabashed celebration of the connections among sports, national 
			pride, and the wonder of whiteguyness. At its center is the 1980 
			U.S. Olympic hockey team, put together by the much beloved and 
			recently deceased Coach Herb Brooks (Kurt Russell, whose ambling 
			determination, hip sideburns, and slick plaid pants make the 
			character almost painfully endearing). The Coach and his young 
			players are miraculous because back then, no one thought they could 
			medal, let alone win the gold. And because, according to the movie, 
			&quot;America&quot; was in need of &quot;a win.&quot;</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Miracle</i> opens by recalling 
			the dismal historical moment that Brooks and his boys inherited: a 
			series of sounds and images run up to 1980, including anti-Vietnam 
			War and Women's Lib demonstrations, the Munich Olympics, the silicon 
			chip, streaking, Nixon's resignation, Carter's inauguration, Elvis' 
			death, Three Mile Island, the gas shortage, the Soviet invasion of 
			Afghanistan, the Iran hostage predicament, and Carter's &quot;official&quot; 
			announcement that the U.S. is suffering a &quot;crisis of confidence.&quot;
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At this point, the film cuts to its 
			present, as Brooks is interviewing with the suits seeking a 
			triumphant Olympic team. After wining three national titles for the 
			University of Minnesota, he's definitely full of confidence, coming 
			with a strategy for developing &quot;team chemistry,&quot; an idea of how to 
			take on the unbeatable Soviet team (which had dominated the sport 
			for some years), and a wife, Patti (Patricia Clarkson), willing to 
			handle all his domestic background (they have two kids, who barely 
			appear in the film), so that he can get the job done. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">He also comes with conspicuous 
			personal baggage, as he was cut from the U.S. national team as a 
			player in 1960. His 1980 squad challenged him I their own ways: the 
			last amateur team before professional dream teams could be 
			assembled, they were college players used to competing against one 
			another, giving up seven months of their young lives to chase an 
			impossible-seeming dream, but not initially willing to give up the 
			cockiness that made them individual stars. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While the sundry tensions among 
			players and, especially, between players and coach, provide a 
			modicum of drama, none is pursued to the point of detail. The kids 
			-- variously rugged, shaggy-haired, and outfitted in pads and 
			helmets -- form a team that tends to obscure their individuality, 
			but that is, to a point, the source of their greatness. No Sharpies, 
			cell phones, or outrageous salaries here, just sincere commitment to 
			the U.S. of A. That said, a few exceptions raise up, briefly, 
			including goalie Jim Craig (Eddie Cahill), whose family tragedy 
			underscores his own noble determination, as well as captain Mike 
			Eruzione (Patrick O'Brien Demsey), whose declaration of his 
			dedication to the &quot;United States of America&quot; (as opposed to his alma 
			mater) secures the team's earnest resolve to beat the Russians.
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Following its first four or five 
			minutes, when Brooks is interviewed, the film -- directed by Gavin 
			O'Connor and produced by the team who brought you <i>The Rookie</i> 
			-- is left without much story to tell. At least, once the outline is 
			established, the end is known, for even if you're not familiar with 
			this particular bit of U.S. history, the title, borrowed from the 
			&quot;Miracle on Ice&quot; and sportscaster Al Michaels' exclamation at the 
			time (&quot;Do you believe in miracles?!&quot;), pretty much gives away what's 
			going to happen. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And so <i>Miracle</i> is left with 
			montages and blandly big music from Mark Isham: Brooks selects the 
			team and drills the team, the team plays, the team rides buses and 
			eats pizza, the team bonds, the team goes to Lake Placid, where 
			Brooks delivers a rousing &quot;This is your time&quot; speech. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Amid all this upright formula 
			(courtesy screenwriter Eric Guggenheim), the film also reveals a 
			little bit about Brooks' obsessive focus, perhaps most vividly 
			rendered as he's watching 8mm film of prospective players at home. 
			Patti tries to have a conversation with him, something to do with 
			daily family subsistence, and he can't deal with it. They fight, she 
			retreats to the bedroom, he watches more film, the image of a teeny, 
			anonymous black and white hockey player reflected in his glasses as 
			the camera closes on his wholly absorbed face. To be fair, he does 
			apologize to the wife, but only enough to let her know, again, that 
			he &quot;needs this,&quot; and that she'll just have to ride it out. Amen for 
			supportive wives. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Also amen for supportive, if 
			occasionally skeptical, assistant coaches, here embodied by Craig 
			Patrick (the completely reliable Noah Emmerich). When Brooks goes 
			hard at &quot;the boys,&quot; drilling them into wee hours or making them 
			angry at his various demands, Patrick is not only available to raise 
			a question to the coach, but also to narrate for you, in case you've 
			somehow missed the point that when Brooks makes the kids mad at him, 
			they won't have time to be mad at each other. The point, Patrick 
			knows, is that Brooks is pushing his players to excellence, because, 
			as the coach reminds everyone, &quot;Common men go nowhere.&quot; By contrast, 
			winners write history. &nbsp;</font></td>
