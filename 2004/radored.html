            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>,7 May2004</i></font><p>
			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">During the opening scenes of the 
			Italian film <i>Adored</i>, we are introduced to Riki Kandinsky 
			(played by Marco Filiberti), who seems hued in gold -- old eyes, 
			gold hair, gold skin. Riki brings to mind the unabashedly sensual 
			look that exists in photos of Nijinsky as the Faun, or that Helmut 
			Berger had during the period when he was in Visconti's films and the 
			1970 <i>Dorian Gray</i>, only Riki does not have the cloying 
			narcissistic quality that Berger also had as well.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Riki is a successful and popular 
			adult film actor, and he certainly seems to be enjoying it. When his 
			older brother Federico (Urbano Barberini) comes to Rome on business 
			after the death of their father, Federico has no idea that Riki is 
			not only doing porno films, he's in porno films where he does scenes 
			with other men. While on the set of his latest film, Riki, working 
			away on someone or other, looks at the camera, as if catching sight 
			of us catching sight of him -- and winks.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And this is in a country where a 
			young prostitute, in the 1993 documentary <i>Boys from Brazil</i>, 
			said that the whole place would suddenly descend into a &quot;porno sexo 
			guerra&quot; if it were suddenly deprived of all its prostitutes. (I 
			doubt that Italy would be the only place where that would happen, if 
			it happened.) Marco Filiberti also directed and wrote <i>Adored</i> 
			(this is his first feature film, after working on the stage and as a 
			music recording artist, and the film has a credit for &quot;screenplay 
			revision&quot; to Italo Moscati), however, after presenting us with the 
			character of Riki, the film never gets as wild or exotic as we would 
			be led to expect. I certainly didn't expect it to become, of all 
			things, mushy. After the initial shock wears off, Federico finds out 
			that Riki's friends---including Luna (Rosalinda Celentano), an 
			artist who only makes sculptures of angels (and, with her turquoise 
			eye shadow and vinyl outfits, Celentano looks like how Lisa Kudrow 
			might've looked if she got into films after going through the 
			bohemian set of Swinging Sixties London), and Claudio (Claudio Vanni), 
			who is apparently supposed to be Riki's lover (it's never entirely 
			clear in the film)---and the people he works with on movie sets are 
			pretty much regular folks just like anyone else, and soon Federico 
			is announcing how meaningless his previous life had been.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Then there is the young boy that 
			Riki rescues after the boy's mother perishes in a street accident. 
			The boy awakens genuine, and previously unexpected, paternal 
			feelings in Riki; not only that, the fact that Riki is gay and makes 
			adult films is perfectly alright as far as the boy is concerned. 
			Alas, that's not how the boy's relatives see it, and an attendantly 
			ugly custody battle ensues.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Adored</i> opens with a prologue 
			set 16 years after the main events of the story have taken place 
			(during the year 1999)---a documentary crew is looking for 
			information about Riki, and Federico, at the family chateau in 
			France, leafs through some of Riki's handwritten journal pages. What 
			all this leads up to is an attempt to turn Riki into -- or at least 
			make the case for him being -- some sort of a martyr and/or victim. 
			The only things is that the film doesn't really provide a reason for 
			him being one. Riki may be enjoying his status as a sex symbol (or, 
			“porno divo”), but he doesn't seem to have any illusions about 
			himself, so he probably wouldn't buy what the film tries to do with 
			him any more than we would, nor would he expect us to. In other 
			words, Filiberti gives us a good portrayal of Riki in <i>Adored</i>, 
			but he probably could have done with having someone else shape a 
			better film around it -- Riki is a glittering creature, one who 
			seems to know the score and is waiting to see if the rest of us will 
			catch up.</font></td>
