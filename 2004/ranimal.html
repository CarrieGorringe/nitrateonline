			<a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 26 March 2004</i></font><p>
			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">In <i>The Big Animal</i>, Zygmunt 
			Sawicki (played by Jerzy Stuhr), an older gentleman with a broad 
			face and mustache, walks through town, wrapped in a trenchcoat, 
			before going to his job as a bank clerk, holding a tether that is 
			attached to a large, magnificent two-humped camel, the camel walking 
			alongside Zygmunt with a quiet grace and majesty that either rubs 
			off on Zygmunt or mirrors that of the gentle man. Zygmunt's wife, 
			Marysia (Anna Dymna), is a little more leery when the creature turns 
			up at their home in a small Polish town, but, after a while, by her 
			own admission, she finds she gets used to having it around. 
			Concerned about the weather, she sews a patchwork shawl for it, 
			which fits over both the animal's humps neatly; the schoolchildren 
			she teaches engage in trying to find a name for it. Zygmunt even 
			decides to build a shelter for it -- looking at photos of mosques, 
			he designs it so that it will resemble something it might feel more 
			at &quot;home&quot; with. Most marvelously, when Zygmunt plays the clarinet, 
			the animal happily &quot;harumphs&quot; in response to the music.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film was made from a screenplay 
			written by Krzysztof Kieslowski that was discovered after his death, 
			from a heart attack, in 1996, and, as with the best of the films 
			Kieslowski directed, the story ends up going far beyond the obvious. 
			Jerzy Stuhr, who also directed <i>The Big Animal</i>, acted opposite 
			Zbigniew Zamachowski in the last episode of <i>The Decalogue</i>, 
			about a pair of brothers who try to figure out what to do with a 
			stamp collection left by their late father. (Stuhr also appeared in 
			a supporting role in <i>White</i>, the second of the <i>Three Colors</i> 
			films.) Aided by&nbsp; beautiful black-and-white photography&nbsp; by the 
			cinematographer Pawel Edelman, Stuhr's direction and acting both 
			show a deep sympathy and understanding of the material. The camel, 
			seemingly abandoned by a traveling circus, is something miraculous 
			that drops into some people's lives, and they respond to it for 
			what's wonderful about it. Zygmunt is proud to show it around, but 
			feels deeply uncomfortable about exploiting it -- it seems to him 
			simply &quot;immoral&quot; -- a response that leaves some people, who readily 
			see how they could use such a beast for their own personal gain, as 
			incomprehensible. Others just don't want it about -- one official 
			explanation being that it creates &quot;unwanted sensation&quot; -- but 
			they're all too happy to be friendly towards Zygmunt when the 
			animal's not around.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the end, the picture becomes 
			something more than just a story about what happens when the 
			miraculous occurs in everyday life, and how it ends up profoundly 
			coloring both Zygmunt and Marysia's existence -- they visit the 
			Warsaw Zoo, and, lingering before the enclosure for camels (3, in 
			fact), the animals approach the couple and lean down to gently come 
			close to their faces, as if both recognizing a quality in these two 
			beings and paying homage to it. Zygmunt and Marysia's response is 
			remarkable. The moment is simply, and breathtakingly, beautiful.</font></td>
