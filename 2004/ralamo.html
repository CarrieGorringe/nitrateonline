            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 16 April 2004</i></font><p>
			<font face="Verdana" size="5">No disparos </font></p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Standing on a rooftop at the 
			Alamo, the apparently valiant and suddenly insightful Davy Crockett 
			(Billy Bob Thornton) pulls out his fiddle. He's responding to the 
			increasingly annoying march that the enemy forces, led by Mexican 
			General Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana (Emilio Echevarría), play before 
			each assault on the fort. As these assaults have been going on for 
			days (the siege will last 13), each bringing cannon fire (&quot;Fuego! 
			Fuego!&quot;) and Mexican advances, the U.S. troops are weary and 
			agitated. They're also grateful to have Crockett stand up. </font>
			</b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While this is most obviously a 
			cocky gesture, it is also a strangely collaborative one: the Mexican 
			soldiers continue to play with Crockett's accompaniment and, much as 
			in the fiddle-and-harmonica scene in <i>Matewan</i> (1987), for a 
			minute, these mortal enemies forget their self-claimed missions and 
			territories, their conflict momentarily quelled in what Crockett 
			deems &quot;harmony.&quot; Whether or not this scene is left over from John 
			Sayles' early scriptwriting efforts for <i>The Alamo</i>, back when 
			it was set to be directed by Ron Howard, cost some $125 million, 
			star Russell Crowe, and merit an R rating, is unclear. But it's a 
			rare moment of grace and reflection in a film that might be 
			charitably called incoherent. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">So much has gone wrong for <i>The 
			Alamo</i> that it almost feels like piling on to say any more about 
			it. But it's hard to find much that's right about it. The movie 
			arrives in theaters directed by John Lee Hancock (<i>The Rookie</i>); 
			written by Leslie Bohem, Stephan Gaghan, and Hancock; rated PG-13, 
			starring Dennis Quaid as blustery drunk Sam Houston; reportedly 
			costing $107 million, that is, still $32 million over the $75 
			million budget granted by the same company, Disney, that spent $100 
			million to make <i>Home on the Range</i>; and plainly cut to ribbons 
			by someone (Hancock's three-hour version now edited to two hours and 
			15 minutes, with Marc Blucas part [as messenger James Bonham] 
			reduced to a couple of one-second pans and one voiceover line, and 
			Wes Studi disappeared altogether). </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As taxing as they surely were, 
			these logistical difficulties can't compete with the political and 
			historical problems associated with Alamo mythology. The 1836 land 
			grab mounted by Houston and the Texians (settlers on technically 
			Mexican land who wanted to establish a nation apart from the U.S.) 
			was hardly welcomed by the Mexican or U.S. government. Hancock's 
			movie allows that the Alamo's 200 or so defenders are assorted 
			ne'er-do-wells: cheats, drunks, bad card players, and debtors, led 
			by the last-minute appointee to command the fort, Colonel William 
			Barrett Travis (Patrick Wilson), who has abandoned his pregnant wife 
			and two children. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But it is the mighty fiction -- of 
			the film and the Alamo -- that these losers are roused to heroism: 
			all were massacred by Santa Ana's 4000 troops. According to the 
			movie, Travis earns his men's respect, despite his repeated 
			demonstrations of incompetence, then inexplicably inspires everyone, 
			including himself, when facing death: &quot;Texas has been a second 
			chance for me,&quot; he says, &quot;For lands and riches, but also to be a 
			different man, I hope a better one.&quot; He goes on to encourage them to 
			die for Texas, at that point less a place than an dream. 
			Specifically, an imperial dream. (Eventually, this dream would end 
			with Texas as the Union's 28th state.) </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Among the men who nod sagely in 
			response to Travis' speech are the &quot;Lion of the West&quot; himself 
			(Crockett) and his equally legendary buddy, Jim Bowie (Jason Patric), 
			designer of the knife that bears his name. These two share an early 
			moment, admiring that knife, as Bowie reveals that he is dying of 
			various ailments (consumption, malaria, pneumonia), as well as old 
			knife and bullet wounds. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Though Bowie is weak, he remains 
			both obnoxious (resisting Travis' inexperience and priggishness) and 
			perversely noble. Consigned to bed for the film's hour, Bowie is 
			tended by his dead Mexican wife's sister, Juana (Estephana Lebaron, 
			whose resemblance to her sister leads to Bowie's sweaty romantic 
			hallucinating) and his slave Sam (Afemo Omilami). Bowie sends both 
			to their &quot;freedom&quot; when Santa Ana grants Mexicans and Negroes in the 
			fort safe passage, though Bowie refuses to give up legal possession 
			of his property (this might be ironic, as he makes the point that he 
			will survive the assault and his illness in order to reclaim Sam, 
			but it's not a particularly funny joke). </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When the Mexicans do breach the 
			fort, as they must, the film cuts between bloody fighting scenes and 
			Bowie buttoning up his vest and readying his guns, so he can shoot a 
			few of them varmints as they kill him. This sets in motion a lengthy 
			&quot;final battle&quot; (that will be followed by another final battle, at 
			San Jacinto, where Sam Houston reappears to give the film a 
			relatively &quot;happy&quot; ending by leading 910 men to victory over the 
			Mexicans), which involves much cutting between personal fights, for 
			Travis, Crockett, and other secondary characters. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This battle provides a moment of 
			realization for Travis' slave, a boy named Joe (Edwin Hodge). 
			Earlier advised by Sam (Bowie's slave) that he should look out for 
			himself when the battle begins (&quot;You clean up their shit, but damned 
			if you gonna die for 'em too&quot;), Joe instead stays with his master 
			until the end -- of Travis. At this point, Joe is left alone and 
			afraid, muttering the words Sam said would set him free: &quot;Soy Negro. 
			No disparos.&quot; The film never does reveal what happens to Joe, though 
			most other supporting players are accounted for (likely, this is one 
			of the many scenes cut from the theatrical release). While its 
			acknowledgment of the slaves' plights is commendable, <i>The Alamo</i> 
			-- at least in the current chopped-up form -- can't (or won't) 
			represent the extent to which hypocrisy, racism, bullying, and 
			anxiety (as well as the usually extolled courage and ambition) 
			shaped the emerging United States. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And so <i>The Alamo</i> resorts to 
			legend, reiterated and refracted. Crockett appears here as an 
			admirable egotist, who resists wearing the coonskin cap for which he 
			is renowned, looks after the men who look up to him, and rides out 
			to defend the Alamo because his friend Sam Houston asks him to do 
			so. He is also remarkably self-aware and somewhat humbled by his own 
			celebrity: before he leaves for the fort, he is a guest at a stage 
			performance based on his life, referring to the actor playing him as 
			&quot;Davy Crockett&quot; (he prefers to be called David). </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Bowie, by turn, is a wily and 
			lovable rapscallion, devoted to his men, who resent the high-falutin' 
			excesses of more formally educated, less field-experienced leaders 
			like Travis. Santa Ana is perhaps the easiest caricature: a 
			straight-up deplorable despot in history, he is here a man obsessed 
			with ostentatious displays of power and wealth, his tent outside the 
			Alamo equipped with fine china, white tablecloths, and silverware. 
			He is also, of course, devious and cruel, willing to sacrifice his 
			men (this opposed to the ostensibly noble Texians), whom he sees as 
			expendable in the cause of his own advancement. Such sketchy 
			representations simplify their interactions and rearrange their 
			legends, so that the Americans look like underdogs, only wanting to 
			preserve their claims to land they've stolen. As in history, their 
			deaths -- and the fact that Houston does take down Santa Ana and 
			take possession of Texas -- make them look righteous. </font></td>
