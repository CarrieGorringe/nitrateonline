			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Originally scheduled to open 
			opposite <i>Spy Kids 3</i> last summer, Bart Freundlich's $18 
			million kiddie caper movie is slow-moving, even for a February 
			release. While it deploys stunts, gadgets, and special effects, not 
			to mention a spunky girl protagonist, <i>Catch That Kid</i> never 
			quite overcomes its ungainly alternations between exposition and 
			episode, and no individual moment ever quite connects with another.
			</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Maddy (Kristen Stewart) likes to 
			climb mountains and rocks. You know this because she's introduced in 
			appropriate gear, with expensive lines and hooks and shoes, each 
			item displayed in admiring close-up. As her family lives in the 
			city, she's left to climb buildings, scurrying up alongside 
			drainpipes and marking her height with chalk every time she reaches 
			a new goal. Maddy's into this particular activity because she 
			emulates her dad Tom (Sam Robards), or rather her dad's former self, 
			as he's suffered a terrible climbing accident on Mount Everest that 
			left him with a scar on his back, a job running go-cart races, and a 
			lingering malady that suddenly blossoms into Desperate Circumstance. 
			He faints, lands in the hospital, and needs surgery costing 
			$250,000, that can, incidentally, only be performed in Denmark (a 
			seemingly odd choice, until you remember that the film is a remake 
			of a Danish movie, <i>Klatretosen</i>.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is way out of range for 
			Maddy's mother, Molly (Jennifer Beals), who does her best to hold it 
			together. In between regularly assigning Maddy to babysit for her 
			younger brother (he becomes something of a hip accessory, or maybe 
			more accurately, a portable reaction shot), mom designs security 
			systems. As the crisis hits, she's just finished one for a bank run 
			by the Mr. Smithersish Mr. Brisbane (Michael des Barres), who won't 
			even give her a loan for her husband's operation. To pile on the 
			convenient complications -- though Molly warns Brisbane that the 
			system is not yet ready to go online, he decides to go on with a big 
			opening fete, anyway. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This creates a big splashy 
			opportunity for Maddy, who decides to rob the bank and deliver the 
			cash to her father's hospital bedside, like the terrifically 
			imaginative good daughter that she is. It's a heavy load for a child 
			to bear, feeling responsible for father's very life, but Maddy takes 
			it in stride, charming the sweet-natured bank manager, Hartmann 
			(John Carroll Lynch), into giving her a tour of all the security 
			facilities, including the password to open every lock. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Maddy also enlists the help of her 
			two best friends, computer geek Austin (Corbin Bleu) and go-cart 
			racer Gus (Max Theriot). She's not a little conniving in her efforts 
			to get her way, pretending for each eagerly adoring boy that he is 
			the love of her young life. Poor guys: they both fall, hard. This 
			metaphor comes up repeatedly in <i>Catch That Kid</i>: remembering 
			well that her dad fell (100 feet), Maddy's also afraid she might 
			fall (the 100 feet marker looms for her), and for some bizarre 
			reason, the bank vault is located at the top of a stairless and 
			ladderless wall (just how the adults were thinking they would reach 
			the vault is not so clear), that Maddy climbs while Gus looks on 
			from the floor, narrating each step for the rest of us. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Toward the end of plying their 
			troths, the boys fulfill their character traits. Gus tricks out a 
			trio of g-carts so they can drive them to and from the bank (in 
			traffic -- this doesn't seem the most inconspicuous way to get 
			around d in the city, but, well, they look fast, for a minute). And 
			Austin whips up a 3D holographic bank plan, based on an architect's 
			model -- when this fancy apparition starts whooshing and swaying in 
			Austin's bedroom, you have to wonder, how come he doesn't have a 
			very well-paying job designing such things, so they wouldn't have to 
			go through all these illegal hijinks?&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As the movie lurches from plot 
			point to plot point, it pauses occasionally for an adult antic, 
			primarily by the bank's cocky security guard (James LeGros, a 
			Freundlich regular), but it lacks the sort of spastic energy that 
			makes so many children's movies simultaneously alarming and 
			entertaining. Worse, it lacks wit -- by the time Molly sits Maddy 
			down to tell her that what she's done is &quot;wrong,&quot; the moral lesson 
			seems both too late and too serious. </font></td>
