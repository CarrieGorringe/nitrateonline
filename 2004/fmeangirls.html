</font><font face="Verdana" size="5">How to Be a Cool Misfit</font><font face="Verdana" size="6"><br>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="4">Interview with Mark Waters<br>
</font><i><font size="1" face="Verdana">interview by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan 
Lybarger</a>, 21 May 2003</font></i></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Director Mark S. Waters seems an unlikely 
candidate to be directing a movie about misfit high school girls. With his 
polished appearance and confident manner, it’s easy to believe that the <i>Mean 
Girls</i> helmer was a basketball player and a valedictorian. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;When I was talking with some of my friends 
from high school,&quot; he recalls in a roundtable interview in Kansas City. &quot;They 
were going, 'What do you mean? You were cool in high school.’ My God, I felt 
like I was a loser. That's the kind of perspective, if anything, I'd like to 
give to a teenage audience is that it's finite. You can make it through it and 
laugh at what you went through.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This hidden, temporary insecurity can be seen 
in the work of his brother Daniel Waters, who wrote <i>Heathers</i> (1989), the 
cult comedy about teen homicides. He explains, &quot;The funny thing is I like to 
make fun of my brother saying that, 'It's a kind of an easy way out to kill your 
bullies.' ‘Yeah, sure. I'm gonna kill her.' It's a tactic that's not available 
to the average high-school student.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;It's more interesting if (the main character) 
actually has to use more devious means to get back at the Queen Bee and in doing 
so she becomes the Queen Bee herself. Also, the thing I really liked about this 
movie in the script form was that it seemed like it had the potential to be like 
a John Hughes movie as well, like <i>Heathers</i> remade by John Hughes.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="4">Indie Roots</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To be fair, Mark S. Waters’ own films have 
occasional dark themes that could give his brother a run for his money. In <i>
The House of Yes</i> (1997), Parker Posey played a mentally disturbed young 
woman who has a Jackie O fixation and an incestuous obsession with her brother.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">He’s aimed for more mainstream audiences with 
the romantic comedy <i>Head Over Heels</i> (2001) and his 2003 remake of <i>
Freaky Friday</i>. According to Waters, the switch from making a Sundance film 
to a Disney one wasn’t all that dramatic.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;When I made <i>Freaky Friday</i>, the reason I 
got the job is because I went into Disney and said, 'I have no idea how to do a 
family movie, so if you want like somebody who's going to make a family movie, 
don't hire me because I'm going to make a movie that I like and a movie that I 
would want to go see myself and work within the parameters of the genre that you 
guys establish for me with the subject matter or how you deal with things.’</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;And I think we benefited because parents who 
brought their kids to the movie weren't horrified that they had to sit through 
an awful <i>Rug Rats3</i>,&quot; he explains.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Despite the commercial success he had with <i>
Freaky Friday</i>, Waters has kept up with and frequently consults his friends 
from his days as an independent filmmaker, like <i>Requiem for a Dream </i>
co-writer-director Darren Aronofsky, <i>8 Mile</i> writer Scott Silver and <i>In 
the Bedroom</i> director Todd Field. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">He remembers, &quot;Darren and I, I had a really 
good class at AFI (the American Film Institute) when I went there. We kind of 
have this support network where we read each other's scripts and give each other 
feedback and watch each other's rough cuts. It's a good place to be because a 
lot of times when you achieve some degree of success you fear people aren't 
willing to say you don't know what the hell you're doing. But since we knew each 
other since we didn't know what we were doing, we're willing to tell each other 
'That sucks! What are we thinking?'</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="4">Keep It Almost Real</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><i><font size="2">Mean Girls</font></i><font size="2"> 
teams Waters with <i>Freaky Friday</i> star Lindsay Lohan and <i>Saturday Night 
Live</i> performer and Head Writer Tina Fey. In it, Lohan plays a home-schooled 
teen who transfers into a conventional high school and discovers social 
maneuvering that makes the African jungles where she grew up seem tamely sedate. 
Fey, who also plays a teacher in the film, wrote the script from Rosalind 
Wiseman’s study of teen girls titled <i>Queen Bees</i> <i>and Wannabees</i>.
</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Waters says, &quot;It's a sociology text. There's no 
story there, so it was Tina's invention of taking these anecdotal interviews 
with teen girls and creating a story of it. However, the detention sequence is 
very much Rosalind Wiseman. That's actually what she does in her seminars, when 
she goes across the country to talk to teen girls. And that line, 'Calling 
someone else fat won't make you any thinner. Calling somebody stupid won't make 
you any smarter.’ It's kind of like straight from her kind of gospel. However, 
the good thing is that it's being related in a way that doesn't feel like a 
preachy Sunday school lesson.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If Waters and Fey had based some of their film 
on Wiseman's observations, authenticity had to be sacrificed in other areas. &quot;If 
we were going to have an R-rated movie,&quot; recalls Waters. &quot;We would have had the 
girls talk the way they really do talk, which is like sailors. A girl like 
Regina (played by Rachael McAdams) in real life every other word out of her 
mouth would be a complete swear word.&quot; Other sacrifices had to be made for the 
PG-13 rating, and a certain television event wound up making things more 
difficult. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;There were a couple of places where we 
submitted the movie to the MPAA (Motion Picture Association of America), and it 
happened to be the Monday after the (2004) Super Bowl. So suddenly they were 
kind of plucking the things out of the movie saying, 'You can't say things like 
that, like <i>cherry pop</i>. You can't say <i>cherry pop</i>.' We basically got 
into these fights. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I kept certain things that I insisted I would 
not give up on but ended up having to change <i>cherry popping</i> to <i>
buttering your muffin</i> in the version that you saw, which we had to make up 
even another euphemism on top of a euphemism. That's just kind of the absurd 
time is that we're in right now as far as censorship is concerned. At the same 
time, I'm kind of happy that the MPAA exists because it's better than some kind 
of government body ruling over the movies,&quot; states Waters.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="4">Where Credit Is Due</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Waters does seem to have a knack for working 
with younger actresses. Lohan has received solid reviews for her work in both or 
his features, but Waters explains that working with performers of Lohan's age is 
easier than some of the challenges he has faced. &quot;I've had situations where I've 
worked with really young actors or working with models in<i> Head over Heels</i>, 
which requires a whole different working method,&quot; he says. &quot;It's much more 
standing next to the camera and coaching them, while Lyndsay and I have got to 
this point now where our shorthand is very quick. Like we have this thing, 
comically where you speak less and less to actors, the better job doing.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While some directors like to take credit for 
even the gaffing on the set and having their name appear several times during 
the credits, Waters is quick to credit Fey's writing and performing 
contribution. &quot;On this movie, she was the one and only writer. Unlike other 
directors who kind of have bigger egos and then I do, I will never send a good 
resource away from me. So, I kept Tina close to my vest. I could always just go 
to her and say, 'This line's not if that funny. It was funny on the page. Can we 
do something better?' Then she'll go off and come up with six new lines. Also in 
post-production, I would show her every cut of the movie and kind of like 
brainstorm ideas for ADR (Additional Dialog Recording) lines,&quot; recalls Waters.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="4">Rethinking the Male Gaze</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If there is any distinctive stamp to Waters' 
films, it may be that all of them with the exception of the upcoming <i>The 
Diceman</i>, which he's developing with Daniel, feature female lead characters. 
&quot;When I find myself reading scripts,&quot; he explains. &quot;I find the female stories 
just grab me more. It's not a conscious choice. I think it comes back to in 
directing you basically have to wake up early in the morning and get up and 
shine a bunch of lights in a camera. It's better if it's a pretty girl than the 
sweaty guy. It helps you get out of bed in to work.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Beyond that I think its that I just I think 
that women will always be a mystery to me. There's still like endlessly 
fascinating and worth exploration. I'm married now and I have a daughter. One of 
the reasons I took <i>Freaky Friday</i> was because my wife just insisted before 
our daughter was about to be born. 'You have to do it because Zoë and I will 
watch it years from now.' I'm even more bathed in estrogen around my house now, 
so who knows? Maybe I need to work with Nic Cage and then The Rock!&quot;</font></p>
