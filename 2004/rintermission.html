			<a href="../kj.html" target="_top">KJ Doughton</a>, 27 March 2004</i></font><p class="MsoNormal">
			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Intermission</i> is directed by 
			John Crowley, but many of its low-life characters seem more in line 
			with notorious Satanist <i>Aleister </i>Crowley. Lehiff, a young 
			Dublin tough played by wary-eyed Colin Farrell, smashes a young 
			woman’s face as this grungy film opens, then repeats his 
			woman-abusing ways later on. These two black-eyed beatings bookend
			<i>Intermission’s</i> look at a batch of troubled Irish oddballs, in 
			its bid for gritty humor ala <i>Trainspotting</i> poured over a 
			vast, Altman-inspired vat of stories. But unless you’re keen on 
			spending two hours in the company of embittered assholes inventing 
			problems for themselves, you’d be better off spinning a U2 record 
			over a pint of Guinness instead.</font></b></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Intermission</i>’s 
			confused “hero,” John (played by Cillian Murphy of <i>28 Days Later</i>), 
			inexplicably dumps his lovely girlfriend Deidre (Kelly Macdonald), 
			then appears miffed when she takes up with a married banker. 
			Immediately, the situation feels contrived. It’s a setup for one of 
			those “all paths intertwine” concepts, as their breakup sparks a 
			chain reaction of events involving seemingly unrelated characters.&nbsp;
			</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jerry, (the 
			terrific Colm Meaney) for instance, is an egocentric cop caught up 
			in the mix, whose level of self-absorption is simultaneously scary 
			and hilarious. As this hulking, pumped-up blow-hard gears up to star 
			in a documentary film about undercover work, he tracks down Lehiff 
			and pisses on the punk’s sneakers in an Alpha Male show of 
			superiority. “Stay out of trouble,” the relieved elder warns, 
			zipping up his pants.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jerry’s tale is 
			absorbing – he’s Ireland’s narcissistic answer to Popeye Doyle. And 
			even a sociopathic loser like Lehiff is made watchable, thanks to 
			the charisma and acting chops of Meaney and Farrell.&nbsp; <i>
			Intermission</i> falls apart, however, as it plays “cute” with a 
			dour bevy of women who lament such tired themes as adultery, dating, 
			and female moustache hair.&nbsp; We’re also treated to John’s blue-balled 
			buddy Oscar (David Wilmot) cruising geriatric nightclubs in a 
			desperate attempt to get laid.&nbsp; Watching Wilmot’s lusty lad beating 
			off to porno videos is akin to being catheterized, and Shirley 
			Henderson’s played-for-laughs monologue about an ex-lover who 
			defecated in bed isn’t much fun, either.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Intermission</i> 
			does season its layered collection of stories with some spicy 
			one-liners that almost redeem the retreaded stories.&nbsp; Self-conscious 
			about the strip of facial hair under her nose, Henderson asks a bus 
			driver, “Do I have a moustache?” His inspired response is, “Well, 
			lady, you’re no Tom Selleck.”&nbsp; There’s also a walrus-sized store 
			manager who torments Oscar and John during their day jobs as 
			bag-boys. Completing each taunt with an acronym, the Hitlerian 
			dictator tells his subordinates that if they don’t shape up, he’ll 
			“TCB” (i.e. “Take Care of Business”).&nbsp; Asked to suggest titles for 
			the reality television show he’s slated to star in, Jerry’s 
			suggestion is less subtle - “Hard as Nails Cunts.”</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Intermission</i> 
			has its moments, thanks to such salty wordplay. But in playing 
			cruelty for laughs, a film better have style to burn, and <i>
			Intermission</i> goes for a no-frills, digital video look as ugly as 
			its canvas of miscreants.&nbsp; Crowley’s group isn’t much fun to spend 
			time with, making viewers <i>yearn</i> for an intermission as his 
			Dublin train wreck unfolds.</font></td>
