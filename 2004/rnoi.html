			<a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>, 4 June 2004</i></font><p class="MsoNormal">
			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">As Icelandic films go, and I can 
			only vouch for <i>Nói (Nói Albinói)</i>, to date the only feature 
			I've seen from that isolated island country (while many people fly 
			over, few apparently stop in; only 300,000 live there), please, sir, 
			bring me more. Filmmaker Dagur Kári's debut feature is an intimate 
			digital study of desolation in a small community cut off by winter's 
			frozen spell. Situated somewhere between <i>Fargo</i> and <i>
			Northern Exposure</i>, the film is a character-driven tale of, well, 
			not much other than a restless teenager, Nói (Tómas Lemarquis), the 
			town's pale, pencil-thin, skinhead &quot;albino,&quot; a laggard who drifts 
			back and forth from home to school, to book store, to gasoline 
			station/convenience store. He's a few rungs down from Max Fischer or 
			Donnie Darko, and tends to doze off and remain in extended REM mode 
			before his grandmother rouses him, not with a cozy nudge, but a 
			blast from the family shotgun.</font></b></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At home with his 
			grandmother (Anna Fridriksdóttir, a natural non-professional who 
			actually delivers the mail in the director-writer's neighborhood), 
			he prefers to sneak down into a cellar hideaway concealed under a 
			throw rug, a self-imposed exile from those who can't understand or 
			tolerate him. As for role models, he's got slim pickings. His father 
			Kiddi Beikon (Thröstur Leó Gunnarsson) is a drunken cabbie inclined 
			to sing Elvis tunes in the small shack he calls home, but is 
			incapable of instilling the discipline, or punctuality, that is 
			lacking in his son's life. His teacher, frustrated by the 
			17-year-old's constant napping in class, his minimalist approach to 
			a math test (i.e., signing his name), or Nói's hilarious idea to 
			send an audiotape recorder to class in his place as proof of paying 
			attention, suggests expulsion. Maybe a psychiatrist could help, 
			wonders his principal, but Nói's too busy quickly solving a Rubik's 
			cube to pay the shrink any mind. Inwardly a genius, outwardly a 
			social misfit; the teen can't seem to cut a break. His Shangri-la 
			lay elsewhere, in that secret basement tomb or the colorful 
			Hawaii-themed slides he observes in his Viewmaster, a birthday 
			present from granny. How quaint that the film is being released in 
			the United States by Palm Pictures.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Amid the steel 
			blue dullness that transcends the town, hovering like the massive, 
			snowbound rock towering nearby, Nói finds himself attracted to the 
			pretty Iris (Elín Hansdóttir, another fresh non-professional), 
			daughter of the local bookseller—the one who collects Coke bottles 
			and munches on Oreos. She's returning from the city (why?) to work 
			at the gas station, eventually paying some attention to Nói here on 
			desolation row. On their first date (proving the adage that misery 
			loves company), not more than a smoke out in the freezing cold, they 
			break into a local museum filled with stuffed birds and bears, and 
			discover a world map that lights major locations. Iceland is left in 
			the dark—a spit in the ocean—just like Nói in his unnamed town. 
			Kicked out of school, he does find work in the frozen wasteland, as 
			a gravedigger, just after a local fortuneteller sees death in Nói's 
			tea leaves.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Day-to-day 
			boredom is the standard issue state of mind for the geeky, clumsy 
			Nói in this snowbound prison, but Kári's deadpan humor instills the 
			film's emptiness with a warm glow. The film's unexpected tragic 
			ending does offer a ray of hope that the years of angst suffered by 
			our teen anti-hero may soon melt away into a tropical paradise. It's 
			time to join him down in the cellar.</font></td>
