            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../kj.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 30 January 2003</i></font><p>
			<font face="Verdana" size="5">Bump, Bump, Bump</font></p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Just in time for their feature 
			film debut, the enormously popular B2K has disbanded, due to &quot;cash 
			disputes.&quot; In fact, <i>You Got Served</i> arrives in theaters while 
			rumors are flying as to efforts to reconstitute the group (with 
			Brandy's brother Ray-J replacing Omarion, no less). Whether this 
			timing means that fans will flock to theaters to see the group as a 
			group -- Omari &quot;Omarion&quot; Grandberry, DeMario &quot;Raz-B&quot; Thornton, Dreux 
			&quot;Lil' Fizz&quot; Frederic, and Jarell &quot;J-Boog&quot; Houston -- one last time, 
			or whether they will eventually get back together is not clear. In 
			any case, the ongoing story has made for much drama, notably on <i>
			106 &amp; Park</i>. </font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>You Got Served</i> offers 
			considerably less emotional intensity: the rote plot has a dance 
			crew competing for big money, fame, and, of course, their own, 
			briefly disrupted friendship. While the plot is surely rote, the 
			dance scenes (which comprise much of the film's 93-minute running 
			time) are tremendous. Designed by the boys' usual choreographer Dave 
			Scott, these numbers are vibrant, explosive, and mostly inventive, 
			pulling from b-boy, mime, ballet, modern dance, pop, cheerleading, 
			and hiphop traditions. Unfortunately, these moments, presided over 
			by local sage Mr. Rad (Steve Harvey) (&quot;We settle it on the floor 
			like men!&quot;), and setting the B2K squad against a team headed by 
			mean, spiky-haired white boy Wade (Christopher Jones), only make the 
			between-numbers machinations seem creakier. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is not so different from other 
			musicals. Also like other musicals, this one features stiff line 
			readings, ludicrous dialogue (&quot;This crew tried to chump my crew 
			today!&quot;, &quot;Sonny sold us out!&quot;, or even, &quot;You suckers got served!&quot;), 
			and a cloying storyline (amid the dancing, tension between two best 
			friends, and a budding romance, a wholly predictable death leads to 
			rearranged priorities and reconciliation). The primary tension 
			arises between David (Omarion) and Elgin (Marques Houston, cousin to 
			Omarion and J-Boog), longtime best friends and dance crewmates 
			(other mates include the disaffected B2K guys Vick [Raz-B], Rashaan 
			[Lil' Fizz], and Rico [J-Boog].) David and El fall out over a 
			two-part contrivance: David falls for El's medical-school-bound 
			sister, Liyah (Jennifer Freeman), and because of this distraction, 
			doesn't help his boy El with a one-last-time &quot;delivery&quot; for the evil 
			huffy-puffy gangster Emerald (Michael &quot;Bear&quot; Taliferro). </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Though it's never spelled out what 
			they deliver in their colorful backpacks, El is jumped in a 
			crackhouse hallway, where he suffers his beatdown in arty silhouette 
			while David's finishes dessert with Liyah. So then it's on. David 
			rushes to the hospital and feels plenty guilty about what's happened 
			to El, and Liyah tries to convince her brother to ease up on the 
			hating, to no avail. Even the occasional appearance of Meagan Good, 
			as Liyah's best friend Beautifull (&quot;with two Ls,&quot; she likes to coo), 
			doesn't soften up El's stubborn resolve. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Determined to carry on despite 
			their trumped-up trauma, each puts together a crew to dance off for 
			a $5,000 prize from MTV and a chance to perform in a Lil' Kim video. 
			This means that the final showdown will be a major performance, 
			hosted by La La Vasquez and wunderkind choreographer Wade Robson. It 
			also means that Kim plays herself at the showdown (emceed by Wade 
			Robson himself), giddily inviting the final two crews to battle 
			&quot;street style&quot;: &quot;You know how I like it baby,&quot; she declares, 
			&quot;Straight hood.&quot; </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Amid this superficial plotty mess, 
			the movie also works as a strangely mesmerizing gloss on the nasty 
			intricacies of the music business. Specifically, its tangled 
			production pedigree says something -- precisely what is unclear -- 
			about the current difficulties of B2K (The Boys of the New 
			Millennium). </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For one thing, <i>You Got Served</i> 
			is directed by the group's manager, Chris Stokes (cousin to Raz-B), 
			whose previous directing experience includes music videos and 2001's
			<i>House Party 4</i>. He also happens to manage IMx, formerly 
			Immature, the group that launched Marques Houston's solo career. 
			Surely, it's only complicated coincidence that Stokes &quot;discovered&quot; 
			Brandy, whose brother is lined up to replace O as lead singer for 
			B2K, even following rumors that Raz-B, J-Boog, and Lil' Fizz have 
			signed an &quot;advisor and business agreement&quot; with another management 
			company, CMX. Stokes remains the manager of Marques Houston and 
			Omarion, whose first solo album is set for a March release.&nbsp; </font>
			</p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Stokes' official response to the 
			breakup is posted on the T.U.G. Entertainment website, expressing 
			his &quot;shock&quot;: &quot;They are like my sons, and I can't understand how, or 
			why they would do this, but if the boys can hear my voice now, I 
			want them to know that I love them and I wish them the best. Plus, I 
			am surprised because they are still under contract with me. I love 
			all of you and all of the fans out there. Please pray for B2K.&quot; The 
			statement is actually longer than this, but the line about the 
			contract creeps in at the end, a detail that, oh dear, must have 
			slipped the minds of his erstwhile son-like clients. (Omarion, for 
			his part, has retreated from initial upset at the walk-out, telling 
			MTV News he'd like to &quot;get back together&quot; with the others, following 
			his solo projects, because &quot;I think people would enjoy it.&quot;) </font>
			</p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The tumult has certainly been 
			immense for the famously enthusiastic B2K fans. This makes the 
			film's rather weak representation of at least one source of tension 
			-- Omarion getting all the attention -- something like the 
			proverbial car wreck, simultaneously hard to see and hard to turn 
			away from. At least the dance scenes supply their own, more potent, 
			mini-dramas, so the rest of it becomes less salient.</font></td>
