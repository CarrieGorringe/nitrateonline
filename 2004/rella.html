            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 16 April 2004</i></font><p>
			<font face="Verdana" size="5">Terribly literal </font></p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Parminder K. Nagra won all kinds 
			of well-deserved praise for her winning performance in <i>Bend It 
			Like Beckham</i> last year. Over this year, she's been visible on <i>
			ER</i>, the soapy series allowing for lots of dramatic stretching. 
			Now she appears, all too briefly, in <i>Ella Enchanted</i>, an 
			updated fairy tale that, for all its charms, can't quite break out 
			of its old-time constraints. </font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Nagra plays the Best Friend, Areida, 
			who appears when Ella of Frell (vivacious Anne Hathaway, star of the 
			mini-franchise <i>Princess Diaries</i>) needs backup for her 
			&quot;independent-minded&quot; activities. The context for these activities is 
			lifted in equal parts from <i>Cinderella</i>, <i>Shrek</i>, and <i>
			The Princess Bride</i>, with seemingly general inspiration from <i>
			The Bullwinkle Show</i>'s beloved &quot;Fractured Fairy Tales.&quot; The girls 
			live in a kingdom ruled, temporarily, by a self-involved martinet, 
			the Prince Regent Edgar (Cary Elwes, neatly inverting his own most 
			famous role, in <i>Princess Bride</i>). Among his most effective 
			laws is institutional segregation, subjugating ogres, elves, and 
			giants to the service of humans. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Ella Enchanted</i>'s obvious 
			parable sets Ella and Areida's naïve belief in fairness and goodness 
			against easy-to-dislike adversaries (&quot;Say No to Ogrecide!&quot; and &quot;Stop 
			the Giant Land Grab,&quot; read their protest placards at one rally). 
			Aside from Edgar, these include Ella's nasty stepmother Olga (<i>Ab 
			Fab</i>'s Joanna Lumley) and her daughters, go-getting Hattie (Lucy 
			Punch) and slow-witted Olive (Jennifer Higham), who endeavor to 
			demonstrate their own superiority by insisting on Ella's 
			subservience. Ella's resistance is immeasurably complicated by a 
			&quot;gift&quot; she receives at birth from the tetchy fairy Lucinda (Vivica 
			A. Fox), namely, the &quot;gift of obedience.&quot; </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is a terribly literal gift: Ella 
			does precisely what she's told, from holding her tongue to hopping 
			to it. At first, no one knows of this curse except Ella's 
			soon-to-be-dead mother and Aunt Mandy (Minnie Driver), a flitty 
			house fairy, know about the gift. When they finally inform Ella of 
			her condition, she's relieved to know there's a reason for her 
			irrational acting against her own wishes. Following her mother's sad 
			death and her traveling salesman father's (Patrick Bergin) 
			remarriage, her stepsisters discover Ella's secret (mainly because 
			Hattie is indescribably bossy). </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Her life now intolerable, Ella 
			resolves to find Lucinda and get her to &quot;take back&quot; that gift. 
			Reasonably worried over her niece's welfare, Mandy stays behind 
			(she's a house fairy, thus, apparently immobile), but also gives her 
			a gift, the use of her fiancé, Benny (Jimi Mistry, of <i>The Guru</i>), 
			whom she accidentally turned into a book some time ago. He is, both 
			conveniently and inconveniently, now able to show locations of 
			people Ella might be seeking. So, she sees Lucinda crashed out on a 
			bed following a drinking-binge, but the location of the bed is 
			unknown. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When Ella takes off with Benny 
			under her arm, she is otherwise alone, as her terrible stepmother 
			has commanded Ella to tell Arieda she never wants to see her again 
			because she is &quot;Arethean&quot; (read: not like Ella and her step-family, 
			or maybe just not white). Both girls tear up at this terrible 
			directive, though Arieda can't know why she is so betrayed. And so, 
			she's banished from the movie until the inevitable happy finale's 
			reunion. Still, as in most fairy tales, the heroine's road trip 
			leads her to pick up a few new friends along with way, including a 
			chatty elf, Slannen (Aiden McArdle), who aspires to be a lawyer but 
			is condemned by Edgar's law to &quot;entertain,&quot; as that is all elves can 
			do. (He's especially angry at the &quot;stinkin' Grimm Brothers,&quot; who 
			have instilled prejudice in their readers.) </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A fourth team member -- after the 
			girl, the book, and the elf -- at least in spirit, is Prince Char 
			(Hugh Dancy), who is scheduled to be crowned king within a week. 
			Edgar, of course, is not crazy about this prospect, and so he is 
			plotting feverishly against losing his position, with the help of a 
			magical CGI snake named Heston (voiced by Steve Coogan). As Char 
			contemplates his future, Edgar convinces him not to change the laws 
			Edgar has enacted, and to follow his own dictate: &quot;Image is 
			everything.&quot; While Char is pretty, he's also pop-starrishly vapid, 
			easing into his inherited position without any thought of what it 
			means. He's just as happy to let Edgar run the show. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Plainly in need of inspiration by 
			the much smarter Ella, Char finds her resistance to him seductive. 
			Whereas every other girl in the kingdom keeps his poster on her 
			wall, imagining she'll marry him like boy band boy (for instance, 
			Hattie, who feels threatened by Char's attraction to her 
			stepsister), Ella insists on following her own socially activist 
			conscience: she wants to free the slaves and oh yes, free her own 
			essentially enslaved mind. &quot;Nobody should be forced to do things 
			they don't want to do,&quot; she asserts. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Based on Gail Carson Levine's book,
			<i>Ella Enchanted</i> brings clever fairy tale credentials 
			(including narrator Eric Idle) in its energetic pursuit of a finale 
			where Ella can have her cake and eat it too, that is, her 
			proto-feminist independence and her prince. As fairy tales go, this 
			one looks healthy, at least for the white girl. That she must also 
			serve as the spokesperson and agitator for the many other oppressed 
			peoples of Frell is rather less adorable. A little more Areida might 
			have gone a long way. </font></td>
