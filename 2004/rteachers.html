            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 23 January 2004</i></font><p>
			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the animated feature <i>
			Teacher's Pet</i>, Spot is a dog who wants to be a boy, much to the 
			exasperation of Leonard, the boy he lives with -- Leonard just wants 
			to have a dog who's content with being a dog and doing things like 
			fetching a stick. Spot, though, has gone so far as to accompanying 
			Leonard to school each day (like the lamb did with Mary)---wearing 
			human clothes and a Jughead-like hat (which Mary's lamb did not 
			deign to do), he's become a classmate, named Scott, with a perfect 
			attendance record (dogs are punctual), in a class taught by Mrs. 
			Helperman, Leonard's mother, who never notices that Scott is a dog. 
			Well, for one thing, Spot/Scott talks, albeit here with a comically 
			lamenting voice provided by Nathan Lane. Plus, Spot has blue fur 
			and, wonder of wonders, a navel.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film is based on an animated TV 
			series which was, in turn, based on the work of artist Gary Baseman, 
			who was allegedly when he began wondering what his dog, Hubcaps, got 
			up to when he wasn't home. The film, which openly acknowledges its 
			debt to <i>Pinocchio</i> by ribbing that animated film in the very 
			first scene---sends Spot, Leonard, and Leonard's mother barreling 
			down to Florida, where the mother is quickly dispensed with when she 
			goes off to participate in some sort of teaching competition. That 
			leaves Spot and Leonard free to track down one Dr. Krank, who has 
			developed a method whereby he can change animals into humans (and 
			who is voiced by, believe it or not, Kelsey Grammer). Training his 
			mighty ray machine on a frog, he activates it and, afterwards, 
			discovers that the frog can now say &quot;moo,&quot; like a cow. (Which was 
			the point at which the movie then totally won me over.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The characters and artwork in <i>
			Teacher's Pet</i> look like a cross between the squiggly creations 
			in Max Fleischer's cartoon and what you might find doodled on a 
			schoolkid's three-ring binder with a ball-point pen. The film got 
			run-over on its opening weekend by the Hobbits and the Orcs, which 
			will probably cause another round in the debate over whether 
			old-style cell-drawn animation is less popular than Pixar animation; 
			one other reason may be that people aren't too sure just what to 
			expect from the movie. Both unpredictability and the hand-drawn 
			quality are what gives the movie its charm, though: at just over 70 
			minutes, the picture moves at a clip that never seems too fast, and 
			the plethora and array of jokes are amazing---they even manage to 
			get in some jabs at &quot;hate-mongering&quot; television jokes, and the lush 
			song score both approximates and parodies the ones that became 
			popular with <i>The Little Mermaid</i> and <i>Beauty and the Beast</i>.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Spot does get his wish to become a 
			&quot;hairy-knuckled grown-up&quot; (his &quot;dog years&quot; figure in his 
			transformation), and in trying to explain his presence to his 
			mother, the roles in Leonard's home life become all confused---at 
			one point, it looks like the only way to restore order once again is 
			if Leonard turned himself into a dog. The movie's daffiness, its 
			wildly inventive and delightfully odd quality, gives it energy and 
			the courage to go out on a narrative limb. But it also has to admit 
			that being a dog has its advantages, too, and that friendship may be 
			more important than just becoming a &quot;hairy-knuckled grown-up.&quot; That 
			this observation feels right and does not come off as a conventional 
			cop-out is yet one more credit to the film's advantage. That, plus 
			the song near the beginning where, in a borrowed &quot;Wentawaygo,&quot; Spot, 
			Leonard and Leonard's mother sing a breathless cadenza that crams in 
			references to all fifty states, and when one character observes, 
			&quot;Florida-smorita! It's Jersey with palm trees!&quot;</font><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
