</font><i><font size="1" face="Verdana">interview by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan 
Lybarger</a>, 16 April 2003</font></i></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Director Martha Coolidge has several notable 
achievements, but she's best remembered for a couple of films she directed two 
decades ago. </font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That's not to diminish her term as the first 
woman to serve as the president of the Directors Guild of America (from 
2002-2003). She's helmed a pair of first rate literary adaptations: Calder 
Willingham's <i>Rambling Rose</i> (1991), which won her the Best Director prize 
at the Independent Spirit Awards, and Neil Simon's <i>Lost in Yonkers</i> 
(1993).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Her work for television has been even more 
formidable. He directed the pilot for the cult police comedy <i>Sledge Hammer!</i> 
and earned an DGA nominations for the &quot;1972&quot; segment of <i>If These Walls Could 
Talk, Part II</i> starring Michelle Williams and Chloë Sevigny and for <i>
Introducing Dorothy Dandridge</i>, which netted Halle Berry an Emmy. She's also 
directed episodes of the hugely popular <i>Sex and the City</i>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still, the films that people constantly site 
around her are the 80's comedies <i>Valley Girl</i> (1983) and <i>Real Genius</i> 
(1985). Both opened to unexpectedly strong reviews. On the audio commentary 
track for the new DVD edition of the former, Coolidge admits that it was 
originally designed as an exploitation film (trying to capitalize on the song by 
Frank Zappa), but the backers were pleasantly surprised when she delivered a 
&quot;real movie.&quot; The movies also launched the careers of two green actors named 
Nicolas Cage and Val Kilmer. Despite the time that has passed, both flicks are 
still remarkably popular.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In a roundtable interview held last month in 
Kansas City, she recalled, &quot;<i>Valley Girl</i> and <i>Real Genius</i> are really 
like anthem pictures for certain people of certain age groups. They've grown. 
They've <i>grown</i>. It's more people, because I think they did it with that 
age group and younger. When I first started going to Washington to lobby for 
artists' rights. It was the young aides. We'd go in with all these elderly 
directors. All the Senators and Congressmen oooh and ah over all these elderly 
directors, and then the aides would be all over me. 'Oh, my God! <i>Real</i> <i>
Genius</i>!'&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b>80s Redux</b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Coolidge was in town (and even wore an 
appropriate &quot;Oz&quot; ring to boot) to plug her latest movie, <i>The Prince &amp; Me</i>, 
which is also aimed for a younger crowd. It features Julia Stiles (<i>Mona Lisa 
Smile</i>) as a workaholic college student whose plans for medical school get 
derailed when she starts falling for a rich, seemingly spoiled Danish playboy 
(British actor Luke Mably, <i>28 Days Later</i>),<i> </i>who turns out to be the 
heir to the throne of his native land. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With all the time that has passed between her 
breakthrough films and her current offering, it was tempting to ask the 
57-year-old director how young people had changed over the last two decades. She 
immediately replied, &quot;I hate to say it, but the 80's are back. It's really 
weird. I even took a bow to the 80's and put The Cars in <i>The Prince &amp; Me</i>. 
I don't know what it is.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;First, this music is still being played, which 
is really interesting. Secondly, I think the real change is even though the 80s 
came out of a punk era and the glitter rock before it, and in that sense it was 
real rebellion. The punk era was a real reaction to all that glitter and glam of 
that other world.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;We've been in a really cynical time. All these 
styles are kind of <i>styles</i>. They're adopted. They're kind of pushed by 
everything from Paris to marketing. It's kind of marketing <i>styles</i>. I 
don't know how real the rebellion is except for rap, and that's all been 
adopted, too. I think it's a hard thing to find what it is that you can really 
make a youthful rebellious statement with.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Indeed, rebellion may not be much of an option 
for her two main characters because the pressures young people face these days 
are much different. Coolidge even felt some affinity with her career-oriented 
female protagonist. &quot;I think that those two characters are representative of the 
kind of perspectives that young people can have today,&quot; she explains. &quot;I really 
do. In order to have a career, a woman has to be so focused. Boys know it, too. 
It's hard. Companies are asking you to work 16, 14 hours a day. I know people 
who say I chose not to go into the stock market because I didn't want to never 
be home. I know in the film business, forget it. It's 16-20 hours a day. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;You can get waylaid. You get off track. You 
start doing the wrong thing. I knew if I had a baby young, how am I ever going 
to become a director? It wasn't even in the cards. I couldn't even consider it. 
Now, I don't think I was emotionally ready to either. But I absolutely identify 
with that aspect of her character.&quot; It should be noted the director now has a 
son, whom she named after he hero, fellow filmmaker Preston Sturges.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In an odd way, the director also has something 
in common with male protagonist as well. You could even loosely say she's 
royalty, because she's a distant cousin of President Calvin Coolidge. &quot;My 
grandfather was his cousin, not first cousin, but knew him and tried to model 
his life after Calvin's life. When (my Grandfather) ran for governor, he lost,&quot; 
she said. &quot;I don't know what it has meant to me in my life except that I never 
questioned that I was American. I was used to having American history being 
personal to me. In other words, when we talked about the Pilgrims, I felt that I 
was related to Pilgrims, or as my grandmother kept telling me, 'Puritans.' The 
fact that she could make that differentiation tells you something.&quot; </font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana">The Coolidge Touch</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Although she has rarely taken a writing credit 
for her films, Coolidge's personal experiences repeatedly influence her movies, 
no matter where they might be set. For example, she based the dining room scenes 
in <i>Rambling Rose </i>on dinners she remembers attending at her grandmother's 
when she was a child, and her first noteworthy film, <i>Not a Pretty Picture</i> 
(1975), for which she is credited as a writer, is a semi-autobiographical 
account of an experience she had with date rape.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><font size="2">Even <i>The Prince and Me</i> features an 
interesting on camera reflection of her own life. Toward the end of the film, 
Julia Stiles' character flies to Copenhagen to pursue the Prince. &quot;I did that. I 
was 22,&quot; she remembered. &quot;I fell in love with a French Canadian in New York 
City. I left the country, moved to Montréal and stood in line and emigrated 
without really even finding out if he really wanted me there. [I] found out that 
some people who like long distance relationships, <i>really</i> like them long 
distance. On the other hand, I got a really great job at a TV station, and I 
worked for television for a year and a half and came back to the </font><a target="_top">
<font size="2">States</font></a><span class="MsoCommentReference"><a class="msocomanchor" id="_anchor_1" onmouseover="msoCommentShow('_anchor_1','_com_1')" onmouseout="msoCommentHide('_com_1')" language="JavaScript" name="_msoanchor_1" href="#_msocom_1" target="_top"><font size="2">[DL1]</font></a><span style="display: none"><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></span><font size="2">.&quot;</font></font></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana">The Talent Scout</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Coolidge has been known for introducing 
up-and-coming male performers to wider audiences. For example, <i>Angie</i> 
offered a memorable early role for <i>Sopranos </i>star James Gandolfini (who 
landed the role in part because he was one of the few actors who auditioned who 
was taller than star Geena Davis). &quot;I loved him. I thought, oh, my this is a 
leading man. I couldn't hold out,&quot; she said. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In <i>The Prince &amp; Me</i>, however, she 
discovered Europe. In nearly three decades of filmmaking, she had never worked 
there. Although the &quot;Danish&quot; scenes in the film were primarily shot in the less 
expensive location of Prague, Coolidge recalls a visit to Denmark helped cement 
the country as a setting for the story. &quot;I expected some cold, dingy, <i>Hamlet</i>-y-looking, 
Elsinore, gloomy gray castle. And what do I find but glorious fantasy. It's a 
fairy tale land. It's got spires and dragons on the lampposts of the Stock 
Exchange, these incredible castles that don't look like any castle I've ever 
seen,&quot; she recalled. While she loved the locations, she did find adjusting to 
Czech working conditions a challenge. &quot;The people were great in the Czech 
Republic, but they were very inexperienced because there were a couple of other 
movies in town and you've got a lot of young people on the crew. They don't 
really have the same system. In fact, it's arguable that in certain departments 
they don't have any system. Consequently, you're coming in and you're teaching, 
I don't like to say that because it sounds condescending, but you are trying to 
organize something that isn't inherently organized, and the way they do it is 
they don't have the tight schedules to shoot it.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Coolidge is proud to have made some darker and 
more substantial films like <i>Rambling Rose</i>, <i>Not a Pretty Picture</i> 
and <i>Introducing Dorothy Dandridge</i>, which dealt with the troubled life of 
the real-life African-American singer-actress who demolished several racial 
barriers through her work. Still, the cheerier new film appealed to her. &quot;That's 
sort of why I wanted to make it. I get to my razor blade tolerance level, too. I 
like those [kind of] movies, but I reach a point.&quot;</font>&nbsp;</p>
