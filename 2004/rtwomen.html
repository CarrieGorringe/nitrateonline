			<a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 26 March 2004</i></font><p>
			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;The dentists are coming!&quot; cries 
			Pvt. Leslie Cuthbertson, both fists raised jubilantly in the air, 
			during one point in the British film <i>Two Men Went to War</i>. 
			Both Cuthbertson and Sgt. Peter King have been serving at a base in 
			Aldershot, in the early part of 1942, where King has been drilling 
			recruits and Cuthbertson has been training to serve in the Army 
			Dental Corp (yes, there really appears to have been such a thing). 
			When King is passed over for a promotion, and Cuthbertson expresses 
			the fact that he doesn't feel like spending the war sitting on his 
			&quot;bum&quot; making dentures, the sergeant takes the private out the front 
			gate of the base one morning, at a fast trot and with loaded 
			backpacks, whence to a train for Plymouth, where they commandeer a 
			boat to cross the Channel into occupied France and perform some 
			mild-to-moderate sabotage work in aid to the British war effort 
			against Nazi Germany.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">How they manage to get as far as 
			they do has something to do as well with how the film gradually 
			exudes a charming, even gentle, hold on your attention -- both King 
			(played by Leo Bill) and Cuthbertson (Kenneth Cranham) aren't 
			violent men by nature, they're fairly unassuming, and so they don't 
			readily call attention to themselves. (They almost get caught by a 
			railway conductor on the train to Plymouth, but they bluff and 
			prevaricate their way out of it successfully.) The fact that the 
			harshest thing they do in dealing with the enemy is by klonking one 
			of them on the head with a shovel only seems to add to their 
			particular victory. Leo Bill, who has an angular face that has the 
			look of not quite having filled out with adulthood as of yet (but 
			may just be about to), gives Cuthbertson an optimism and 
			adventurousness -- he seems eager to see what there is to see, even 
			when out in the middle of what is ostensibly enemy territory. (The 
			two British soldiers initial trek across a green, nearly deserted 
			French countryside has the feeling of an idyll.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film (based on a true story, 
			or, as an opening title puts it, &quot;Most of what follows is true&quot;), 
			never turns, to its credit, into a pseudo-Monty Python sketch 
			(something along the lines of, &quot;An army marches on its teeth, so 
			every dentist must come to the aid of...,” or something to that 
			effect), nor does it stiffen into a handsome, lacquered &quot;prestige&quot; 
			piece. But the film seems small. We are only given some very basic, 
			general idea of what motivates the two men into trying to pull off 
			what is an outrageous and possibly dangerous stunt -- the aging 
			King, who served in the First World War and has a medal to prove it, 
			wants the chance to do one last great thing, while Cuthbertson wants 
			to do something more to fight the Nazis (there is a glancing 
			reference to his being in London, which, by 1942, has been hit very 
			hard by the Blitzkrieg, but no explanation as to how he ended up 
			being assigned to dental chores for the Army) -- but nothing larger 
			than that which would give it more meaning. Nor do we get much of an 
			idea as to of how what they do fits into the larger scheme of 
			things. It's not until the two men are put on court martial for 
			desertion and dereliction of duty -- after they have been put into 
			the mortifying position of being unable to prove what they 
			accomplished right under the enemy's nose -- that an officer and aid 
			to Winston Churchill, played by Derek Jacobi, sweeps in and pretty 
			much saves the men's bacon by showing that their act of sabotage, 
			involving a handful of grenades, just happened to coincide with a 
			major covert raid that had been planned all along. That the men just 
			happened to succeed by coincidence is mitigated by the aid's news 
			that it helped pull the prime minister, Winston Churchill, out of a 
			serious funk into which he had fallen while brooding over the 
			British efforts in the African campaign.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While Kenneth Cranham never 
			entirely lets King turn into a standard-issue British military 
			bulldog, nor Bill allow Cuthbertson to remain first and only a 
			wet-eared pup, Jacobi's appearance in the film is nonetheless 
			marvelous, playing an Army Major who shuttles between the mailroom, 
			where who he calls &quot;the garden room girls&quot; open the daily mail to 
			Whitehall (Sgt. King, prior to the &quot;mission,” has posted his and 
			Cuthbertson's paybooks, along with a letter of explanation and 
			intent, there), on down into the bowels beneath Downing Street, 
			where Churchill and his long-suffering secretary (Phyllida Hall, 
			who's exquisite) toil, and back again. Jacobi manages to find some 
			way to bring his character fully and vividly to life every time he's 
			on the screen -- something, I'm afraid, the film, pleasant and 
			enjoyable as it may be on some levels, never entirely manages to 
			with Cuthbertson and King, who remain light, quaint figures to the 
			very last.</font></td>
