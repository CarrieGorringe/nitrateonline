            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 23 January 2003</i></font><p>
			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Elmore Leonard’s crime novels have 
			a lot fine traits that make them terrific fodder for movies:</font></b></p>
			<ul>
				<li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Quirky but believable 
				characters, in particular female protagonists who have something 
				more to do than look good on the hero’s arm</font></b></li>
				<li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Snappy dialogue</font></b></li>
				<li><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">A droll, acidic wit</font></b></li>
			</ul>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That’s not to say bringing his 
			books to the screen is easy. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With Leonard’s serpentine plot 
			lines, it takes a deft hand to bring these stories to film because 
			viewers only have a few seconds to grasp what’s happening while 
			readers can always go back a few pages to catch what they’ve missed.
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It takes a sharp adapter like Scott 
			Frank (<i>Get Shorty</i>, <i>Out of Sight</i>) or Quentin Tarantino 
			(who retooled Leonard’s <i>Rum Punch</i> into <i>Jackie Brown</i>) 
			who can ably pick out what elements to cut or keep from the books. 
			Both made interesting deviations (the film of <i>Out of Sight</i> 
			features more of the character Albert Brooks plays) that helped the 
			films to flow much more smoothly.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Screenwriter Sebastian Guiterrez (<i>Gothika</i>) 
			hasn’t quite mastered the art in his reworking of Leonard’s <i>The 
			Big Bounce</i>. Despite some inspired casting and a photogenic 
			Hawaiian backdrop, neither Guiterrez nor director George Armitage 
			imbue the tale with Leonard's unique balance of wit and tension.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The filmmakers should at least get 
			some credit for selecting a nearly ideal leading man. With his 
			crooked nose and generally goofy manner, Owen Wilson effortlessly 
			occupies the run down shoes of Jack Ryan (not the Tom Clancy hero).
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jack has gravitated to the Aloha 
			state after bungling his way through the American mainland. Able to 
			do little than lose legitimate gigs or steal relative paltry sums by 
			breaking and entering, Jack almost winds up in jail for swinging a 
			baseball bat at his mean-spirited foreman (Vinnie Jones). Curiously, 
			the charges against him are quickly dropped, and Walter Crewes 
			(Morgan Freeman), the judge who could have presided over the case, 
			hires Jack as a handyman at his collection of resort cabins.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While Freman might imbue the judge 
			with his usual stern paternal manner, Crewes has taken a liking to 
			Jack because his stunt has slowed the construction of a luxury hotel 
			by crooked tycoon Ray Ritchie (Gary Sinise). Ritchie's venture could 
			hurt the judge's own plans, and most of the locals hate the smug 
			mogul's manner. People seem to think even less of him for building a 
			hotel when he's in the middle of Chapter 11 bankruptcy.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Through some accounting wizardry 
			that would make Enron proud, Ritchie manages to keep hundreds of 
			thousands of dollars stashed to pay off local unions in his hunting 
			lodge. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Because even his gorgeous mistress 
			Nancy (Sara Foster, a former model who can thankfully do more than 
			look good in a bikini) hates Ray's guts, she's more than eager to 
			tip the beleaguered Jack into trying to break in and swipe it. After 
			engaging in all sorts of illicit thrills like stealing cars and 
			having sex in bizarre locations, Jack, who's better judgment is 
			non-existent, is as eager as he is wary.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>The Big Bounce </i>might have 
			been a little more fun if Jack were a little more of the latter. 
			Nancy may be attractive, but a viewer keeps wondering why he's not 
			more concerned about the dangerous types who defend Ray's interests. 
			On paper, Armitage would seem the perfect helmer for this material 
			because his adaptation of Charles Willeford's <i>Miami Blues</i> 
			effortlessly alternated between genuine chills and off-kilter humor.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>The Big Bounce</i>, however, 
			lacks anything as threatening as Alec Baldwin's sadistically suave 
			con artist in the previous film. Most of Jack's antagonists, like a 
			bone-headed thug played by Charlie Sheen, pose less than a nominal 
			menace. Jack's rivals are even dimmer than he is, so it's hard to 
			get worked up over whether any of them wind up with the loot. </font>
			</p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Armitage plays things just a little 
			too broadly. Some of the performers, like the normally terrific Bebe 
			Neuwirth as Ray's disgruntled wife, have little more to do than ham 
			it up. As a result, the film seems oddly languid for its almost 
			90-minute running time. The abrupt transitions almost make one 
			wonder if a good chuck of the movie is on the cutting room floor.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thankfully, the banter has some of 
			Elmore's flair (Freeman advises a maladroit associate, &quot;Don't think. 
			It's bad for the team.&quot;), and Wilson can get a few laughs simply by 
			flashing his klutzy grin.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>The Big Bounce</i> is actually a 
			remake of a 1969 adaptation that starred Ryan O'Neal as Jack. The 
			original version is finally coming out on video in March, but if 
			Leonard Maltin's assessment (&quot;muddle-headed tale&quot;) is still valid, 
			neither version offers an honest take on Elmore Leonard's singular 
			vision of grifting.</font></td>
