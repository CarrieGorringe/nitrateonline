<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><span style="color: black">Washington's 
harshest winter in many years was on the verge of melting away into the Potomac 
River when Jean-Paul Rappeneau arrived in town in advance of his latest film <i>
Bon Voyage</i>, a World War II story of intertwined lives populated by farcical 
elements. In the course of a short 30-minute interview, the Spring blossoms 
surrounding Georgetown's Four Seasons Hotel would inch up a few millimeters in 
anticipation of the warmth both the director-writer and his new feature have 
brought to town, dropping down from New York City before moving on to San 
Francisco. </span></b></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color: black">The beige turtleneck 
shirt, dark jacket, and khaki trousers frame a man of medium height and calm, 
unpretentious demeanor. A simple gold wedding ring adorns the fourth finger of 
his left hand. No gaudy chains. No spectacles either, as we chatted in a third 
floor corner suite with the assistance of a translator who was friendly but 
obviously not that keen on doing a word-for-word, or even cliché-for-cliché 
conversion. The few visits the director has made to this country promoting his 
films has not afforded him an opportunity to pick up English as easily as many 
of the French actors he has worked with over the years. My limited high school 
French caught some of what was missed. Only in moments like this do I regret 
that I detested my French teacher so much back in the 1960s, but I suspect the 
feeling was mutual. She convinced me that there was no literal translation for 
my name; she christened me Philippe. <i>Zut, alors!</i></span></font></p>

complimented by a doorknocker beard and calm, blue eyes.&nbsp;</span></font></p>

			</font></span><font size="2">Welcome back to America, and with a

			I offer him birthday wishes. Jean-Paul grimaces when I mentioned 
			he's about to turn 72.) Can you provide us some background on your 
			growing up and how did you become a filmmaker. I know you were not

<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><span style="color: black"><font size="2">
Jean-Paul Rappeneau:</font></span></i></b><span style="color: black"><font size="2"> 
(chuckling) No, no. I was born in the town of Auxerre. Thinking of my childhood, 
the memories of war immediately come to the fore. The occupation, the 
liberation, the arrival of the Americans. In the aftermath of the war, American 
films (&quot;<i>cinema American&quot;</i> is his term, making the films seem more exotic), 
banned by the Nazis, all of a sudden came to France. This is a vivid memory. As 
a kid I dreamed of being in theatre, because he didn't see any movies in my 
small village.</font></span></font></p>
            <hr size="1">
            <p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><span style="color: black">
			<font size="2">Elias Savada:</font></span></i></b><span style="color: black"><font size="2"> 
			So how did you get from that small town to being an assistant with 
			Louis Malle on <i>La vie privée</i> or making short films?</font></span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><span style="color: black"><font size="2">
Jean-Paul Rappeneau:</font></span></i></b><span style="color: black"><font size="2"> 
I decided I wanted to be a film director after seeing <i>Citizen Kane</i> in 
Auxenne, presented at the cinema club. I was of college age, having gotten my 
high school diploma. As a gift, my father gave me a camera. I started making 
short 16mm films. My father said maybe you'll do some movies, but first get a 
real job. The old story. So, I studied law in Paris. I had brought my movies 
with me while attending the university, showed them around. One person involved 
in the movie business asked him &quot;Why are you studying law? You seem to have 
understood everything there is to know about movie making!&quot; Thus, I became an 
assistant, made more shorts, this time in 35mm, became a friend of Louis Malle, 
and we wrote <i>Zazie dans le metro</i> together. I worked writing scripts with 
Philippe de Broca, Alain Cavalier. <i>Le Nouvelle vague</i> (The New Wave, the 
creative burst of French cinematic talent in the late 1950s). Then, taking more 
time than most other people, while all the New Wave directors were putting out 
their first films, I was slower, because I was always writing scripts. It wasn't 
until 1966 with <i>La vie de château (A Matter of Resistance)</i>.</font></span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color: black">It was unusual for 
New Wave films to be both a critical and commercial success.<i> La vie de 
château</i> was. It won the Prix Louis Delluc. (The highest award, inaugurated 
in 1936 in honor of the French film critic, bestowed by French cinema for 
filmmaking achievement.) It was a grand public success.&nbsp;</span></font></p>

            <p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><span style="color: black">
			<font size="2">Elias Savada:</font></span></i></b><span style="color: black"><font size="2"> 
			There is a lengthy span between your projects. (Jea n-Paul nods in 
			agreement.) It's obvious you have a longer creative process, or 
			maybe you like taking long walks in the countryside. Before <i>Bon 
			Voyage</i> (released in 2003 in France), your last film was in 1995 
			with <i>Le Hussard sur le toit (The Horseman on the Roof)</i>. Was 
			the 7-8 year gap (he gasps in mock horror) devoted to preparing <i>
			Bon Voyage</i>? Or was it 3-4 years with a break?</font></span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><span style="color: black"><font size="2">
Jean-Paul Rappeneau:</font></span></i></b><span style="color: black"><font size="2"> 
It was 3 or 4 years working on the script. Developing a film becomes my life. I 
can't be thinking about the next project when I'm making one. I am completely 
immersed in the film at hand. Like a shipwreck on a beach. I have no idea about 
what I am going to do next. So that is the time lapse between finishing one 
movie and then literally falling in love again with a new topic. For example, 
after having finished <i>The Horseman on the Roof</i> I starting thinking of 
many projects, but none of them (until <i>Bon Voyage</i>) worked out.</font></span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color: black">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
            <hr size="1">
            <p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><span style="color: black">
			<font size="2">Elias Savada:</font></span></i></b><span style="color: black"><font size="2"> 
			So, there were other projects you were contemplating?</font></span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><span style="color: black"><font size="2">
Jean-Paul Rappeneau:</font></span></i></b><span style="color: black"><font size="2"> 
Yes, yes, yes. There was a certain film being prepared about Napoleon in exile 
in St. Helena. I worked on this for over a year as a screenwriter. I stopped 
believing in the project, which came from Daniel Auteil, the French actor, who 
wanted to play Napoleon. The only thing that interested me about the subject 
were his final years, in exile. Ultimately, Auteil thought my script a downer, 
although he did like the manner in which the character was portrayed. There was 
a lot of hesitation back and forth before I can commit to a project. That's my 
character.</font></span></font></p>
            <hr size="1">
            <p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><span style="color: black">
			<font size="2">Elias Savada:</font></span></i></b><span style="color: black"><font size="2"> 
			The films that you've directed, and I believe there are seven 
			features, you've always co-written the screenplay.</font></span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><span style="color: black"><font size="2">
Jean-Paul Rappeneau:</font></span></i></b><span style="color: black"><font size="2">

			<font size="2">Elias Savada:</font></span></i></b><span style="color: black"><font size="2"> 
			You never do the script on your own. It's always a collaboration. 
			Obviously, that is something you prefer. Do you like bouncing ideas 
			off of the other writers?</font></span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><span style="color: black"><font size="2">
Jean-Paul Rappeneau:</font></span></i></b><span style="color: black"><font size="2"> 
When you write for the movies, you need a spectator in front of you to speak 
back. I work in interaction with my other writers, bouncing ideas back and 
forth. I write a first draft on my own, bring in my friend, another writer, who 
will read it and react to it. In the case of <i>Bon Voyage</i>, that included my 
son Julien. Thus, there are several successive drafts of the script.</font></span></font></p>
            <hr size="1">
            <p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><span style="color: black">
			<font size="2">Elias Savada:</font></span></i></b><span style="color: black"><font size="2"> 
			This process would drag out the creative process then</font></span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><span style="color: black"><font size="2">
Jean-Paul Rappeneau:</font></span></i></b><span style="color: black"><font size="2"> 
Yes. Generally two years.</font></span></font></p>
            <hr size="1">
            <p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><span style="color: black">
			<font size="2">Elias Savada:</font></span></i></b><span style="color: black"><font size="2"> 
			In America we have screenwriter credits. </font></span>
			<font size="2">French films seem to differentiate this credit as 
			scenario (<i>scenariste</i>), adaptation and/or dialogue. I assume 
			the process must be universal, but can you elaborate on why the U.S. 
			vs. French credits differ like this?</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><span style="color: black"><font size="2">
Jean-Paul Rappeneau:</font></span></i></b><font size="2"> (Apparently not fully 
comprehending my question, Jean-Paul replies that the American writers' guilds 
determine who gets screen credit. I further clarify my question.) Okay, there is 
an old French movie tradition, that people speak a lot. Therefore, there are 
writing specialists who work in creating movie dialogue. There is a long 
tradition of using such people, and thus they receive dialogue credit. I worked 
with Daniel Boulanger, who did the dialogue for <i>La vie de château</i> and <i>
Les Mariés de 'an II</i> (unreleased in the U.S.). Michel Audiard, Henri Jeanson, 
even Jacques Prevert write dialogue. Daniel Boulanger is great at writing 
dialogue, but he is totally unable to construct a story, a plot. In working with 
Daniel Boulanger, I would fashion a sketch of the dialogue. Boulanger would come 
into the project, refashion my words, and make up some other lines that would be 
really great. I could never come up with such material. He has a taste for word, 
for language. Maybe that's specifically a French concept.</font></font></p>

            <p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><span style="color: black">
			<font size="2">Elias Savada:</font></span></i></b><span style="color: black"><font size="2"> 
			Probably. Americans don't always get the joke. That's the problem.</font></span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><span style="color: black"><font size="2">Your new film 
is rather frenzied, with a lot of action going on about the screen.</font></span><font size="2">
<i>The Horseman on the Roof</i> also had a lot of scampering about. In that film 
it was throughout the French countryside in the 1830s sidestepping cholera and 
crazed citizens. In <i>Bon Voyage</i> people are dashing from Paris to Bordeaux 
sidestepping the German invasion and crazed citizens.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><span style="color: black"><font size="2">
Jean-Paul Rappeneau:</font></span></i></b><font size="2"> Yes, there's a clear 
parallel between the two films.</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There is a hysterical farceness afoot, 
particularly in <b>Bon Voyage</b>—an epidemic actually that infects everyone in 
the cast. From where does this turmoil arise? Obvious Howard Hawks appears to be 
watching over you. Who else is?</font></p>
            <hr size="1">
            <p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><span style="color: black">
			<font size="2">Elias Savada:</font></span></i></b><font size="2"> 
			There is destructive hotel dining room sequence in <i>Bon Voyage</i> 
			which appears to be an expansion of a similar scene in <i>Horseman</i>, 
			in which Olivier Martinez's character chases a cat. Was that 
			intentional?</font></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><span style="color: black"><font size="2">
Jean-Paul Rappeneau:</font></span></i></b><font size="2"> No, that wasn't 
intentional. <i>Horseman on the Roof</i> is based on the post-war (1951) novel 
by the extraordinary writer Jean Giono. Cholera for Giono was a metaphor for war 
and the invasion of a country.</font></font></p>

			<font size="2">Elias Savada:</font></span></i></b><span style="color: black"><font size="2"> 
			In <i>Bon Voyage</i> you didn't use that metaphor. You had the war 
			itself.</font></span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana"><b><i><span style="color: black"><font size="2">
Jean-Paul Rappeneau:</font></span></i></b><font size="2"> Someone said of the
