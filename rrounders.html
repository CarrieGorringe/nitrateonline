<p><big><strong><big>I</big></strong>t&#146;s a good bluff, but a bad bet. Most of you
will make it through a few hands in <i>Rounders</i>, pushing it to the number one spot its
opening weekend. A compelling cast and gritty authenticity make an appealing diversion for
any intelligent filmgoer bored with the Bill and Monica story. But while this mildly
entertaining study of the Big Apple&#146;s high-stakes, low-life world of hard-core card
and loan sharks is heavy on atmosphere, it&#146;s flat on substance, poor on
relationships, big on predictability, and slow getting anywhere. And if you&#146;re an
exceptional poker player like handsome Mike McDermott (Matt Damon), it&#146;s hard going
cold turkey when you can read the opposition like an open book (and hence the reason
he&#146;s studying law -- what else is the legal profession but a big game). Jo (Gretchen
Mol), his blond squeeze, social conscience, and fellow student, further befuddles the
story, providing an unconvincing trifle of moral sense (that taking money from moronic
card players is no way to support yourself) before she heads for the comfort of moot court
and a life of her own. You&#146;d be best taking advice from both: he&#146;d tell you to

<p><img src="images/rrounders-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">First-time
screenwriters David Levien and Brian Koppelman and director John Dahl (<i>Red Rock West</i>,
<i>The Last Seduction</i>) have embedded <i>Rounders</i> with a plenty of gambling
vernacular and local color (with side trips to drab Binghampton, New York, and a garish
Atlantic City casino), effectively captured by cinematographer Jean Yves Escoffier (<a href="fberlin98-5.html#Good-Will-Hunting" target="_top"><i>Good Will Hunting</i></a>), but their
characters are painted with flat strokes, with the possible exception of the compulsive
Worm. If you want a good gambling/con artist movie, head down to your local video store
and rent <i>The Grifters</i> (1990),<i>The Hustler</i> (1961), or, on a lighter side, <i>The
Sting</i> (1973). Norton (<i>Primal Fear</i>, <i>The People vs. Larry Flynt</i>) immerses
himself into this big bad egg of a sleaze role, and while I had no trouble hating his
character (God save your sole if you empathize with this loser), it takes way too long for
his school buddy to realize he&#146;s friends with an vile stick of aging dynamite --
unstable and ready to blow.</p>

<p>The confused McDermott gets a bruising, close-up view of the streets before grudgingly
seeking out his mentor, Professor Petrovsky (Martin Landau), an amiable judge with a
penchant for a friendly game of small stakes poker. The magistrate rambles on about his
own calling to the legal profession (despite a lifelong disconnection from a family of
rabbis) before anteing up some grub stakes to his sweet-talking, sad-puppy disciple for
the expected showdown with KGB. The now ex-pupil realizes his future lies outside the law
and in the draw of the cards. At this point, it becomes a rooting match between the pretty
boy and the cookie monster, and it doesn&#146;t take much imagination to figure out who
wins. You don&#146;t.</p>
