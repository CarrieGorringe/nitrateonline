<p></font><img src="images/rzorro-1.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="132" HEIGHT="200"><font size="3">Our latest masked heroes (yes, two for the price of one) have been previously
portrayed on big screen and small by the likes of Douglas Fairbanks, Sr., Tyrone Power,
Guy Williams (you can catch these every night on The Disney Channel), Alain Delon, and
Frank Langella. The first twenty minutes has Zorro/Don Diego de la Vega (Anthony Hopkins)
setting up the comeback for the remaining 110 minutes, with a tarzanesque sequence
revealing the sinister proclivity of the dastardly Don Rafael Montero. Stuart
Wilson&#146;s vision of this notorious self-serving figure was the only weak point in the
film, coming across as a combination poor man&#146;s Richard Chamberlain/Herbert Lom.
Having worked with director Martin Campbell on No Escape (1994), Wilson is a serviceable
choice. But, still, the role begs for the same sinister spin that Alan Rickman gave Robin
Hood. The set up for the &quot;new&quot; Zorro falls to a large belief in mystical
coincidence, much Saturday afternoon serials did fifty years ago. The orphan Alejandro is,
20 years after having saved the cowled crusader from certain death, discovered carousing
by the aging Don Diego and enlisted to fight the scheming Don Rafael and set all wrongs
right. The dour and mournful elder Zorro proceeds to educate the youngster in the ways of
the sword and the heart, much like Batman teaching Robin a few years back. But heck, since
this movie is based on legend, the writers can take certain liberties and you, the viewer,
should say job well done.</p>

<p><img src="images/rzorro-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="133" HEIGHT="200">Matthew Letscher is
American Captain Harrison Love, a smarmy second foil (two zorros = two villains) that
you&#146;d love to smack on his oily head a few times. He&#146;s a blond-haired killer
who, no-doubt, will get the point by film&#146;s end. Other smaller but key roles are
filled by veteran Mexican actor Pedro Armendariz, Jr. and by the slap happy L. Q. Jones,
the latter as Three-Fingered Jack. I&#146;m not sure I&#146;d call this an ensemble piece,
but the actors all seem to get behind their roles gallantly and gleefully.</p>

<p>Martin Campbell, last behind the megaphone for 1995&#146;s <a href="rgldneye.html" target="_top"><i>GoldenEye</i></a>,
does a masterful job handling the period pyrotechnics and blocking his actors before the
camera as they trade barbs and barb swords. Kudos to Paul Meheux&#146;s sun-drenched
cinematography (lovely locations in Mexico subbing for an American West of bygone days),
Cecilia Mantiel&#146;s glorious production design from hacienda to hideout, Graciela
Maxon&#146;s stunning costume design showing our young leads in fine form, and James
Horner&#146;s stirring soundtrack. The filmmakers playfully send up the E.T. bicycle/moon
image early on in Zorro as homage to Steven Spielberg, who adds his illustrious name to
the show as one of the film&#146;s executive producers. And it was Spielberg who brought
Zeta-Jones to Campbell&#146;s attention. Thanks Steven!</p>

<p>The film screams for a sequel and I, for one, second that with a snappy touch and en
garde.</font></p>
