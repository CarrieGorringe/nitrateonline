<p><big><strong><big>I</big></strong>nevitably bigger and infinitely louder than the
similar-themed <a href="rdeepimpact.html" target="_top"><i>Deep Impact</i></a> (surprise: 1998's biggest
hit to date!), the engagingly dunder-headed <i>Armageddon</i> is, for better or worse,
precisely where high concept, big-budget, technology-laden Hollywood moviemaking is at
just now. Neither as blurrily stupid as <a href="rtherock.html" target="_top"><i>The Rock</i></a> nor as
cheerfully irreverent as <a href="rconair.html" target="_top"><i>Con Air</i></a> (über-producer Jerry
Bruckheimer's two previous summer spectacles), <i>Armageddon</i> is two and a half hours
of well-tooled, flag-waving fun that survives its pre-release bombast (don't be fooled by
the trailers selling it as a love story) to emerge as a holiday event that may not rival
Will Smith's last two years worth of world-saving (<a href="rid4.html" target="_top"><i>Independence Day</i></a>
and <a href="rmib.html" target="_top"><i>Men in Black</i></a>) in the all-important race for global box
office bucks but should be the default attraction to beat over the artificially long
holiday weekend and well into the lucrative summer season.</big></p>

<p><img src="images/rarmaged-1.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="149">Essentially a
class conflict larded over with testosterone-fueled patriotic posturing (what do you
expect from a movie that opens with narration by Charlton Heston?), the action pits NASA
eggheads, spearheaded by frustrated-astronaut-turned-administrator Dan Truman (Billy Bob
Thornton, fine against type) against maverick oilwell rigger Harry Stamper (an almost
smirkless Bruce Willis), who is hired to first train, then lead a group of one-dimensional
miscreants (ex-employees all) on a daring mission to fly to, land on, drill a hole in, and
detonate a nuclear device within a meteor the size of Texas &#150; a &quot;global
killer,&quot; in NASA-speak &#150; hurtling towards earth. Further disrupting Truman's
show is Stamper's pack of jokers, including hothead protege A.J. Frost (hunky but gawky
Ben Affleck), who spends his time either countermanding Harry's authority or wooing his
mentor's daughter Grace (moist-eyed Liv Tyler) &#150; usually in a spectacularly scenic
location or, in an unintentionally funny sequence, a dormant rocket booster.</p>

<p>Most of the other dirty dozen or so roughnecks are straight out of central casting,
Bruckheimer style. There's the priapic Rockhound (Steve Buscemi, essentially reprising the
shrewd wiseacre he played in <i>Con Air</i>), reluctantly resourceful Russian cosmonaut
Lev Andropov (Peter Stormare, Buscemi's tightly-wrapped partner from <i>Fargo</i>), can-do
right hand man Chick (Will Patton, underutilized again), emotionally frail big man Max
(Ken Campbell), and philosophizing stoner Oscar Choi (Owen Wilson), among others. William
Fichtner (<a href="rcontact.html" target="_top"><i>Contact</i></a>) is suitably shifty in an
ill-conceived sabatoguish subplot, while Jessica Steen's shuttle pilot character might've
made for a more interesting major character than some on display. Sharp-eyed buffs can
catch genre mainstays Lawrence Tierney, Grace Zabriskie, and newly ubiquitous Lars von
Trier regular Udo Kier in atmospheric yet miniscule support. </p>

<p><img src="images/rarmaged-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="148">A sweeping special
effects extravaganza, <i>Armageddon</i> bids for gravity in shots of anxious citizenry
awaiting the results of the mission in countries around the world, as first New York
(which has taken a real pummeling this year), then Shanghai, and even Paris fall victim to
stray chunks that herald the arrival of the big bang. As large as it is, though, the movie
finds time for more humorous, idiosyncratic gestures, including yet another jab at Noah
Emmerich and Dean Devlin, producers of <a href="rgodzilla.html" target="_top"><i>Godzilla</i></a>
(following hot on the heels of Fox Mulder's peeing on an Independence Day poster in <a href="rxfiles.html" target="_top"><i>The X Files: Fight the Future</i></a>), an early bit in which
Stamper drives golf balls from his oil rig to a Greenpeace ship and liberal sprinkles of
the same cockeyed junk culture ruminations that gave <i>Con Air</i> such a distinctive
voice amidst all the cliched violence (not surprisingly, Bruckheimer pressed four script
doctors into service tweaking the work of the five credited writers, giving <i>Armageddon</i>
the same quip-o-rama feel).</p>

<p>Yet within the cliched fray there can be glimpsed some legitimate, if fleeting, grace
notes, including a leg brace that eloquently explains Truman's yearning to make the trip,
the underlying gravity of the ramshackle Russian space station at which they refuel,
Chick's achingly predictable subplot involving the child who doesn't even know him (but is
encouraged to bond once Dad becomes famous) and even the valuable lessons about team
playing in moments of crisis (even though, like most movies of this sort, the narrative
violates its own precepts for the sake of gratuitous tension). Less successful is the
whole Affleck-Tyler romance, which feels awfully perfunctory and leaves Liv stranded at
Mission Control for most of the movie looking ruminative and distraught.</p>

<p><img src="images/rarmaged-3.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="126">In Michael Bay,
Bruckheimer has found a directorial soulmate. Mercifully, the director of <i>The Rock</i>
has tempered his frantic style somewhat (Tsui Hark he ain't), punctuating the movie with
shots of matter and rockets flying straight into the camera (low-budget 3-D genre films
did the same thing four decades ago, but quietly). Ex-Yesman Trevor Rabin's titanically
derivative score is punctuated by no less than four Aerosmith songs (howled, of course, by
Liv Tyler's eternally jaunty father Steven) as well as ZZ Top's &quot;La Grange&quot; and
Chantal Kreviazuk's cover of John Denver's &quot;Leaving on a Jet Plane,&quot; while
Michael White's production design successfully blends the realistic with the fantastic
(does NASA really have a huge hangar where everyone can get weightless?). At least a dozen
special effects houses have delivered some truly jaw-dropping sequences, prompting the
usual advisory with movies of this ilk that patrons seek out the biggest and best-equipped
theaters possible.</p>

<p>Forewarned is forearmed: while unlikely to make a deep impact on critics' year-end
best-of list (unless the newly-minted industry lapdog American Film Institute comes out
with a supplementary roster of easily-digestible populist classics &#150; really, <i>Pretty
Woman</i>?), <i>Armageddon</i> will quench an undiscerning thirst for big, loud summer
entertainment. The best advice is to let Bruckheimer be Bruckheimer and order extra
butter-flavored product as Willis and company kick a little asteroid.</p>
