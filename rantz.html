<p><big><strong><big>&quot;D</big></strong>on't worry, I know almost exactly what I'm
doing,&quot; dyspeptic worker ant Z-4195 (Woody Allen) confides to new love Princess Bala
(Sharon Stone) before he saves the entire colony from genocide at the, uh, hands of evil
General Mandible (Gene Hackman) towards the end of <i>Antz</i>, and his reluctant battle
cry could well serve as a motto for the entire enterprise. The much-ballyhooed new movie,
the latest bid by DreamWorks SKG to unseat Disney's reign as the chief provider of
popular, hi-tech animated films for all ages, knows almost exactly what it's doing,
courtesy of dazzling computer-generated animation (the first film made entirely in that
medium since the Mouse Factory's pioneering <a href="rtoystry.html" target="_top"><i>Toy Story</i></a>)
produced in Palo Alto, California -- the heart of Silicon Valley -- by Pacific Data
Images. Unfortunately, what's missing from the equation (the &quot;almost&quot; part of
&quot;exactly&quot;) is a heart beating underneath the glossy exterior: shallow and
cliched, <i>Antz</i> is eighty-five minutes of technical wizardry lacking any of the
fairytale sense of wonder promised by the bold new frontiers of the medium.</big></p>

<p><img src="images/rantz-1.jpg" hspace="15" vspace="4" align="right" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">First seen in
analysis (complaining of his fate as &quot;a middle child in a family of five
million,&quot; he's told by shrink Paul Mazursky, &quot;You ARE insignificant.&quot;), the
suspiciously Woody Allen-ish Z dreams of a better place and a better life, a fantasy
fueled by a chance encounter with a bar drunk scout ant (&quot;Frasier&quot;'s John
Mahoney) who tells him of a shimmering &quot;Insectopia&quot; just beyond the confines of
the totalitarian underground world. It's not a fantasy shared by either Z's spunky but
subservient co-worker Azteca (Jennifer Lopez) or Z's pal Weaver (Sylvester Stallone), a
slab-jawed warrior ant. Still, it is something to think about and dream of -- and, in Z's
case, kvetch and fret over. Meanwhile, Princess Bala (Stone), chafing over the promise her
mother the Queen (Anne Bancroft) made to marry her off to Mandible, slips away from the
palace for a night at the very same bar, where she boldly asks Z -- the only one not
dancing -- to cut some rug (their dance includes a brief but amusing doff of the hat to <i>Pulp
Fiction</i>).</p>

<p><i><img src="images/rantz-2.jpg" align="left" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150"></i>Smitten, Z
swaps places with Weaver to march past Bala as the troops are reviewed, and subsequently
manages to be the only one to survive a violent surprise battle with termites Mandible
forces the ants in to as part of his scheme for total domination (he's aided by his aid,
Colonel Cutter, voiced by Christopher Walken). Returning a war hero after the death of his
new friend Barbatus (Danny Glover), Z accidentally kidnaps Bala and begins an adventure in
the great outdoors that includes WASPish wasps Muffy (Jane Curtin) and Chip (Dan Aykroyd)
as well as the film's best sequence, an exhilarating ride on a wad of bubble gum affixed
to the bottom of a child's sneaker. </p>
<i>

<p>Antz</i> was directed by Eric Darnell and Tim Johnson, two veterans of the CGI wars who
coordinated the groundbreaking facial animations, crowd systems and water effects that
make the movie such a detailed technical wonder. Interestingly, Darnell left PDI briefly
to help develop the upcoming DreamWorks animated epic <i>The Prince of Egypt</i> (he was
back in time to work on <i>Antz</i>) and Johnson is the guy responsible for the sequence
in that odd and very funny &quot;Simpsons&quot; Halloween episode where Homer and Bart are
transported to a 3-D world. Jarringly, while some characters in <i>Antz</i> look more like
their human counterparts than others (Weaver looks strikingly like Stallone, Azteca looks
vaguely like Jennifer Lopez and Z is kind of a plush-toy version of Allen), none of the
characters are even of the cute-gross variety kids like; rather, they're downright
grotesque, sort of like those sad, large-eyed kids and animals in cheap paintings. And
come on, ants with perfect teeth?</p>

<p><img src="images/rantz-3.jpg" align="right" hspace="15" vspace="4" WIDTH="225" HEIGHT="150">One of the very best
things about the entire enterprise is the sprightly music of Harry Gregson-Williams and
John Powell, which is supplemented by Neil Finn's rendition of &quot;I Can See Clearly
Now,&quot; a clever use of &quot;Guantanamera&quot; (which was co-written by Pete Seeger),
special permission from Yoko Ono to use a snippet of John Lennon's &quot;Give Peace a
Chance,&quot; the Jimmy van Heusen/Sammy Cahn Oscar-winning chestnut &quot;High
Hopes&quot; (first heard in Frank Capra's 1959 <i>A Hole in the Head</i>, starring Frank
Sinatra), and even Woody himself crooning Lerner &amp; Loewe's &quot;Almost Like Being in
Love.&quot;</p>

<p>While Gregson-Williams and Powell do their part to liven things up, <i>Antz</i> finally
peters out not as a march, but a limp. Too pseudo-hip for kids, far too simplistic for
adults (the brief trailers for <i>The Rugrats Movie</i>, Disney's rival production, <i>A
Bug's Life</i>, and even the apparently more weighty <i>Prince of Egypt </i>look a lot
more interesting) and much too dramatically overblown for the simple messages of its
story, the movie tries to make a mountain out of an anthill. One doesn't want to dismiss
the exciting technical achievement on display in <i>Antz</i> out of hand, but it's a pity
there couldn't have been more steak with the sizzle. </p>
