            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by <a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia
            Fuchs</a>, 4 April 2003</i></font><p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="5">What your 
			parents don't know</font><font size="2"> </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700">
			<font size="2">Jesminder Bhamra (Parminder Nagra) loves David 
			Beckham. Her bedroom is a veritable shrine to the Manchester United 
			star. As she gazes up at her wall, she can focus on any one of a 
			number of Beck pix -- posing in action or at ease, the fashionably 
			appointed husband of Posh Spice, or, as Jess' mother describes him, 
			&quot;this skinhead boy.&quot; </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">But in <i>Bend 
			It Like Beckham</i>, Jess, the British-born daughter of orthodox 
			Hindu parents, is not just doting on Becks for his good looks. 
			Rather, she's a footballer herself, and admires his athletic skills 
			in particular. &quot;Nobody can bend it like Beckham,&quot; she beams, 
			referring to his extraordinary ability to warp space in order to get 
			the ball to the goal. She takes every opportunity she can to play, 
			usually in the park near her home in a London suburb, away from her 
			parents' watchful gaze. They have other plans for her:&nbsp; that she'll 
			complete school, learn to prepare a full Punjabi dinner, and marry a 
			proper Indian suitor. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">This is the 
			plan already in place for Jess' older sister Pinky (Archie Panjabi), 
			who is engaged to marry within weeks. Pinky, however, is also not 
			adhering exactly to parental expectations and drawing from her 
			immediate environment. And, she has her own secret: she and her beau 
			have been enjoying habitual, if rushed, trysts in his car. The 
			sisters agree not to tell on one another; it's not a crisis they 
			spend much time discussing, but a routine practice, a way to get 
			along in a world where expectations and desires invariably conflict. 
			They've grown up crossing cultural borders on a daily basis, and see 
			such negotiations -- and deceits -- as nothing special. Their 
			parents can't understand, being from another time and place. And so, 
			they take to heart the advice offered by Jess' best friend Tony (Ameet 
			Chana): &quot;What your parents don't know won't hurt them.&quot; </font>
			</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">If Jess and 
			Pinky take such code-switching for granted, their father (Anupam 
			Kher) has different perspective. Well intentioned and generous, he's 
			most often left to bridge the gaps between his daughters and their 
			more traditionally minded mother (Shaheen Khan), massaging all 
			anxieties so everyone feels attended. He frames his concern with 
			Jess' ambitions by his own experience as a young and eager 
			footballer arriving in England, by way of Uganda, with his wife. 
			When he attempted to play on a white team, they harassed him with 
			racist comments. Since then, he's kept to his own community, 
			appreciating his daughters' next-generational sense of freedom and 
			prerogative, but hardly imagining it for himself. For her part, 
			Jess' mother doesn't want her exposing her legs &quot;to complete 
			strangers.&quot; </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Lucky as well 
			as resourceful, Jess does, of course, find a way to play, for the 
			Hounslow Harriers, the girls' auxiliary of a local football club. In 
			the locker room, she finds herself schooling the white girls on what 
			it means to be her: &quot;Indian girls aren't supposed to play football,&quot; 
			she explains. &quot;That's a bit backwards,&quot; observes one of her 
			teammates. Jess knows exactly what it is: &quot;It's just culture, that's 
			all.&quot; </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Jess' 
			navigations of &quot;culture&quot; take up most of the film's energy (along 
			with some jaunty football game montages). <i>Bend It Like Beckham</i> 
			takes Jess' perspective seriously, treating her as a <i>girl</i> 
			with a complicated experience, understandable ambitions, and messy 
			emotional responses to restrictions that will be familiar, in 
			various ways, to viewers her age as well as those who remember what 
			it was like to be that age. While the film includes some standard 
			issue contrivances and coincidences, it also puts them to good use, 
			as an investigation of the ways that expectations and assumptions 
			shape experiences, particularly, girls' experiences. </font></span>
			</p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Such 
			representations of girls are, in fact, not so standard: too many 
			recent cross-cultural girl movies -- the ones with worldwide 
			distribution -- feature vivacious Yanks setting the staid British or 
			Euro culture on its ear (see <i>Princess Diaries</i> or the upcoming
			<i>What a Girl Wants</i>) or star the Olsen twins, doing what they 
			do. Writer-director Gurinder Chadha grants her girl characters 
			complexity and self-understanding (at the same time, the adults in
			<i>Bend It Like Beckham</i> are more broadly, less persuasively 
			drawn). </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">While Jess's 
			interactions with Pinky reveal a specific sisterly pattern of 
			conflict and conciliation, the primary means to get at Jess' 
			evolving consciousness is her friendship with Harriers teammate 
			Jules (Keira Knightley). The girls have lots in common: Jules also 
			has parent issues: her earthy father (Frank Harper) loves to kick 
			the ball around with her in the backyard, but her fidgety mother 
			(Juliet Stevenson) frets that such activities are unladylike. And, 
			like Jess, Jules looks forward to a future that includes football: 
			Jules hopes to make it to university in the States, on a soccer 
			scholarship; her bedroom walls are plastered with pictures of Mia 
			Hamm. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The girls 
			develop a fast friendship, through which the film explores the 
			differences in their respective backgrounds, and most deftly, the 
			ways they navigate their parents' rather typical fears -- of other 
			cultures and changing times. Several crises emerge when Pinky's 
			future in-laws spot Jess and Jules on a street corner, displaying 
			more affection publicly than is seemly: the wedding is called off, 
			Jules' mom fears she's a baby lesbian, and Jess' parents (believing 
			short-haired Jules is male), think Jess is intimate with a white 
			boy. Another issue arises concerning Jess' actual affection for a 
			white boy, the Harriers' adorably sensitive, Irish-born coach, Joe 
			(Jonathan Rhys-Meyers). </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">All of these 
			conflicts come to a head in a colorful finale that crosscuts between 
			a final football match and Pinky's traditional wedding. The cultures 
			continue to clash, but in ways that are increasingly responsive to 
			one another.&nbsp; </font></span></td>
