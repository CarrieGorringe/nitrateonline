            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In his biography of Luis Buñuel,
            John Baxter quotes another biographer, Lachlan Mackinnon, who said,
            &quot;Those who survived it [the Surrealist movement] were either
            heroic individualists like André Breton or psychotics like Salvador
            Dalí.&quot; This makes it sound as if it were something like a war,
            which it was and wasn't -- it was certainly a concerted and
            organized effort in response to something. The French author and
            poet Breton served as<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the
            grand poobah of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the
            Surrealists in the 1920s, deciding on who would, or would not, be
            admitted as a Surrealist member and be allowed to call themselves as
            such in public. The Catalonian-born Dalí, who cultivated his
            nuttiness for the sake of Art, knew, like Picasso and Andy Warhol,
            exactly how to market himself. With the Spanish Civil War and the
            ascension of the Franco regime in Spain, Dalí went to the U.S.,
            designed department store window displays, and did paintings such as
            one which rendered the Golden Gate Bridge as if it were made from
            human bones. He also achieved the singular accomplishment of
            grossing-out no less a personage than Cecil B. De Mille with a
            screening of <i>Un Chien Andalou</i>, the film which would define
            Surrealism in the minds of many people for years to come.</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But the Surrealists themselves were
            begat from the Dadaists, whose manifesto was written by poet and
            writer Tristan Tzara in 1918. Like the Surrealists -- who would
            create public disturbances and even wreck establishments they felt
            disinclined towards -- the Dadaists didn't confine themselves
            entirely to the world of the arts. Dadaism was in part a response to
            the conditions which were engendered in Europe by the catastrophic
            First World War -- among which was the effective sweeping-away of
            the old Europe, including two of its &quot;central powers,&quot; the
            Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires; the use of armored tanks and
            mustard gas and trench warfare in battlefields; and the disastrous
            tactical errors made by military commanders, sometimes resulting in
            the loss of several thousand soldiers per day and, in one instance,
            troops breaking-rank and refusing to go back into the trenches
            because they had lost all faith in their upper command.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Dada -- an &quot;anti-art
            movement&quot; born of &quot;misunderstanding and confusion&quot; --
            was a means by which to challenge conventions and confront the very
            questions of existence. &quot;Every page must explode,&quot; Tzara
            wrote in his 1918 &quot;Dada Manifesto,&quot; continuing, &quot;On
            the one hand a tottering world in flight, betrothed to the
            glockenspiel of hell, on the other hand: new men.... We will put an
            end to mourning and replace tears by sirens screeching from one
            continent to another....&quot; The Dadaists created publications,
            photomontages, held poetry readings where two or more people read
            on-stage simultaneously or while accompanied by tomtoms. Exhibitions
            were held where patrons had to enter through a urinal. In Berlin,
            members of the Weimar parliament were showered with incendiary
            leaflets declaring that Dadaists were &quot;rulers of the
            Globe.&quot;</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Tristan Tzara and the Dadaists --
            who included poet and impresario Hugo Ball, artist Hans Arp, and
            writer Richard Hulsenbeck -- regularly convened at the Cabaret
            Voltaire, a cafe in Zurich, Switzerland, and the new documentary <i>Dada
            Changed My Life</i> is essentially about how a group that could be
            called the New Dadaists reopened the Cabaret Voltaire in early 2002
            as a meeting and performance space, and how they subsequently fought
            to keep it from being turned into a pharmacy and apartment block by
            developers. The documentary -- made by Olga Mazurkiewicz (who's
            Polish-American), Daniel Martinez (who's Spanish), and Lou Lou
            (who's Swiss, making this a respectably international undertaking)
            -- takes its title from a story related to the filmmakers by a woman
            -- Ursula Sterling, &quot;Council President&quot; for the
            &quot;Federation of Swiss Protestant Churches&quot; -- who was
            arrested at the Cabaret one night by a policewoman who, instead of
            taking her to the station, took her back to her apartment, where
            they had a drink and an evening that is described simply as being
            &quot;<i>wun-der-schön</i>.&quot; The film is playful, loose, and
            scrappy in a way that Tzara and his group probably would've approved
            of. It includes portions of slam-poetry readings, a marriage
            ceremony at a &quot;Ministry of Silly Weddings&quot; in Britain
            (interrupted on account of a phone call for the bride), and an
            attempt to interview the &quot;sole surviving Dadaist,&quot; who
            only manages to get out how the new kids are &quot;<i>mierda</i>&quot;
            before keeling over for good. The Dadaist &quot;Foundation
            Kroesus&quot; decides to liquidate their assets by throwing them out
            the window to people on the street below, while a hiccuping
            recording of John Philip Sousa's &quot;Liberty Bell March&quot;
            plays in the background.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That last, of course, also served
            as the theme to <i>Monty Python's Flying Circus</i>. So much of what
            comprised the original Dada movement has long since been absorbed
            and made commonplace by mainstream culture, from record album covers
            to advertising and music videos. It is often difficult, in the age
            of electronic communications, to discern when people are trying to
            do something &quot;meaningful,&quot; nowadays, from people who are
            just acting-out in front of the cameras to get what immediate
            attention they will. (The wedding sequence mentioned above is
            interrupted by a beautiful young woman in pearls and a fur coat who
            seizes the attention of the documentary-makers and then says,
            &quot;I absolutely have nothing to tell. I just would like to be
            filmed.&quot; After directing the cameraman to look at her legs, she
            tells us that her &quot;profession&quot; is, &quot;I live to be
            rich.&quot;) Films and the moving visual arts were just getting
            started when the Dadaists came into being; they would be further
            explored by Man Ray , with his experimental black-and-white montage
            films, and Buñuel, who was able to make <b><i>L'Age d'Or</i></b>,
            one of the great anarchist documents in film history, because he had
            private financial backers who gave him complete freedom. The New
            Dadaists seek to exercise their God-given right to express
            themselves, however and in whatever way they see fit, and they
            certainly don't appear to be spoiling for a fight (something of a
            relief during this time of &quot;preemptive&quot; wrist-smacking).
            The New Dadaists may have to find some way to do so in the video or
            film medium that conveys the same shock of the old -- maybe some way
            that says, we don't care whether you gaup at us like some freaks on
            a &quot;reality&quot; show or not, but we've got something to say.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>A return to the stage, with its sense of immediacy and power,
            may also be the thing, which is why fighting to keep places like the
            Cabaret Voltaire up and going as an open forum is something of
            genuinely vital concern. To everybody.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"></o:p>
