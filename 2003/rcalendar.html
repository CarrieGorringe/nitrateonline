            now and then, there's a pop culture trend that gives me hope. A
            British calendar featuring pictures of women past the age of 50 that
            was intended to raise money to for leukemia research managed to
            outsell the Britney Spears calendar in the United States. With its
            lofty and successful goals in mind (nearly 500,000 British pounds
            worth of these things have been purchased), it might not seem
            improper that the subjects in the better selling calendar were
            photographed nude.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><o:p>

            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">The
            poses these calendar girls have taken are more quaint than
            exploitative (most feature the participants cooking or playing
            piano), the unusual actions taken by members of a local Women's
            Institute in Yorkshire have helped demonstrate to a sadly
            youth-obsessed culture that age and beauty are not mutually
            exclusive and have inspired an affectionately entertaining, if
            easily predictable film. <o:p>

            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Director
            Nigel Cole is making a career out of capturing almost stereotypical
            Brits losing their inhibitions in often hysterically funny ways. His
            last feature, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Saving Grace</i>,
            showed what a little canabis can do for a small town, so he's a
            reasonable choice to demonstrate how far people might go for a good
            cause.<o:p>

            benefits immeasurably from a talented, agreeable cast who manage to
            elicit far more chuckles than the thin setup would seemingly allow.
            Dame Hellen Mirren stars as Chris Harper, a middle-aged woman who
            attends the monthly meetings of her Knapely, Yorkshire Women's
            Institute or WI, and often wonders why she bothers. Most of the
            presentations are rather dull (listeners learn more than they could
            ever want to know about the history of the Milk Marketing Board or
            broccoli), and the only reason she wins a baking competition is
            because a store-bought dish she's brought out of desperation is
            mistaken for homemade.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Attending
            does give her a chance to catch up with her pal Annie Clarke (Julie
            Walters). Annie needs all the support she can get because her
            husband John (John Alderton) is dying of leukemia. When the disease
            takes him, Chris and Annie decide that their local hospital
            desperately needs a new couch. It's bad enough that people have to
            watch their loved ones die, and the dilapidated furniture only makes
            matters more agonizing.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">The
            local WI often uses their calendar to raise a few bucks for good
            causes, but last year's volume couldn't begin to cover the cost of a
            sofa, and it's doubtful the theme of this year's datebook
            (vegetables) will inspire a bestseller either.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Chris
            and Annie then decide to try something different. Noticing how nude
            calendars seem to be dominating the walls of car repair shops, they
            decide that posing for one themselves might make a bit of a stir.
            They'll simply be making the same sort of poses they've always made
            for a calendar except they won't have to wear clothes, and if
            anything, some get intrigued by the idea of doing something that's
            inconceivable for women their age.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Consequently,
            the WI members have an amusingly difficult time trying to overcome
            their obstacles through trial and error. If local prudery won't stop
            them, watch them try to conquer their own inhibitions as they try to
            pose. They're even afraid of letting the male photographer they've
            hired (Philip Glenister) in the room.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Needless
            to say, the calendar becomes an unexpected and overwhelming success.
            Much of the humor comes from how the villagers react to the
            publication and the seemingly reserved women who appeared in it.
            Chris' son (delightfully played by John Paul Macleod), in
            particular, is utterly bewildered and frustrated with his mother's
            obsessive fascination with pornography. At some point, he wishes his
            mother would chew him out about his pornographic magazines the way
            most mums do instead of gazing at them for inspiration. In addition,
            her husband Rod (Ciaran Hinds) learns that fame has an eerie
            downside.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Screenwriters
            Tim Firth and Fuliett Towhidi run out of chuckles once the Yorkshire
            lasses start basking in international fame. The attempts at setting
            up a conflict between Chris and Annie fall flat. In some ways the
            film is marred by its true life origins. A lot of the tension over
            whether the Calendar girls will succeed is lost.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Thankfully,
            Mirren and Walters are thoroughly convincing lifelong buddies and
            project the necessary intelligence to make their character's antics
            seem as logical as they are outrageous. As a result, Chris' zeal is
            as contagious as it is unusual. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">It's
            temping to treat this film as a sort of female <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Full Monty</i>, where the protagonists strip to redeem themselves.
            Thankfully, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Calendar Girls </i>is
            funny enough in its own right to make such a comparison pointless.<o:p>
