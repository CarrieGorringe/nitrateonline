            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Seabiscuit</i>,
            based on Laura Hillenbrand's best-selling book, Chris Cooper gives a
            magnificent performance as Tom Smith, an upstanding man of few words
            who has an unassuming nobility and is capable of great depths of
            feeling. A horse trainer, he is able to take the measure of an
            animal, assess its weaknesses as well as its strengths, and then
            with a soothing tone and gentle hand proceed to bring the latter to
            the fore. He spots a wild-spirited brown horse that is about to be
            put-down, and rescues it, which then catches the attention of
            Charles Howard (Jeff Bridges), who, with a pugnacious jockey named
            Red Pollard (Tobey Maguire), turn the horse into the race champion
            Seabiscuit, who would become a household name.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Gary Ross' film, which he directed
            and wrote the screenplay adaptation for, is enjoyable -- in part
            because, good heavens, it seems genuinely interested in people and
            in telling a story about them -- but it has some gaps. It does a
            good job in the opening sections in showing the events, public and
            personal, that shaped its three main characters up to the moment
            when they meet -- Howard's rise from a bicycle salesman in San
            Francisco (wrong city for bicycles) to successful salesman pitching
            the &quot;future&quot; of the automobile, as well as the unexpected
            dissolution of his family; Pollard's scramble to make a living as
            both an amateur jockey as well as an amateur boxer (which leads to
            his losing sight in one eye, something he tries to keep secret as
            much as possible); Smith encountering barbed wire strung across open
            land, touching it with his thumb while assessing its ramifications
            -- as well as the way Seabiscuit himself had been handled (courtesy
            of David McCullough, who spoke the narration for some of Ken Burns'
            documentaries) in ways that would provide hurdles the three men will
            have to overcome.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But the film doesn't give us a
            really good idea of how Seabiscuit captured and fired the public
            imagination and interest the way he did -- the horse, as with the
            three men who together turned him into a champion, is supposed to
            represent the achievement of the underdog, at a time during the
            1930s when many good people fell on very hard times through no fault
            of their own. Also, the film gives us little in terms of what
            brought and kept the three men who rescued and trained (as well as
            promoted) Seabiscuit together -- they are supposed to bring out the
            best in each other, as well, but the men must have had something
            more that kept them together than confluence and the recognition to
            win. (One gets the feeling, for instance, that Cooper's Tom Smith,
            unmaterialistic and so attuned to the broader nature of things,
            would have found some way to get along had he never met Howard and
            Pollard -- he might have had just as good a life had he never turned
            Seabiscuit into a famous race horse.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film depicts Seabiscuit as a
            small horse jockeyed by a big rider, a combination that shouldn't
            work but does because horse and rider know how to work together. I
            suspect this may be to explain the fact that Tobey Maguire, without
            faulting his performance (which is just fine), is bigger and
            dissimilar to the actual Red Pollard, who was more willowy, light
            complected, and sometimes dieted to the point of anorexia. The film
            concludes with Seabiscuit's wins at Pimlico and, in 1940 (the year
            before the U.S. entry into World War Two), at Santa Anita -- it ends
            on a high note, with no further disclosures of what happens to horse
            or men, but with Maguire's Pollard saying that &quot;he,” meaning
            Seabiscuit, &quot;fixed us,” meaning the shambling guys they were
            before they met and worked together. I find this to be a little too
            self-depreciating: if anything, the men fixed themselves, plus
            Seabiscuit. I rather like better the melancholy, settled note upon
            which Hillenbrand ends her story, with Seabiscuit's bones resting
            peacefully and in privacy under an oak tree.</font><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="5"></o:p>
