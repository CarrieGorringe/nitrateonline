<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The nominees for this 
year's Academy Awards elicit as many &quot;why&quot; as &quot;why nots.&quot; The machinations of 
the collective studio mindset - most specifically Miramax - labored over their 
political strategizing and placement of nominees, resigning an actor to a 
different category if necessary to carefully not compete against another 
performer in the same film and -- on the final ballot -- cancel each other out. 
The result of all this calculation feels obvious and uncaring --&nbsp; it’s no secret 
they just want to reap in the gold.</font></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meryl Streep ­ conspicuously 
absent as a best actress contender for <i>The Hours</i> -- was on the money when 
she recently put noses out of joint with a statement about how commercial the 
whole awards campaign has become: &quot;I find it alarming that all the campaigning 
for Oscars is getting like a political campaign,&quot; she said. &quot;It won't be long 
before they start paying for television commercials for Best Picture, Best Actor 
and all the rest.&quot;</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I’m neutral over the 
nominations this year, though there are a few glaring omissions that rankle; 
where are Dennis Quaid, Toni Collette and Bebe Neuwirth in the supporting 
categories? Categories that, for my money could have done without Ed Harris and 
John C. Reilly’s names. Harris over-emoted shamelessly in <i>The Hours</i> but 
voters seem to think his performance was courageous; Reilly had a great year but 
he was virtually the same (save for his self-inflated Irish cop in <i>Gangs of 
New York</i>) deluded schlub in <i>Far From Heaven</i>, <i>The Good Girl</i> and 
the nominated role in <i>Chicago</i>. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I don’t know who you could 
knock out of the running in the supporting actress category. All the women are 
terrific here and it’s one of the most exciting races of the entire program. But 
Catherine Zeta-Jones’ screen time equalled Renee Zellweger’s in <i>Chicago</i> 
and she was more impressive and solid than her co-star. She should have been in 
the running for a Best Actress nod, making a slot for Collette or Neuwirth. So 
here is an example of Miramax’s mindset. They figure Zellweger will take it and 
Zeta-Jones won’t get much competition from Queen Latifah or anyone else in the 
supporting race. It’s the one bet that may backfire upon them, to Zeta-Jones’ 
dismay.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Both the best actor and 
actress category hold some unexpected surprises. Why Adrien Brody for <i>The 
Pianist,</i> I wonder? Despite the Academy’s slavish respect and awe for 
Holocaust-themed films, Brody’s passive character had little to do but react to 
his heinous circumstances. And while post-nomination critics are revelling over 
the fact that Diane Lane grabbed the spot reserved for Streep, there was never 
any doubt in my mind that Lane had the slot in the bag all along. It’s perhaps 
the finest work by all the women in the running as Lane had to make something 
extraordinary out of a fictional, ordinary woman. Salma Hayek (<i>Frida</i>) and 
Nicole Kidman (<i>The Hours</i>) had the benefit of history and reams of 
documentation to draw upon for their notable performances as Frida Kahlo and 
Virginia Woolf while Julianne Moore’s '50s housewife was played as essentially 
written into Todd Haynes excellent script of <i>Far From Heaven</i>.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The best director category is 
ominously doomed to honor Martin Scorsese for the wrong film, too. <i>Gangs of 
New York</i> features a bookend pair of grand, epic scenes --&nbsp; its opening gang 
battle and the closing Draft Riots sequence. In between lies a tepid love story 
atop a single volcanic performance by Daniel Day-Lewis. Critics have sniped that 
he grandstands and overacts; had the rest of the cast kept tempo with Day-Lewis 
there might have been something to this mish-mash movie. He was, outside of the 
two segments mentioned above, its sole virtue. I’d love to see something gutsy 
happen instead, like the Academy giving the prize to nominated Pedro Almodovar 
or better, un-nominated Phillip Noyce, whose dual efforts - <i>Rabbit-Proof 
Fence</i> and <i>The Quiet American</i> were consistently exceptional and both 
distributed by Miramax. But it’s going to be Scorsese’s moment, at the expense 
of directors who made better films -- and to the virtual exclusion of Peter 
Jackson for <i>The Lord of the Rings:The Two Towers</i>.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I would have loved to have 
seen Almodovar’s heartfelt, surreal film <i>Talk To Her</i> take the best 
foreign-language prize but Spain submitted another in its place and ultimately 
neither made the cut. Perhaps there’ll be a repeat from this year’s Cannes Film 
Festival where Aki Kaurismaki took the Grand Jury Prize for the second part of 
his Finland trilogy, <i>Man Without a Past</i>. But this category is always iffy 
--&nbsp; witness the Academy’s upset of the very popular French film <i>Amelie</i> 
last year by the dark horse Bosnian war drama <i>No Man’s Land</i>.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Documentaries are also touch 
and go. Generally they’re noble, philanthropic works or exposes of corporate 
environmental injustice. We have Michael Moore’s misguided <i>Bowling for 
Columbine</i> in the running this year --&nbsp; worthy subject matter lamed by bad 
execution -- and I can certainly do without witnessing Moore pontificate through 
an acceptance speech. I’d much rather have seen producer Robert Evans at the 
podium picking up the Oscar for the humble documentary based upon the excessive 
rise and fall of his illustrious film career, <i>The Kid Stays in the Picture</i>. 
Alas, it wasn’t even nominated.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The composite whole of the 
best picture category feels more anti-climactic than the breadth of excellent 
performances this year. <i>Chicago</i> is a fun, terrific musical and <i>The 
Hours</i> sneaks up on you. By the end it’s emotional and introspectively 
soul-searching. <i>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</i> feels like a 
preface to its next big chapter, <i>The Lord of the Rings: Return of the King</i>, 
which, I have a hunch, will be a shoe-in next year for several prizes. <i>The 
Pianist</i> and <i>Gangs of New York</i> are throwaways and unwarranted - tepid 
films that don’t hold up under scrutiny. I would have rather seen Todd Haynes’ 
forgotten homage to Douglas Sirk - <i>Far From Heaven</i> - niched in where it 
belonged. And what of <i>Adaptation</i> and <i>About Schmidt</i>, two films that 
challenged convention and made no apologies for their humanistic flaws, yet were 
unique and revelatory?</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Adaptation</i> earned a 
well-deserved screenplay nod as well as its acting kudos for Nicolas Cage, 
Streep and everyman Chris Cooper, but <i>About Schmidt</i> was ignored for its 
script by wonder-team Jim Taylor and Alexander Payne, and outside of its two 
acting acknowledgments is nowhere to be seen.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I have a hunch that because 
few distributors have the gift of savvy and the ability to turn controversy into 
an asset, or to play the kind of hardball that Miramax can, they were sideswiped 
by Miramax's product. For the first time Harvey Weinstein and company have 
eclipsed even Steven Spielberg’s Dreamworks SKG in their reported long-running 
Oscar &quot;feud.&quot; After the neck-in-neck race between the two companies over 
competing films <i>Shakespeare In Love</i> and <i>Saving Private Ryan</i> and 
whispered allegations of Miramax’s buying the awards through massive 
campaigning, Spielberg still received only faint weak applause for <i>Minority 
Report</i> and <i>Catch Me If You Can</i> this year. Further proof is in the 
numbers: Miramax received a momentous forty nominations (they must split noms 
for <i>The Hours</i> with Paramount Pictures). Could it be that Meryl Streep is 
on to something after all?</font></p>
