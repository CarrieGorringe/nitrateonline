            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>I will have to join my voice
            with that of Peter Rainer's, who has, recently, called for a
            moratorium on bad remakes of films that were perfectly good to begin
            with. Last year, we had perfectly dreadful remakes of <i>Rollerball</i>
            (well, the original wasn't that all great, but it looked a whole lot
            better after the remake), <i>The Time Machine</i>, and, on
            television, <i>The Magnificent Ambersons</i> (which purported to be
            based on Orson Welles' screenplay, but then failed to use the ending
            that Welles had intended). This year (with a remake of <i>The
            Italian Job</i> already on the horizon), there's <i>The In-Laws</i>.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The 1979 film, which was directed,
            by Arthur Hiller, from a hilarious original screenplay by Andrew
            Bergman (who would later be put through the meatgrinder of the Demi
            Moore film <i>Striptease</i>), had Alan Arkin as an
            upper-middle-class dentist who finds out that his daughter is about
            to be wed to the son of a man (Peter Falk) who's an international
            espionage operative. The story was a comedy with some espionage
            trappings: Falk's character takes Arkin along on an assignment
            simply because it seems like a very good opportunity for the two men
            to get to know each other better, since their kids are about to be
            married. So what do the makers of the new film do? They turn it into
            an espionage actioner with comedy trappings. The opening scenes,
            filmed in the dark, grey-blue colors of a Jerry Bruckheimer spy
            drama, show shady encounters, sinister deals, nasty gunplay, car
            chases, and Michael Douglas flying a jet with a hole in it from
            Prague to Nova Scotia. It's as if the filmmakers didn't think the
            audience would sit still for anything unless they threw in some
            business showing people doodling around with high-tech gizmos and
            racing around in cars first.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Back in the States, Albert Brooks
            turns up playing a podiatrist (for reasons which solely have to do
            with a minor plot turn that occurs late in the film): he has a
            couple of phobias (fear of planes, fear of heights), and he wears a
            fanny pack. This last is the source of not so much endless jokes as
            the same joke repeated many times: &quot;What's that? A fanny
            pack?&quot; asks Douglas' pretty young assistant (Robin Tunney),
            with an incredulous look on her face. &quot;Ha ha ha.&quot; It's
            so-so the first time around, not so great when you hear it,
            seemingly verbatim, the fourth or fifth time. Albert Brooks'
            performance in the film is flat and dispirited, and it's not
            surprising: he also has to wear a thong in one scene, and the
            humorous stuff he's handed to do is dismally uninspired.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The madcap Latin dictator played by
            Richard Libertini in the 1979 film is here replaced with a French
            munitions dealer who swans around with one little finger extended
            and is played by, of all people, T.V.'s Hercule Poirot himself,
            David Suchet. Doubtless the producers thought that by hiring
            openly-gay director Andrew Fleming to helm this picture, he'd find
            some way to take the edge off of the gay gags so that they wouldn't
            look like they're trading on homophobic clichés while reinforcing
            them at the same time. He doesn't, and they still look like they do
            (right up until the very end, in fact). Michael Douglas, by the by,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>does not lend himself terribly well to broad humor in this
            film -- like Cary Grant, he works well when he does variations on a
            suave persona. Candice Bergen, terribly dressed and wearing an
            explosion of hair, almost finds some way to make her role as
            Douglas' estranged wife work -- she has the clenched manner of
            someone waiting for a root canal to begin. I would suggest spending
            your time and hard-earned money, though, checking out the 1979 film
            on video, before plunking one's self down to watch this depressing,
            wince-inducing enterprise.</font></td>
