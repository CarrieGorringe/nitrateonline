            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by
			<a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 
			14 February 2003</i></font><p><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="5">The One That I Want</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700">
			<font size="2">The similarities between porn movies and musicals 
			have been frequently noted. In both, character and plot take a back 
			seat to a series of set pieces designed for visceral, immediate 
			pleasure. Daisy von Scherler Mayer's new film, <i>The Guru</i>, 
			explores this confluence, with one of its romantic leads a porn 
			performer and the other a dancer, then adds another combinatory 
			layer: cross-cultural desire. One of the lovers to be is a white New 
			Yorker who aspires to an ideal marriage and suburban home; the other 
			is a young émigré from India, come to the States to become the next 
			John Travolta. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><i>The Guru</i> 
			begins with Ramu (Jimi Mistry, the British actor best known in the 
			States for <i>East Is East</i>), an enthusiastic dance instructor in 
			New Delhi who beguiles his middle-aged women students with his 
			cleverly passionate rendition of the Macarena. &quot;Move your feet to 
			the beat of your heart,&quot; he urges, as they do their best to mirror 
			his swiveling hips and gracefully twisting limbs. At the end of 
			class, Ramu announces that he's leaving for the U.S., where he hopes 
			to make his fortune. That is, he wants to follow in the footsteps of 
			his cousin, Vijay (Emil Marwa), whose letters home extol the great 
			fun and brilliance of living in NYC. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">When Ramu 
			arrives at his cousin's doorstep, however, he realizes that the 
			stories are somewhat exaggerated. The red Mercedes is actually the 
			cab Vijay drives to make ends meet, and the penthouse is an 
			apartment over a bargain movie theater in Queens (&quot;It's the top 
			floor!&quot; insists Vijay). Disappointed, Ramu insists that he just 
			wants his chance at the American Dream. &quot;You why they call it the 
			American Dream?&quot; Vijay asks. &quot;Because it only happens when you're 
			asleep.&quot; </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Undeterred, 
			Ramu pursues his dream. When it turns out that he's not so good at 
			playing the stereotypical Indian restaurant waiter (he dumps the 
			&quot;chicken f*ckin' tiki masala&quot; on an obnoxious patron's head), Ramu 
			auditions for Ramrod Productions, unaware that the company makes 
			porn. He dances up a storm in the office, stripping to his underwear 
			and reinventing Tom Cruise's routine for &quot;Old Time Rock n' Roll&quot; 
			(sung on the soundtrack in Ramu's head by Vishal Ailawadhi) and 
			impressing director Dwain (Michael McKean) with his energy and 
			originality (&quot;Most guys, they come in here and they wax the 
			dolphin&quot;). </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">In an effort to 
			capitalize on Ramu's &quot;Oriental cabana boy thing,&quot; Dwain renames him 
			&quot;Rammy&quot; and puts him on a &quot;Fantasy Island&quot; set with his best leading 
			lady, the fearless Sharrona (Heather Graham). Unable to &quot;achieve 
			wood&quot; (and so, fired), Ramu is nonetheless quite taken with his 
			would-have-been co-star's philosophical bent. And she is full of New 
			Agey aphorisms: &quot;Your naked body is really just a costume,&quot; &quot;The 
			universe isn't run by some big old perv,&quot; and, of course, &quot;The most 
			powerful sexual organ God gave us is our brain.&quot; </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Later that 
			night, Ramu puts this good knowledge to the test, when he's called 
			on to play the &quot;Swami Bu&quot; at the last minute, before an upper-crusty 
			dinner party crowd where Vijay is working for the caterer. It's a 
			tough audience, including the disquieting ice queen Chantal 
			(Christine Baranski) and her miserably wifty daughter Lexi (Marisa 
			Tomei), but once Ramu starts repeating Sharrona's mantras, he has 
			everyone joyously dancing around the mansion. It helps that he is 
			able to achieve wood that night, servicing Lexi so well that she 
			proclaims him the Guru of Sex, and sends him forth to minister to 
			all the unhappy ladies (and men, and couples, and lesbians) she 
			knows. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">In order to 
			sustain his charade, Ramu convinces Sharrona to tutor him, absorbing 
			her spiritual take on sex. He's lying to her (she thinks he wants 
			her instruction in order to have another go in porn), but that's 
			okay, because she's lying to her fiancé, Rusty (Dash Mihok), a 
			strapping fireman who thinks she's a bespectacled schoolteacher. No 
			surprise, all these secrets (and a few others, including Rusty's 
			doozy) must out in order for the proper couple to find one another.
			</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">That this 
			proper couple is Sharrona and Ramu is only one of <i>The Guru</i>'s 
			crossover complexities. Their true love develops as a matter of 
			course, and, as must happen in such fairy tales, each must learn 
			something from the other. All lessons have to do with honesty and 
			commitment to your dreams, despite and because of the fact that 
			these ideals might not always coincide. Executive produced and 
			conceived by Shekhar Kapur (<i>Bandit Queen</i> and <i>Elizabeth</i>), 
			the film offers a cagey take on cultural influences and 
			intersections. An affectionate satire of porn aesthetics (in one 
			scene, Sharrona plays a whip-wielding dominatrix, with Ramu as a 
			Roman gladiator in chains), conjoined with Hollywood and Bollywood 
			musicals, the film finds their corresponding spiritual and sexual 
			rhythms. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">This even as 
			the plot is as silly and predictable as can be: with Lexi's money 
			and connections behind him, Ramu parlays Sharrona's wisdom 
			(including a sensuous lesson on how to &quot;feel&quot; the lyrics of Billy 
			Joel's &quot;Just the Way You Are&quot;) and his own charisma into the stardom 
			he so covets. Soon he has a guest appearance on <i>Sally Jesse 
			Raphael</i>, and seems on his way to becoming as beloved and desired 
			by U.S. consumers as Deepak Chopra. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Still, Ramu 
			must come to terms with the lies he has told Sharrona, much less his 
			pilfering over her philosophical meanderings to jumpstart his new 
			&quot;career.&quot; His combination of guilt and desire comes to a delirious 
			climax as he watches a Bollywood musical on TV. The characters on 
			screen are transformed into Sharrona and Ramu, dancing and 
			lip-synching &quot;You're the One that I Want.&quot; </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">At last, he's 
			John Travolta, on the TV of his dreams, the <i>Grease</i> 
			fairgrounds set replaced by a sumptuous Bollywood staircase, Olivia 
			Newton John's famous leotard now Sharrona's silk sari. And at last, 
			Ramu realizes what he must do -- declare his love (&quot;My heart beats 
			for you!&quot;) and touch his soul. Sex, song, and Sally Jesse Raphael.
			<i>The Guru</i> celebrates -- and turns inside out -- cultural 
			cross-pollinations. It's also so completely charmed by itself that 
			it's impossible to resist. </font></span></td>
