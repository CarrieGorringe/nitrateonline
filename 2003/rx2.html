			</font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 9 May 2003</i></font><p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sometime during the course of 
			the hectic, striving-to-be-good picture <i>X2</i>, the thought 
			crossed my mind that talented directors such as Sam Raimi and Bryan 
			Singer have spent (or are going to have spent) years toiling away on 
			bringing comic books to the screen. While there's nothing wrong with 
			making movies from comic books, it does not leave a whole lot of 
			time for directors like Singer to bring us films like The <i>Usual 
			Suspects</i>. (Or <i>Apt Pupil</i>, a good-try which nonetheless has 
			some haunting moments in it.) Raimi, who has always managed to find 
			some way to put something noteworthy into each of his films, did one 
			of his best-ever pictures, <i>A Simple Plan</i>, before becoming 
			yoked to doing two <i>Spider-Man</i> films in a row, possibly 
			because the producers were scared of something happening such as 
			when Joel Schumacher took over from Tim Burton on the <i>Batman</i> 
			pictures. Flattering that they consider Raimi to be a competent 
			director with a vision, but, still, the nature of films such as <i>
			Spider-Man</i> and <i>X-Men</i> are such that they subsume all of a 
			filmmaker's time and energy for years at a time, apiece.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>X2</i> is fortunate in having a 
			great array of considerable talent essaying the roles and a director 
			who knows how to handle them and show them to their best advantage. 
			On the other hand, this is a franchise which, in the end, roils 
			onward, ever onward. After some opening slight-of-hand business set 
			in the Oval Office, the movie proceeds to toss plots and subplots 
			into the air, and it always seems to be trying to show us several 
			things happening in several different places at the same time, and 
			you often feel like you're barely keeping up with it all. (What kind 
			of extra-normal power did Anna Paquin's character have, again, for 
			instance?) Here, the usual hero-nemesis dichotomy between the 
			characters played by Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen is thrown 
			a-kilter by the introduction of an even worse enemy -- a U.S. 
			government emissary played by Brian Cox who, it turns out, was 
			responsible for giving Hugh Jackman's character, Logan, a.k.a. 
			Wolverine, the ginsu blades which come out of his hands and thus 
			mark him as a pariah in normal society. McKellen's character -- once 
			again aided by Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, with that beautiful blue 
			full-body makeup that makes her look like an Impressionist canvas 
			come to life -- must ally with the good mutants -- Jackman, Halle 
			Berry, James Marsden, Famke Janssen, et al. -- to stop Cox's 
			character from carrying through with a plan that will snuff them 
			all.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The action and the plot 
			twists-and-turns hurtle forward in a manner which, for the most 
			part, suggests that the movie's trying to get a lot of stuff in 
			while keeping the running time down to such a length that will allow 
			for the maximum number of showings per day at your neighborhood 
			theater. There is little room for anything more than rudimentary 
			shading or development in either the characters (there are about 
			thirteen principle roles -- Bruce Davison, reprising his part from 
			the first film, does a walkthrough!) or the story, although the 
			filmmakers try. Alan Cumming brings affecting melancholy and 
			dimension to a new character, Nightcrawler, who can transport 
			himself from place to place with a puff of powder and smoke, and has 
			Queequeg-like skin decorations across his (blue-skinned) body; Famke 
			Janssen achieves an admirable sense of nobility during the 
			concluding scenes; and there's some not-bad staging in the final 
			scene between Jackman and Cox's characters. Still, you can't get 
			away from the fact that you're watching a great many people spending 
			a good deal of time and effort on a story where people and places 
			are named Magneto and Cerebro.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I don't think Marvel ever intended
			<i>X-Men</i> to be anything more than diversionary, if not 
			disposable, entertainment. How seriously are we supposed to take the 
			movie? Not very, I think. But, twenty-five years later, what one 
			remembers most about the 1978 <i>Superman</i> is not the story 
			(which was more of a mess than the one, here, could ever be) but the 
			wonderful and graceful chemistry that was allowed to develop between 
			Margot Kidder and Christopher Reeve on the screen. Something like 
			that is what's missing, and missed, in <i>X-2</i>, because there 
			simply isn't enough time or room for it, and I hope that the 
			filmmakers don't think that we haven't stopped caring for things 
			like that.</font></td>
