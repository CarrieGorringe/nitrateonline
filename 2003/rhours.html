            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../paula.html" target="_top">Paula Nechak</a>, </i></font><i>
			<font face="Verdana" size="1">3 January 2003</font></i><blockquote>
				<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I don't mind about the 
				dead...The worst of it is they cling to the living, and won't 
				let go.&quot; So wrote D.H. Lawrence in his 1920 novel, &quot;Women in 
				Love.&quot;</font></b></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>The Hours</i>, while dallying 
			with that notion, pushes and nudges against it and in an elegaic, 
			demanding cinematic dirge --&nbsp; chooses to grasp at life. Though 
			Stephen Daldry's film begins with a death -- Virginia Woolf's 
			suicide in 1941 - and rapidly segues back to her germinating the 
			seed for the novel <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> in 1924 - it is about much, 
			much more than the dead clinging to the living; more like the living 
			clinging to the living and that passage of time called memory that 
			can either sweep us up in an exalted, false happiness or allow us 
			the liberation of living in the immediate moment. A woman's whole 
			life in a single day, just one day, and in that day her whole life,&quot; 
			Woolf put to paper in describing her creation Clarissa Dalloway, the 
			heroine who, on the morning of her party decides to &quot;buy the flowers 
			herself.&quot;</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In three separate stories over the 
			course of that day and which, though they hinge on a foreboding of 
			death and flow and converge like the river into which Woolf 
			ultimately threw herself when she knew she would never again recover 
			from recurring madness, introduces very different women who will 
			either artistically, metaphorically or literally &quot;buy the flowers 
			themselves.&quot; </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Certainly, <i>The Hours</i> is a 
			film that will segregate its audience, if not along gender lines, 
			then by those who cannot fathom internal life or the quiet presence 
			of it. Yet it, as adapted from the perfectly observed words of the 
			Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by Michael Cunningham and as written 
			for the screen by the extraordinary insights of screenwriter and 
			playwright David Hare, begs for patience and compassion.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Woolf (Nicole Kidman) suffers in 
			the suburbs where she and her publisher husband Leonard (the 
			wonderful Stephen Dillane) have sequestered themselves following 
			another bout of Virginia's depression and descent into her heart of 
			darkness. Virginia, chafing at being exiled from the bustle of the 
			city craves London and --&nbsp; in her fear of impending sickness --&nbsp; 
			begins writing <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i> (originally called <i>The Hours</i> 
			as well) as a panacea to her aloneness.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In 1951, Laura Brown (Julianne 
			Moore), pregnant and mother of a young son, faces a spiritual death 
			from her dull, routine life. It is her husband's birthday and Laura, 
			who would rather be lying in bed reading <i>Mrs. Dalloway</i>, can 
			barely cope with the demands of motherhood and its duties and the 
			housewifely things she knows she should be doing to ensure her 
			family's happiness. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Clarissa Vaughan (Meryl Streep) is 
			a present day publisher in New York city. Today she is throwing a 
			party for Richard (Ed Harris), friend, ex-lover and poet dying of 
			AIDS, who is about to receive a prestigious literary award for his 
			body of work. Clarissa, affectionately called &quot;Mrs. Dalloway&quot; by 
			Richard, lives with her longtime lover Sally (Allison Janney), who 
			barely registers next to Richard's pervasive presence. Richard tells 
			her she &quot;is always giving parties to cover the silence,&quot; yet 
			Clarissa refuses to see anything beyond Richard's fading world and 
			refutes the idea that after he dies she will have to live her own 
			life.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">On this day, these women will 
			collide, possibly to repeat history and tragedy - or - subvert it.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Daldry, who came to our attention 
			with <i>Billy Elliott</i> and who - so deftly aided by editor Peter 
			Boyle -- has taken on a monumental challenge in bringing an 
			interiorized book to the screen. But he, Boyle and Hare have pulled 
			it off --&nbsp; at least structurally. The film certainly is not without 
			flaws - Phillip Glass's droning and intrusive score is heavier than 
			the stones that pulled Virginia to the bottom of the river Ouse and 
			it screams where silence is demanded. It's the biggest upset to the 
			delicate balance that <i>The Hours</i> juggles. As well, the 
			contemporary story with Streep and Harris never takes us to that 
			place of emotional despair in which Moore and Kidman reign. Its 
			modern-day intellectual sensibility makes its strange agony more 
			akin to stubbornness or an unwillingness to relinquish the past 
			instead of - like the other women - trapped, externally and 
			societally within it. Those &quot;other&quot; roles -- played by Kidman and 
			Moore -- provide passionate, beautifully modulated opportunities 
			that carry a frightening frailty at being cornered within one's own 
			mind, life and expectations.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Some fuss has been made about gay 
			subplots and a kiss that occurs between sisters and women friends 
			but these, I think, happen less out of being gay (though Virginia 
			had supposed affairs with Violet Dickenson and Vita Sackville-West) 
			than the isolation of the women's existences, love and their longing 
			to connect - we all reach out to those who are most like us in the 
			unexpected minutes that tick and whittle at our time and to downplay 
			the fact that these emotions exist is sheer ignorance. That Hare and
            Daldry and their actors get that impulse and manage to find the 
			nuance to visualize and play it out by juxtaposing it against the 
			creative and human urge to return to the place where we come from 
			and from where we felt most alive and happy, is unique.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">An exception must be made for 
			Nicole Kidman though, as she, as the spine and propeller of the 
			film, thrives as its heartbeat, despite her character's imminent 
			suicide, &quot;past death through the words, the work, the writing, 
			everything that happens in a moment, the history of it and who we 
			once were, the history of us.&quot; It's something <i>The Hours</i> 
			reminds in its courage to face the minutes that slip away for each 
			of us; that and its making an art film out of such commercial 
			talent, who, apparently reveled in going back to that place where 
			they began. </font></td>
