            say Japan was made by a sword.&quot; The &quot;they&quot; who say
            this are not identified in Edward Zwick's <i>The Last Samurai</i>,
            but this initial voiceover conjures -- briefly -- a certain gravity.
            This will be a film about violence and legend, about national origin
            and mythic history. The camera sweeps over mountainsides and
            meditating men, warriors weighted with a sense of mission and fate.
            The film cuts to Tom Cruise, and now you know: this is no splendid
            saga of a people or a culture. It's a star vehicle, straight up. <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's
            a grand vehicle, to be sure, with horses, martial arts, and vast
            armies, not to mention Cruise's shiny shoulder-length hair flowing
            just right, in snow or mud as well as in wind. As Civil War veteran
            Captain Nathan Algren, he's introduced in 1876, depressed and drunk,
            literally a sideshow act selling Winchester rifles and raging at
            atrocities he was ordered to commit, in particular under the command
            of one General Custer. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            last memory -- which trauma recurs in various slow motion images,
            and leads Nathan to describe the General as &quot;a murderer who
            fell in love with his own legend&quot; -- grants Nathan a semblance
            of self-righteousness, underscored when you meet his former
            commanding officer, the aptly named Colonel Bagley (typecast Tony
            Goldwyn). Chillingly mercenary and not a little smug, Bagley shows
            up with Nathan's friend, the bighearted Sgt. Zubulah Grant (Billy
            Connolly), with an offer of seeming redemption. The new gig entails
            training soldiers for Japan's anxious Emperor Meiji (Shichinosuke
            Nakamura), besieged by rebel samurai warriors (still endeavoring to
            serve the Emperor, they are hard put to understand his decision to
            demolish them). Nathan is skeptical but also desperate, and so he
            agrees to teach this newly conscript army to shoot Winchesters (this
            contracting is supported by the U.S. government). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Predictably,
            Bagley makes a crucially bad decision when he sends forth the troops
            when Nathan says (and quite ably demonstrates) they're not ready.
            Following a bloody battle with the samurais (during which Bagley
            characteristically retreats to the rear), Nathan fights valiantly,
            killing a Warrior in Red Armor before he is wounded and taken
            prisoner by the unspeakably charismatic samurai warlord Katsumoto
            (Ken Watanabe, who would steal this film completely if not for its
            incessant worship at the shrine of Cruiseness). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Though
            Katsumoto has been dismissed as &quot;another tribal leader,&quot;
            Nathan is soon convinced otherwise. Carted back to Katsumoto's
            mountain village, Nathan is subjected to a <i>Dances With Wolves</i>-ish
            recuperation and reeducation, nursed back to health by the widow of
            the Red Armored fellow. Taka (Koyoki) is visibly unhappy about this
            arrangement (in fact, she spends most of her onscreen time in tears,
            her flawless face framed in tender close-ups), but does her duty as
            assigned by Katsumoto. Nathan, being the crass American, is slow to
            realize the precise nature of the pain he's inflicting by his very
            existence, and remains determined to demonstrate his manly fortitude
            under the most trivial of circumstances. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">When
            he's not eating meals with the widow and learning Japanese from her
            adorable young children, Nathan finds himself led about the village
            by an elderly guide he nicknames &quot;Bob&quot; and mocks
            mercilessly (&quot;You're angry because they make you wear a
            dress&quot;). &quot;I continue to live among these unusual
            people,&quot; he writes in his diary (and speaks in helpful
            voiceover). &quot;I'm treated with a kind of benign
            negligence.&quot; At the same time, thanks to a series of
            &quot;conversations&quot; with the conveniently English-speaking
            Katsumoto, Nathan gradually comes to revere Bushido, the Way of the
            Warrior, especially as it's not so foreign to his own way of
            honorable man's thinking.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Impressed
            by his hosts' discipline and perfectionism, as well as their
            hand-to-hand combat skills, Nathan trains to fight like a samurai:
            here, his epiphany comes (ironically, considering who's playing the
            part) when he learns <i>not</i> to perform for an audience.
            &quot;Too many mind,&quot; observes a teacher. He needs to stop
            minding, stop thinking, only to serve, to feel. Eventually, he's so
            sharp that he comes to the defense of Katsumoto when the Emperor
            sends deadly ninjas to attack him in his village. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            Nathan must eventually come to terms with his part in the serial
            decimation of ancient ways of life, he must also return to his
            &quot;people&quot; (and those who originally hired him) back in
            Tokyo. But as he finally recognizes the absolute destructive power
            of &quot;modern&quot; U.S. industry, weaponry, and international
            contracting, Nathan is also the means for the film to undermine its
            own carefully constructed respect for this very traditional culture.
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">He
            not only decides to throw in with Katsumoto against the unscrupulous
            Japanese general and Bagley, he also reminds Katsumoto of his own
            vital values and time-honored codes. Seppuku is not helpful here;
            stand and fight, urges Nathan, even if it's only another form of
            ritual suicide. That the white man becomes the most ferocious,
            respected, and committed Samurai in sight is odd, and not a little
            appropriative. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            inevitable climactic battle scenes (which seem a long time coming,
            since the film, so unsubtle, moves glacially) incorporate images and
            ideas familiar from director Zwick's other march-into-certain-death
            war movie, <i>Glory</i>. The valiant Samurais follow respected
            rituals and even engage some cunning subterfuge, but are no match
            for mechanical weapons, big guns wheeled in and aimed directly into
            their ranks. The sheer scope of the brutality surely indicts the
            West and Bagley as its representative, as well as the Japanese
            officers who purchase such power rather than earn their men's
            respect or enter into battle alongside them. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Such
            politics are simplistic in the way that <i>Dances With Wolves</i>
            was simplistic -- greedy men are bad, no matter what race or nation
            claims them. But <i>The Last Samurai</i>'s veneration of old-school
            principles is just as surely undercut by its lack of nerve, namely,
            its use of Nathan as that most familiar icon, the grandly galloping
            hero, hair flying. <o:p>
