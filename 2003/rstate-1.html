            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b>From
            its start -- Nate Dogg in front of Mount Rushmore and flanked by
            white girl dancers dressed in skimpy red, white, and blue -- Chris
            Rock's crossover dream of a movie is obvious and derivative. Nate,
            of course, can deliver a hook like no one else, but here he's
            reduced to rhyming no-brainer observations of plot.</b></span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">A
            similar droopiness and lack of invention pervade <i>Head of State</i>,
            which Rock co-wrote (with longtime collaborator Ali LeRoi -- with
            whom he worked on <i>The Chris Rock Show</i> and the lamentable <i>Down
            to Earth</i>). He also co-produced, as well as directed. And oh yes,
            he stars too, as DC Alderman Mays Gilliam, a mostly
            well-intentioned, mostly ineffectual local organizer who becomes a
            TV hero when he saves an old lady and her cat from a building about
            to be razed by heartless contractors. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">When
            his party's candidates for President and Vice President die
            suddenly, Mays is tapped by the party's mucky-mucks to run for
            President in 2004. Their reasoning is typical of self-interested
            career politicians: anyone who would take this gig only nine weeks
            before the election is doomed to lose; Mays will lose big-time, and
            then the stage will be set for the major mucky-muck, Senator Bill
            Arnot (James Rebhorn), to run and win in 2008. Mays looks a little
            skeptical, for a minute, and even flinches when he sees his first
            version of a recurring vision of his own Malcolm X-like
            assassination). But he soon agrees to run, for otherwise, there
            would be no movie. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">In
            order to make good his plot, Arnot enlists his loyal and wily staff
            to run Mays' expensive faux campaign: Martin (Dylan Baker) as
            manager, Debra (Lynn Whitfield) as his advisor, and, as white girl
            &quot;masseuse&quot; -- every campaign must have one -- wifty Nikki
            (Stephanie March, whose four or five lines here make her role as ADA
            on <i>Law &amp; Order: SVU</i> look positively progressive). Their
            project is to smooth out Mays' rough edges, dress him in suits, and
            shoot a commercial featuring white kids in the sunshine and a white
            lady with an apple pie. This does give Mays brief pause, but again,
            he goes along: these are the professionals, surely they know what's
            best. That is, for all his street smarts affect, Mays is
            astonishingly ignorant. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Debra
            and Martin also come up with a canned speech for Mays to read on
            every occasion, extolling his love for whatever audience he's
            addressing so he sounds exactly the same (and exactly like every
            other candidate) whether he's addressing dairy farmers in Wisconsin,
            churchgoers in Memphis, or cowboys in Texas (or at least, folks in
            cowboy hats): he loves America and he's proud of American values,
            etc. This despite the fact that, in his first public appearance, at
            a swank DC fundraiser, he &quot;gets the party started,&quot;
            getting the tux-and-evening-gowned crowd to electric slide to
            Nelly's &quot;Hot in Herre.&quot; (And please, a moratorium on lumpy
            white people fo-shizzling -- the joke is tired already.) <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">At
            long last (in this ninety-five-minute movie), the campaign swings
            through Chicago, home of Mays' silk-suit-wearing bail bondsman
            brother Mitch (Bernie Mac, so welcome here, and so underused). After
            they share some tender slaps and punches, older brother advises
            younger that, gee, maybe he should be his own person, make his own
            speeches, and speak his own mind. This novel idea moves Mays to turn
            off the teleprompter and start a call-and-response, exhorting his
            listeners to be mad about what's wrong: and &quot;That ain't
            right!&quot; is born as a campaign slogan. And, pathetically, this
            sounds ingenious compared to the slogan that defines his opponent,
            sitting Vice President Lewis (Nick Searcy): &quot;God bless America,
            and no place else!&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">This
            jumpstarts Mays' new and improved campaign, a hiphop campaign. He
            trades in his blue suit and power tie for FUBU gear, starts telling
            it (supposedly) like it is, and gains twenty points in the polls.
            This looks vaguely dangerous, like he might win, so both Lewis and
            Arnot start running dirty tricks of the predictable sort, negative
            ads and appeals to racism. This is, of course, a potential goldmine
            for jokes by Chris Rock, the man who (long ago, it seems) concocted
            the ingenious, and certainly provocative, &quot;difference between a
            black man and a nigger&quot; routine.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>But no. Most of what goes on here is lethargic: gags based on
            lottery tickets, the Players' Ball, and Sharon Stone; repeated
            soundtrack references to Jay-Z and DMX (mixed by DJ Quik, perhaps as
            markers of a wholly commercial black culture?); and explicit
            instructions, such as, &quot;Politics is no place to express
            yourself.&quot; You know, like mainstream movies. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">To
            pad out the plot (and make it even more predictable), Mays is
            juggling two girls (two and a half if you count Nikki's half-hearted
            effort to seduce him). The first is his ho of an ex-fiancée, Kim
            (Robin Givens, who has never been more annoying, ever). She kicked
            him out at film's beginning, screaming and contorting about his lack
            of ambition. Now that he's headed somewhere, she appears at all
            sorts of functions, disguised as a marching band member or a
            questioner at the Presidential Debate, planning their wedding out
            loud until he yells, &quot;Security,&quot; and a black-gloved hand
            swoops into frame, covers her mouth, and drags her off. One time for
            this routine would have been plenty, but much as <i>The Chris Rock
            Show</i> used to do, the film beats this dead horse, again and again
            and again. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            other girl is, of course, the good one, Lisa (Tamala Jones). He
            meets her at the register at a DC gas station, where she works
            multiple shifts. Adorable, smart, and determined, she's his perfect
            First Lady. In another movie, she might even be charming and lively,
            but here, she's stuck on the other end of phone conversations, with
            Mays whining about his loss of direction and depression. She
            encourages him to run his own race, as if he has blinders on, the
            way racehorses do. Blinders: this is, in its way, astounding advice.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">When,
            at long last and for his own well being, Mays is counseled to quit
            the impossible campaign, he steps up: &quot;You just represent
            yourself,&quot; he schools the completely oblivious Martin, &quot;I
            represent my whole race.&quot; Rock has already pushed past it, and
            in so doing, made clear -- repeatedly and with clever venom -- the
            ongoing institutional racism that supports it. As crossover-dreamy
            as it is, <i>Head of State</i> may just grant him enough industry
            clout to drag it - the industry -- along with him.</span></font>
