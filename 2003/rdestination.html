            the first anniversary of the explosion of Flight 180. Kimberly
            Corman (A.J. Cook) sleeps fitfully, as a talk show host on her
            scritchy, blue-lighty television recalls the explosion and the
            tragedies that followed: when a group of students got off the flight
            because Alex (Devon Sawa) had a vision that foretold the explosion,
            one by one they all died &quot;weird, seemingly random,&quot; and
            quite horrible deaths. The talk show guest draws his gloomy
            conclusion: &quot;We are surrounded by death, absolutely, everyday,
            everywhere.&quot; And, of course, it's a good idea to &quot;look
            beneath the visible world.&quot; Whatever that means.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

            this info may be helpful for anyone who hasn't seen <i>Final
            Destination</i>. For everyone else -- that is, the most likely
            audience for <i>Final Destination 2</i> -- it's standard slasher
            sequel setup: briefly recount past events, set a mood, and send
            forth the latest batch of victims-to-be smack into fatal havoc...
            or, in the case of the <i>FD</i> films, into death's &quot;grand
            design.&quot; For in these films, there are no accidents, except of
            survival: the only uncertainty (that is, the thrill) is how wacky
            the deaths will be.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            this movie, as the talk show ends, Kim wakes, breathing hard: she's
            in trouble. Within minutes, she's out in the sunshine, saying
            bye-bye to her dad and driving to Florida for Spring Break, with her
            best blond girlfriend and a couple of doper-boys in tow. As she
            drives and her pals mess around, Kim starts to see &quot;signs&quot;
            -- &quot;Highway to Hell&quot; comes on the car radio; a beer truck
            driver drinks while he's driving; her SUV engine light comes on; a
            kid crashes a couple of toy cars for Kim's benefit. Then, disaster:
            a log falls off a truck and smashes through a windshield,
            obliterating the driver's head into a splatter of blood and brain
            matter; in excruciating slow-motion succession, multiple cars ram,
            slam, crunch, and burst into flames. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kim
            wakes -- again -- this time in the driver's seat at the on-ramp to
            Route 23. What's just happened is her version of Alex's plane
            explosion premonition, and since she knows today's the anniversary,
            she quickly puts together what her vision means. She swings her
            vehicle around so no one behind her can get past, thus saving all
            their lives in the multi-car pile-up that does take place before
            their eyes. (Too bad for the cars that do crash -- their drivers'
            faces do not appear in her vision and so they're plot-moving toast.)<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Officer
            Thomas Burke (Michael Landes) happens to be in this line of cars
            behind Kim. Following the actual accident, after her premonition, he
            hauls her and the others on the ramp down to headquarters so they
            can discuss what happened, and, more to the point, so they can more
            or less reproduce the airport discussion scene from the first film.
            On hearing that they may be now involved in a scheme whereby
            &quot;Death itself&quot; will be stalking them, the
            survivors-about-to-be-victims react variously. They mention Clear
            Rivers (Ali Larter), the only survivor from the first film, now
            voluntarily locked in a padded room (apparently, Sawa had better
            things to do than come back for more, so Alex's death by a falling
            brick is reported in a news headline), and thus available for
            consultation. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">According
            to formula, the survivors leave the room believing the story is
            mostly unbelievable, so that Death can get on with its business. The
            first to go is Evan (David Paetkau), a swaggering, material boy who
            has, oh so ironically, not only not died in the fiery calamity, but
            has also just won the lottery. His death is the most protracted and
            obviously comic -- taking several minutes and a series of accidents
            (his gold-watch-bearing wrist stuck in his sink's garbage disposal
            while his dinner ignites on the stove, a failed fire extinguisher,
            and an initial narrow escape that leads to a ferocious smack-down by
            Death), but it sets the tone for the rest of the bizarre, shockingly
            flesh-and-bone-devastating demises. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's
            obvious that the casualties are the film's <i>raison d'etre</i> --
            the more incredible and creative, the better. As in the first film,
            most of these deaths are presaged by Rube Goldbergian chains of
            circumstances -- a drip here leads to an effect there, which leads
            to a rising tension for you while the victim remains blithely
            unaware that a bone-shattering plate glass window or a spike through
            the skull is coming his or her way. The suddenness of several of
            these deaths suggests that the filmmakers attended to the great
            popularity of the alarming smashed-by-a-bus moment in the original <i>FD</i>:
            most of these fatalities involve bodies spattering into fluids. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            the midst of all this amusement, <i>Final Destination 2</i>,
            scripted by J. Mackye Gruber and Eric Bress, does devote a few brief
            minutes to &quot;character development.&quot; These belong mostly to
            your hero Kim (&quot;Why is this happening to me?&quot; she frets,
            much like Alex before her); her not-quite-romantic-interest Burke;
            and a cocky biker named Eugene (T.C. Carson), who declares, with
            typical token-black-guy affect, &quot;My ass is alive!&quot; Another
            rather vivid character is a coke addict named Rory (Jonathan
            Cherry), who, for all his eye-poppy jitters, will likely be best
            remembered for his utterly appalling death, which combines an idea
            ripped off from Paul W. S. Anderson's <i>Resident Evil</i> (and, no
            doubt, precursors) and some common farm equipment. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So
            as to adhere to formula (those requisite references to first film in
            a series), Kim contacts Clear, drawing her out of her cell and into
            the melee with a whiny judgment: &quot;You're a coward,&quot; she
            asserts, then flips Clear the bird in the surveillance monitor
            outside her hospital room door. It appears that the central reason
            Clear emerges is so she can lead Kim and Burke to visit with the
            first film's uncanny and odiously named mortician, Bill Bludworth
            (Tony Todd, evidently typecast for life). He's hanging out in a
            peculiarly hellish morgue -- red light, shadowy corners, sinister
            stone walls -- where Kim and crew arrive in order to ask him how to
            &quot;stop Death.&quot; He smiles cruelly, then advises cryptically
            that they find a &quot;flaw in the design.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Bludworth's
            mostly unnecessary re-appearance aside, the <i>Final Destination</i>
            franchise has come up with a somewhat clever spin on the slasher
            formula, that is, to excise the embodied slasher. &quot;Death
            itself&quot; need never be visual or even characterized, which
            grants the series a long-term lack of investment in a performer or
            set of particular causes and effects. No need to entice a Robert
            Englund (or several actors in hockey masks) to return for subsequent
            installments. Just dish up the basics, namely, dead bodies,
            preferably arranged for in ridiculous, increasingly outrageously
            entertaining ways, so as to allow a certain distance from the
            enacted violence and presumed emotional effects. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            understanding of the essentials of slasher aesthetics -- such films
            work like musicals, with story and characters only lined up to get
            from one set piece to another, the set pieces here being gory
            slayings -- possesses an elegant simplicity. While the design
            appears to draw from video games (which drew from film and other
            narratives), it also grasps the bare bones of (movie) plots, per se:
            conflict leads to resolution. And this may or may not open into a
            next conflict, depending on box office and/or video sales. However
            you feel about the design's moral, political, or even artistic
            aspects, on its own terms, it's flawless. <o:p>
