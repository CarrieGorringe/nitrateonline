            very seriously. There are apparently a few popular Israeli tunes
            that have added to its local success, but the synthetic music won't
            ever hit the American charts. Less than a dozen men and two women,
            irresolutely stationed at a remote Northern outpost along the
            Lebanese border, are surrounded by fields of snow and barbed-wire
            fence. Boredom is rampant. Military intelligence is the oxymoron <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:

            the land of milk and honey. Something has soured in this no man's

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This 71-minute
            hand-held, digital-to film feature made for Israel Cable Programming
            in 2002 by New York City-born, Jerusalem-raised Eytan Fox is based
            on a true story about a career officer and his sensitive
            second-in-command. They have not told anyone, friend or family, of
            their hush-hush affair, lest they be drummed out of the military (so
            much for the army being a closed-knit family). The outpost, having
            been re-manned after a brief furlough, finds the grunt soldiers
            exhausting themselves digging a ditch to bury a pile of rancid meat,
            spoiled during their absence for lack of power to their
            refrigerator. Logically, I wonder how, if it's so cold in this
            claustrophobic settlement, that the food could actually warm and
            spoil. Or burn the rotten meat. Anyway the company commander Yossi
            (Ohad Knoller) and platoon leader Lior Machai (Yehuda Levi),
            affectionately nicknamed Jagger for his rock star locks, heat up the
            scenery with a fight. A private snow fight, that is, which precludes
            a sexy dalliance that melts the snow around them.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">When their
            superior, the belligerent colonel Yoel (Sharon Regniano) arrives
            unexpectedly for a yet-to-be-announced mission, he's more anxious to
            sample the culinary wares of the resourceful cook Yaniv (Erez
            Kahana) who creates an ingenious dish culled from the non-spoiled
            staples left in his kitchen. When he's not boorish, the macho-man
            colonel is getting serviced by Goldie (Hani Furstenberg), a sexy
            blonde recruit with David Letterman set of teeth who doesn't seem to
            mind that her boss has only one &quot;chore&quot; for her. She's in
            the army to have fun!</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            brunette companion Yaeli (Aya Koren) has her sights on heartthrob
            Jagger, unaware of his sexual leanings. That there's something
            different about him. Ofir (Assi Cohen) is the company's jealous
            schemer and anxious to get into Yaeli's pants. Even Shakespeare
            can't be this bad, can it?</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            to send the men out on a &quot;hot ambush,&quot; I wonder if that's
            some Kama Sutra position other than the lame, and ultimately tragic,
            military exercise it becomes. The soldiers wonder about the
            operation as well, heading out into enemy territory under a full
            moon.</font><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Okay. Okay. The
            acting is passable and the two leads are pretty fellows. The film's
            production design is dull, gray grunge. The landscape is cold,
            murky, dissolute. In this setting, every soldier wants to make love,
            not war. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Yossi &amp; Jagger</i>
            is an economically short piece, with a sentimental postscript that
            barely makes sitting through it worthwhile. Soldiering in the
            Israeli Army never looked so bad.<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><o:p>
