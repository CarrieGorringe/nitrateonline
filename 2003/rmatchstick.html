            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Normally known for making films
            with large sets, eye-popping special effects and bone-crunching
            action, it's nice to know that Sir Ridley Scott (<i>Alien</i>, <i>Blade
            Runner</i>, <i>Gladiator</i> and <i>Black Hawk Down</i>) can handle
            human stories with roughly the same skill that he orchestrates
            spectacle.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Roy Harrell (Nicolas Cage) may feel
            bad about being a con artist, but he takes a lot of pride in the
            fact that he handles the job exceptionally well. When forced to
            admit how he makes a crooked living, he hedges and then baldly
            states what he does with a loud emphasis on &quot;artist.&quot; Roy
            and his partner Frank Mercer (Sam Rockwell) have such a finely tuned
            routine that they can hit the same victim twice without being
            detected.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The problem for Roy is that the
            same traits that enable him to successfully hoodwink a mark twice
            make his personal life a nightmare. Roy has to keep his home clean
            to the point of sterility. Visitors, in the rare moments when they
            do come, can't wear shoes on his immaculately maintained rug. He
            also has an aversion to sunlight that makes him practically a mole
            when he's not on the job. It gets worse when his medication runs
            out. Roy tries to hit up a new shrink for pills, but to Roy's regret
            his new psychiatrist (Bruce Altman) is more interested in digging
            through his psyche than loading him with meds.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the process venting to poor
            doctor, Roy discovers that he has a teenage daughter he's never met.
            Angela (Alison Lohman) is a giddy rambunctious bundle of energy who
            also shows up at home unannounced and leaves messes. She also seems
            to give her newfound dad a sense of satisfaction he's been missing
            for a long time. She's fascinated by dad's work and, to his glee,
            takes to it easily.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Whereas a lot of filmmakers might
            have Roy absorbed with guilt over his daughter's decision to follow
            in his crooked footsteps, Scott and screenwriters Nicholas Griffin
            and Ted Griffin, working from Eric Garcia's book, have Roy wavering
            between minor pangs of guilt and gushing admiration of Angela's
            budding skill. This more complicated approach allows Cage, in a role
            he was born to play, to exercise his fondness for quirky characters
            and physical ticks without reducing the tale into an emotional freak
            show. Cage thankfully keeps Roy human enough to keep him interesting
            and even likable in his darkest moments. The flamboyant Rockwell
            serves as an able counterpart, brashly complementing Roy's
            withdrawal. Lohman, however, is something of a revelation. Despite
            being a decade older than her character, she's completely convincing
            as a teen and achieves just the right blend of innocence and lethal
            curiosity.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Griffin brothers -- Ted
            scripted Steven Soderbergh's <i>Oceans Eleven</i> --<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>expectedly churn out some tasty dialogue (Angela: “You
            don't seem like a bad guy.” Roy: ”That's why I'm so good at
            it”.), but their real achievement is taking story elements like
            having a crook see a psychiatrist (as in <i>The Sopranos</i> and <i>Analyze
            This</i>) and still make them seem fresh.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Scott for his part doesn't let his
            smaller canvas cramp his sense of style. Having started in
            commercials, Scott uses color and sound with remarkable finesse,
            accenting Roy's sense of isolation. His primarily Rat Pack era song
            soundtrack (the newest tune is an ‘80's entry from Roxy Music) and
            Hans Zimmer's organ score put the viewer in Roy's socks nicely.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What's most interesting about <i>Matchstick
            Men</i> is that Roy's condition is not explicitly described as
            obsessive-compulsive disorder, but alert viewers can figure it out
            on their own. Scott and company have approached the film
            intelligently and have thankfully credited their viewers with having
            brains as well.</font></td>
