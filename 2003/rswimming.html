            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by Nicholas Schager,
            4 July 2003</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>After turning his fascination
            with murder, mystery, and beautiful women into the enjoyably
            lightweight Agatha Christie musical <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">8
            Women</i>, French provocateur François Ozon returns to more
            malevolent ground with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Swimming
            Pool</i>, a thriller that re-teams the filmmaker with his <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Under the Sand</i> star Charlotte Rampling. Rampling plays a stodgy
            British mystery novelist who, retiring to her publisher’s French
            summer house, becomes engaged (for good and bad) in a war of wills
            with her employer’s trampy daughter, who has unexpectedly arrived
            at the residence for the summer. Then someone winds up dead, and a
            whirlwind of nefarious scheming is set in motion.</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Or is it? Ozon, working from his
            first English language screenplay (co-written by Emmanu<span style="color:black">è</span>le
            Bernheim), sets the scene as if we were in for a straightforward
            suspense story in the vein of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">See
            the Sea</i>, his chilling debut short film that also concerned two
            female strangers at an idyllic French cottage. Rampling’s Sarah,
            saddled with writer’s block as she attempts to produce the latest
            in a series of mystery novels, arrives at the house and immediately
            gets to work, the words seemingly coaxed out of her body by the
            soothing tranquility of her surroundings. She takes lunch at a
            nearby outdoor café, sits on a deck enjoying the sun, and eats her
            routine bowlful of vanilla yogurt – a comfortable but boring means
            of re-energizing her creative spirit. She’s a fuddy duddy in every
            sense of the word, a woman whose cold and clinical books deal not
            with characters but with carefully diagrammed murders and
            investigations, and this retreat seems to be the perfect way to get
            back in touch with her dull self.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">All hell breaks loose when Julie
            (Ludivine Sagnier), the sex-kitten daughter of Sarah’s publisher,
            arrives without warning and decides to stay. The two are unlikely
            roommates, and Sarah immediately becomes infuriated over Julie’s
            slovenly habits, loud music, and penchant for bringing home
            different male lovers (some many years her elder) each night of the
            week. Julie is everything that Sarah is not – carefree,
            uninhibited, comfortable with her own sexuality – and the two
            clash openly about their disgust for the other. Until, that is, the
            volatile tension becomes a source of inspiration for Sarah, opening
            the author’s imaginative floodgates in a surge of artistic output.
            Their bickering doesn’t subside, but Sarah slowly begins to take a
            clandestine interest in the young harlot, going so far as to steal
            Julie’s diary in order to use it as the jumping-off point for her
            uniquely personal new novel.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meanwhile, the house’s swimming
            pool looms ominously in the back yard, a giant rectangular entity
            that, when Sarah initially arrives, is covered by a tarp. As
            befitting this titular object, the pool (and its gradual uncovering)
            becomes a metaphor for Sarah’s emotional and sexual awakening, but
            this awkward and obvious imagery speaks to the film’s fundamental
            shortcoming: it’s so convinced of its psychological depth that it
            ignores, and thus fails to provide, any measure of genuine
            excitement. Not content to let his actress’ performances speak for
            themselves, the filmmaker gives Sarah’s a bland aquamarine
            bedroom, while her firebrand housemate Julie inhabits a blood red
            room, and the symbolism is shocking in its clumsiness – does Ozon,
            a director with a true gift for creepy understatement, really find
            these signifiers subtle or necessary? As in her previous (and far
            superior) collaboration with Ozon, Rampling effortlessly conveys the
            stunted inner life of a woman incapable of breaking free from
            self-imposed chains, but the actress has nowhere to take Sarah
            except in one direction, and that path turns out to be a real
            snoozer. Ozon constructs his film as a whodunit but then stages all
            high drama inside Sarah herself, a move that might have worked had
            the director not sapped his film’s momentum by providing us with
            scene after scene in which nothing very interesting occurs. Only
            after an interminable wait does he toss an actual murder into the
            fray, but the move feels designed as a lame afterthought, a means of
            simply placating his audience while also satisfying his schematic
            script’s need for a thematic climax that seals Sarah’s
            transformation from a frigid bore into an empowered modern woman.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As with all his work, the director
            proves himself a master of stillness, of uneasy sterility and
            quietude, and his creepily-paced tracking shots and sparse use of
            music lend the film an air of chilly malice. Yorick Le Saux’s lush
            cinematography sparkles with summertime radiance, and Ozon makes
            sure to pay special attention to his leading ladies; the ogling
            camera repeatedly gliding over Rampling and Sagnier’s bodies from
            toe to head, Ozon implicates viewers as unabashed voyeurs while
            simultaneously allowing us the pleasure of reveling in his
            strong-willed protagonists’ physical sumptuousness. This is most
            readily apparent with Sagnier, whose petite, busty frame is
            frequently free of the constraints of clothing. We’re meant to
            find this undress as representative of Julie’s blithe
            constitution, but, like so much of the film’s tired plotting, Ozon
            goes to the well so many times that one eventually finds Sagnier’s
            nudity simply an immature symptom of the director’s own indulgent
            fantasies.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The only thing keeping <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Swimming
            Pool</i> afloat is the combustible chemistry Ozon elicits from his
            leading ladies, who imbue their petty squabbles and minor
            confrontations with a deliciously snide contentiousness. Rampling
            and Sagnier trade blows with the everyday nastiness of people who
            feel right at home with anger, resentment, and distrust, and their tête-à-têtes
            -- expertly framed in Ozon’s compositions with an eye toward
            spatial disharmony<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>--
            are the glue that tenuously holds the film’s flimsy premise
            together. Ozon tacks on a worthless surprise epilogue that’s sure
            to leave more than a few moviegoers scratching their heads, but
            given the phoniness of the entire affair, it’s unlikely that
            viewers will care to figure it out. Sarah’s passions may
            eventually be liberated by her experiences in France, but I’d just
            as soon suppress the memory of this elegant misfire.</font></td>
