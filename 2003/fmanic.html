<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Life can often seem absurd. Meaningless, even. 
The rituals and routines that define our existence can become almost too much to 
bear, as we ramble on from one day to the next. <i>What’s the point of it all</i>, 
we ask ourselves, struggling to make sense of life, the world, and everything. 
Before directing <i>Manic</i>, the sober new film about life in a juvenile 
mental hospital, Jordan Melamed wrestled with this existentialist conflict.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I was in the pit,&quot; he recalls of his days as a 
commodities trader, buying and selling on the crowded floors of Chicago’s 
cutthroat Stock Exchange. &quot;The animalism of the trading world is remarkably 
similar to that of the film business. However, it’s in your face in the pits, 
and more hidden in the movie industry.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Currently, Melamed is facing a different type 
of absurdity. Cooped up in a Seattle hotel room, he’s fielding a frantic, 
nonstop barrage of press questions. It’s the filmmaking equivalent to ol’ 
Sisyphus and his eternal rock-pushing routine, but Melamed has chosen to enjoy 
the redundant rhythms that come with publicizing his movie. His young star, 
Joseph Gordon-Levitt, is also along for the ride. &quot;I haven’t been in Seattle for 
five years,&quot; the actor announces, glad to be in the stomping grounds once 
frequented by Nirvana, his favorite band. &quot;I went to Pike Street Market 
yesterday.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In <i>Manic</i>, Gordon-Levitt plays Lyle, a 
volatile adolescent whose schoolyard fighting lands him behind the locked fences 
of Northwoods Mental Institution. While receiving therapy for anger management 
issues, Lyle joins a sullen stew of troubled teens. Tracey (Zooey Deschanel, the 
older sister from <i>Almost Famous</i>) is a fair-skinned ghost of a girl 
tormented by unfriendly nocturnal visions, while Sara (Sara Rivas, <i>Crash</i>) 
dresses in Goth garb and oozes rebellion. Michael (Eldon Henson, <i>The Mighty</i>) 
is a doughy, blonde bully who invites violence with each crass insult he hurls, 
and Chad (Michael Bacall, who also co-wrote Manic’s gutsy screenplay) is a 
melodramatic manic-depressive with an artist’s sensitive heart. Meanwhile, 
there’s tentative, frail Kenny (Cody Lightning), whose near-comatose flatness is 
borne of an abusive past too horrible to speak of.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This nest of broken kids is nurtured by Dave 
(Don Cheadle), a Northwoods psychiatrist who facilitates grueling group therapy 
sessions in an effort to prepare his patients for community living.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And while Dave has a life on the outside, 
Cheadle plays this pressured mental-health professional as a man with his own 
boulder to push. Looking into the dead eyes of Northwoods’ young residents, many 
of whom have endured abuse, neglect, and psychosis, Dave wrestles with his own 
vision of the world’s absurdity.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Life is a struggle,&quot; Dave asks his group with 
harsh, point-blank bluntness. &quot;Can you handle it?&quot; Cheadle’s shrink poses the 
question as a dare, challenging his group to grasp at what makes life meaningful 
and run with it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The same challenge to find truth and meaning 
from life is what led Melamed to abandon trading and pick up a camera. Before 
graduating from the American Film Institute in 1997, Melamed used the school as 
a vehicle for directing <i>A Corner in Gold.</i> &quot;It tells the story of a 
commodities trader who is literally trying to corner the gold market,&quot; Melamed 
explains. &quot;He learns the hard way that sometimes it’s not possible to follow in 
a father’s footsteps, as he is trying to do.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The short film won Melamed a student Emmy at 
AFI, and it was aired on numerous cable stations before attracting the attention 
of studio talent scouts. When asked if the tale is autobiographical, the 
director chuckles. &quot;Well, let me just say this. I think that in making a film, 
you have to identify very strongly with its characters in order to make it feel 
alive.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Melamed’s fierce connection to characters is 
what attracted him to <i>Manic</i>’s original script, penned by Blayne Weaver 
and Michael Bacall. A child actor who had appeared in <i>Free Willy</i>, <i>This 
Boy’s Life</i>, and the <i>A-Team</i> television series, Bacall’s second 
screenplay (his first was for the film <i>Bookies</i>) conveyed an emotional 
truth that resonated with Melamed. After the two talents met in 1998, they 
immediately noted the story’s parallels with Albert Camus’ essay, &quot;The Myth of 
Sisyphus.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;All of the characters in <i>Manic</i> are 
trying to decide whether life is just this pointless charade – pushing a rock up 
a mountain, only to see it rollback down – or is there meaning in it all?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Manic</i> shuns the high-gloss artificiality 
of big studio productions, preferring a gritty, jittery vision borne of 
handheld, digital camerawork. When Cheadle throws questions to his audience of 
patients, and they rattle back answers, the viewer feels immersed, as if also 
participating in this intimate psychotherapy group. &quot;With this type of 
material,&quot; explains Melamed, &quot;you’ve got to tell the story in a way that is 
organic. To capture spontaneous performances, it’s essential to use small 
cameras as you would with digital.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To heighten his film’s realism even further, 
Melamed shot several improvised scenes not originally included in <i>Manic</i>’s 
script, giving its performances an urgent, almost documentary edge that doesn’t 
resemble mannered acting. &quot;In the finished movie,&quot; he proudly proclaims, &quot;you 
can’t tell what is improvised and what is scripted. It flows together pretty 
seamlessly.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Melamed admiringly cites a scene in which 
Gordon-Levitt sits on a bench with Deschanel. &quot;His character tells a story about 
his mother, and how he almost hit her. He completely improvised all of it.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Gordon-Levitt, best know for his work on T.V.’s
<i>Third Rock from the Sun</i> series as alien Tommy Solomon, deserves kudos for 
such on-the-spot improvisation. However, he’s most effective in Manic when he’s 
not engaged in dialogue. His eyes are steely slits that warn strangers to keep a 
distance, and his intense masculinity brings to mind a young Russell Crowe. &quot;Why 
are we supposed to trust you guys when things like this happen?&quot; his character 
barks at Dave after another youth is victimized within the supposedly safe walls 
of Northwoods. The world-weary vigilance and distrust reflected in 
twenty-two-year-old actor’s searing eyes are those associated with a much older 
man, and make Lyle a tragic figure. He’s disillusioned with life even before his 
post-school existence has begun. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When asked if he studied actual patients to 
research the role of Lyle, Gordon-Levitt sounds displeased. &quot;I don’t like the 
word studied,&quot; he confirms before a brief pause. &quot;It makes it seems as though 
they are lab rats. The most important thing that came across for me concerning 
kids like Lyle, was that I could be friends with these guys. They're not some 
strange, alien breed. These characters are dealing with the same issues of love 
and hate that any human being does.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;When I spent time with different people that 
had been in mental hospitals, we never really spoke about the hospital, or about 
their rage, or childhood. We just hung out like we would if we had met at a 
party, sitting around smoking cigarettes and talking about music.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In fact, Gordon-Levitt often kept himself at 
arm’s length from the psychiatric information filling the charts of such 
patients. &quot;I did speak with a psychologist, but I tried my best to ignore the 
clinical point of view. I didn’t read up medically on what it’s like to be 
bipolar, or have violent outbursts. My character wouldn’t have the benefit of 
that knowledge.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In addition to its clear-eyed look at mental 
hospital residents as people first, and patients second, <i>Manic </i>also 
provides a realistic glimpse at the exhausting, emotionally draining routine of 
a therapist. During one clever montage, Dave interviews each of his patients 
from behind a sprawling office desk. As each teen takes a chair in front of his, 
the psychiatrist asks, &quot;What kind of progress have you made since you’ve been 
here?&quot; The camera cuts between his weary-yet-hopeful face, and the indifferent 
answers and flat expressions of his charges. We watch Cheadle’s shrink fight off 
frustration, wondering whether any of these lost souls will ever improve. </font>
</p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Therapists must have tremendous empathy to be 
good at their jobs,&quot; exclaims Melamed, tipping his hat to mental-health 
professionals. &quot;And just like a filmmaker would, I’ll bet that therapists get 
some kind of catharsis being in group therapy themselves. They’re unheralded. 
Society only heralds our sports heroes.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While <i>Manic</i> refuses to stereotype its 
subjects as being nothing more than the sum of their diagnoses (&quot;Just because 
you’re diagnosed bipolar,&quot; confirms Melamed, &quot;doesn’t mean you also have anger 
issues&quot;), its director and star are quick to point out how their own personality 
quirks parallel many mental-health conditions. &quot;I’ve never had myself 
psychoanalyzed,&quot; says Gordon-Levitt, &quot;but I do know that my mind is often 
divided into two states. Whatever my focus is on any given day, I can be 
depressed and nervous about it and not think I’ll be able to handle it, or I can 
feel wonderfully confident, like I’m gonna do something pro-active about my 
life, and have a much more positive outlook about things. Each day, I have these 
turns. I think that everybody does.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;That’s what <i>Manic</i> is all about,&quot; the 
actor confirms. &quot;It’s not so much about a mental institution, but about the 
conflicts, struggles, and resolutions that are presented by life. These things 
are not at all exclusive to a mental institution. They’re just human traits.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The struggles that Gordon-Levitt speaks of 
bring us back to the world of Greek mythology, and Sisyphus. &quot;The movie does 
imply hope,&quot; he confirms, &quot;and it does call to you not to give up and surrender 
to apathy in the face of all that’s wrong with the world. It shows that one 
shouldn’t lash out with hostility and violence, but rather, try to buckle down 
and accept the pain of the struggle. Live through it and try to grow.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Sisyphus pushed a boulder painfully up a 
mountain, only to watch it fall down. You can curse the world, and kick the 
boulder, and break your toes. Or, you can rally and sing a song to yourself 
while you’re walking down the mountain. <i>Manic</i> fits rightly around this 
idea, that you can surrender and give up to the absurdity, or embrace it and 
live an engaged life.&quot; </font></p>
