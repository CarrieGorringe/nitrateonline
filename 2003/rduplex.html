            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Oh, yeah, I've had crazy
            neighbors. Shortly before I relocated eight years ago, I had one guy
            move into the apartment next to mine. Single, no furniture. When
            anyone came to the door, he just shouted, without opening the door,
            &quot;GO-'WAY!&quot; He worked some really strange shift at some
            job, so that, at midnight, on weekdays, without fail, when the rest
            of the apartment block was just getting to sleep, he would stomp up
            the stairs and go CLOMP-CLOMP-CLOMP across the landing to his front
            door. Always the same way. One neighbor, who worked as a registered
            nurse, changed one apartment over to get away from it. When the guy
            cooked, he'd get something out of his cabinets and always slammed
            the cabinet door shut; he kept this up once for an hour and a half,
            steady. When he once broke-up with someone, he put the soundtrack
            for <i>The Bodyguard</i> on his CD player, played Whitney Houston's
            &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot;, put it on &quot;repeat&quot;,
            then started singing along with it. At ten o'clock at night. The
            limit, though, came when one girlfriend suddenly started emitting
            these blood-curdling screams -- and I mean screams -- from inside
            his apartment one night. I didn't know what was going on, but it
            didn't sound good, and it occasioned me to call both my landlords
            and 911. So, yeah, I've had crazy neighbors.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            is not as annoying as having to listen to Whitney Houston all night,
            and while Danny DeVito hasn't entirely lost his directoral touch,
            this new picture starts out as if it's going to be a black comedy,
            then ends up homogenizing itself into nothingness. Ben Stiller and
            Drew Barrymore play a couple who purchase a Brooklyn brownstone that
            already comes with an upstairs tenant, a sweet little old
            button-eyed Irish woman (Eileen Essell) who then proceeds to drive
            them crazy with distractions, until they get to the point where
            they'll do anything to get rid of her. Larry Doyle's original
            screenplay does not match the methodical approach of DeVito's
            directoral style -- some of the humor is dated (jokes about <i>Riverdance
            </i>and the Bronx?), a lot of the jokes fall over flat, like upright
            garden stones set in wet earth. Is the little old lady entirely
            innocent, or is she craftier than she seems? (My first thought was,
            she's trying to get rid of them while they're trying to get <i>her</i>
            to move out.) The movie even reverses itself on that point -- the
            matter seems to be resolved in a concluding scene, but there then
            follows a badly tacked-on bit that tries to make us believe
            something else entirely was going on. (As if the filmmakers were
            terrified they were going to produce something that wasn't going to
            please everyone. That's why independent films get made.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Harvey Fierstein, bless-'im,
            contributes a deftly-turned appearance as the real estate agent who
            handles the selling of the brownstone to our heroes. Stiller and
            Barrymore (both credited with helping to produce the film) work well
            together, and they go through virtual acrobatics trying to get their
            roles to work, and they at least remain appealing throughout.
            Essell, a long-time British stage and T.V actress, manages to find a
            way to play some of the more undignified moments she's asked to do,
            but the film wreaks her character's arc, in that we never get a
            definite idea what to make of her and we're left flummoxed by the
            would-be resolution tacked on to the end, so we just give-up. We did
            not feel that way about Anne Ramsey's elderly terror in <i>Throw
            Momma from the Train</i>, that's for sure. The film also looks like
            it's been through some last-minute-desperation recutting, and some
            of the cinematography is surprisingly poor. I think Danny DeVito has
            at least one good black comedy film in him that he could give us --
            think back to the way he said &quot;I could squash her like a
            grape!&quot; in <i>Ruthless People</i>, or to most of <i>The War of
            the Roses</i>, the second film he directed -- and he's one of the
            only people in Hollywood who is both interested in working in this
            vein and has a feel for it. But, given this picture and the reaction
            to his previous film, the children’s-show satire <i>Death to
            Smoochy</i> (which nonetheless had a brilliant performance by Edward
            Norton in it), I hope he hasn't run out of rope or the opportunity
            to do so.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"></o:p>
