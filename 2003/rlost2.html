            frame opens on a young woman's sheer pink panties. She's lying on
            her side, on a large white bed looking on a wide high-rise window;
            with her back to the camera, the long line of her torso is still,
            sinuous and graceful. It's only a moment, a hint of privilege and an
            invitation to desire, explicit and prepackaged, yet mysterious and
            elusive. It's the pop girl made quiet, vague, and not yours. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            shot cuts to Bill Murray, of all people, arriving at New Tokyo
            International Airport: in seconds, he's whisked off in a cab,
            immersed in neon and traffic as he sleeps briefly, jetlagged and
            bored. In fact, he's not Bill Murray here, but Bob, an action movie
            star in Japan, where he's shooting whiskey ads (&quot;For relaxing
            times, make it Suntory time&quot;) for a couple of million dollars.
            En route to the Park Hyatt, he passes his own billboard, and rubs
            his eyes as if startled, which he is not. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">In
            fact, Bob is feeling rather lost, an idea that comes up in repeated
            and shifting forms in Sofia Coppola's <i>Lost in Translation</i>.
            Not only is he not getting the language or the height or the
            contacts with his family back in L.A., but they produce not yearning
            so much as weariness, and unarticulated questions. His (offscreen,
            unseen) wife faxes him, noting that he missed his son's birthday
            (adding, &quot;I'm sure he'll understand&quot;), demanding a
            decision concerning the new carpet for his study; she sends a box of
            swatches, which tumble out onto the floor when he opens the package
            as if beyond his understanding. Fine, he mutters, whatever she
            wants. When he calls, she's rushed, taking the kids to school. What
            does he want, anyway? <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">This
            is the film's question -- what to want and how to want when you
            appear to have everything. Famous, rich, selfish: he couldn't be a
            less sympathetic character. On a commercial set, he half-smiles with
            his liquor glass in hand. &quot;Could you do it slower?&quot; asks
            the director, &quot;With more intensity?&quot; Fine. At a photo
            shoot, the photographer insists, &quot;I need mysterious face... You
            know Lat Pack?&quot; Ah, Bob knows, and contorts his face so it
            looks swingy: &quot;Sinatra, ring a ding ding.&quot; Less
            condescending than exhausted, he seeks someone out, someone with
            whom he can have a conversation. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Early
            in the film, Bob spots Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson, she of the
            pink panties shot) in the hotel elevator. She won't recall him
            later, though they're the only Caucasians in this tight package of
            suits. But Bob sees her smile at him, a familiar sign, pale and
            sweet. What he'll find out later, when the talk, is that Charlotte
            is a recent Yale graduate (in philosophy, no less), feeling her own
            sort of lostness, as she has little to do in Tokyo with her brand
            new husband John (Giovanni Ribisi, who narrated Coppola's delicate
            first film, 1999's <i>The Virgin Suicides</i>), a high-fashion
            photographer who appears to have no notion of who she is or why
            they're married. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">They
            run at different speeds. After collapsing into bed late at night, he
            stumbles off to work in the mornings, on occasion leaving her alone
            for days at a time. Later, she'll ask Bob (so not the right person
            to ask), &quot;Does it get easier?&quot; When she does tag along
            with John, for instance, to post-shoot drinks with a perky starlet,
            Kelly (Anna Faris), Charlotte can only feel superior (I mean,
            really: Kelly thinks Evelyn Waugh is a girl's name). But even if
            Charlotte can't know it, her snooty impatience is less about the
            obvious shallowness and compromise that John's life represents than
            about her own need to feel recognized, special, deserving.</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">It's
            a small-seeming theme, even commonplace: she feels alienated,
            foreign, in another country. Dumped into Tokyo, Charlotte and Bob
            meet at the hotel bar, confess their sleeplessness, and smoke
            cigarettes. Soon they're sharing sarcastic glances in the hotel
            piano bar, exploring the city together, going to clubs, strip bars,
            and video arcades, eventually spending an evening into the wee hours
            at an apartment belong to Charlotte's friend Charlie (named for a
            friend of Coppola's and played by Fumihiro Hayashi). Bob serenades
            her with a karaoke version of </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Roxy
            Music's &quot;More Than This.&quot; S</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">he's
            touched, and who wouldn't be? <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Their
            connection is necessarily fleeting, and the movie doesn't pretend
            otherwise. It's not salvation or even resolution that's at issue
            here, but rather, investigation, or maybe contemplation. <i>Lost in
            Translation</i> is clever and refined; it turns perspective inside
            out. It's not a structural inversion, as in <i>Virgin Suicides</i>,
            which had the boys imagining the girls, hopelessly missing all so
            they might hang onto their imagined vision at all costs, longing for
            the rest of their lives. Bob and Charlotte also remain poised rather
            than resolved, but their understanding of desire is more
            sophisticated, or more jaded, than the collective neighborhood boys.
            Bob and Charlotte live with unarticulated loss (no explanatory or
            nostalgic narration here), and the movie doesn't fix that for them. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Bob
            and Charlotte also see one another, unclearly, which complicates
            what you see. Director of photography Lance Acord (who has worked on
            movies with Spike Jonze, Coppola's husband) here works with film
            (not video), maintaining a muted aesthetic, so the film's evocation
            of loss is never acute, but composed, quiet, polished. It's
            certainly true that the characters' longing is skewed; they may live
            with loss, but they live beautifully, in fine hotels with access to
            swimming pools, cabs, and room service. (That said, when Charlotte
            takes a day trip to Kyoto, outdoors, observing without speaking or
            venturing to connect, the scenes are faster, more colorful, less
            sad.) <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">In
            the recent star-making (or more precisely, star-announcing) <i>New
            York Times Magazine</i> cover article, Coppola admits that she's
            dressed Johansson based on her own tastes: &quot;I know,&quot; she
            tells interviewer Lynne Hirschberg, &quot;How narcissistic&quot; (31
            August 2003). Such performative self-awareness is business as usual
            for Coppola, child of two famous filmmakers and sister to another,
            Roman (whose 2000 film, <i>CQ</i> also considered the difficulties
            of expectation and desire, the timidity that comes with class
            consciousness). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Unsurprisingly,
            guesses at Coppola's family dynamics have shaped some reactions to
            this film as well -- Charlotte's distant marriage, the protagonists'
            father-daughter-ish ages, the easy sniping at &quot;Hollywood&quot;
            when Kelly shows, up all appear to be recognizable touchstones. But
            such easy allusions can also miss what's most interesting <i>Lost in
            Translation</i>, which is its evasiveness. Yes, it's about
            alienation (the title alone tells you this), and yes, it's about
            rich people feeling alienated (the Park Hyatt tells you that). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">But
            it's about seeing and not seeing at the same time, a series of
            incredibly precise, meticulous images of faces and hands and
            doorframes, images that brush up against one another so you can
            tease out stories, project your own desires. And that's why that
            mysterious first shot of the fantastic pink panties is at once so
            delicate, so disconcerting and so apparently straightforward. It's
            about Americanness, whiteness, and insularity, and it's about
            wanting something else.</span></font></p>
