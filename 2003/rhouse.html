            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 21 March 2003</i></font><p class="MsoNormal">
			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Bringing Down the House</i> 
			seems to be popular with audiences right now for the moment when 
			Steve Martin puts a stocking cap on his head and turns himself into 
			a homeboy who can be as down with it as the rest of them. Limbering 
			his way into a hip-hop club, he converses in super-coded lingo with 
			the same goofy delicacy that he used with the lyrics to his 
			recording of &quot;King Tut&quot;, and he can bust a move, too, on the dance 
			floor and send it up at the same time. There's actually not very 
			much of this in the movie, though, and it comes, like dessert, near 
			the very end, but the audience seems expectant and patient to wait.</font></b></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Martin plays a 
			tax attorney and divorced father who's been corresponding with 
			someone on the Internet, and he eventually finds out that his white, 
			blond dream girl is an African-American ex-con, played by Queen 
			Latifah, in a series of outfits that seem to consistently emphasize 
			her highly buxom, Rubenesque shape. During what ensues, she helps 
			him to loosen up and not be so uptight, in exchange for which he's 
			supposed to prove that she was wrongfully convicted and exonerate 
			her. It's this last part that keeps turning the movie into the kind 
			of formulaic thing that you could see at home on television for 
			free, and there's even a point where, for several minutes, the 
			comedy that we've been watching turns into a crime drama (one of the 
			characters gets shot!), then flips back again (oops! no cause for 
			alarm).</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I can understand 
			why some people have said that the movie, disappointingly, doesn't 
			take advantage of what it has, here, with Martin and Latifah -- 
			there are many instances where, in their scenes together, an antic, 
			loosey-goosey energy keeps emerging in their interplay. It never 
			really gets out, though -- for one thing, Martin's never been as 
			funny as he can be when he has to play scenes where he's an uptight 
			W.A.S.P. Some of the humor in the film is also dubious, as well: Oh, 
			look, there's a black woman in the white-run law office! There's a 
			black woman at the country club! My, oh, my! This is the type of 
			thing I'd expect to see in a Joan Davis sitcom from the 'Fifties, 
			but, fortunately, Queen Latifah never looks foolish and never loses 
			her dignity, even in a scene where she has to serve dinner to a rich 
			matron played by Joan Plowright, whose character suddenly bursts 
			into singing a &quot;Negro spiritual&quot; heard during her childhood. (And, 
			somehow, Plowright manages to still make it funny.)</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But the business 
			of Eugene Levy's character panting after Latifah's and acting like 
			she's the red-hot mama he's been waiting for all his life never 
			struck me as being as amusing as the filmmakers wanted it to be. (I 
			will lightly pass over Betty White's scenes as a seemingly dotty 
			woman who says precociously ugly things about people of color, and 
			people who are non-heterosexuals, under her breath. Please.) And I 
			found myself surprisingly disconcerted during one scene where 
			Latifah has to b-slap a snooty white woman, and it turns into a 
			bone-crunching, body-thwacking brawl that goes on and on, and on 
			some more. And it's supposed to be funny. Physical humor of the most
			<b><i>outré</i></b> type has been used in movies for a hundred 
			years, now, but a peculiar sort of viciousness briefly emerges in 
			this scene that makes the facade of comedy fall away and causes you 
			to wonder if something else altogether is being worked-out, from 
			under the surface, here. The movie no longer looks like some frothy 
			little thing that shows that race and culture can cross-blend and 
			happily coexist. The line between daring humor and embarrassing 
			ugliness is crossed one too many times for comfort, and it 
			diminishes the film.</font></td>
