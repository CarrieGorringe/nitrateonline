            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>,
            25 April 2003</i></font><p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the new thriller <i>Identity</i>, 
			several people find themselves stranded at a remote motel, off the 
			main highway, one dark and storm night. The roads in either 
			direction are washed out. There's no cable T.V. The diner's closed. 
			It's difficult to even get a signal for one's cell phone. The bed 
			linen at least appears to be clean, but, before long, the stranded 
			travelers start getting bumped off, one by one, by a mysterious 
			killer.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And that's not the only strange 
			thing going on. Nobody, it seems, is who they appear to be. And the 
			story of the people at the motel is cross-cut, in the picture, with 
			some business involving a stay of execution for a confessed killer 
			(played by Pruitt Taylor Vince) who has a multiple-personality 
			disorder. What does he have to do with the murders that begin 
			occurring at the motel? Is the story that we're watching, there, a 
			flashback, or even a flash-forward? Is there some psychic or 
			supernatural element going on, especially once the now-potential 
			victims at the motel find out that they all share some unexpected 
			similarities?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Truth be told, <i>Identity</i>, 
			which James Mangold directed from an original screenplay by Michael 
			Cooney, isn't as clever as it would like to be, or, for that matter, 
			needs to be. For one thing, the movie doesn't give the actors who 
			have been lured into playing sitting ducks in the picture much room 
			to build characters whom we can become involved with, although some 
			of them give it a good try -- John Cusack, who plays a limo driver 
			who's also a former cop (he has police skills, plus, as it turns 
			out, medic skills, which certainly come in helpful); John C. 
			McGinley as a nervous, fussy, rattled man with a critically-injured 
			wife; and Rebecca DeMornay, long off the screen, as a demanding 
			movie star who gets very put-out because someone tried to book her 
			accommodations at a Ramada Inn. (Hers is the only character whom, 
			after the movie's over, you wish had stayed around for a little 
			while longer.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The picture starts out showing how 
			a series of coincidences ends up turning into a skein of things 
			which pulls all the different characters towards the motel, same 
			place at the same time. But before, and even after, it springs its 
			big surprise revelation, what the movie ends up depending on the 
			most is, for Pete's sake, the boring old <b><i>modus operandi</i></b> 
			of the slasher movie genre, in which people do incredibly dumb 
			things which end up getting them killed. And the surprise revelation 
			also has a boomerang effect of, to put it as delicately as possible, 
			calling into question everything that we had been watching for the 
			first two-thirds of the picture, in such a way as to negate any 
			feeling we may have been having towards anything that has been going 
			on. Mangold's direction keeps things going at a good clip, at least, 
			and he and the cinematographer Phedon Papamichael try to come up 
			with about as many good ways to show people lurking around in the 
			pouring rain during pitch-dark surroundings as they can. But the 
			picture needs something more -- the visual style or mischievous 
			degrees of energy that Brian De Palma might've brought to both 
			staging and telling the story on film, for instance, or the rich, 
			enveloping atmosphere of possible ominousness that Hideo Nakata 
			brought to his two &quot;Ring&quot; films --to make it somewhat more worth our 
			while. The picture doesn't leave you feeling bummed out at the end, 
			but you are left sitting in your seat with a &quot;so what?&quot; feeling as 
			the end credits start to unfurl. Approach this as you may.</font></td>
