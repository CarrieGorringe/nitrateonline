			<span style="color: black; font-weight: 700">As this ninety-minute 
			English-dialogue, German-financed documentary continues to expand 
			its U.S. engagements (where it premiered in early January), 
			audiences are enjoying a naturally enchanting visit with a most 
			unusual artist. Thomas Riedelsheimer's award-winning film is a 
			spellbinding study of Andy Goldsworthy, a Scottish land-sculptor who 
			creates location-specific work using only the organic vegetation and 
			minerals found in his &quot;studio.&quot; The film arrives courtesy of 
			American distributor Roxie Releasing, a San Francisco-based company 
			handling contemporary indie product (Henry Brommell's <i>Panic</i> 
			my favorite amongst these) and some unusual classic titles 
			(including Samuel Fuller's <i>Shock Corridor</i>, <i>The Naked Kiss</i>, 
			and his obscure <i>Dead Pigeon on Beethoven Street</i>).</span></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color:black">This 
			temporary study of mostly temporal set pieces easily bonds with the 
			captive-time element of the audio-visual medium. Without 
			Riedelsheimer's constantly panning camera showing us Goldsworthy 
			unique artistic course of action/reaction, the only remnant of the 
			Goldsworthy's creative days would be relegated to their 
			two-dimensional reproductions through 35mm slides and still 
			photographs. Although Goldsworthy's art has been chronicled in 
			numerous collections, watching it evolve via a cinematic/digital 
			process adds a fascinating component. The numerous coffee-table 
			books may capture the shape, the scope, and the moment, but since 
			this particular artist sculpts on a chronologically demanding 
			canvas, the camera acts as the missing recording mechanism that, 
			save us being there at the time of creation, allows us at least the 
			ability to watch each birth as a near-metaphysical event. &quot;Art, for 
			me, is a form of nourishment,&quot; comments the Scotsman early in the 
			film; we, the viewers, are allowed the share his meal.</span></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color:black">Coupling 
			the moving images with an intoxicating score by Fred Firth, this 
			film is often mesmerizing. The changing process of sculpting (versus 
			the static viewing of sculpture) entrances as the camera 
			deliberately tracks the artist visually and figuratively. At first 
			Goldsworthy shares his innermost thoughts on conception, then 
			arranges the initial stages of preparation (think of a hobbyist 
			arranging all the parts of a model airplane before assembling them), 
			followed by the urgent states of birth and growth, through to the 
			ensuing, but not necessarily final, static condition. Even at this 
			culminating moment, the structure is capable of additional change in 
			the hands of nature, such as a large bleached driftwood beehive 
			caught up in the motion of a river's flow, or a conical piling of 
			rocks submerging in a rising tide. Hence the film's perfect 
			ebb-and-flow title. Sometimes there is stability in the art, often 
			not. Yet in those moments of failure (rocks shift, twigs break) 
			caused by &quot;too many unknowns,&quot; we witness the enlightenment of the 
			artistic vision.</span></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color:black">This is a 
			fascinating study, vibrant beyond the shade of the brilliant 
			coloring that might occur in a given imaginative occurrence. 
			Pigments could be the greens of leaves, the reds of crushed rock, 
			the whiteness of snow. Wood, stone, mud, dirt, roots, flowers, 
			foliage, moss, ice, water, even sheep's wool, are some of the 
			organic materials that comprise Goldsworthy's multi-dimensional 
			canvas. His bare, grizzled hands (and sometimes his teeth) are his 
			brushes; his bruised fingernails scream for your (or a doctor's) 
			attention. His easel could be a grassy field, a rock-strewn meadow, 
			a gravelly coastline, or other serene setting.</span></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color:black">His 
			trademark squiggles and snakes, reminiscent of the meandering of a 
			river, are just a few of the artistic arcs present. Riedelsheimer's 
			contribution is an astute camera placement, brilliantly 
			complimenting the art and artist, whether capturing a pink sunset 
			reflected in the water or an aerial view showing us the cycle of 
			turning. On a more necessary level, Goldsworthy asks the filmmaker 
			to put his camera aside and help him with a rock formation. Someone 
			else catches this moment for us.</span></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color:black">When not 
			at his home base with his wife and four blonde-haired moppets in 
			Penpoint, Scotland, the small pastoral village where he has resided 
			the last dozen years, Goldsworthy's at play in the fields and 
			streams of the lord. One huge installation during the last third of 
			the film is at Storm King Sculpture Park in Mountainville, New York, 
			where we witness the genius of an artist accustomed to observing the 
			way time has changed landscapes, the way nature balances each 
			changing moment, and how he can create a startling, fluid river of 
			stone that reflects a profound vision.</span></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color:black">There's 
			something magical in <i>Rivers and Tides</i>. Let the artist play 
			on.</span></font></td>
