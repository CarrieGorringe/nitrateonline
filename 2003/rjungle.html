            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by
			<a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 
			14 February 2003</i></font><p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">An amazing experience occurred 
			when, on a whim, I went with some family members to see a re-release 
			of <i>The Jungle Book</i> sometime during the second half of the 
			1980s. I had seen the picture when it first came out in theaters -- 
			my family ALWAYS took us to see the new Disney picture -- and I'd 
			listened to songs from the film on L.P.'s that were handed out at 
			Gulf gas stations. These L.P.'s had been stored away for years, and 
			I hadn't seen the film in years, but, seeing it again many years 
			later, I was surprised to find myself remembering the lyrics of the 
			songs, word for word, as the characters began performing them 
			on-screen -- sometimes remembering the lyrics BEFORE they were even 
			performed.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is why some people took to 
			ranting and raving over how all-pervasive Disney and his fodder had 
			become in modern pop culture -- because the Disney characters and 
			films really <i>had</i> become all-pervasive in modern pop culture. 
			Nobody knew how to sell his product better than Uncle Walt, whether 
			it was introducing his Sunday-night television show around which 
			everyone gathered (some of which was good, some of which was <i>The 
			Horse Masters</i>), or handing out those L.P.'s to customers at Gulf 
			stations -- &quot;Mommy! Daddy! I gotta have that record, oh, puh-leeze!&quot; 
			To which Mommy and Daddy would acquiesce, even if it meant ending up 
			hearing it on the kid's record-player for days or weeks or months on 
			end---and the last track of which would be Tommy Steele singing &quot;Fortuosity&quot; 
			from <i>The Happiest Millionaire</i>, the new Disney picture that 
			JUST HAPPENED to be about ready to come out in theaters. The design 
			was perfect.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Happiest Millionaire</i> was the 
			last live-action picture which Walt Disney supervised before his 
			death in 1966, and <i>The Jungle Book</i> was the last animated 
			feature he oversaw, and the reason you're reading all this is 
			because there really isn't very much to say about <i>The Jungle Book 
			2</i>, the sequel to the animated film which has arrived in theaters 
			over twenty-five years after the first film's release. When Mowgli 
			the man-cub, at the end of the 1967 film, made his decision to leave 
			his friends, Bagheera the panther and Baloo the bear, and go live 
			with his own kind in the village, it seemed like a pretty good bet 
			that he would stay there for good. It also seemed like a sensible, 
			natural progression for a boy who was just about to enter into 
			adolescence and, presumably, have man-cubs of his own some day. The 
			new film picks up right where the last one left off, and it spends 
			half of its running time trying to figure out how to get Mowgli back 
			together with his animal friends. Despite the presence of Shanti, 
			the young girl who was glimpsed just long enough at the end of the 
			last film to catch Mowgli's eye, and who has now metamorphosed into 
			a full-fledged character of her own, Mowgli still yearns to go back 
			into the darkest wilds, and, eventually, the film pretty much picks 
			him up by his britches and repels him right back in there, like Brer 
			Rabbit flying into the briar patch, so that he can quickly reunite 
			with Baloo and sing the first of many reprisals of &quot;The Bare 
			Necessities&quot; (the song which, unbelievably and regardless of the 
			levels of its own merits, lost out on the Oscar to &quot;Talk to the 
			Animals&quot; from <i>Doctor Dolittle</i>). This turns out to be just 
			fine, since Baloo, rather than&nbsp; being engaged in other bear-like 
			activities, has been spending all his time mooning around over 
			Mowgli. And Shanti, thinking that Baloo has captured Mowgli and is 
			carrying him away, goes charging, warrior woman-style, after him. 
			She's accompanied by Ranjan, one of those overactively mischievous 
			tykes who require a muzzle and leash to be let-out in public.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still, most of the picture is made 
			up of bits and pieces that reprise characters and business from the 
			last film. Or from other Disney films, like the musical number that 
			looks like it's copied from &quot;Be Our Guest&quot; in <i>Beauty and the 
			Beast</i>. The actors who provide the voices for the animal 
			characters in the new film have been made to sound as closely as 
			possible to the actors (Sebastian Cabot, George Sanders, Sterling 
			Holloway, and J. Pat O'Malley) who voiced their counterparts in the 
			1967 film. That also goes for John Goodman, who does Baloo in the 
			same raspy way that Phil Harris did. (Unfortunately, Goodman cannot 
			sing like Phil Harris did, which makes a difference.) The only 
			character who does not put in a reappearance is the orangutan King 
			Louis, who was voiced and sung by the late, great jazzman Louis 
			Prima -- although, not missing a trick, Prima's recording of &quot;I 
			Wanna Be Like You&quot; has been given a hip-hop remix and is played over 
			the closing credits for the new film.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While the village where Mowgli and 
			Shanti live has been often beautifully rendered in shades of blue 
			and jasmine, not even the way that Shere Khan the tiger has been 
			drawn is as dramatic or scary as in the last film. (And Disney knew 
			that you needed a little bit of menace in order to bring some spice 
			to the proceedings.) And what a difference twenty-five years makes. 
			Asked why he left the village during one of his conversations with 
			Baloo, Mowgli simply replies, &quot;Rules, rules, rules!&quot; This is in 
			spite of the fact that Mowgli hasn't been shown doing a lick of work 
			or anything else in the film up until then. (And it's also an 
			example of the jarringly anachronistic dialogue that the characters 
			have been given to utter in the new picture.) And the film not only 
			ends with the filmmakers keeping their options open, but also with 
			the characters wanting to have things any way they want to, just as 
			long as they have fun, fun, fun. In trying to have it any which way, 
			the film ends up with nothing -- it's a soft, slack, lazy ending for 
			a film whose makers seem to think it's being made for a soft, slack, 
			lazy audience. Not, I think, something that Uncle Walt would have 
			done.</font></td>
