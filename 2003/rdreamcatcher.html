			</blockquote>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">One thing you 
			can say about <i>Dreamcatcher</i>: you can't really say one thing 
			about it. The film is a wild clutter of previous movie fragments (<i>Men 
			In Black</i>, <i>Alien</i>, <i>John Carpenter's The Thing</i>) and 
			generic hooks (including &quot;Based on a Stephen King novel,&quot; which 
			means it repeats his usual tropes, from childhood flashbacks to 
			mysterious characters named Mr. Something, all seemingly worse here, 
			in the first book he wrote after his near-death rundown by a car). 
			As such, it runs a zany gamut of images and scares and jokes, 
			featuring an ensemble cast of gooey monsters and panicky men, a 
			remote out-in-the-snowy-woods setting (underlined by a pat reference 
			to Frost's &quot;Stopping by Woods on a Snowy Evening&quot;), and a dizzying 
			assortment of weapons. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Too bad all 
			these rampaging concepts don't come to a point, except, maybe, in 
			the bathroom scene that so delights director Lawrence Kasdan. The 
			setup comprises standard horror movie shenanigans: four childhood 
			friends -- super-intuitive college professor Jonesy (Damian Lewis), 
			suicidal shrink Henry (Thomas Jane), car salesman Pete (Timothy 
			Olyphant) and big dope Beaver (Jason Lee) -- retreat from their 
			workaday lives at a cabin in Maine, where they remember the good old 
			days of twenty years ago. Yes indeed, that was when each was granted 
			his own special telepathic gift, by pale and shivery little Duddits 
			(Donnie Wahlberg), the cute, retarded, mind-reading kid they save 
			from local bullies. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Having fondly 
			remembered this (via a couple of those flashbacks where each of the 
			boys sports a sign of his later self: red hair, noble 'tude, dorky 
			comportment), the guys endeavor to enjoy their holiday. In 
			furtherance of the plot, this involves splitting up: Henry and Pete 
			are driving back from the market when they flip their car while 
			trying to avoid hitting a frozen lady in the road; meanwhile, Jonesy 
			and Beav tend to the frozen lady's erstwhile companion, discovered 
			stumbling toward the guys' cabin, his face blotchy red, his bloated 
			body belching, farting, and undulating. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">It turns out 
			both the stragglers have been infected by wormy parasites: much like 
			the aliens in <i>Alien</i>, these incubate for a while in the human 
			body, then emerge in bloody, slimy awful splat, from the anus. 
			Hence, the aliens' designations, by the crack military unit assigned 
			to destroy them, as &quot;Ripleys&quot; or &quot;sh*t weasels.&quot; </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">All this leads 
			to the bathroom scene. Jonesy and Beav find their guest sitting on 
			the toilet, insisting he just needs to &quot;make some room,&quot; before the 
			weasel evacuates and scuttles across the floor, pausing to reveal 
			its multiple vagina dentate teeth and make the usual alien trilling 
			sounds. It proceeds to chomp up one of the buddies, leaving behind a 
			rowdy red mess to be discovered by the second, who is appropriately 
			panicked -- especially when he's confronted by a towering alien with 
			the usual big-almond-eyed alien head, with the added accessory of 
			the sh*t weasel, now crawling around up the alien's alarmingly long 
			limbs and across its stooped shoulders like a slithering pet boa.</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">To be fair, the 
			scene <i>is</i> remarkable in its way. The entire cabin becomes a 
			sign of the incursion, turning against its inhabitants, every 
			surface covered by a dark, creeping red crud. Once straggler guy has 
			relieved himself and summarily died, Beav, quick-thinking, flushes, 
			slams down the lid, and plants himself on it, as the weasel makes 
			repeated efforts to force its way back up and out. </font></span>
			</p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">And honestly, 
			making the toilet -- that most mundane, private, and fearsome of 
			sites -- the location of body-invasion terror, might seem a clever 
			idea, especially if you're twelve. The scene is cut together to 
			underline its cleverness, with tension-building cross-cutting to 
			Jonesy searching desperately for duct tape out in the shed 
			(obviously, no one knew how resonant this image would be, now), 
			while Beav frets and errs (comically and fatally), on the throne 
			inside. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">However you 
			want to parse this pile-on of metaphors, the result is grim and, 
			likely, smelly. By the time Henry returns to the scene to discover 
			one of the weasels has laid a neat little pile of eggs on the bed, 
			it's clear what must be done: he's got to nuke the planet. Er, torch 
			the cabin. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Henry's efforts 
			to find his missing buddy Jonesy becomes the film's primary 
			trajectory. This is complicated by a couple of factors, each bizarre 
			in its own way. One, Jonesy's mind is figured literally, a place 
			called the Memory Warehouse. The film repeatedly cuts to shots of 
			Jonesy moving and organizing wheelbarrows full of file folders in a 
			series of rooms on floors connected by a and elaborate circular ramp 
			system. Whenever Jonesy argues with the alien who takes over his 
			body, named, for no discernable reason, Mr. Grey, he's pictured 
			looking out the window (of his mind?), observing his physical self 
			doing the sinister, strangely English-accented Mr. Grey's bidding. 
			And whenever he has an idea that he somehow hides from Mr. Grey, 
			he's scurrying about in his Warehouse, gathering files and breathing 
			hard. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">And two, Henry, 
			who is at least as cerebral as Jonesy, must deal with his own 
			immediate physical threat, the aforementioned military unit, headed 
			by Colonel Curtis (Morgan Freeman). Ominously -- and obviously -- 
			named Kurtz in King's novel, the Colonel has been waging a personal 
			war against the aliens for some twenty-five years, which has left 
			him not only wise and weary, but also quite loony-tunes. He spits 
			some of the most eccentric dialogue this side of John Wayne, calling 
			all his boys &quot;Bucko,&quot; insisting they swear by &quot;Scouts' honor,&quot; wary 
			of the &quot;blizzard of bullsh*t&quot; that he presumes is on its way to 
			smack him down. When he brings in his second, Underhill (perpetually 
			inventive and apparently certifiable Tom Sizemore), Curtis really 
			starts acting out, shooting at his own men and locking up all 
			civilians who may or may not have come into contact with the aliens.
			</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Henry, one of 
			those citizens so roughly rounded up, uses his mind-reading 
			abilities to impress Underhill (plainly seeking a way to get back at 
			his father figure), and before you know it, the two handsome heroic 
			types are bouncing along in a military vehicle, rushing to their 
			fated, final encounter. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">It is here that 
			the film runs its most audacious gambit, a disjointed, goofball 
			moment that belongs in another movie entirely. It begins when Henry 
			asks to see Underhill's fancy pearl-handled weapon, a gift from his 
			father-figure, unnecessarily underscoring the film's homoerotic 
			predilection (recall that the only women appear for a moment each, 
			and are: a] frozen, and b] someone's mom). Henry mutters something 
			about his earnest desire to hear from Duddits, and lo, the phone 
			rings. What phone? The gun, transformed into a phone, though whether 
			in his mind, Duddits' mind, or, heck, Jonesy's Warehouse, is 
			unclear. The two have a conversation, and then, the magic moment 
			ends.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">At this point, 
			lack of clarity seems apposite. As adapted by Kasdan and William 
			Goldman (who also adapted King's <i>Misery</i> and <i>Hearts in 
			Atlantis</i>), <i>Dreamcatcher</i> just can't seem to get out of its 
			own way. The inevitable series of action-ated showdowns grabs 
			imagery and ideas from several well-known sources, resulting in a 
			mishmash of a conflagration that can't possibly cohere and has its 
			human protagonists standing around with their mouths open, 
			responding to a confrontation of green-screened creatures that makes 
			the battle between Godzilla and Mothra look sophisticated. </font>
