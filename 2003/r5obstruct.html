            were insufficiently stimulating for Lars von Trier, he indulges
            himself in some more game-playing with his friend, fellow director Jørgen
            Leth, in a little scenario called <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Five Obstructions</i>. Leth is to make five
            &quot;obstructions&quot;, or short films, based upon an obscure 1967
            film, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Perfect Human</i>.
            Each of Leth’s films will be created according to a set of rules
            laid down by von Trier. Constant among the rules, however, are the
            requirements that Leth use no sets, (a good <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Dogme</i></b> 95 precondition) and that no single edit can be longer
            than twelve frames. Between 2001 and 2003, von Trier sends Leth
            globe-hopping from Cuba to Austin, Texas, to Bombay’s red-light
            district, among other places, to create his mini-masterpieces.<o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">After
            his first successful effort, Leth boasts, &quot;Twelve frames are a
            paper tiger!&quot; Obviously disconcerted despite his outward
            nonchalance, von Trier replies, &quot;Next time we’ll have to add
            a few more [rules].&quot; And Leth’s personal obstructions grow.
            His ethics and talents are tested to the limit (in one of the films,
            he is obligated to dine upon a sumptuous buffet in front of poor
            people), but he comes through mostly unscathed; he is able to win
            over von Trier even when working in von Trier’s least favorite
            medium: animation. Von Trier is amazed by the effortlessness of
            Leth’s work -- &quot;Not a mark has been left on you by the films
            you’ve made&quot; -- so von Trier decides to direct the final
            episode himself, giving Leth full credit for the production, but
            allowing him only the role of narrator. Leth’s narration, written
            by von Trier, talks about a filmmaker who &quot;tries to fool the
            world because he doesn’t want to be a part of it…emotions are
            too dangerous.&quot; Then comes the revelation: von Trier exposes
            himself as &quot;dishonest&quot;, because he only sees what he wants
            to see. It is a case of the attacker, which von Trier has been
            throughout the film, exposing himself as the ultimate obstruction.<o:p>

            is a fascinating exercise in watching art emerge from not only
            technical constraints, but also from morality and friendship,
            especially the latter two elements. Although von Trier puts his
            friend through the wringer (promising, at one point, to
            &quot;ruin&quot; him), he also has few illusions about himself. But
            what do morality and friendship mean to von Trier? His films possess
            shades of morality running from jet black to grey in the best of
            circumstances, as one would expect of an individual whose viewpoint
            of the world is somewhat jaundiced. It’s also the
            self-righteousness of the ideologue (and von Trier, with his
            espousing of extreme naturalism in his adherence to the rules of <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Dogme
            95</i></b>, is an ideologue), who knows that he has a better answer
            than anyone else. But, in using disadvantaged individuals in the
            name of a so-called &quot;sophistic exercise&quot;, is von Trier
            (with Leth as his handmaiden in crime, so to speak), undercutting
            his own superior morality, or is a self-lampooning his real
            intention? And what about his relationship with Leth? At what point
            does testing someone’s limits go too far? These are the real
            questions raised by the film, and, difficult though they are to
            answer with absolute certainty, there is no doubt that they, and not
            necessarily the films themselves, constitute the real
            &quot;art&quot; on display. <o:p>
