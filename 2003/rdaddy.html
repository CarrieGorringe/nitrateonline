            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>, 9 May 2003</i></font><p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mention three-year-olds wielding 
			a large pair of scissors or motoring about the yard on a riding lawn 
			mower in the first sentence of a film review and everybody's going 
			to get the wrong impression about the new hit from Eddie Murphy. No,
			<i>Daddy Day Care</i> is not Toddlers of the Damned. It's Toddlers 
			of the Damned Funny.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Murphy, following last year's 
			disastrous outings (<i>I Spy</i>, <i>The Adventures of Pluto Nash</i>,
			<i>Showtime</i>), returns to the family-man/cartoon-situation 
			comedies (<i>Doctor Dolittle</i>, <i>The Nutty Professor</i>, and 
			their successful sequels) that reinvented the actor's career among a 
			whole new demographic: the younger, family-oriented, G-rated 
			variety. Teamed up with the full-sized Jeff Garlin (<i>Curb Your 
			Enthusiasm</i>), the zany Steve Zahn, and a passable yet barely 
			realistic script by freshman scribe Geoff Rodkey, the film succeeds 
			because the capable cast is handled well by director Steve Carr (who 
			had similar chores on <i>Dolittle 2</i>). Carr, apparently inspired 
			by Chuck Jones and his Road-Runner approach to cartoon filmmaking, 
			moves the action impressively from one preposterously funny sequence 
			to the next once the movie's simple premise is set up: two 
			out-of-work advertising executives open an unorthodox childcare 
			service, catering to a dozen or so kids, an occasional parent, some 
			hellishly overwritten competition, and a sympathetic government 
			inspector.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The story revolves around the 
			unemployed Charlie Hinton (Murphy) and his wife Kim (Regina King), 
			who slides into the breadwinner role courtesy of a dormant law 
			degree. She gets the Benz convertible, he gets daytime custody of 
			their four-year-old son, Ben (Khamani Griffin, who already knows how 
			to steal a scene or two). Commiserating with fellow layoff-victim 
			and father Phil (Garlin) about their strained financial obligations, 
			a casual comment pushes the idiotic idea that the men could make a 
			go as cut-rate guardians to several of the neighborhood kids.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meanwhile, the Hintons attend a 
			school orientation&nbsp; at the posh, hoity-toity Chapman Academy, where 
			they had hoped to enroll Ben before dad's work situation worsened.&nbsp; 
			There, they encounter a small tyke reciting his numbers. In German. 
			Anjelica Huston, borrowing broadly from her role as the grand high 
			witch in <i>The Witches</i> (1990), a delightful adaptation of the 
			Roald Dahl book, is reincarnated in <i>Daddy Day Care</i> as Gwyneth 
			Harridan, the authoritarian, conniving headmistress who strives for 
			perfect demeanor, marine corps diligence, and a subversive, dirty 
			fight with the new competition in town.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film hits best with its many 
			short, effective sequences and the ensuing slings, arrows, and punch 
			lines that find the Hinton's previously immaculate Victorian home, 
			and its adult occupants, under siege and disarray. The initial 
			introductions (the men's two boys and seven sporadically monstrous 
			loaners, including a Drew Barrymore, <i>E.T.</i>-vintage lookalike) 
			produce bedlam amid the unconventional, scarcely licensed, and 
			barely lawful supervision by the two dads and their unsteady day 
			care supervision skills. Separation anxiety, a broad list of 
			possible allergic reactions to various food dyes, sugar overloads, 
			misguided soccer kicks, and Phil's son Max's explosive bowel problem 
			provide the early set-ups that need to be dealt with or, at least, 
			provide an unsubtle comic reaction. The most priceless joke 
			incorporates Bernard Herrmann's violin shrieks from <i>Psycho</i>, 
			as Charlie surveys, off-screen, the extensive damage little Max has 
			wrought on his bathroom. In case you don't get the obvious bow to 
			The Three Stooges, that veteran comic trio pops up on a television 
			set and in the film's dialogue. (Why not, the film is being released 
			by Columbia, the aggressive, violent team's production home for 
			nearly twenty-five years.&nbsp;</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Then, there's Steve Zahn, one of 
			the most unusually goofball actors in any film. My two favorites to 
			date: <i>Nurse Betty</i> and <i>Happy, Texas</i>. His semi-dimwitted 
			role as Marvin, the third cog in the child-care wheel, starts with a 
			walk-on wearing vintage 1960s <i>Star Trek</i> regalia, segues to 
			conversing in Klingon with one of the youngsters, blossoms with a <i>
			Wrath of Khan</i> puppet show (assisted by Jonathan Katz, as the 
			kind-hearted, milquetoast daycare inspector), and mind-melds when he 
			calms the growing brood (now up to fourteen) because he 
			inadvertently absorbed one of the several child care books by Dr. 
			Spock, confusing the author with the character endeared to millions 
			of fans by Leonard Nimoy&nbsp;</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The weakest part of the film 
			revolves around broccoli and carrot suits, a silly advertising 
			campaign for vegetable-flavored cereal, and their nemesis (Kevin 
			Nealon) at the old firm. It's still good for a yuck or two.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like Moe, Larry, and Curly, their 
			popular, more vulgar ancestors, Eddie, Jeff, and Steve stooge it up 
			in fine PG-fashion in <i>Daddy Day Care</i>. Child care was never 
			this much fun.</font></td>
