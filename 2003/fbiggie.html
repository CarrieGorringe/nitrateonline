Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 2 May 2003</font></i></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700"><font size="2">Nick 
Broomfield asks questions for a living. A graduate of England's National Film 
School, the fifty-five-year-old filmmaker has made his name by pushing formal 
and political boundaries concerning documentaries, as well as occasional 
&quot;buttons,&quot; in his explorations of equally difficult and fascinating subjects, 
from Courtney Love to Aileen Wuornos to, in his 2002 film <i>Biggie &amp; Tupac</i>, 
Voletta Wallace and Suge Knight. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Broomfield first caught 
attention for <i>Who Cares</i> (1978), a documentary on urban redevelopment in 
Liverpool, eventually used by the British government in a reassessment of 
policy. Since then, he has been prolific, his films ranging in style from <b>
vérité </b>(the award-winning <i>Chicken Ranch</i>, a 1984 study of legal 
prostitution in Nevada) to satirical documentary (<i>Proud to Be British</i> in 
1979) to fiction (<i>Dark Obsession/Diamond Skulls</i>, made in 1989; released 
in the U.S. in 1991). </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">He has long worked with 
producer-director-cinematographer Joan Churchill, beginning with <i>Juvenile 
Liaisons</i> (1975), a study of police working with youthful offenders, which 
inspired a follow-up in 1990, <i>Juvenile Liaisons II</i>. Their 1990s 
documentaries have been increasingly deconstructive, in the sense that they pose 
more questions than answers, and don't even pretend to be objective. His films 
have become increasingly popular, as well, including <i>Aileen Wuornos: The 
Selling of a Serial Killer</i> (1992), <i>Heidi Fleiss: Hollywood Madam</i> 
(1995), <i>Kurt &amp; Courtney</i> (1998), and last year's <i>Biggie &amp; Tupac</i>. 
His newest film, co-directed with Churchill, <i>Aileen: The Life and Death of a 
Serial Killer</i>, will&nbsp; premiere in the States at the Tribeca Film Festival in 
May 2003. </font></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The occasion for our 
conversation is the April 2003 DVD release of <i>Biggie &amp; Tupac</i>, by Razor &amp; 
Tie. An investigation of the investigations into the murders of Biggie Smalls 
and Tupac Shakur, Broomfield's movie considers the intersections of the music 
industry, police corruption, gang affiliations, and organized crime. He's 
especially keen on bringing the cases into the media spotlight again, in hopes 
of encouraging serious efforts to solve them. We begin by discussing the end of 
the film, in which Broomfield and his film crew return to the home of Voletta 
Wallace, Biggie's mother.</font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Cynthia Fuchs:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
How did you decide to return to Voletta at film's end, rather than finishing 
with the rather spectacular Suge Knight interview? </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Nick Broomfield:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
I felt that Voletta was the heart and soul of the film, in the sense that I 
think she's what an audience will really remember and relate to. I think if the 
case is going to get solved, it will come from those emotions. Voletta and the 
Christopher Wallace Estate are bringing a lawsuit against the L.A.P.D., and I 
think that will have an effect in creating the momentum to solve the case. So, 
Voletta represents the future, in that way. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
You think the case will be solved? </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">NB:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
The case has been reopened, and when I spoke to Russell Poole last -- and I 
don't know if he's being unduly optimistic -- he said he thought it would be 
solved this year. The investigation is in motion again, witnesses are being 
re-interviewed, and there seems to be a renewed vigor to come to terms with what 
happened. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
It's not so often that films can affect the &quot;real life&quot; they reflect. </font>
</span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">NB:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
I think the film is part of a group of forces, including Randall Sullivan's book 
[<i>LABrynth</i>], and the lawsuit, all bringing attention to the case. And 
there has been embarrassment in the Los Angeles Police Department, for the new 
Police Chief [William Bratton] who has just arrived, and he wants to show he's 
not connected in the way that [Bernard] Parks was. I think Parks' own family, 
his daughter and granddaughter were involved in gang behavior. His daughter knew 
David Mack quite well, and was arrested in Las Vegas herself for cocaine 
possession, and the granddaughter was shot in a gang shootout, and killed. So I 
think Parks was sort of involved. A lot of people were saying he was trying to 
shield his daughter. This was another reason why David Mack had not been more 
vigorously investigated. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
I know that you started this film in part because of [producer] Michele 
D'Acosta's work on a Tupac piece and your own interest in the Rampart scandal. 
How did you come to structure all of these many stories into a manageable film?
</font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">NB:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
I used something very simple, which is that it went back to his friendship 
between Biggie and Tupac, that all these forces served to break up. It's all 
about how you tell the story, and it can be told many different ways. I wanted 
to find a way to tell it in a personal way, which I thought would be more 
engaging than making it a political analysis, like a head-on analysis of the 
Rampart scandal. I suppose all of these stories are about the same thing: the 
position of black Americans has not moved enormously from the Civil Rights days. 
Although there are no signs saying &quot;Whites Only,&quot; the less overt racism has the 
same effect when it comes to justice, educational possibilities, and the rest of 
it. That's ultimately what the story is about, any way you cut it. I thought 
that if you came out and said that too blatantly, you'd alienate some of the 
audience.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
You mentioned your interest in making the film &quot;personal.&quot; Certainly the Biggie 
and Tupac and Voletta stories are very personal, but your presence in your films 
make all them &quot;personal&quot; in specific ways. </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">NB:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
I think that's very important. I just finished another film about Aileen 
Wuornos, after her execution. In this new film, I'm subpoenaed as a witness. I 
think that when I just filmed her, and there's a lot of her in the film, it's 
hard to have empathy that's required. And I think that if the filmmaker is 
involved and affected, and forms personal relations, it becomes a way for the 
audience to do the same thing. This makes the subjects accessible. </font>
</span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
And it also makes documentaries more marketable, in a way, as they struggle just 
to be seen. </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">NB:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
It's very hard. I remember when I was doing the film for HBO, about fetishes in 
New York [<i>Fetishes: Mistresses and Domination at Pandora's Box</i>, a 1996 
profile of an S&amp;M sex club], the more personal I made it, the more involving and 
more tolerable it became for the audience, maybe neutralized it in a way. I 
think it's a more compelling way to tell a complicated story that hasn't got an 
inherent structure. I came out of doing observational films, <b><i>cinéma vérité</i></b>, 
and in a way, <i>Biggie &amp; Tupac</i> is like a detective story, and a lot of its 
elements are disparate. Without a thought track connecting them, I don't think 
the audience would follow it. The easiest thing is to use what's there, which is 
one's own journey, one's own perception. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
Your films tend to take a particular form, the &quot;quest,&quot; with driving shots, the 
boom mic in the shot, the doorways entered. And they also undermine the idea 
that there's a Truth with a big T. </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">NB:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
I think it's all about raising questions, about making the audience think about 
their own position, their own ideas. I went to a film school where the emphasis 
was on ethnographic films. We were taught to work in crews of two, and I carried 
on with that. I do sound and Joan [Churchill], my original partner from film 
school, does the camera. I do have researchers one doesn't see, and producers, 
but it's essentially made with that teeny team. And that allows us flexibility. 
I think it's interesting to see where someone lives, to see what the drive to 
their house looks like, to see the interior, the meeting of people. An audience 
learns more in those few little shots than they do in almost any more formal 
setting. When I go into people's houses, I'm fascinated to see what they have on 
the walls, what they wear, how they invite you in. It's how we still usually 
meet people, the internet notwithstanding. It uses people's everyday vocabulary 
to tell a story. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
And livelier than the standard talking head. </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">NB:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
Yes, the normal way of doing it is to go into someone's house, rearrange their 
drawing rooms, put lights up everywhere, and sit down and start asking 
questions. And you get this completely constipated interview, not surprisingly. 
I never use lights, I never rearrange anything. And I like to film from the 
moment I meet someone. I think that keeps a tension and fluidity going. It's 
when things stop, and people start fiddling around with their lenses that it's 
no longer a social meeting. I want the interviews to be like conversations.
</font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
Very different from the interview with you on the <i>Biggie</i> DVD, where 
you're posed in front of a poster for the film. </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">NB:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
[laughs] How do you think that works on the DVD? </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
I think the contrast is instructive, actually. </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">NB:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
I haven't ever watched my interview, so I was wondering. And for the commentary 
track, I thought I'd just speak as I was watching the film, rather than having 
all these notes. I thought I'd reveal a lot more if I did it in an immediate and 
spontaneous way. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
I appreciated when you paused in your commentary, to point out what you thought 
were key moments, as when Mopreme speaks to you on the street. </font></span>
</p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">NB:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
I must say, I really like DVD as a form. I think it is very useful and you can 
address issues in a specific way, which I think is very satisfying. And I think 
that viewers are interested in what people are thinking and how long it takes, 
and how something gets made. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
How did you think about your audience for this film? </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">NB:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
I wanted to make it accessible to as wide an audience as possible, but also so 
it would work on the level of detail for the fans, though it's really not a 
&quot;music film.&quot; On the other hand, I thought it was important that the white, 
middle class, liberal community would realize that the world of hiphop was 
different than what they might have imagined. That's one of the reasons I put 
Voletta in it, in that way. The media portray [Biggie and Tupac] as two black 
gangstas who happen to be rap artists and were killed, so it's kind of &quot;So 
what?&quot; There is such a separation in American communities that people don't 
imagine that [Biggie] could come from a respectable, loving home, with an 
amazing mother. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
Voletta makes herself fairly visible, even outside your film. But your 
conversation with Tupac's father was unusual. How did you find him? </font>
</span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">NB:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
With great difficulty. It was literally, in the middle of nowhere, and every 
hour, he'd change his mind. I think he's a shaky individual really. And he went 
through a period of addiction, and now he's emotionally inconsistent. We were 
lucky and it was largely due to Michele's persistence that we got to see him at 
all. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
There's such a range of characters across your films, but you remain constant as 
a persona. </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">NB:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
Well, I think that's sort of a life decision thing, which is that I'm always 
fairly consistent as to who I am. I don't feel like I'm doing an MTV spot where 
I have to suck up to people and try and pretend I'm other than who I am. 
Sometimes that works. Though, for someone like Mopreme, initially, at least, I 
represented a spoiled, white, middle class filmmaker who he didn't like. And if 
it hadn't been for Michele, he wouldn't have talked to me at all. But also, 
because of that, he was as revealing as he was. One of the most sensitive things 
about people is that they work out whether someone is sincere or if they're 
performing. And if, as a filmmaker, you can remain consistent, after a while, I 
think that counts for a lot. Especially if you follow through and do what you 
say you're going to do. People come to trust you after a while. After the first 
interview, I'll phone people up and get their opinions on things, tell them 
what's happening. I think that creates a feeling of openness, more of an 
exchange. And then it gets to the point where people call <i>you</i> up and say, 
&quot;What do you know about this?&quot; or, &quot;Have you seen such and such a person?&quot; And 
then you can give out information too, and acquire a more equal relationship.
</font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
Like with Russell Poole? </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">NB:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
Yes, we had more information than he did at one point. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
Have you kept up with him since the film? </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">NB:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
Yes, and irony of ironies, Sly Stallone has bought the rights to his story. I 
hate to think what he'll do with it. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
Well, at least Russell has some food on the table. </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">NB:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
Yes. After the end of the filming, he didn't have a job. He was picking up 
bodies for the county. And I remember, we didn't have much money, and he never 
asked us for any, but we sent him a check, and he was so effusive in thanking 
us. I thought it was wonderful that at last, he got a job with the sheriff's 
department. I wouldn't begrudge him making some money from Hollywood. When we 
showed the film at Sundance, Russell hadn't seen the film yet, as it had 
literally come out of the lab and arrived at Sundance that morning. So we looked 
at it in this enormous theater, about 1400 people. And at the end of it, I went 
up and asked Russell to come up, really not knowing what he thought of it. 
Fortunately, he got up and gave me a great big hug. In hindsight, I see it was 
taking a risk, because he could have taken exception, because people do 
sometimes, you know. They have an impression of what you'll put in the film 
that's different from what they see. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
And some come with a sense of what you've done before. It sounded like Suge, or 
someone in his office had seen a film of yours, with his injunction against 
&quot;slander and funny stuff.&quot;&nbsp; </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">NB:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
Yes [laughs]. Reggie Wright Jr. had seen <i>Heidi Fleiss</i>. But the film 
apparently got a good review on the Death Row website. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
[laughs] Well, he was able to deliver his message to the kids. </font></span>
</p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">NB:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
[laughs] Apparently there was a rumor that I was going to be the Salman Rushdie 
of the documentary film movement. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
That long take of him at the end, in the prison yard, is striking. </font>
</span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">NB:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
I was tempted to interrupt, to ask him more questions. But Michele and I had 
talked endlessly of course, about how we were going to be with him. And we 
thought it was more interesting to find out who he was rather than doing a 
combative interview. I don't think either of us felt he was going to confess to 
murdering anyone, but we knew it would be more revealing to get him to talk 
about what he wanted to talk about, to see how he viewed himself and the world 
around him. I think that's what happened in that long take. He starts with his 
message to the kids, and then talks about Compton, which he obviously cares 
about. He's such a product of Compton, he can't get his vengeance for Snoop out 
of his system. I think one of the most amazing things about film is that in long 
takes, you just see things change. If you're reporting in a different medium, 
say, in a newspaper, you report the conclusion. But in film, there's a way in 
which you see the process of people making decisions or coming to a conclusion. 
No other medium has that ability. You can show things in real time.&nbsp; </font>
</span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
I know that you spent a long time editing the film. </font></span></p>
<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">NB:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
It's such a rich story, with so many substories. I found in the initial cut that 
I spent too much time setting things up, informing the audience of what they 
were about to see. I was going into things in a detail that was interfering with 
the flow. So I had to find a way to simplify, so my voiceover was more my 
emotional experience of going through it than giving out information that 
somehow wasn't coming through the footage. And we cut a lot of the substories 
out, that I just couldn't do justice to. This way I could find a timeframe, an 
inherent structure in the material that showed an order and a progression. That 
took a long time. I still wonder if it couldn't have had a more radical 
structure in a sense, so there was a more overtly political outer boundary about 
the racial situation in the States. But I think that's inherent. </font></span>
