            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by <a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>,
            2 May 2003</i></font>
			<p><b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Filmgoers in Los Angeles and New 
			York City this week have the option of the watching tween queen 
			Hilary Duff strut her klutzy, comic stuff in the unbelievably silly, 
			childishly entertaining, and mass-market (i.e. Disney) driven <i>The 
			Lizzie McGuire Movie</i>, or they can avoid the lines (most of those 
			people are actually waiting for the next showing of <i>X2</i>) and 
			catch a more somber, serious approach to teenage angst in the 
			pitch-perfect <i>Blue Car</i>, a first feature of remarkable honesty 
			and strength from Kate Moncrieff, who spent more than half a decade 
			as a series regular on four daytime dramas dating back to <i>The 
			Guiding Light</i> in 1986. Moncrieff put her acting career on hold 
			after her script for <i>Blue Car</i> received a prestigious Don and 
			Gee Nicholl Screenwriting Fellowship back in 1998, sharing honors 
			with Michael A. Rich for <i>Finding Forrester</i>, another tale of 
			inspiration and literary guidance. Arriving later at the box office 
			gate than her co-winner, Moncrieff's film is perhaps slight of 
			budget but full of heart, soul, and a ton of acting talent, all well 
			stirred by a new director who has expertly transferred her story of 
			family failures and teen dreams to the big screen.</font></b></p>
			<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Seventeen-year-old Agnes Bruckner 
			earned her acting stripes early, as a regular on the CBS soap opera
			<i>The Bold and The Beautiful</i>, coincidentally one of the series 
			in which Moncrieff was featured before Bruckner entered 
			kindergarten. Now, six years later, her performance as a fragile 
			student is a bold, forceful step in career arc that is curving 
			upwards, comparable to Thora Birch's riveting jump from puberty in
			<i>American Beauty</i>, the quintessential dysfunctional American 
			family film. Ms. Brucker's Meg Denning is a beautiful, bright 
			student, much enamored of her AP English teacher Tony Auster (David 
			Strathairn), a seemingly earnest instructor willing to nurture the 
			shy youngster as a budding poet. Meg, the product of a broken home, 
			struggles with her unappreciative, over-worked mother (Margaret 
			Colin), and Lily, a bratty, younger sister who is dangerously prone 
			to self-destructive tendancies. Auster, we learn, has lost a son 
			years earlier and his wife (Frances Fisher, in a short yet 
			well-delivered role), still wallows in alcoholic disbelief and a 
			marital relationship bordering on frigidity.</font></p>
			<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Strathairn, a well-seasoned actor 
			who hits his mark here as a double-faced husband/father/teacher with 
			an itch for writing a novel in invisible ink, is selfishly apt to 
			quote Rilke to impress susceptible young ladies. Best known for his 
			passionate work with director John Sayles (<i>Limbo</i>, <i>Passion 
			Fish</i>, <i>City of Hope</i>), his performance evolves from &quot;Mr. 
			Understanding&quot; teacher-of-the-year mode to I-don't-wear-a-seatbelt 
			silent statement to poster child for the moth-to-the-flame, 
			schmuck-of-the-month club, as he lets his temptations compromise his 
			student at her most vulnerable moment. Perfectly believable for an 
			unsympathetic individual.</font></p>
			<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The other stellar actor is 
			freckled-face moppet Regan Arnold as Meg's ultra-despondent sister, 
			who commences a two-week hunger strike in a delusional attempt to 
			sprout angel's wings. Newcomer Arnold nails the character's family 
			disconnection and her stubbornly anorexic condition. The resulting 
			hospitalization strains the already claustrophobic situation (the 
			family lives in a cramped apartment) and the hereditary low 
			self-esteem boils up to a emotionally charged breaking point.</font></p>
			<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The film's titular automobile is 
			Meg's father's vehicle, the one in which he drove off when he 
			abandoned the women in his life. Meg mistakenly believes he shares 
			her affection for him, but it's an illusion. He doesn't even pay his 
			former family the meager $60-per-week child support. <i>Blue Car</i> 
			is also the name of the sorrow-filled elegy penned by Meg that 
			strikes a compassionate note with Auster. The mentor urges her to 
			push &quot;deeper&quot; in her creative process, and inspires her to 
			participate in the Ohio State Discovery Award for Young Poets 
			contest (which oddly has its national competition in Florida during 
			Spring Break).</font></p>
			<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In a way, the film's treatment of 
			men as the lesser sex reminds me of director Coline Serreau's 
			approach to the subject in her smart, sassy <i>Chaos</i>, wherein 
			French men were akin to pond scum. Aside from the absent father and 
			the teacher-as-father illusion, Meg's best friend's brother does a 
			disappearing act on her just as he promised to give her a hitch to 
			Florida for the important poetry competition.</font></p>
			<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Moncrieff, who premiered her film 
			at the Sundance Film Festival in January 2002, has crafted a 
			emotionally-draining, character-driven piece that reveals life's raw 
			blemishes in Job-like fashion, yet with a hope that one child's 
			brittle human soul will heal as she blossoms into womanhood.</font></td>
