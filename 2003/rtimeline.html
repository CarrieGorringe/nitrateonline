            I left the screening for <i>Timeline</i>, one of the movie minders
            observed that I had been laughing. I was, he said, vaguely vexed,
            laughing at parts that weren't even funny. And you know, what was up

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Granted,
            there may be parts in this film that aren't funny, or better, aren't
            meant to be funny. But all the zoiksy illogic and spinning plot
            points give <i>Timeline</i> a strange energy. This in spite of the
            considerable dampening rendered by that most earnest of young wet
            blankets, Paul Walker. As Chris, rebellious American-twanged son of
            British archeologist Edward Johnston (Billy Connolly), Walker makes
            good use of his two facial expressions, while the film flies in 20
            simultaneous directions all around him. Sometimes, it's good to be
            stiff. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Based
            on Michael Crichton's novel, Richard Donner's movie features a
            creaky father-son reconciliation story framed by a bizarre collision
            of Sci-Fi and Medieval Tymes. That is, when Johnston seeks answers
            regarding his pet project, a dig in France, he's whisked back by a
            time machine to 1357, during the Hundred Years War, precisely on the
            evening before British forces will decimate a French outpost at
            Castelgard. When it happens that Edward can't find his way back to
            present day, Chris is called in (though just why is unclear) by
            think-tanker </font></span><font face="Verdana" size="2">Robert
            Doniger (David Thewlis), head of ITC (International Technology
            Corporation -- as bland a title as any scary conglomerate might hope
            to have). It appears that the gizmo Doniger calls a 3D fax maxhine
            is causing trouble.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Specifically, there's just a <span style="mso-fareast-font-family:
&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">six-hour window within which to locate Edward and bring
            him back before this particular &quot;wormhole&quot; to this spot
            and moment is lost forever. (Or maybe not; as its discovery is
            accidental, there's really no telling what might be found or unfound
            next.) Chris and his dad's loyal diggers don 14th-century garb and
            grit their teeth for the molecular spaz through machinery. These
            intrepid few include Chris' reluctant romantic object Kate (Frances
            O'Connor in terrible bangs); Scottish action-heroic archeologist
            André Marek (Gerard Butler); and the exquisitely timid François
            (Rossif Sutherland), compelled to go just because he &quot;speaks
            French&quot; (the fact that the olde French might be different from
            the French he speaks is apparently not an issue). Also along for the
            aggressive part of the ride are a couple of red-shirts (Marines) and
            the spastically gung-ho Frank (Neal McDonough), who looks and acts
            suspiciously from jump. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Not
            that this crew would notice anything suspicious. For a group of
            scientists, they are almost shockingly inattentive to details and to
            facts. Contrary to most time-travelers in movies, these people have
            no compunction about changing the past. Declaring his belief that
            &quot;You make your own history,&quot; André promptly falls in love
            with the crucial historical figure Lady Claire (Anna Friel), a
            Frenchwoman who speaks English intermittently and conveniently, and
            whose noble brother, Lord Arnaut, is played by Lambert Wilson,
            looking for all the world like he wishes he was still a program
            married to Monica Belucci in one of the <i>Matrix</i> sequels. (Then
            again, maybe that was just my funny spin on the unfunny moment.)
            Though André knows her story backwards and forwards, as her demise
            and its aftermath form his area of academic expertise, he just can't
            help himself -- he's got to change history to suit his own desires. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">His
            fellow time-skippers show equal disinterest in maintaining
            chronological stability. Instead, Chris is conniving to get next to
            Kate, she's desperate to prove her own theory that a certain tunnel
            exists (to the point that she's willing to stake all her friends'
            lives on it), and poor François is left wondering just how not to
            translate a phrase that spells certain doom for him. And so, by the
            time a few nasty Brit soldiers start pointing swords and spears at
            them, well, killing them off one by one looks okay too. Who's going
            to miss a few smelly rubes anyway? And besides, the leader of that
            pack is as sniveling a villain as you'd ever meet, so he deserves
            whatever he gets. Right? <o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            question of deserving, as it relates to political order, social
            meaning, and time, drives the film, as if history is a matter of
            ensuring good victors, and making it fit personal visions. This is a
            funny idea, if you think about it. And it makes the film's
            time-related dialogue and inane timing seem rudimentarily humorous
            (intentionally or no). So, consider André's romantic, on-a-boat
            chitchat with Claire, who isn't following his 20th-century slang
            (&quot;We're speaking the same language, but you don't understand a
            word I'm saying, do you?&quot;), as this precedes a round of British
            arrows shot at them. <o:p>

            <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            André and Claire pursue their mutual interests, the others are left
            to devices Amid the excitement, Kate starts to rethink her policy
            about not dating her employer's son and Edward is compelled to
            deliver a devastating weapon to the bad guys (who in this case hey
            locate Edward being held prisoner, then learn they need 40 feet
            clear around them to start up the &quot;markers&quot; that will send
            them back, and then find out that a previous time-traveler, Robert
            de Kere (Marton Csokas), is siding with villains because he wants to
            be wealthy, or maybe just because. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">All
            this while an accident and several arguments back (forward?) in the
            20th century necessitate rebuilding the time machine -- with
            precious few minutes left on the wormhole's tick-tocking clock. Will
            they save Castelgard? Will they get back to the future? Will they
            figure out how time works or why men go to war? And will they come
            to learn how the French get to be heroes in this version of history?
