            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 24 January 2003</i></font><p>
			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Your nostrils are flaring!&quot; 
			Brittany Murphy exclaims at one point to Ashton Kutcher in the 
			romantic farce, <i>Just Married</i>, a sure sign that he is 
			prevaricating to her and one of those things that guys hate to be 
			caught out on if for some reason they have to avoid telling the 
			truth to the women in their lives.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kutcher, who has the rubbery face 
			of a baby's squeeze toy, and Murphy play Tom and Sarah, a young 
			couple who marry, go off on a European honeymoon, and become so 
			furious with each other over how imperfectly things came off that 
			they're ready to split immediately after they touch ground again in 
			the U.S. Among other things, they ignominiously blow out the 
			electrical system in their quaint French hotel, plow their compact 
			rental car into a snowdrift, and find themselves dogged around 
			Venice by an ex-boyfriend of Sarah's, here more &quot;obsessed&quot; rather 
			than being full-blown &quot;psycho&quot; like the ex-boyfriend in <i>A Guy 
			Thing</i> (the ex in <i>Just Married</i>, played by Christian Kane, 
			pretty much just takes Sarah out for a drink, after which she lobs a 
			marble ashtray that ends up hitting Tom). Worse, Tom and Sarah never 
			once get around to making love on their honeymoon. Worse than that, 
			Tom doesn't have daily access to the American sports scores.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The movie, directed by Shawn Levy 
			(who gave us last year's <i>Big Fat Liar</i>, in which Paul Giamatti 
			was dyed blue from head to foot for the fun of it) and written by 
			Sam Harper, and which has incredibly muddy, if not hideous, 
			cinematography (the culprit shall remain nameless here), has all 
			manner of contrivances, derivative material, and stuff that the 
			filmmakers throw in because they seem to think that the audience 
			expects it -- Sarah's mother (Veronica Cartwright), for instance, 
			has the same first name that Ms. Galore has in <i>Goldfinger</i>, 
			and, of course, one of her first on-screen lines in the movie is to 
			tell Tom that he can address her on a first-name basis. Sarah's 
			family is made up of rich folk who stand around, silent and 
			appalled, when Tom visits them for the first time (it seems he's a 
			bit too proletarian for them: he works at a local radio station); we 
			don't see any of his family, save for a single scene at the end 
			where the fine actor Raymond J. Barry plays his father and wisely 
			advises him that a little bit of adversity is to be expected in 
			marital life.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What's interesting is how Kutcher 
			and Murphy generate appealing on-screen chemistry in the film, and 
			how they spark something in each other during their scenes together 
			-- they have an ebullient quality at times, as if they really 
			enjoyed each other's presence, and which lends their scenes a 
			genuine tone. (Kutcher and Murphy are supposed to be an item 
			off-camera, as well.) And what's surprising is that you find 
			yourself wanting to see them get happily back together before the 
			final fade-out. That's the least you'd expect from a picture like 
			this one, and certainly more than you can say about a lot of other 
			bogus screen couples with whom we've had to suffer through a lot of 
			other, more swankier and ostensibly polished motion picture romances 
			of late.</font></td>
