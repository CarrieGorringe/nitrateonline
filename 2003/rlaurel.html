            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			Nicholas Schager, 7 March 2003</i></font><p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">There’s no 
			shortage of sex, drugs, and rock and roll in Lisa Cholodenko’s <i>
			Laurel Canyon</i>, but one wishes there were a few less yuppies. 
			Christian Bale and Kate Beckinsale star as Sam and Alex, an 
			intellectual couple of recent Harvard Medical School graduates with 
			no sexual, romantic, or social life. Despite the protestations of 
			Alex’s father, the two abandon their East Coast residence to 
			complete their studies in California while staying at the supposedly 
			vacant home of Sam’s counterculture record producer mom Jane 
			(Frances McDormand). However, when they arrive, Jane is still holed 
			up in her house trying to complete a record with a wild British band 
			whose lead singer, Ian (Alessandro Nivola), is also her lover du 
			jour. Sam and Jane are like oil and water, and it’s not long before 
			we recognize <i>Laurel Canyon</i> to be a film about time-worn 
			clashes: between mother and son, preppie and hippie.</font></b></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Complicating 
			Sam’s homecoming are two formidable obstacles: Alex actually likes 
			Jane’s devil-may-care lifestyle, and Sam’s beautiful Israeli 
			co-worker Sara (Natascha McElhone) has taken a (not unreciprocated) 
			liking to him. Writer/director Cholodenko, as in her debut <i>High 
			Art</i>, is fascinated by the ways in which happy relationships 
			become complicated. If only <i>Laurel Canyon</i> didn’t feel so 
			painfully obvious and programmed from the get-go. As Alex is seduced 
			by both Jane and Ian (whose passionate love affair is the opposite 
			of hers and Sam’s), Sam finds himself drawn to the enticing Sara, 
			but the drama elicited from these shenanigans is painfully rote and 
			predictable. When Cholodenko has Alex and Sam awkwardly fail to have 
			sex while Jane and Ian’s screams of ecstasy are heard reverberating 
			through the house, it’s a sign that there’s very little originality 
			or surprise left in <i>Laurel Canyon</i>.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Will both Sam and 
			Alex learn something about themselves and each other, and find a way 
			to make their relationship work? Will Sam ever accept his Mom, 
			faults and all, for the loving woman that she really is? Will Jane 
			ever grow up? You won’t have to hold your breath for the answers, 
			since they’re deduced easily enough from the film’s first fifteen 
			minutes. Yet if the liberal-conservative conflict at the heart of 
			the story – also embodied in Jane’s battles with the commerce-first 
			record label, who wants the band’s album finished in time for 
			Christmas so that it can “move more units” – is disappointingly 
			uninspired, the film at least benefits from the chemistry of its 
			almost uniformly excellent cast. As Jane, McDormand, with blond 
			highlights and decked out in a variety of skin tight faded blue 
			jeans and band T-shirts, gets her juiciest role in years, and her 
			relationship with Nivola’s rakish, smoldering Ian sizzles. Jane is 
			introduced while smoking a bong, and her uninhibited penchant for 
			nudity, cursing, and bisexuality is complemented by a tinge of 
			regret over having put her wild life before her son’s. McDormand has 
			a devilishly good time playing Jane, and it’s a testament to her 
			performance’s casual artlessness that Jane doesn’t disintegrate into 
			a caricature of peace-and-love slackers.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Similarly, Bale 
			and Beckinsale feel right at home with each other, although their 
			easy rapport might have something to do with the fact that both 
			foreign actors (Bale is Welsh, Beckinsale English) sport similarly 
			distracting American accents for the film. But while Beckinsale’s 
			Alex is allowed to branch out from her stultifying bookish life, 
			Bale is saddled with the thankless role of perpetually repressed 
			dork with a conscience. It’s one thing for Cholodenko to split the 
			world into two camps – artistic cool people and academic losers – 
			and another thing entirely to saddle your lead actor with a nerdy 
			haircut, sub-J. Crew outfit, and little to do except look dry and 
			constipated every time he gets near his mom’s rowdy friends. Even 
			Bale’s best scenes, involving his parent-sibling bickering with 
			McDormand, are few and far between, scattered among too many 
			sequences of Sam acting petulant or emotionally remote. Of course, I 
			dare any actor to elicit sympathy when his character’s biggest 
			dilemma is whether to choose between Kate Beckinsale and Natascha 
			McElhone. One wishes Sam would just smoke some grass, take a look at 
			his charmed life, and stop complaining. </font></td>
