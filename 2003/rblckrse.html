			</font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>,
            16 May 2003</i></font>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I don't know 
			you,&quot; Ryuko says to the various men who throw themselves at her feet 
			in <i>Black Rose Mansion</i>. Of course, she knows them: Ryuko is 
			the classic femme fatale, a woman who, whether she wants to or not, 
			need only step into a room and mesmerize everyone on the spot. Men 
			take one look at her and just can't help themselves. They'll do 
			anything for her -- spend all their money, kill other men. Yet, 
			Ryuko brushes them away, apparently heartless, yet, as one character 
			observes, that only adds to the &quot;enchanting mystery&quot; of her.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Black Rose 
			Mansion in <i>Black Rose Mansion</i> is owned by the aging, wealthy 
			businessman Mr. Sakou (Eitaro Ozawa), who has used it to set up a 
			private club and salon (so that, he cryptically says at the 
			beginning, he can pursue his hobbies). One evening, he drops in and 
			there's Ryuko, invited by one of the other club members, and Sakou 
			becomes, if not consumed by desire, at least distracted by it. He 
			continues to be so despite all the warning signs that follow. A 
			stern-looking man (Ko Nishimura) shows up and, claiming to be 
			Ryuko's husband, alternately demands and begs of her to come back to 
			him. Another, younger man (Yusuke Kawazu) arrives on another night 
			-- he's become pitifully dissipated and spent after seeing Ryuko 
			perform in a club in Yokohama, singing a song about the &quot;rose 
			rumba.&quot; A third, more vicious man (Ryohei Uchida) arrives on another 
			night still -- he met Ryuko in a gambling den in Kobe, and whips out 
			a knife which he's going to use on someone, only he gets himself 
			killed instead. &quot;This thing called love.... It could be called 
			insanity,&quot; says a police inspector who arrives at the scene of the 
			slaying.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Black Rose 
			Mansion</i>, with its stylized settings (the club is a mélange of 
			Western-style furniture, marbled columns, and art-nouveau, with 
			designs copied from the work of Alphonse Mucha), scenes suddenly 
			bathed in vivid color, and odd symbolic touches (Ryuko almost always 
			carries a black rose, an artificiality that she nonetheless believes 
			will turn red, and come alive, when she encounters true love), was 
			directed by Kinji Fukasaku, and I can safely say that I haven't seen 
			anything like it. (The film has recently premiered in the U.S., in a 
			splendid DVD edition, on video, and will also be screened at the 
			American Cinematheque, in Los Angeles, on May 18, as part of a 
			tribute to Fukasaku.) Exception: <i>Black Lizard</i>, a 
			crime/espionage drama that Fukasaku did in 1968, a year before <i>
			Black Rose</i>, and which did not appear in the U.S. until the late 
			Eighties, at which time it caused a stir. (&quot;Lysergic&quot; was one of the 
			adjectives used to describe it.) The Japanese author Yukio Mishima 
			made an appearance in <i>Black Lizard</i> (as a &quot;living statue&quot; -- 
			the female lead strokes his forearm and exclaims on how &quot;downy&quot; it 
			is), and he's said to have possibly had some input in &quot;Black Rose 
			Mansion.&quot; (A Mishima stand-in turns up as one of the characters, a 
			brash writer who attempts – miserably -- to make a pass at Ryuko in 
			French.) It wouldn't surprise me, since the film contains plenty of 
			Mishima's &quot;tortured by roses&quot; conception of love, in which beauty 
			and pain become interchangeable, even indistinguishable, and those 
			who love are doomed to suffer for it. Sakou's wife, for instance, is 
			housebound -- an accident left her immobilized, but it was an 
			accident that occurred when she was leaving her husband for another 
			man. Sakou spends more money on renovating the Black Rose Mansion 
			for Ryuko, just when his younger son, Wataru (Tamura Masakazu), 
			shows up. A brooding loner and ne'r-do-well who sees his parents 
			only when he needs to cadge money off of them, Wataru becomes 
			smitten with Ryuko only to become tormented by the fact that he's 
			falling in love with the woman who has just become his father's 
			mistress. Trying to find a way out, Wataru only gets deeper into 
			trouble, eventually leading to incidents involving gunfire and a 
			boat that plows right into the side of a freighter. As Sakou 
			observes at both the beginning and end of the picture -- recalling 
			when he saw her arrive, by boar, coming out of the crimson light of 
			a setting sun -- Ryuko was the beautiful sunset that preceded a 
			storm.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ryuko is played 
			by Akihiro Maruyama, who also played the wicked female lead in <i>
			Black Lizard</i>. Maruyama is a professional <b><i>onagata</i></b>, 
			an actor who, in the tradition of the Japanese theatre, must 
			flawlessly and methodically create the illusion of being a woman in 
			order to play the female roles in classic Japanese stage drama. 
			Ryuko is aloof, taunting, always in control, and Maruyama plays 
			Ryuko's emotions with just the slightest shift of register. The aim 
			is to create a character so heavy with mystery that fascination 
			becomes inevitable---nobody knows where Ryuko comes from, who she 
			really is, and we, in the audience, never really find out, either. 
			And, oddly, the film succeeds in that respect -- &quot;oddly&quot; because, 
			even on a second or even third look, you feel like you're only just 
			beginning to pick up on what's going on in &quot;Black Rose Mansion,&quot; 
			from the scene (flashback, or delusion?) where we see Ryuko happily 
			thrashing her husband with an archery bow (while the husband 
			describes how ecstatically in love he was with her), to the moment 
			where Sakou telephones Wataru to say that he's going to be out of 
			town for a few days, so Wataru is welcome to &quot;play&quot; with Ryuko while 
			he's gone.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">After completing 
			this picture, Kinji Fukasaku would go on to replace Akira Kurosawa 
			in directing the Japanese sequences of <i>Tora! Tora! Tora!</i> 
			(1970), after which he would direct a gangster drama set in 
			post-World War Two Japan, <i>Battles Without Honor and Humanity</i> 
			(1973), which was so successful that Fukasaku was pressed into 
			directing five sequels to it. In 1999, after fifty-nine films, 
			Fukasaku directed <i>Battle Royale</i>, which became a phenomenon in 
			Japan, played successfully in Europe and the U.K., and still has not 
			received a theatrical distribution in the U.S., despite the fact 
			that the film is unequivocally an anti-violence statement. (Fukasaku 
			was directing a sequel to <i>Battle Royale</i> when he passed away 
			earlier this year; his son, Kenta, is completing the film). There 
			may be something a bit too prickly in the film for many U.S. 
			audiences, who for the most part like their pictures cut and dried.
			<i>Black Rose Mansion</i> has a strangely subversive, yet complicit, 
			feel to it -- you feel as if you're being lead into strange 
			territory, places you've never been before, but you trust where the 
			film is taking you, and, in the end, in exchange for your attention, 
			the film does not violate your trust. Like Ryuko, it is exotic, 
			orchidaceous, and tantalizing.</font></td>
