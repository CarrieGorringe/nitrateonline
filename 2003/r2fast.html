            knew? Tyrese has got jokes. As parolee Rome Pierce, seeming sidekick
            to Paul Walker's bland blondie hero in <i>2 Fast 2 Furious</i>, he's
            easily the most entertaining object in sight. That is, aside from
            the superduperstudlyspectacular cars, all shiny, noisy, and wicked
            fast. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">John
            Singleton's $100 million sequel knows what it is and, no small
            thing, appreciates its revved-up viewers: it's comprised of a series
            of elegant, SF-looking, beautifully stun-driven and edited races,
            one after another; all are more ingenious than the CGI-ed
            tumbling-crashfest in <i>The Matrix Reloaded</i>. Each includes a
            special little twist, a trick that makes it extra-clever and woo-ha:
            at the end of one, the racers speed up to fly off a daringly lifted
            bridge; in another, one car careens between a couple of stubborn
            18-wheelers; and in another, well, Tyrese makes his first appearance
            in a &quot;Speedway&quot; contest, smashing all contenders with his
            tank of a car, painted so it has barracuda teeth grinning on its
            grill. Too funky. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">All
            this self-awareness gives <i>2 Fast</i> an admirable -- and
            admittedly surprising -- edge over Rob Cohen's original, which, if
            you recall, took itself too soapy-seriously. Brian's mooning over
            Derek Jeter's one-time girl was so soulful and all those betrayals
            were such drama. Equally unmissed here is Vin Diesel, then Mr.
            Breakout, now Mr. Priced Out of Part Two. Brian this time is looking
            leaner, and his minimalist backstory is that he was fired for
            letting Dominic/Vin walk away at the end of the first film (come
            again: the LAPD kicked his ass out for a moral breach, only one of <i>2
            Fast</i>'s insidey japes). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So
            as the new film opens, Bri's living on a houseboat and street racing
            in Miami for food money, hooked up by local gearhead Tej (Ludacris,
            who gets bonus points just for making Bill O'Reilly's hate-list).
            This first magnificent race introduces a few other racers who must,
            of course, eat Brian's dust, including Suki (model Devon Aoki), with
            brilliant pink car and hotpantsed pit crew, whose major function
            appears to be looking cute in chaps. Post-race, the kiddies all
            scatter in order to get Brian in position with a slew of feds,
            headed by uptight Agent Markham (James Remar). They need drivers to
            infiltrate the inner circle of Big Bad Dealer Verone (Cole Hauser
            with too much tanning makeup). (Just why Big Bad Dealer needs
            drivers who go really fast and cause mayhem is not exactly clear,
            but it's not exactly important either.) <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Because
            he's got pages of charges arrayed against him (enough to send him to
            prison for real time), Brian agrees to the plan, but insists on
            bringing in his homeboy for the requisite tag-teaming. Hooray for
            ridiculousness and for Singleton's obvious affection for Tyrese
            (with whom he worked to terrific effect on <i>Baby Boy</i>): Brian
            goes to find Rome at the aforementioned Speedway Jamboree, whereupon
            they display their history via a brief spate of macho posing and
            tussling, providing entertainment for Brian's infinitely patient
            watcher, brought back from Round One, Agent Bilkins (Thom Barry),
            and setting up their ostensible friction: Rome's a smalltime
            offender currently compromised by a lo-jack, and Brian's a cop...
            even if he isn't anymore. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Roman
            brings appropriate rage, outstanding musculature, and welcome comedy
            to the proceedings, calling out bulky thugs as &quot;Fonzie&quot;
            and &quot;Fabio,&quot; stuffing fast food in his mouth because, as
            he notes, he might be headed back to prison where the food sucks,
            and besides, doctor told him he's &quot;got a high metabolism.&quot;
            All this delivered with first-rate timing and endearing humility,
            along with a sense of irony -- all more interesting than anything
            his wifty-boy partner offers. On being hired by Big Bad Dealer,
            Rome's first move is to ask for some food, 'cause &quot;We
            hongry.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Their
            twofer driving routines entail the expected bonding rituals:
            reciprocal rescues, joint booty ogles, simultaneous whooping behind
            their wheels. As their first wrastling in the dirt scene suggests,
            these boys love each other lots; yes, Brian's the white boy wonder
            around whom all the drivers of color gather to beat the systems --
            Verone's overtly corrupt one as well as the law-and-order one -- but
            who knows. Maybe next time out, Brian's gone and Rome and Tej have
            it going on. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            main reason this seems possible is that Brian is less attentive to
            the boy-boy-action that powers buddy films (especially interracial
            buddy films) than he might be. Sure the guys are straight, but they
            also appreciate one another's skills and beauty. They say they grew
            up and &quot;played in the dirt&quot; together, but they're from
            different planets, which makes their friendship all the more
            charming (if implausible). When Rome strips off his shirt during one
            action scene, Brian calls it his &quot;blouse,&quot; so
            delightfully. They have a rhythm. So it's that much more
            disappointing when Brian loses his head. As Rome points out, Brian
            -- his bro -- is repeatedly distracted by the nearest dark-haired
            girl. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            this case, it's Monica (Eva Mendes), a vivacious fed undercover with
            Verone's operation. She and Brian have history (not exactly clear
            how), and he frets that she's &quot;sleeping with the enemy,&quot;
            which she is. The nastiest moment evolving from their dancing around
            each other comes at the behest of a jealous Verone, who forces the
            boys to watch while h has Monica participate in the ingeniously
            harsh torture of a scuzzy local detective they're plying for
            cooperation. As Brian and Rome wince and grimace, girlfriend applies
            herself, and this, more than anything else, makes Rome wonder if
            maybe his boy has his priorities skewed. You know he does. Rome's
            where the action is. <o:p>
