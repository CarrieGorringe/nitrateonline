            I'm old! I look like the Crypt-Keeper!&quot; exclaims Jamie Lee
            Curtis as the mother who has just exchanged personalities with her
            daughter in <i>Freaky Friday</i>, an updated remake of one of the
            more well-regarded Disney films of the Seventies. But, honestly,
            would ANYBODY say that Jamie Lee Curtis looked like the Crypt-Keeper
            in that dodo TV series? Even in jest?</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The earlier film was graced with
            performances by Barbara Harris and Jodie Foster in the leads. Here,
            Curtis plays the mother, Tess, a psychiatrist and, for the moment,
            single mother, who normally has to do around ten things at once
            during the course of a normal day. Lindsay Lohan, who initially has
            the tortured look of Avril Lavigne (something which eases up as the
            movie progresses), plays her teenaged daughter, Anna, having to
            contend with school, boys, an impossible younger brother, rehearsing
            with her rock band so they can get into a contest at the House of
            Blues, and -- the final indignity -- losing the door to her room as
            a punitive measure. As in the earlier film, mother and daughter say
            the other wouldn't last a day if they changed places.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And one's initial elation at seeing
            Jamie Lee Curtis in a comedy once again is soon deflated when the
            realization sets in that the movie is going to be short on
            inspiration and that it's going to keep repeating the same, small
            set of ideas over and over -- Lohan, when she's Tess-as-Anna, acts
            with high-minded rectitude in scene after scene, while Curtis, in
            Anna-as-Tess mode, wags her head gawkily and says &quot;Ew!&quot;
            several more times. It's not as if the movie does nothing, but,
            rather, you'd like it to do more with what it's got. You wait to see
            Tess-as-Anna witheringly deflate the dilettantish teacher (Stephen
            Tobolowsky, who's perfect) in Anna's English class, who enjoys
            flunking students for spite and gives pop quiz questions such as,
            &quot;Describe the character of Hamlet.&quot;; there's also the
            reaction of Jake (Chad Michael Murray), a boy Anna had been earlier
            trying to impress, when he sees Tess-as-Anna sabotage the test paper
            submitted by a classmate who humiliated her -- he's disturbed, even
            offended, by what he sees her do, which makes you realize that he's
            looking for a girl who respects the same things as he does, but the
            movie walks away from this and never comes back to it. Similarly,
            Anna-as-Tess treating her mother's patients for a day holds a
            potential that isn't even remotely explored. And why does the movie
            suddenly turn creepy when Jake starts flirting with Tess-as-Anna?
            He's supposed to be responding, of course, to Anna, behind Tess'
            eyes, but it feels, inadvertently I hope, more like a
            Benjamin-and-Mrs. Robinson type of thing.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>And when Tess helps Anna out at the big band performance, the
            filmmakers don't even give us a good shot of Jamie Lee Curtis
            playing electric guitar, like she means it, off-stage (they
            apparently filmed some, but it never made it into the final film).
            And not much is made of Mom about to be married to a new man,
            meaning a new father in the family (even though he is played by Mark
            Harmon, whose easygoing performance is one of the best things in the
            picture). While there are many moments where Curtis and Lohan work
            splendidly together, parts of the picture, alternately, could have
            been handled more delicately, or more assuredly.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mark Waters has previously directed
            an ambitious and rather daring independent comedy about another type
            of family, <i>The House of Yes</i>, which is worth having a look at;
            whether this new movie is a step in the right direction, I don't
            know. And what is the great moral lesson that Tess and Anna come
            away with after their experience? They're glad to be back in their
            own bodies, the end.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
