            the last film of Peter Jackson's history-making trilogy begins with
            a bit of recollection. Gollum (voiced and body-mapped by Andy
            Serkis) remembers how he turned from the hobbit Sméagol (fleshly
            Serkis) to the CGIed creature so relentlessly tormented by the
            Precious. While out fishing, Sméagol is so instantly smitten by the
            One Ring that he sets upon his cousin Deagol (Thomas Robins) with a
            murderous frenzy. From here, his subsequent addiction to Ringness
            leaves him alone in woodsy darkness, eventually transformed into the
            slithery, gaunt, and ferociously schizophrenic Gollum. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">From
            here, Jackson's version of J.R.R. Tolkien's <i>The Lord of the
            Rings: The Return of the King</i> cuts back to the present, when
            Gollum is guiding Frodo (huge-eyed Elijah Wood) and Sam (the
            strangely brilliant Sean Astin -- his performance here is
            excellent). Headed to Mordor, they seek to destroy the Ring (much to
            Gollum's upset). Awhirl with panicky fears and tremors, Gollum has
            nonetheless agreed to &quot;serve&quot; Master Frodo. But he is, as
            Sam surmises, traitorous, so gripped by the Ring's power that he
            schemes to wrest it back at his soonest opportunity and at any cost.
            The Ring is working its evil on Frodo as well: as they journey from
            one murky point to another, he begins to distrust his most intimate
            and loyal friend-to-the-end Sam, and believe instead in Gollum.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            taut three-character drama forms only a third of <i>Return of the
            King</i>. The film includes two other plotlines that merge in
            conflagration. First is the king of Gondor to be returned, splendid
            Aragon (Viggo Mortensen), who rides with his fellows, pretty elf
            Legolas (Orlando Bloom) and pithy dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies), he
            of the comedic assessments (&quot;Large chance of death, small
            chance of success. What are we waiting for?&quot;). And second is
            forced-perspective wizard Gandalf the Now White (Ian McKellen), with
            earnest hobbit Pippin (Billy Boyd). They all come together,
            supported by the men of Rohan and eventually, those of the
            seven-tiered city of kings, Minas Tirith, to fight the armies of
            Sauron, in what Gandalf pronounces &quot;the great battle of our
            time.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            bad guys are, as usual, marked by incessant ugliness and vague
            non-whiteness. This year's crew includes the broken-faced Orcs,
            hulking trolls, swooping Fell Beasts, and, in a dismally Orientalist
            turn, riders of the woolly mammoth-like Mûmakil (a.k.a.
            oliphaunts). The war for dominion over Middle-earth occurs in
            several parts, stretching over the Battle of the Pelennor Fields and
            an assault on Minas Tirith. It is tremendous and exhilarating and
            lengthy. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">All
            this mêlée imagery warrants the praise already heaped on it.
            Jackson and his CGI wonderfolks have created an astonishing mayhem,
            where meanness and munificence seem conjoined, each unimaginable
            without the other. Yes, the grand scale effects are thrilling: giant
            animatronic trolls, blown-up miniature edifices, and the
            computer-generated Shelob, the giant spider who webs up Frodo. And
            the close-ups solicit tears and cheers: the valiant stand made by
            Rohan's King Théoden (Bernard Hill); the rise of his magnificent
            daughter Éowyn (Miranda Otto); and the charming mushy love shared
            by Pippin and Merry (Dominic Monaghan), the former briefly enchanted
            by Sauron, via a glowing orb. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Pippin's
            brief, Gollum-lite encounter puts him on Gandalf's list, which means
            he'll have to prove himself worthy, again. No in-betweeners in this
            reductive view of the world: characters and choices are good or
            evil. This even as some of the good are rendered rather dull. The
            interracial romance between Aragon and elf Arwen (Liv Tyler) occurs
            mostly in flashbacks; her dad Elrond (Hugo Weaving) and the gossamer
            Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) appear for brief, boring minutes, while,
            Aragon, becoming his royal self, has to perform long-seeming scenes
            with utterly silly-looking ghosts. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">One
            conspicuously missing embodiment of badness is Saruman (Christopher
            Lee, who has publicly complained of his excision, having expected to
            see his seven minutes of a death scene, out of the film's 201), most
            impressive of Sauron's go-to guys. The Dark Lord Sauron,
            self-lauding creator of the One Ring, appears here as an enormous
            flaming eyeball with conveniently limited gaze (it misses Frodo when
            he falls behind a rock, and then, distracted by a battle, also
            overlooks his gradual progress to Mount Doom). Evil must fail, of
            course, and this literal lack of vision makes the triumph of good
            forgone. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            character most egregiously uglified by this rudimentary scheme is
            the Steward of Minas Tirith, Denethor (John Noble), also father of
            poor barely-a-blip Faramir (David Wenham), Dúnedain lord of Gondor,
            Prince of Ithilien. Miserable that his favorite son, Boromir (Sean
            Bean), is dead, Denethor becomes a ravaged shell of malevolent
            neglect: during one especially gruesome instance of metaphorical
            overkill, he chomps on juicy, bloody-seeming vittles while the film
            cross-cuts to a raging battle where well-intentioned humans,
            including the incurably obedient Faramir, are bloodily devastated. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Such
            broad strokes have surely shaped the trilogy throughout. Depending
            on what you're looking for, the film's uncomplicated moral
            oppositions are either entirely gratifying or generally irritating.
            As much as the context for the trilogy has changed from Tolkien's
            day to Jackson's, dissimilarities between sides remain readable in
            raced and national terms. (Notoriously, women in <i>LOTR</i> are so
            repeatedly left by the wayside that Éowyn can only define herself
            at her moment of triumph by what she is not: &quot;I am no
            man!&quot;) <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Such
            reading is probably inevitable in what is, at one level, a war
            movie. Racism (in its most blatant forms) requires visible
            distinctions, and so do war movies. Hectic battle scenes are more
            legible when the adversaries are marked by red and blue flags, dark
            and light skins, gray and blue uniforms. That <i>LOTR</i>
            differentiates between villains and heroes by making them unsightly
            and not (save for dear Gimli, I suppose) is thus understandable but
            tedious too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">When
            Gandalf imagines a &quot;greater country,&quot; where the good might
            reign unimpeded, he might be speaking for any warlord or president
            who believes that his cause is just and his enemy's just plain
            wrong. Wars are most effectively waged when sides are clearly drawn
            (otherwise, who would sign up to fight, save for those in need of
            work?); so too, war movies are most marketable when they manifest
            moral values in opponents' appearances. Thus, the fearsome King of
            the Ringwraiths is a faceless black figure astride a Fell Beast, and
            Merry is an adorable hobbit, riding into battle in Éowyn's lovely
            lap. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">All
            this obviousness makes the subtler threeway dynamic among Frodo,
            Sam, and Gollum compelling by comparison. Their judgments repeatedly
            and differently impaired, they struggle to make peace with one
            another and themselves. Even the most faithful and good-hearted of
            them, Sam, has moments of lost confidence and rage, and Frodo, for
            all his genuine niceness and affection for tagalong Sam, is
            intermittently seduced by the Ring. Convulsive and frantic, Gollum's
            split self is also perversely nuanced. So desperate to hold the
            Precious, so quick to hate on Sam and deceive Frodo, this hobbit
            transformed is newly raced. Without a fixed identity or ambition,
            haunted by traumatic memories, poor Gollum has no place to be,
            except those fiery Cracks of Doom. No wonder he's feeling
            distraught.</font></span><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"></o:p>
