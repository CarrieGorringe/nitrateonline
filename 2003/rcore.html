            hard to imagine a movie with worse timing than <i>The Core</i>. For
            one thing, it's a motley-crew-saving-the-world movie, with exploding
            buildings imagery that probably seems less fun now than it might
            have a few months ago. Here the explosions emerge from inside the
            world itself. The earth's core has stopped rotating, which means 1)
            the protective electromagnetic field will fail, and 2)
            &quot;everybody on earth will be dead within a year.&quot; Jeepers. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">As
            if this cosmic meltdown scenario isn't bad enough, the introduction
            of a crucial character -- astronaut/pilot Major Rebecca
            (&quot;Beck&quot;) Childs (Hilary Swank) -- depends on a space
            shuttle disaster. This is designed to demonstrate her most excellent
            skills and instincts, as she actually comes up with the perfecto
            coordinates to save the ship from disaster, allowing it to land --
            after much flaming and careening -- safely in downtown Los Angeles.
            This is quite the fancy stunt, and no doubt, when the film was
            conceived (screenplay by Cooper Layne and John Rogers), it seemed
            neat. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Now,
            however, the sequence includes some alarmingly resonant images --
            the ship's exterior in flames while streaking through the blue sky;
            urgent glance exchanged among crew members; and a sudden loss of
            radar contact with NASA, whereupon a ground controller named Stick (Alfre
            Woodard) looks properly horrified. It's not a little creepy, and,
            depending on how you look at it, a wholly bold or wholly insensitive
            gambit. (The film's promotional staff, at least, took note, and
            pulled the trailer featuring the shuttle trouble.)<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Once
            this bumpy patch is over, however, <i>The Core</i> settles quickly
            into the most mundane of plot and character developments. A series
            of mini-crises around the world indicates the calamity looming
            before oblivious earthlings: pigeons lose their bearings in
            Trafalgar Square, plummeting into windows, people, and fountains;
            the Roman Coliseum fries in an zap-zap electrical storm; the Golden
            Gate Bridge is cut in half by a super-searing-hot sunbeam (or
            something) that gets in through a sliver of a hole in the ozone
            layer. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Each
            of these scenes is both hilariously overstated and dreadfully
            rendered, evoking the good old days of '70s Disaster Pix. To be
            fair, such corniness does give <i>The Core</i> something of a Grade
            C drive-in movie look, as diverse no-names throw themselves
            dutifully into cinematic panics. Repeated shots of screaming faces,
            hurtling bodies, and frantic limb-waving, from low and deliriously
            canted angles, remind that poor schlubs respond badly to the
            unexpected. At the same time, the crises ostensibly generating such
            hysteria appear as listless CGI effects, with sets looking, on
            occasion, like they've been scavenged from <i>Godzilla, King of All
            Monsters!</i> (It's perhaps worth noting here that the film,
            originally slated for a 1 November 2002 release, was pushed back
            five months so the effects crew could add &quot;more scenes of
            destruction,&quot; with emphasis apparently on &quot;more,&quot; not
            better.)<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Such
            imminent catastrophe plainly calls for drastic action, namely, the
            assembly of an intrepid, occasionally internally contentious team to
            burrow into the earth and jumpstart core rotation. While this
            storyline may be creaky (Disney made a movie of <i>Jules Verne's
            Journey to the Center of the Earth</i> back in 1959), the 21st
            century team is fashionably multi-culti, while also predictably
            typed. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Reluctant
            Hero is Josh Keyes (Aaron Eckhart), physics professor
            extraordinaire. He happens upon the problem by accident one day,
            does some quick calculations, assisted by some even quicker research
            by his devoted RAs, and comes up with the doomsday scenario. Eckhart
            (best known as Julia Roberts' generous biker beau in <i>Erin
            Brockovich</i>, best respected for his admirably raw work with Neil
            LaBute) manages to look cheery and virile at the same time, which
            goes some way toward smoothing over Josh's not-quite-explained
            behavior shifts. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            primary thorn in Josh's side is his should-be partner, celebrity
            geophysicist and Carl Sagan wannabe Conrad Zimsky (Stanley Tucci,
            who <i>so</i> needs to stop playing the clueless snoot).
            Self-involved and prissy, Zimsky annoys everyone, especially former
            colleague Edward Brazzleton (Delroy Lindo), from whom he stole
            precious, name-making research twenty years ago. A prototypical
            angry black man ever since, Braz has been living out in the desert,
            designing a terra-burrowing ship, and is more than happy to complete
            the project with the government's check for $50 billion (this
            bestowed by a general played by reliably solemn Richard Jenkins). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Tagging
            along, that is, mostly observing the grumping by these three, are
            gallant pilots Beck and Robert Iverson (Bruce Greenwood), and
            weapons specialist Sergei Leveque (Tchéky Karyo). He's in charge of
            the nuclear bombs that will, presumably, restart the core. (At last!
            Weapons of mass destruction will be put to &quot;constructive&quot;
            use.) He's also French, underlining yet again <i>The Core</i>'s poor
            timing -- how quaint (or maybe nostalgic) this notion of a committed
            U.S. and French collabo seems today. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            project is put together in a matter of months, reduced to a few yay-team
            montage minutes on screen, in order to get all the primaries
            underground as soon as possible. All, that is, except the stalwart
            Stick and a hacker named Rat (DJ Qualls), conscripted to ensure that
            news of what's going on doesn't hit the internet (i.e., he's
            supposed to &quot;hack the planet&quot;). Rat's a nerdy smart-ass
            whose dismissal by Zimsky immediately marks him as admirable; that
            Josh likes him also speaks in his favor, as does his minimal demand
            for payment: a supply of <i>Xena</i> tapes and Hot Pockets. Sadly,
            the film omits cutaways to <i>Xena</i>, which surely would have
            lifted all spirits. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Once
            underground, egos vie, tempers flare, and a bit of romance simmers
            between virile boy and the only the girl in the room. Lasers mounted
            on the ship's nose carve out a tunnel as the enabled by some sort of
            laser beams that carve a tunnel for the ship as it goes. The ship
            itself is composed of a material that inventor Braz cleverly calls
            Unobtainium, which supposedly grows stronger with heat. Following a
            series of difficulties and deaths (some accidental, some painfully
            noble), the ship reaches its destination, as it must, and team
            members learn important lessons, like, say, &quot;Leadership isn't
            about ability; it's about responsibility.&quot; Roger that. You
            might say the same for moviemaking: just because you can imagine a
            plot and a set of effects doesn't mean you have to impose it on the
            rest of us. <o:p>
