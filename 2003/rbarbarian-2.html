            <p class="MsoBodyText"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Is <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Barbarian
            Invasions</i> about a jolly, life-loving intellectual whose final
            days are celebrated by a warm nest of loyal, admiring comrades? Or
            does it concern a pompous, irresponsible bunghole whose few
            remaining acquaintances grudgingly tend to him during a life-sapping
            terminal illness? Denys Arcand’s continuation of 1986’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Decline
            of the American Empire</i> revisits Frenchman Remy (Remy Girard), a
            college history professor that viewers will either love or hate.
            He’s an enthusiastic, carpe diem-practicing force of nature with
            an eye for women and good books. But his somewhat impulsive id has
            ruined his marriage and caused a rift between Remy and his son. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Barbarian
            Invasions</i> examines how this free-spirited man’s impending
            death effects the motley crew of colleagues, mistresses, children,
            ex-wives, and junkies gently guiding him into that good night.</b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">The
            film’s opening scene resembles a Game Boy screen during some
            frantic, obstacle-jammed video race. A chaplain worker skitters down
            the hallways of a Quebec hospital, dodging gurneys, IV tubes, and
            nurses en route to Remy’s room. The whole journey through this
            medical minefield is filmed in one unbroken shot (think of the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Goodfellas</i>
            Copacabana scene set in an ER, and you get the idea). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Such
            first impressions are deceiving, however. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Barbarian
            Invasions</i> is a movie of words and ideas, not action set pieces
            and fancy camera moves. When Arcand’s lens finally rests on
            Remy’s bespectacled, pear-shaped face, the French subtitles run
            fast and furious across the screen. His ex-wife (Dorothee Berryman)
            expresses bitter resentment over the libidinous man’s early days
            spent &quot;humping co-eds,&quot; even as she supports Remy through
            the sobering news of his illness. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">The
            unfaithful skirt-chaser has cancer, and his one-time wife summons
            Remy’s son Sebastian (Stephane Rousseau) to the scene. A
            millionaire investment broker with the bland good looks of David
            Duchovny, Sebastian has long since cut ties with his elder. After
            much begging on his mother’s part, the descendant reluctantly
            visits his ailing dad, brandishing a cell phone and laptop computer.
            The boy’s yuppie lifestyle is at odds with Remy, a self-proclaimed
            &quot;sensual socialist&quot; who labels Sebastian a
            &quot;puritanical capitalist.&quot;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">&quot;He’s
            never read a book,&quot; complains the snooty pop. &quot;He may not
            read,&quot; counters Sebastian’s proud mother, &quot;but he makes
            more in a month than you do in a year.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Even
            on a physical level, Remy and Sebastian appear as polar opposites,
            the older man’s doughy features contrasting wildly with his
            son’s lean, wiry profile. And herein lies the question at the
            heart of &quot;Barbarian Invasions.&quot; Can a father who shares
            virtually nothing in common with his son find closure as he
            reluctantly nears death’s door? Can both elder and offspring find
            some middle ground, and identify with one another in an emotionally
            satisfying final truce?<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">A
            few giggles are generated by Sebastian’s money-based values
            system, as he buys off a hospital’s administrator and union to
            move his father into a more respectable room. Later, he attempts to
            curb Remy’s pain by scoring some illicit drugs with a little help
            from the local police precinct. &quot;I hoped you could recommend a
            spot where I could find some high-quality heroin,&quot; he naively
            explains to the amused and disbelieving cops. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Eventually,
            Remy <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">is</i> introduced to
            heroin, in an eerie scene involving the junkie daughter of a past
            mistress (Marie-Josee Croze, in a dynamic performance that captures
            the manic highs and rock-bottom lows of smack abuse). &quot;The
            first hit is always the best,&quot; insists the young addict, her
            world-weary face suddenly aglow with enthusiasm as she shares the
            forbidden fruit. &quot;It’s the one you long for. They call it
            ‘riding the dragon.’&quot;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Meanwhile,
            we’re introduced to the educator’s clique of college buddies,
            all of whom have mellowed with age. &quot;The only powder I sniff
            now,&quot; says one reformed counterculture rebel, &quot;is
            ‘Baby’s Own.’&quot; In another clever scene, after Remy has
            deteriorated and is taken to a lakeside cabin to live out his
            precious final moments, such chums ponder the various causes once
            they embraced. &quot;Was there an ‘ism’ we didn’t
            worship?&quot; asks pal Pierre (Pierre Curzi), before the group
            recites a long laundry list that includes Maoism, Freudianism,
            Socialism, Humanism, and Separatism. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">The
            laughter is juxtaposed by Remy’s bitter take on world history.
            &quot;The history of mankind,&quot; he laments, &quot;is a history
            of horrors.&quot; Throughout &quot;Barbarian Invasions,&quot;
            characters speak of civilization’s constant state of flux, and the
            inevitable changes that transpire as unfamiliar forces shape the
            course of humanity. Many are tragic, such as the 9/11 attacks
            (briefly glimpsed through television footage). But are such changes <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">always</i>
            horrific, or must Remy come to acknowledge that some societal shifts
            are for the better? Can he embrace Sebastian’s uniquely different
            qualities, for instance, and not be afraid of them?<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Barbarian
            Invasions</span></font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">
            is a moving film, but one that often seems to embrace its
            complicated character with too much admiration. After all, his
            students are so indifferent to Remy’s illness that Sebastian must
            bribe them to visit. He’s a self-absorbed man, and moviegoers
            might well perceive Remy as nothing more than a selfish cad. In
            choosing the path of wine, women, and song, while shirking the
            responsibilities inherent to marriage and parenting, perhaps his
            children, lovers, and students have reason to find fault. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">But
            Remy’s flaws are also what makes Arcand’s movie so unique.
            Here’s a far from perfect man trying to learn from his mistakes,
            even as his mortality closes in. Perhaps Arcand is trying to tell us
            that we might not have control over the changing tides of history,
            but we can continue playing a part in the lives of those we love,
            even as they morph and develop in way not completely understood.
            &quot;Embrace the unknown,&quot; offers a caregiver as the film’s
            lead character slips away. Like an encounter with Remy the man, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Barbarian Invasions</i> is an emotional, infuriating journey that’s
            ultimately worth taking. <o:p>
