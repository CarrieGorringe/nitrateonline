			<a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 25 April 2003</i></font><p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="5">Caught in the 
			Henhouse </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700">
			<font size="2">&quot;So, I'm dead.&quot; Jake (Edward Burns) introduces 
			himself as the camera looks down on his body, lying in the street, 
			crumpled and bloodied. &quot;I think,&quot; he adds, &quot;it's because of this 
			redhead.&quot; And you think, okay, I'm in.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">You might think 
			this because James Foley's <i>Confidence</i> opens with a bit of an 
			homage to <i>Sunset Boulevard</i>'s famous dead-guy-in-a-pool 
			opening. Or because Burns has a part sweet, part gravely voice, good 
			for selling a noirish premise as well as Fidelity Investments. Or 
			maybe because the movie begins with this sort of dare, a jaunty 
			smartness that will be hard to maintain. And with that, it cuts back 
			to &quot;three weeks earlier,&quot; so Jake can explain how he came to be 
			dead. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The action 
			begins with Jake and his boys -- Gordo (Paul Giamatti), Miles (Brian 
			Van Holt), and Big Al (Louis Lombardi) -- on a job. They've got 
			crack timing, can read each other's slightest signals. At this 
			particular point, they're in a bar, conning some poor office-worker 
			weasel out of his money, which turns out not to be his money, 
			exactly. The upshot is, when the job looks most successful, Jake's 
			crew is in serious trouble. Now they owe $150,000 to a too-tanned, 
			unforgiving, and ADS-afflicted Mr. Big, Winston King (Dustin 
			Hoffman). The threat he poses is summed up in customary fashion: 
			Jake must meet him at his downtown club, all abstract edges and 
			neony lighting, where King is auditioning strippers: Dustin Hoffman, 
			big pimping. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Cocky, Jake 
			plays the hand he's dealt: he assures King that he'll sting someone 
			else of his choosing, who turns out to be a guy named Morgan Price 
			(Robert Forster, who, sadly, only appears for a few minutes). If 
			King puts up the front money, Jakes promises a $5 million return 
			(figuring he'll make be able to keep the money he's already 
			swindled, and either pay back or get over on King). Cockier, King 
			agrees to let Jake play, but only if he takes in his guy, the 
			apparently standard-issue henchman, Lupus (Franky G). Though Jake 
			protests (&quot;I work with <i>my</i> guys&quot;), the terms are set before he 
			even begins to negotiate. So now, the conning starts in earnest.
			</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Though Jake's 
			guys are not especially happy with the situation (feeling content 
			with their relatively safe smalltime status), he spins an elaborate 
			scheme, which includes the participation of that redhead he 
			mentioned, Lily (Rachel Weisz), though she isn't actually a redhead 
			yet. They meet cute when she picks his pocket; Jake admires her 
			nerve, if not exactly her skill, and he makes an offer, Walter Neff-ishly: 
			&quot;I'm talking about a grift, and it pays well.&quot; Though the guys 
			aren't completely comfortable with bringing in a new partner for 
			this, their biggest job ever, they go along because there has to be 
			a girl in a noirish con movie, to jumpstart heterosexual intrigue, 
			destabilizing and enhancing generic homosocial tensions. </font>
			</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Just so, Lily 
			throws a couple of seeming wrenches in the guys' posturing. Most 
			ostentatiously, she decides to dye her hair red, which sends Jake 
			into a tizzy over bad luck and his personal past. The guys moan and 
			groan about this omen, but the hair stays red, because Jake's 
			already brought it up in his framing voiceover. Lily also introduces 
			distrust among the crewmembers (crucial in a con movie). She and 
			Jake share a lustful evening, which either is or isn't a sign of 
			genuine affection. In turn, Gordo and Miles either see this as a 
			sign of Jake's debilitating distractedness or womanizing business as 
			usual. How you read these responses ambiguous depends on whether or 
			not you've figured out who's scamming whom. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">This figuring 
			is, in turn, either easy or tricky, depending on how much attention 
			you're paying, or maybe, how many con movies you've seen. Jake's 
			plan is suitably complicated, involving bank embezzling, wire 
			transfers to Belize, a couple of cops on Jake's payroll, Whitworth (Donal 
			Logue) and Manzano (Luis Guzmán). And, by the way, he's not in it 
			for the money, he asserts, but for the &quot;f*cking principle.&quot; The 
			commotion attracts the attention of a dogged fed, Gunther Butan 
			(Andy Garcia), who's been tracking Jake and company for years.
			</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">This plot point 
			allows for lively crosscutting between marks and surveillance 
			positions -- binoculars, cameras, listening devices -- which Foley, 
			editor Stuart Levy, and cinematographer Juan Ruiz-Anchia use toward 
			achieving an appropriately slick surface. Among the more striking 
			instances is a scene in which the crew meets at a sidewalk café. The 
			camera shoots them from across the street, traffic passing before a 
			series of increasingly intense close-ups. It matters less what they 
			say than what you're looking at: style filling in for scanty plot.&nbsp;
			</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Other stylistic 
			flourishes are somewhat less efficient. Doug Jung's script is 
			structured as a series of flashbacks, embedded within the broad 
			flashback that begins with &quot;So, I'm dead.&quot; Jake's storytelling is 
			occasioned by the fact that he's being held at gunpoint by Morgan 
			Price's guy, the smooth-suited Travis (Morris Chestnut). This 
			suggests that things don't go completely as planned during the scam, 
			but then again, maybe they do, since Jake is telling the story. 
			Movements between past to present (however you understand these 
			relative concepts here) use wipes and overhead pans, suggesting an 
			eye-of-god overview of events, in which motives and backstories are 
			withheld in order to sustain a kind of suspense. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">But suspense is 
			always a function of style in a con movie: the plot can twist a bit, 
			but it follows a formula. As dedicated con-catcher Butan observes, 
			&quot;A fox is not a fox until he's caught in the henhouse.&quot; And once 
			he's caught -- say, in frame one of such a movie, his destiny is 
			clear. The route toward this end can be sophisticated or snappy, 
			obvious or tortuous, but the end isn't in question. What may be 
			worth asking is what functions are served by such tidy little 
			puzzles, as they reflect a liking for nominal outlaws and 
			system-buckers, even as they reinforce a basic faith in systems.&nbsp;</font></span></p>
