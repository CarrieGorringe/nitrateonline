            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>For the average escapism-craving
            Joe, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Paycheck</i> is a breezy way to forget about reality for two hours. The
            movie looks nice. Its freshly scrubbed stars, with their soap-opera
            faces and Barbie-doll bodies, are pleasing to the eyes. The violence
            is served up light, like an airy soufflé, and there’s a happy
            ending to induce smiles as viewers exit the theatre. In other words,
            it’s an innocuous film that can’t hurt you. However, longtime
            fans of John Woo, who have come to accept operatic, lead-slinging
            death dances as an integral part of the director’s powerful
            aesthetic, will probably be unsatisfied with this neutered variation
            on his earlier, superior works.</b><o:p>

            <p><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Paycheck</font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">
            concerns a &quot;reverse engineer&quot; named Michael Jennings.
            Hired by cutting-edge companies to tinker with high-tech inventions,
            Jennings rebuilds such gizmos into superior versions, then allows
            the entire experience to be erased from his memory. The final
            &quot;mind wipe&quot; is assisted by his equally brilliant sidekick
            Shorty (Paul Giamatti, strung along for Steve Buscemi-style comic
            relief as the one funny-faced cast member), and ensures that such
            company secrets cannot be stolen by competitors. Sound familiar?
            This memory-tampering angle comes to us courtesy Philip K. Dick, the
            visionary author whose futuristic forays into mind-robbing have
            fueled similar plots for <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Total
            Recall</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Minority Report</i>.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Predictably, there’s a corporate
            rotten apple lurking behind the gleaming metallic science labs,
            marble business tables, and glass-encased high-rises. Jimmy Rethrick
            (Aaron Eckhart) is a billionaire entrepreneur who hires Jennings to
            embark on a three-year assignment involving a mega-magnifying lens
            that allows one to glimpse the future. After 36 months, Jennings
            will have the entire mission erased in the mother of all memory
            wipes. In return for this brutal bout of amnesia, he’s be rewarded
            a cool $90,000,000 paycheck. Being the yuppie whore that he is,
            Jennings accepts the lengthy job.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Upon completion, however,
            complications arise. An envelope that held his pre-assignment
            belongings is full of unfamiliar objects instead. Meanwhile,
            Jennings is horrified by the news that over the past three forgotten
            years, he forfeited his massive paycheck. Adding to his confusion is
            the appearance of an affectionate company woman named Rachel (Uma
            Thurman), who insists that she is his lover. Huh?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The remainder of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Paycheck</i>
            involves Jennings piecing together the mystery of why he’s out
            several million dollars, why Rethrick’s goons and FBI agents are
            hunting him, where Rachel belongs in his life, and what went wrong
            during his assignment. And why is the engineer haunted by what seem
            to be glimpses into the future, where he is seemingly gunned down by
            an assassin’s bullet? The scientific mastermind uses his envelope
            of seemingly unrelated objects to piece these puzzles together,
            after learning that the collection was compiled by the
            pre-&quot;wipe&quot; Jennings as a road-map of clues. In a kind of
            &quot;reverse scavenger hunt,&quot; Jennings must use the items to
            change his future and avoid a fate-scheduled appointment with death.
            An included package of steel ball bearings, for instance, is used to
            set off a mall metal detector, and the ensuing confusion provides
            him with a convenient, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Fugitive</i>-style escape.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Viewers who enjoy the zigs and zags
            of a complex, crisscrossing plot line, ala <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Usual
            Suspects</i> or <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Memento</i>,
            might enjoy this mind-bending motion picture puzzle. But even lovers
            of such intricate story mechanics will wince at the basic flaws of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Paycheck</i>’s premise. For instance, once Jennings has changed his
            fate with the first of his clues, he has already altered the path of
            what lies ahead. Thus, wouldn’t all of his subsequent clues be
            irrelevant?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In prioritizing the plot twists, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Paycheck</i> also fails to humanize and develop its characters. The best
            of its predecessors, Andrew Davis’ <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Fugitive</i> among them, generated tremendous empathy for its
            double-crossed heroes to go with the exciting chases and tense
            showdowns. So much screen time is invested into expository dialogue
            (you know the blueprint: villain points gun at hero, but explains
            his scheme in exhaustive detail before pulling the trigger), that we
            don’t really buy the plight of these onscreen rooting interests</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Another problem is the casting of
            Ben Affleck, who is to acting what the Big Mac sandwich is to fine
            cuisine. Following his triumphant turn as an odious, paddle-wielding
            bully in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Dazed and Confused</i>,
            he’s hammered more nails into his thespian coffin than Chevy
            Chase. Affleck is capable of two speeds: Snot-Nosed Yuppie Scum
            (tie, hair gel, crybaby attitude) or World Saving Hunk (bare,
            pumped-up chest, deer-in-headlights expression). Appearing slightly
            aloof and overwhelmed, he’s like smarmy Andrew McCarthy cloned
            with Keanu Reeves. Throw in the whole sad, embarrassing Bennifer
            circus, and this is one celebrity disaster worthy of Irwin Allen.
            Uma Thurman’s ass-kicking quotient is a pale shadow of the
            magnetic actress’ work in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Kill
            Bill</i>, and Giamatti simply stands around looking buffoonish (no
            doubt wishing he were filming an <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">American
            Splendor</i> sequel instead).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As for John Woo, the World’s Best
            Action Director should dredge up some hungry, under-the-radar Indie
            script, sign on for scale pay, and rage with the same hellfire
            intensity that branded <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Bullet in the Head</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Killer</i>,
            and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Hard-Boiled</i>. Full of
            roaring, monstrous set pieces harnessed only by their precise,
            brilliant choreography, the visionary violence of his early films
            has been aped by the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Matrix</i>
            series and nearly every other subsequent big bang film. His
            influence cannot be underestimated.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This time around, however, the
            grand master is repeating himself. Recycling a Mexican gun standoff
            here and a fluttering dove there, the filmmaker has jumped on his
            own bandwagon. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Paycheck</i> is
            John Woo lite.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"></o:p>
