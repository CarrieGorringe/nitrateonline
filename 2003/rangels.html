            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And this seems as good a starting
            point as any to discuss the extraordinary filming of Tony Kushner's
            ambitious 1993 stage drama, presented, as was the play, in two
            parts, and which encompasses everything from religion to political
            power, sexual politics, social identity, and the AIDS crisis in the
            1980s. At the conclusion of the drama's first part, one of the
            characters, Prior Walter, abandoned by his lover after Prior reveals
            he's HIV-positive, is rudely awakened by nothing short of an angel
            whose arrival shatters the ceiling of Prior's apartment, after which
            she proclaims him to be a prophet, HIV-positive or not. Prior, as
            most people would be, is taken aback. The main story is set during
            1985-86, before the widespread use of AZT and protese inhibitors,
            when Pres. Reagan hasn't even spoken publicly about AIDS, making
            many HIV sufferers feel as if they're being rendered non-entities by
            a government that is ostensibly supposed to be providing for the
            common good. And this is but one aspect of Kushner's play to
            contemplate.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Which is not to say that it is dour
            and dull and instructional. Kushner's dialogue is often alive and
            has bite, and it also has the quality, at a time when many things
            are plainly generic, of speaking to us with a genuine voice. The
            works of Noel Coward and Tennessee Williams share this same,
            unmistakable quality, as does the recordings of Glenn Gould and the
            films of Hitchcock, Fellini and Truffaut. The debut of <i>Angels in
            America</i> was not only extraordinary for what it addressed (in
            fact, Larry Kramer had already dramatized AIDS in his play <i>The
            Normal Heart</i>, which, unfortunately, has been enormously delayed
            in reaching the screen) but also for its scope and span -- a drama
            which addressed issues of controversy while providing a human aspect
            that anyone could relate to, a work which aimed for the moon and
            stars and, to quote the famous &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; review of
            Bruce Springsteen's &quot;Darkness at the Edge of Town&quot;, hit
            the moon and stars.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For the most part. Some of the
            flaws in the play are still evident in the screen version, although
            Kushner's screenplay has fine tuned certain aspects in the drama's
            second part which made its message seem somewhat jejune to some
            audience members (although, as Kushner acknowledges in the play's
            published edition, the expectations were enormous -- <i>Perestroika</i>,
            the second part of <i>Angels</i>, premiered eight months after the
            first, <i>Millennium Approaches</i>). There is also the
            split-difference on who the heavy of the piece is supposed to be.
            Two of the three plotlines that intersect in <i>Angels</i> have to
            do with Joe and Harper Pitt, an LDS couple freshly arrived in New
            York City, and Roy Cohn, the real-life attorney and dark eminence
            who attempts to turn Joe, an attorney, into his protege. Cohn also
            attempted to hide his HIV status by saying, to the end, that it was
            &quot;liver cancer;&quot; meanwhile, in Kushner's drama, unbeknownst
            to Cohn, Joe has crossed paths with Louis, who has just left Prior,
            and Joe, finding himself attracted to Louis, has to deal with his
            own identity issues at the expense of his marriage to (already
            troubled) Harper.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Cohn was, and still is, undeniably
            evil, having worked as Sen. Joseph McCarthy's right-hand man during
            the Army-McCarthy hearings in the 1950s, and in <i>Angels</i> he is
            seen visited by the spirit of Ethel Rosenberg, who, with husband
            Julius, went to the electric chair at Cohn's hastening. Kushner's
            depiction of Cohn comes off as harsher and more abrasive in the
            stage version, but that is not to say that Al Pacino's portrayal of
            him in the film isn't superb in its own way -- Pacino brings human
            aspects out of this unrepentant reptile, and his playing of Cohn's
            last scene is a real pip. But, with Cohn's exit, the burden of
            antagonist seems to fall to Joe Pitt, who is played by Robert Wilson
            with a face that has a beautifully unspoiled quality to it in
            close-up. Cohn lays a hand atop Joe's head and gives him a paternal
            blessing during one of Joe's last visits with him, when Cohn is in
            hospital, as if trying to pass on some last bit of the power,
            however venal, that he has accrued during his lifetime. (Cohn's hand
            is then seen slipping away, briefly touching Joe's shoulder and arm,
            as if Cohn were taking leave of the last vestige of carnal pleasure
            in this world.) Even if Joe's marriage to Harper is a sham and would
            make Joe a hypocrite, I don't think that necessarily makes him a
            terrible person. (I went to school with some LDS gay men, some of
            whom married in an effort to become &quot;straight&quot;, and they
            suffered terribly because of it.) I think Kushner is more concerned
            with aspects of fidelity -- not just in how it relates to the
            communicable quality of the AIDS virus, but also in how it relates
            to how relationships will stand or fall based on the true character
            of those involved -- trust, truth, fairness, love, things which
            apply just as well to straight relationships as well as gay ones.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And Kushner's drama has,
            essentially, too much compassion towards the way that people suffer.
            Louis leaves Prior; Joe leaves Harper; and, in turn, when Louis and
            Joe split up, it is after Louis has discovered Joe's connection to
            Cohn, &quot;the pole star of human evil&quot; -- Louis uses the
            occasion to spill out all of the frustration and guilt that he has
            been feeling, not necessarily towards Joe, but also towards the
            whole thing regarding conservatives versus homosexuals, his guilt
            and sorrow about Prior, and more, and the emphasis is upon how
            profoundly hurt Joe becomes by the confrontation. (Joe is never
            given the opportunity to explain himself.) But Joe also leaves
            Harper feeling tremendously hurt, as well. Mary-Louise Parker plays
            her as someone who exhibits a sense of wonderment at how desolate
            she has become, but she also struggles her way into a place where
            she can see things more clearly, and thus sorts out and takes
            control of her life. Joe and Louis may have to reconcile themselves
            with what pain they have bestowed upon others, but the drama's
            conclusion, which achieves incredibly poetic levels, shows that the
            characters who arise at the story's finish are the ones who have
            defined what principles they see as the ones by which they can try
            and do right and good in the world -- they may disagree, but there
            is room for that, and it does not cancel out the ability to help
            uplift each other, as people or as a community.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meryl Streep appears in the film as
            Hannah, Joe's mother, who wings in &quot;from Salt Lake&quot; to
            find out firsthand what is going on with her son and
            daughter-in-law, and ends up, by happenstance, meeting Prior. When
            he tells her of the visitations he has been experiencing -- a
            formidable angel, played by a formidable Emma Thompson -- Hannah
            calmly and confidently explains the situation to him: &quot;You had
            a vision.&quot; Justin Kirk, who plays Prior, has a bit of a
            satyr-like look about his eyes, the look of the one kid in the
            classroom who can always be counted on as being incorrigible. But,
            in the closing scene, he communicates a deeply beneficent quality
            (because he's playing his role from within, not just a matter of
            putting on externals). The angelic visitations turn out to be a
            representation of whether, as a person with AIDS, Prior should lie
            down and give up or do something else. To his surprise, he finds
            that he can't give in to the disease -- even if he doesn't know
            what's ahead (and he's given a hint that it might be pretty lousy),
            he'd prefer to take the chance and live, even if it's for a small
            time, just for the chance to be alive, just to keep going, and in
            that way his character becomes august. As Kirk's Prior tells us,</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;The world only spins forward;
            we will be Citizens.&quot;</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film that Mike Nichols has
            directed of <i>Angels in America</i> -- whose uniformly excellent
            cast also includes Ben Shenkman (as Louis), and Jeffrey Wright (as
            the proud, indomitable Belize, whom Wright also played in the New
            York stage production), and which has a beautiful and haunting music
            score by Thomas Newman -- captures the vaulting quality of the work
            without losing sight of the intimate, and it ends on a note of hope
            in that Prior is the first of many who will come forward and perform
            a great work in quelling the waters. It is a film that will be much
            discussed. We should be grateful.</font></td>
