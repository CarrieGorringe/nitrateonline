            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The spirited magic of rock ‘n
            roll illuminates Richard Linklater’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">School
            of Rock</i>, turning a formula story into something original,
            heartfelt, and resonant. The film’s premise - a failed slacker
            musician’s attempt to teach grade school, using only rock music
            trivia to tutor his tykes - sounds as lame and bland as Barry
            Manilow. Thus, those expecting <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Spinal
            Tap Tots</i>, or a headache-inducing, Marshall-powered variation on <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Daddy
            Day Care</i>, can be forgiven.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">However, we <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">are</i>
            talking Linklater here, a director whose work finds emotional truth
            in unlikely places.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His
            <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Dazed and Confused,</i> an <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">American
            Graffiti</i> for the bongs ‘n Aerosmith generation, put
            ‘seventies keggers in the time capsule like no film before or
            since. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Before Sunrise</i> injected pheromones into the talk-heavy approach of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">My
            Dinner with Andre</i>, and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Waking
            Life</i> poured experimental animation over the top of its equally
            rich conversations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Unlike
            so many self-consciously cold movies of late (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Attack
            of the Clones, Matrix Reloaded</i>), Linklater’s films dance and
            crackle with the warm words of impassioned thinkers.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            School of Rock</i> follows such a tradition.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Its hero, Dewey Finn (Jack Black), is an underachieving
            twentysomething indifferent to work, higher education, or ambition
            of any sort.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>However, there’s a romantic, idealistic heart beating
            beneath Dewey’s stale clothes and sub-par hygiene.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The conduits, valves, and circuits of his brain respond only
            to select neurotransmitters. As in, Black Sabbath, Motorhead, and
            Ted Nugent. L Dopa? Forget it. Led Zeppelin? Now you’re talking.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </span>Dewey, however, is a slave to his own unbridled enthusiasm
            for music.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>As <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">School of Rock</i> opens in the shadowy, catacomb-like caverns of a
            smoky rock club, its stage-aimed camera reveals that Dewey is a
            guitarist. His portly mass stammers like a charging rhino on
            amphetamines, or a tubby Angus Young. No, wait - now it’s Pete
            Townsend whirling his helicopter-blade arm!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>But, then again, the flashing tongue is all Gene Simmons!
            Ultimately, Dewey appears as a tragically un-hip, flailing butt-rock
            cliche, ending the set with an ill-fated stage dive onto the
            concrete floor.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s not long before this
            guitar-strumming sad sack is booted from his band.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Dewey’s unhinged onstage mania might be sincere, but it’s
            not cool. Meanwhile, his roommate is demanding rent reimbursement.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>What’s an unskilled, unemployed, unmotivated, aging rocker
            to do?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Dewey schmoozes
            his way into a substitute teaching job.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>With no credentials or experience, he forges a resume packet
            and impresses a prudish, old maid principal (Joan Cusack).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Even so, she has a bad feeling about the new hire, especially
            after Dewey’s first day request to “cut out early.”</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As Jack Black “orients” his
            classroom full of impressionable pupils, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">School
            of Rock</i> really hits its stride.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Linklater dodges the old “students from hell” cliche by
            making Dewey’s charges a perfectly poised, well-behaved bunch. No
            spitwads, no paper airplanes.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>All the more fun to watch the group’s mentor tarnish such
            mild manners with his low-brow influence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>“Look, here’s the deal,” explains an unshaven,
            bleary-eyed Dewey after stumbling in for his first class. “I’ve
            got a hangover, a headache, and the runs.” Meanwhile, the
            educational guru uses a less-than-subtle approach for teaching
            life’s harsh realities. “The world is run by The Man,” he
            whines. “It will crush your soul. You’ll end up a fat, washed-up
            loser. Just give up.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Obviously,
            Dewey champions a rather harsh worldview.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For good reason, such tactics might
            come across as a parent’s worst nightmare. Yet, as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">School
            of Rock</i> familiarizes us with Dewey’s routine and introduces us
            to his young students, we come to realize that this is one nightmare
            that might be a blessing in disguise.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>A stifled young man acknowledges that his dad never allowed
            him to play electric guitar. Soon, the liberated lass is wielding
            Dewey’s Flying V and strumming the chords to “Iron Man.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>A piano player is handed a stack of Doors CD’s for
            homework, all the better to embrace keyboards. Soon, the entire
            classroom has re-invented itself as a cherubic musical force to be
            reckoned with.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Dewey likes his students.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>If his methods are crude, it’s merely a reflection of this
            ignorant savage’s own social shortcomings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>He might not be cool to his peers, but this guy’s
            unmannered, pure zest for all things rock is contagious with
            children too young to know the difference. He’s also an advocate
            for these insecure youngsters. When a portly African American girl
            worries that her size will be viewed as an embarrassing liability
            onstage, Black reminds the reluctant singer that “Aretha Franklin
            is a big lady” that everyone wants to party with.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meanwhile, Linklater is careful to
            avoid another overused cliché by depicting rock <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">not</i>
            as a sinister, evil force, but as an agent for cathartic release and
            healthy emotional management. ‘I like your delivery,” praises
            the instructor after a young ‘un belts out some lyrics,
            “‘cause I could feel your anger.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The comment acts as a segueway into anger management lessons,
            with Dewey leading his troops through an anti-bully anthem called,
            “Step Off.” Better to vicariously act out one’s anger, Black
            suggests, than to take it out on classmates, parents, siblings –
            or oneself.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Why is it that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">School
            of Rock</i> succeeds at its mission while other high-concept,
            “cute” movies like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Big
            Daddy</i> sink faster than an iron butterfly?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Perhaps its because Linklater and his actors understand <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">passion</i>.
            They understand <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">enthusiasm</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Black’s delivery – think John Belushi with Jack
            Nicholson’s overactive eyebrows - isn’t self-conscious or
            eccentrically hip. There’s an honesty to his convictions that any
            pre-grunge rocker who has ever strummed an air guitar in front of a
            mirror can relate to.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film’s supporting players
            also make beautiful noise together, contrasting Black’s
            sensational turn with other, equally recognizable shades of
            humanity.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Playing
            Dewey’s withdrawn, pussywhipped roommate Ned, Mike White (who also
            wrote the film’s screenplay) represents the fallen leagues of
            failed rockers who give up on their dreams. “I’m not a satanic
            sex god anymore,” Ned laments, his domineering, superbitch
            girlfriend (Sarah Silverman) looking on with controlling approval.
            Meanwhile, Cusack plays prissy Principal Mullins as someone so
            tightly-wound and tense, she’s prone to manic Stevie Nicks
            impersonations to let off steam, after having her inhibitions
            drowned by a couple of beers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Linklater’s latest joyride is
            also a hymn to the importance of teamwork and camaraderie.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Music-lovers are like war veterans or Trekkies, with their
            own cliques, cults, and cultural bonds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Such rock ‘n roll brotherhood is best conjured forth in a
            late scene in which Dewey and his students-cum-bandmates huddle
            together before performing their first public gig. “Oh, God of
            Rock,” he prays, “thank you for giving us the opportunity to
            kick some ass tonight.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
            <p style="mso-outline-level:1"><font face="Verdana" size="2">“School
            of Rock” kicks ass. It’s one movie that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">definitely
            </i>goes to eleven.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"></o:p>
