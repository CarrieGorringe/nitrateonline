			<font size="2">It's dark. And windy. A boy quakes in his bed. His 
			mom just tucked him in, and told him everything was all right, but 
			he knows better: the house creaks and shrieks, creepazoidal shadows 
			glide over his wall, thunder cracks. Hiding under the covers, he 
			grabs for a flashlight on his nightstand. Panicky and barely 
			breathing, he manages to flick it on at the last minute, just before 
			something -- some floating, eerie, porcelain-masked, and vaguely 
			female creature -- comes at him. The boy screams. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">This brief 
			description of an early scene from <i>Darkness Falls</i> makes it 
			sound like lots of scary movies. But, while it borrows heavily from 
			previous films -- <i>Elm Street</i>'s badly-burned-fiend and 
			don't-go-to-sleep premises; the <i>Blair Witch</i> old-biddy 
			vengeance plot; the unfounded blame for murder that haunts selected 
			vics in the <i>Candyman</i>; the rather worn out 
			Phantom-of-the-Opera-Halloween-hockey-mask monster look; <i>They</i>'s 
			&quot;night terror&quot; framework; the can't-go-in-the-light idea used much 
			more effectively in <i>The Others</i>, as well as <i>Pitch Black</i>'s 
			stay-in-the-light-or-else business; the 
			little-kid-accused-of-murder-and-sent-to-a-madhouse concept; even 
			the exceedingly familiar spooky-lighthouse long shot, most recently 
			used in <i>The Ring</i> -- Jonathan Liebesman's movie is uncommonly 
			weak. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Based on <i>
			Tooth Fairy</i>, a five-minute film by Joseph Harris (here credited 
			with &quot;story by&quot;), <i>Darkness Falls</i> begins with a lengthy 
			narration -- it feels like you're listening to this fellow ramble on 
			for ten minutes, but it's probably closer to a couple -- explaining 
			just why this kid you're going to see will be so scared of the 
			floating wraithy thingy with the white mask. Seems that 150 years 
			ago, Matilda Dixon was a nice &quot;tooth fairy,&quot; friend to all the kids 
			in the town of Darkness Falls, until she's horribly disfigured in a 
			fire, forced to wear a porcelain mask, and stay out of the daylight. 
			Falsely accused of a terrible crime, she's hanged, but not before 
			she curses the mobbish townsfolk -- whenever kids lose their teeth 
			in the future, she'll come kill 'em. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">All this leads 
			to the boy in his bedroom, named Kyle (played by Joshua Anderson as 
			a child). When the wraith can't kill him (because he's got a 
			flashlight), it kills his mom instead, leaving horrific bloody 
			wounds all over her drained, pale body. Accused of this grisly 
			murder, Kyle is sent away, much to the chagrin of Caitlin, the 
			neighbor girl who has a crush on him. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Years later, 
			Kyle (now played by Chaney Kley) is de-institutionalized and busy 
			stockpiling batteries, flashlights, and flares, while also checking 
			and rechecking his cache of anti-psychotic drugs. So maybe he's not 
			the most stable personality. But scrappy Caitlin (now played by <i>
			Buffy</i>'s most excellent Vengeance Demon, Emma Caulfield) still 
			carries a torch, of sorts. She phones him up, explaining that she 
			actually does have a reason: she has a little brother, Michael (Lee 
			Cormie, with annoying &quot;widdle kid&quot; enunciation), currently suffering 
			&quot;night terrors&quot; that resemble Kyle's old stories, and locked up in 
			the local hospital. Against his better judgment, Kyle returns to the 
			small town that so cruelly damned him. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Bad idea. 
			Everyone's determined to harass him, from the townie bullies to 
			Larry (Grant Piro), the jealous nerdy former classmate guy who's now 
			a lawyer and courting Caitlin. And, of course, he's suddenly 
			revisited by the wraith (part concoction by Stan Winston's creature 
			shop, part digital black shroud, part Antony Burrows), who 
			apparently didn't have Kyle's address in the hospital. </font>
			</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Granted, logic 
			is hardly a high priority element in slasher films, but <i>Darkness 
			Falls</i> sets a new bar for lack of it. The wraith appears at first 
			to have a plan, convoluted as it is: to assault kids who've lost 
			their teeth, and especially to pursue kids who've lost their last 
			teeth and avoid death by turning a light on her (and, evidently 
			importantly, &quot;seeing&quot; her in the process). But when she has trouble 
			killing a kid with an unambiguous tooth affiliation -- say, Kyle and 
			then Michael -- she's willing to settle for anyone in the vicinity.
			</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">So, when the 
			loutish, big-mouthed, hard-drinking Ray (Angus Sampson) gives Kyle a 
			hard time at a scuzzy bar (to which he has inexplicably agreed to go 
			with Larry the Lawyer), they end up in the dark woods where the 
			ghost comes a-calling: she flies through the night air to scratch 
			and flay Ray, leaving Kyle the most likely suspect. Samey-same when 
			Larry schemes to keep Kyle away from Caitlin and drives him out in 
			another woods, where he slams the car into a tree and then, when 
			Kyle instructs him not to, he looks up at the wraith swooping down 
			on him and meets his own ghastly fate, again leaving Kyle to appear 
			guilty for the local PD, who promptly lock him up -- without a 
			flashlight -- and then fall prey to the erstwhile tooth fairy 
			themselves. (The cops, it should be said, are preternaturally dense, 
			having not noticed the series of unsolved murders that have plagued 
			their town for decades.)</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Perhaps the 
			wraith appreciates the irony of inflicting false arrest and 
			punishment on someone else. Maybe the movie just needs a pile-up of 
			bodies to emphasize her unspeakable evil, or to stretch out a 
			five-minute idea into seventy-five minutes by way of laughable 
			carnage and cheap effects. Or it could be that Ms. Dixon is just 
			playing matchmaker for the film's designated couple: Caitlin and 
			Kyle, fortunate enough to have the built-in nuclear-convenient 
			child, Michael, whose own parents (also, presumably, Caitlin's) 
			don't merit a mention in the tumult of plot turns and corpses-to-be 
			that fill up <i>Darkness Falls</i>. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Indeed, it 
			appears that, if not for the tooth fairy, Caitlin and Kyle would 
			never get over themselves enough to hook up. He's shocked when she 
			calls him up, then briefly resists her entreaties, themselves rather 
			stilted and hesitant, as if she's still the girl who didn't get to 
			go to the dance because her date was charged with matricide. True, 
			she is visibly uncomfortable under Larry's proprietary touch, but 
			she makes little effort to assuage Kyle's nerves, even reminding 
			him, rather callously, of his own incarceration and supposed 
			insanity. But, when he's beaten up and dragged through the woods, 
			appearing before her bloodied and besieged, she's undeniably drawn 
			to him: &quot;I need to get this gravel out of your scalp,&quot; she mutters, 
			strong-arming him into a chair near the light in order to do her 
			nurturing duty. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">It is a clever 
			come-on line, to be sure. And it suggests that her instincts 
			regarding light are good. But it's mostly lost on Kyle, the big lug, 
			determined to make his date with his destiny, i.e., his mother's 
			slayer. This is hurried along when a massive power failure kills 
			every light in town, and the hardy survivors head over to the 
			lighthouse to turn it on and blast the wraith out of existence, 
			temporarily at least. Kyle, Caitlin, and Michael make a neat little 
			grouping, and Caitlin conveniently loses her sweater during the 
			drive over to the lighthouse, so that the film's final scenes might 
			feature her in a string-strapped, clingy top. Someone gave serious 
			thought to costume design, at least. </font></span></td>
