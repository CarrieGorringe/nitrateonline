            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At
            first, hearing Tupac Amaru Shakur talk about himself in the past
            tense is unnerving. Not only was he profound and perceptive in his
            early 20s, he was prescient too. &quot;I got shot. I always felt
            like I'd be shot,&quot; he says at the start of Lauren Lazin's
            documentary, <i>Tupac: Resurrection</i>. &quot;I'm surprised, but
            I'm happy, because I believe it's all in God's hands.&quot; With a
            voiceover culled from the artist's many interviews, thoughtful and
            provocative, the film pieces together a too-short life, a patchwork
            that's sometimes sad, sometimes predictable, and often inspired and
            impassioned. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            basic trajectory of that life is familiar to anyone with even a
            passing knowledge of Tupac's art, as he talked about his life
            throughout his career, using his experiences as foundation, source,
            and challenge. The film recounts all those steps, from his birth in
            Brooklyn in 1971 to Baltimore to Digital Underground to Clinton
            Correctional Facility to Death Row and at last to Vegas on 7
            September 1996. From jump, the film insists on the importance of
            Tupac's mother Afeni (who executive produced the film, ensuring, if
            nothing else, its excellent soundtrack, with add-ons by Tupac
            acolyte Eminem, including the single &quot;Running [Dying to
            Live]&quot;). Black Panther, community activist, drug addict, and
            strong black woman, she shaped her vibrant son as he absorbed her
            politics, rage, and poetry, challenging and admiring her at
            different points in his life. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            relationship is good to remember, for and at one level, this film is
            all about continuity across generations. At another, of course, it's
            about resisting history, or better, understanding in order to
            overcome it. &quot;Everybody's past,&quot; he says, &quot;is what
            made their future.&quot; The film reflects that his own relationship
            to his past changed during his life, but even more to the point, as
            his past became mythic and seminal, a means to a legend that now has
            everything and precious little to do with the person he may have
            been. Certainly, there were pressures on Tupac to be a star, a
            leader, a prophet, and yet he also felt (or said he felt) that these
            were his callings, that he would make a difference in the broadest
            sense: &quot;Throughout my life, I just wanted to be an angel of
            God.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            volatile as Tupac may have been, those who tell (and retell) his
            story tend to make it unambiguous, whether in hagiographies or in
            critiques of his outraged lyrics. (This process of
            &quot;stabilizing&quot; his legend continues with the film's
            release, as it is accompanied not only by the requisite cd of tracks
            &quot;inspired&quot; by Tupac, but also a coffee table-type book, <i>Tupac:
            Resurrection</i>, featuring photos and quotations from the movie,
            edited by Jacob Hoye and Karolyn Ali.) While the movie
            &quot;allows&quot; Tupac to represent himself, the counterpoint is
            unavoidable: the film by definition seeks to organize and make sense
            of chaos. On the surface, this is a matter of correspondence: when
            he speaks of his friend Jada Pinkett, and you see images of them
            together; he describes his experiences on a particular movie set or
            at high school in Baltimore, and you see matching photos and
            footage. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            beneath the surface, this sense-making also has to do with
            extrapolation and education -- granting Tupac yet another chance to
            speak his mind, indict injustice, and urge action. The film extols
            Pac's skills and virtues, certainly, and to that end, it includes
            brief clips of easy targets Dan Quayle, C. Delores Tucker, and
            Calvin Butts, almost as comic relief (with a shot of the bulldozer
            crushing cds, as if that's been forgotten), as they look so silly
            now. Tupac himself was painfully aware of political and material
            oppressions, and those afflicting many millions more. The film
            retells some of his most famous run-ins with his &quot;number one
            enemy,&quot; the police (his beating in Oakland, his arrest for
            assaulting the Hughes brothers, his shooting in New York, his
            conviction on sexual abuse charges and 11-month stint in a New York
            State prison), revealing his take on each episode in a series of
            interview snippets, with Tabitha Soren, Arsenio, and a youthful but
            still somber Ed Gordon. &quot;My fans go to jail,&quot; he observes,
            &quot;just like me.&quot;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            movie alternates between news footage and home movies, still photos
            and his own carefully maintained notebooks, music videos
            (&quot;Brenda Got a Baby,&quot; &quot;California Love&quot;) and
            film scenes: Tupac as Bishop in <i>Juice</i>, Lucky in <i>Poetic
            Justice</i>, Birdie in <i>Above the Rim</i> (he and Marlon Wayans
            have a good laugh over Wayans' name in the film -- Boogaloo -- as
            this must have been some screenwriter's idea of what a black baller
            would be called), and Spoon in <i>Gridlock'd</i>. Even in this brief
            career, he demonstrates remarkable range and changes across roles.
            Lazin uses still shots that lift and shift, animated as if to
            emulate the vivacity and instability of history -- you can't hold it
            down. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Just
            so, Tupac's self-descriptions reveal his understanding of cultural
            and political shifts, as well as his evolving efforts to express
            ideas and make appeals. He describes, for example, his decisions to
            attend &quot;dirty parties&quot; even after he became a celebrity,
            as these were where he might maintain his sanity, apart from the
            noise of privilege. As well, he explains repeatedly, as he did
            during his lifetime, his understanding of thug life, as concept,
            practice, and ethos. &quot;I don't understand why America doesn't
            understand thug life,&quot; he says, &quot;America <i>is</i> thug
            life. What makes me saying, 'I don't give a f*ck' different than
            Patrick Henry saying, 'Give me liberty or give me death'? What makes
            my freedom less worth fighting for than Bosnians or whoever they
            want to fight for this year?&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Lazin's
            movie shows Tupac's rudeness as much as his wisdom, his poetry and
            frustration. By turns elegiac, inventive, and contemplative, the
            film shows you what you've seen before, but in a form that insists
            on complexity rather than definition. <o:p>
