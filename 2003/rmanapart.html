            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>,
            4 April 2003</i></font>
            <p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="5">Turbulencia</font><font size="2">&nbsp;</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700">
			<font size="2">Plots don't come more worn out than this one. Ex-L.A. 
			banger and current undercover DEA agent Sean (Vin Diesel) takes down 
			the biggest dealer in Mexico (you know he's wicked because he's 
			introduced dancing with a slithery girl in an underground club). 
			Sean's first words following this difficult bust (he literally runs 
			down the villain's car on foot) are a request for time to see his 
			wife. Can you guess what will happen next? </font></span></p>
			<p><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">A Man Apart</font></span></i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
			isn't much for suspense. Following a few aren't-they-great-friends 
			party scenes and dreamy sunset-salsa-dancing shots, cartel henchmen 
			arrive at Sean's gorgeous beachfront home, shadows in the window, 
			large weapons drawn. Before you can say <i>Mad Max</i>, or <i>Lethal 
			Weapon</i>, or maybe <i>Hard To Kill</i>, they've shot up Sean's 
			exquisite wife (Jacqueline Obradors). </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">It's sad that 
			the wife is dead, of course. More painful is the death scene per se, 
			as Vin Diesel has to play something approximating tragedy: he 
			cradles her bloodied face, mumbles on his cell phone to a 911 
			operator, and cries, all at the same time. Ouch. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The rest of the 
			film -- originally slated to open in November 2002 --concerns Sean's 
			vengeance plot, pedestrian in its conception (written by Christian 
			Gudegast and Paul Scheuring), and darkly operatic in its execution. 
			Director F. Gary Gray knows how to convey drama through composition, 
			as evidenced by his terrific work on <i>Set It Off</i>, <i>The 
			Negotiator</i>, and the splendid video for OutKast's &quot;Ms. Jackson.&quot; 
			Here, he has his work cut out for him. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Among the 
			hurdles: making Sean, whose plot path is so clearly marked from the 
			start, even remotely compelling. Toward this end, he comes equipped 
			with a nominal support system, in his DEA &quot;family,&quot; as well as his 
			longtime partner (in banging and policing), Demetrius, a.k.a. D (Larenz 
			Tate). These male bonds grant Sean a standard means to vent: he'll 
			get angry at his captain (Steve Eastin) and he'll mourn with his 
			partner, as D holds his head and says, &quot;I got you, I got you.&quot;
			</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">This is about 
			the extent of the guys' articulation of their &quot;feelings.&quot; For the 
			most part, Sean's internal states are revealed through a mundane 
			voiceover, rowdy action scenes, and occasional close-ups of his 
			ravaged, increasingly scruffy face, as he downs little airplane 
			bottles of liquor and smokes endless cigarettes. A mournful 
			soundtrack underlines his grief in these moments, as he gazes on his 
			home, still broken and bound with police tape, even after his own 
			gunshot wounds have healed (which suggests weeks if not months have 
			passed). Through the still open glass doors, pocked with bullet 
			holes, you see the remains of the party. Sean says he can't stand to 
			go inside, so apparently, he lives on the porch. Lucky it doesn't 
			rain much in southern California.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The initial 
			focus of Sean's wrath is, of course, the now incarcerated cartel 
			boss, Memo Lucero (Geno Silva). For reasons unknowable, he's allowed 
			access to his sworn enemy in prison, repeatedly. Unsurprisingly, 
			Lucero insists he's not responsible for the hit, that indeed, 
			there's a new sheriff in town, called &quot;El Diablo.&quot; Mmm-hmmm. Sean 
			buys this story, and heads off into the fray, his voiceover 
			informing us that in order to get guys at the top of the drug trade, 
			&quot;you have to work your way up from the bottom.&quot; This ensures that he 
			and his team -- namely, D and their buddy from banger days, Big Sexy 
			(George Sharperson) -- will pursue a series of violent encounters 
			with assorted scuzzy characters, granting the film a familiar 
			boom-boom-boom trajectory.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Among these 
			characters is the redoubtable Pomona Joe (Jeff Kober), whom Sean 
			meets, needless to say, at a strip club. Undercover as a heroin 
			dealer with &quot;major weight&quot; to move, Sean plays cool until he tells a 
			half-naked girl to &quot;get the f*ck off my lap.&quot; Here, Joe surmises 
			that maybe Sean's a &quot;faggot,&quot; at which point Mr. Tough Guy 
			Undercover gets stupid and nearly blows the transaction. </font>
			</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">This bad 
			behavior is not enough to clue his teammates that Sean's &quot;on the 
			edge,&quot; though his haunted face and red eyes certainly suggest this 
			much. And so, a few scenes later, Sean wreaks havoc during a 
			supposed buy. When the mark boasts that he was the one assigned to 
			shoot some DEA agent's &quot;stupid bitch wife,&quot; Sean beats him to death, 
			ferociously, initiating a horrific shootout that leaves three agents 
			and several bad guys dead -- a calamity emphasized by the camera 
			craning out to show the pavement mural on which they all stand, a 
			huge, colorful face. Surrounded by bodies, Sean stands in an eye's 
			pupil, at once target and shooter, victim and psycho killer. </font>
			</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Such 
			extravagant imagery makes the film look more exciting than it is. 
			The human equivalent of this hyperbole is Timothy Olyphant's 
			Hollywood Jack. Ostensibly the owner of a Beverly Hills tanning 
			salon, Jack is really a dealer and remarkably ruthless killer 
			(&quot;remarkably&quot; even in this crowd). Especially helpful to the film, 
			Jack has style to burn. He first appears in a slick powder-blue 
			ensemble, right down to his blue-suede loafers, featured in 
			portentous close-up as he steps from his silver Porsche. </font>
			</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Jack brings a 
			bit of welcome speed and pizzazz to the proceedings, fragments of 
			buzzy antidote to Sean's ponderous sense of purpose. When Sean 
			announces that he's been fingered by a junkie named Overdose (Malieek 
			Straughter), Jack waits a perfect beat before he sniggers, &quot;There's 
			a human being called Overdose?&quot; Or again, when he's getting off a 
			plane and must explain the results of a severe beating (courtesy of 
			Sean) to his Mexican connections, Jack shrugs and says, &quot;Turbulencia!&quot;
			</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Sean doesn't 
			get these jokes. He's so wrapped up in his blood frenzy that he 
			can't see the absurdity of the world into which he's plunged so 
			wholeheartedly. This makes him too familiar, a cop who can only 
			clean up the underworld by turning as damned and dirty as the 
			culprits he pursues. Indeed, Lucero, who would know, tells him he 
			must become &quot;a monster.&quot; And so, when Sean's suspended (so he can 
			take &quot;time to grieve&quot;), he doesn't go much for that idea, and shows 
			up at D's door, insisting that he's put together a squad from the 
			neighborhood. D is stunned; with a wife and child of his own, he's 
			got reservations about running off into battle with a crazy man.
			</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">No matter. Sean 
			deems his cause &quot;just,&quot; even if it's obviously delusional to 
			everyone else. And that rage for justice is the most tedious aspect 
			of <i>A Man Apart</i>. While it occasionally suggests that maybe 
			Sean's not the healthiest of rampagers, it mostly just tries to stay 
			out of his way. </font></span></td>
