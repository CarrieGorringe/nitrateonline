            Martin Lawrence appeared on Conan O'Brien to promote his new movie, <i>National
            Security</i>, the interview focused on what you already know about
            Martin Lawrence. His ears stick out, he wears designer clothes, and
            he was in a coma three years ago. On the first point, Lawrence
            underlined that it has never affected his appeal for the ladies. On
            the last, he said he's stopped smoking weed, because &quot;It's not
            for me.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">When
            the time came to talk about <i>National Security</i>, they showed
            the obligatory clip: Lawrence and co-star Steve Zahn appear on
            screen, playing L.A. cops. When they mistakenly allow a car thief to
            drive off in a rich lady's Jaguar, Lawrence unveils his &quot;backup
            plan&quot;: he shoots the car until it blows up. The fiery explosion
            is vintage cop-buddy-action-comedy, all orange and big and exciting.
            In the foreground, Lawrence and Zahn jump and contort. The studio
            audience applauds on cue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">That's
            about all you need to know about <i>National Security</i>. And, for
            that matter, Martin Lawrence's career to date. From his minute in <i>Do
            the Right Thing</i> and long run on <i>Martin</i> to his be-sequeled
            buddydom with Will Smith to his $20,000,000 paycheck for the
            upcoming <i>Blue Streak 2</i>, Lawrence has made a fine living off
            his terrifically mobile features. His basic joke is always the same:
            he calls out racial injustice, even strikes an occasional aggressive
            pose, but remains resolutely nonthreatening (for a white audience
            who might otherwise take such scolding seriously), because his ears
            stick out and his face goes comically paroxysmal. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            allows for more of the same. Earl (Lawrence) is introduced trying to
            pass a series of L.A. police academy tests. When his enthusiastic
            displays of shooting, cart-wheeling, and driving go wrong and, most
            importantly, enrage his instructor, Earl's escorted off the academy
            campus by a couple of burly uniforms. Mad at the bum-rush, he throws
            up his karate-choppy hands and makes faces: &quot;I got skills, ya
            bitches!&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">At
            that moment, Earl meets his white buddy-to-be. Hank (Zahn) has been
            established previously as Earl's match -- angry, traumatized (by the
            recent death of his partner [Timothy Busfield, on screen for about
            two minutes]), and spastic-faced. Hank catches Earl trying to get
            his keys out of his own car and mistakes him for a car thief. Their
            verbal exchange escalates to awkward wrestling, just as a
            &quot;big-ass bumblebee&quot; buzzes by. Being allergic, Earl
            panics, and when Hank swats at the bee with his stick, a helpful
            bystander videotapes them. The resulting &quot;evidence&quot;
            resembles the Rodney King beating. Hank is kicked off the force and
            sent to prison for six months. From now on, he holds a grudge
            against Earl, indicated by his permanent scrunch-face. <o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Long
            story (relatively) short: both Hank and Earl end up working as
            security guards, and both happen to be in the vicinity when Nash
            (Eric Roberts in tacky blond hair), the smuggler who killed Hank's
            partner, strikes again. In order that the feuding buddies-to-be
            might join forces, Nash helpfully calls Earl a &quot;monkey&quot;
            (as in, &quot;Somebody shoot that monkey!&quot;). Now that the
            pursuit of justice is suitably &quot;personal&quot; for both
            partners, the movie can stumble on through to its end, one
            flamboyant car chase and bruising stunt after another. <o:p>

            (written by the same team who brought you the woeful <i>I Spy</i>,
            Jay Scherick and David Ronn) endeavors to complicate the standard
            black-white buddy dynamic, or at least to draw attention to its
            conventions and presumptions. They exchange witty dialogue (Hank:
            &quot;Do you know how to hotwire a car?&quot; Earl: &quot;Why?
            Because I'm black?&quot;), bond as they spend seriously smelly time
            on a garbage barge, and suffer repeated beat downs by the bad guys.
            As always in interracial buddy films, such moments lead to eventual
            mutual understanding, not to mention supposedly riotous physical
            abuses. And, true to formula, they must decide which of their cop
            superiors -- Detective McDuff (Colm Feore) or Lieutenant Washington
            (Bill Duke) -- is the villain. Gee, do you think they'll figure it
            out in time? <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Once
            they're on the run from the cops as well as the smugglers, the
            buddies find they only have one another as confidants. This leads to
            one of those stock stakeout rooftop conversations where one partner
            confesses his troubles and the other commiserates, while a plinky
            guitar sounds in the background. Poor Hank. Not only has the
            bumblebee encounter cost him his job and six months of his life,
            he's also lost his girlfriend, Denise (Robinne Lee), who, because
            she's black, can't accept that he's beaten a black man. Earl is
            aghast at such suffering: &quot;You know what you are Hank?&quot; he
            observes, by way of consolation. &quot;You're a black man.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">It's
            a good line, especially when you're looking at Steve Zahn's
            exceedingly pale face, which is, for a minute, relaxing its scrunch
            in recognition of this new brotherhood. That is, while it's a
            ridiculous thing for Earl to say, it's also an effective ground for
            these guys to bond -- to see themselves as alike, mirrored in their
            equal oppression, depression, abandonment, and hopelessness. The
            difference between them is this: Earl is used to being a black man,
            and so he expects the world of hurt it entails. For Hank, it's a
            novel and devastating experience, simultaneously exciting (buddy
            Earl has finally accepted him) and horrifying (what if he has to
            face these obstacles forever?). It's hard to be a black man,
            especially when you're white. <o:p>
