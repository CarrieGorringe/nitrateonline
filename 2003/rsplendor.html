            <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="5">An
            interior life <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Is
            there a finer actor on the planet than Hope Davis? She makes every
            role her own as she becomes someone wholly new. From the doomed
            Brooke in <i>Arlington Road</i> (1999) to the fractious Dana in <i>The
            Secret Lives of Dentists</i> (2003), wistful Erin in <i>Next Stop
            Wonderland</i> (1998) to pitch-perfectly defiant Jeannie Schmidt in <i>About
            Schmidt</i> (2002), Davis shows a range so subtle and complex that
            makes her every performance a beauty, even when the films around her
            are not. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">As
            Joyce Brabner, Davis is again superb, and nearly unrecognizable
            behind big horn-rimmed glasses and black bangs. Joyce first appears
            in <i>American Splendor</i>, working in a Delaware comic book store
            and teaching prisoners to write (or, as she puts it, she's
            &quot;trying to help them build an interior life&quot;). From her
            first moments on screen, Joyce walks a weird, thin line, between
            practical-minded and loopy, fanatically insecure and completely
            generous, shrewd and naïve. In the flesh -- in Davis' flesh, and
            even in her own, as she appears briefly in the film -- Joyce at
            first resembles a comic character, as if she's been conjured by her
            husband, cranky cult comic-book<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>writer Harvey Pekar (Paul Giamatti).&nbsp;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">She
            becomes increasingly complex, less a function of his perspective
            (and the film that takes that perspective) and more her own
            creature, pushing beyond his needs and desires, into her own. This
            even as she is, as she says, &quot;a notorious reformer.&quot; She
            has her work cut out for her, as the first part of the film
            establishes Harvey's general situation, from the 1950s through 1976,
            when the first edition of the autobiographical <i>American Splendor</i>
            comics was published. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Written
            by Harvey and illustrated by his artist friends, <i>American
            Splendor</i> details the difficulties of everyday life, including
            his filing job at the Cleveland Veteran's Administration hospital,
            his coworkers -- nerdy, jelly-bean-loving devout Catholic Toby
            (Judah Friedlander) and grumpy boss Boats (Earl Billings) -- his
            love of jazz 78s and his friendship with Robert Crumb (James
            Urbaniak), who worked briefly as a commercial artist at a Cleveland
            greeting card company during the 1960s. He's also unspeakably
            lonely: &quot;Sometimes,&quot; he observes, &quot;I'd feel a body
            next to me like an amputee feels a phantom limb.&quot;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">By
            the time Joyce comes to Cleveland for their first date, you've seen
            enough of Harvey's &quot;grumpy guy&quot; demeanor to not be
            surprised by his greeting at the train station: he announces
            &quot;right off the bat&quot; that he's had a vasectomy. From here,
            he takes her to a chain restaurant, then to his apartment. He
            apologizes for his sloppiness, they chat, and she shuffles to the
            bathroom to throw up. He stands on the other side of the door, sorry
            that he doesn't have tea to offer her. Whereupon they agree, they
            &quot;should just dump the whole courtship thing and just get
            married.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Appropriately,
            given its irascible subject, Shari Springer Berman and Robert
            Pulcini's movie is shrewdly unwieldy, dipping in and out of Harvey's
            narration and scenes where he's played flawlessly by Giamatti, comic
            panels that come to animated life, and pomo pullbacks. Here, for
            instance, the-real-Pekar appears talking head-style to discuss the
            strangeness of participating in a film about his life and art, or
            when the camera shows that the scene previous has been shot on a set
            (itself artificial, too white and clean), where Friedlander and
            Giamatti step out of character, as the real Radloff and Pekar
            discuss jellybean flavors. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Perhaps
            most striking among these multi-layered moments are those featuring
            Pekar's fabled 1980s' spots on <i>Late Night with David Letterman</i>.
            For these, the film incorporates old NBC footage (with the real
            Pekar and the real Letterman), which Joyce watches from the green
            room (she's progressively more unhappy with what she sees as
            Harvey's mistreatment, and moves on to her own interests), hawking
            the Harvey ragdolls she's made. Then Giamatti as Pekar comes
            backstage to ask Joyce what she thinks. After a few runs at this
            structure, the movie reaches Pekar's final appearance on the show in
            1994 -- when he famously disparaged NBC, GE, and Letterman for being
            a corporate shill. The episode never aired, and the movie runs it as
            a reenactment, a curiously jarring effect, as the other interviews
            have not been. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">This
            jarringness makes its own point, namely that Pekar's
            self-performance, however discordant, is perpetual. Indeed, the film
            suggests, everyone performs a self (or selves), whether on TV talk
            shows, on the job or at home, in comic book panels or movies.
            &quot;Different artists draw me all kinds of ways,&quot; says Pekar
            during one of his direct addresses to the camera. &quot;But I'm also
            a real guy.&quot; The question here is how that &quot;real&quot; guy
            might possibly be interpreted (perceived or drawn) by anyone,
            including himself. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">And
            if such interpretation is part and parcel of art -- popular and
            underground, if there's a difference once a film about that
            underground wins prizes at Sundance and Cannes -- then the question
            might shift, to how that real guy might be sold and bought. While <i>American
            Splendor</i>'s Harvey complains vigorously about the
            commercialization of art (this supposedly initiates his last
            Letterman rant), he is, of course, taking advantage of his own
            celebrity in order to have a forum for complaining. He rails against
            popular culture generally, and associates like Toby specifically --
            when Toby, made famous in Pekar's comics, appears in a self-spoof
            for MTV, then reenacted for the movie, the representational circle
            seems painfully complete, or at least worn out. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">As
            clever and slippery as these moments are, illustrating that the
            &quot;real&quot; Pekar is as elusive as any performance of Pekar,
            they don't offer any more insight into that elusiveness than those
            featuring Pekar and Joyce. As they spar and care for one another, it
            becomes clear that &quot;truth&quot; is a malleable, exploitable,
            and utterly necessary fiction.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">That
            this idea -- the sometimes surprising ways that truth changes even
            as you think you're looking at it -- emerges most forcefully in a
            poignant turn of events is at once trite and fitting. So furiously
            determined to avoid dramatic clichés, to stay focused on mundane
            minutiae, poor Pekar has his life changed in a totally dramatic way.
            On learning that he has testicular cancer, he's stricken:
            &quot;Life,&quot; he sighs, &quot;seemed so sad and so sweet and so
            hard to let go of in the end.&quot; As much as he's disposed to give
            up, Joyce flies into action, arguing, researching, fighting back.
            He's swept along, so that his routine flies into &quot;total
            chaos.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">To
            make their turmoil even vaguely coherent, he and Joyce narrate it,
            in a ravishingly private-made-public graphic novel, <i>Our Cancer
            Year</i>. The illustrator who works with them happens to have a
            daughter, Danielle (Madylin Sweeten), with whom Joyce forms a
            singular bond. This may be the most improbable shift of all, that
            Pekar finds himself -- or better, his several selves -- in those who
            love him. For a dour, cynical guy, he does okay: even this corniness
            works out, because his primary mirror is the undefeatable Joyce by
            way of Hope Davis. <o:p>
