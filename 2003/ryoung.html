            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>, 11 April 2003</i></font><p>
			<p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Director Catherine Jelski's 
			debut feature, &quot;discovered&quot; at the twenty-fifth Toronto Film 
			Festival back in 2000, is getting a belated release this month 
			through Indican Pictures. Don't blame the delay on 9-11, the War in 
			Iraq, or all those celebrity couple break-ups; it's going to be a 
			hard sell no matter when you get this film into the marketplace. 
			This actors' tour-de-force over content is a raw study of the young 
			and the disillusioned among L.A.'s rich upper crust. Early Neil 
			LaBute it ain't.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The minimalist day-in-the-life 
			story allows you an eighty-seven-minute visit with the snobbish 
			Charlie Foxx, played with brutish vulgarity by Devon Gummersall (<i>My 
			So-Called Life</i>). He spends his days in the family's posh 
			California home, soaking up the chlorine in the pool, sipping 
			bottomless margaritas, chain-smoking, maxing out his credit cards, 
			and otherwise carousing with other like-minded, insecure brats. His 
			parental units are absent: father Sebestyen is a famous commercials 
			director somewhere on the road between La-La-Land and London, while 
			mom's been out of the family picture since Charlie was twelve. 
			There's a decade of familial angst that has undoubtedly hoisted much 
			of the anger on rich, pretty Charlie. Although mom sends back 
			occasional photos from Vermont or wherever, twenty-three-year-old 
			sonny boy begrudgingly leaves her mail unopened. Simon Templeman 
			literally phones in his part as the distant dad.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Charlie's part-time, sleep-in 
			exotic girlfriend Paloma (Arly Jover) -- by day a Hollywood 
			production coordinator, by night (and day) wondering what the heck 
			she's doing with this rotten schmoe -- deserves a better man and a 
			car that works. I continually asked myself, &quot;Will audiences pay to 
			see such an immature and off-base creature, with oodles of money, 
			constantly put down the entire human race, save himself and best bud 
			Joe (Eion Bailey), a even more freakish, violent imitation of 
			himself?&quot; (No.) Both &quot;men&quot; (each actually belongs to a much lower 
			species) have a nasty knack for the steady dirty dig, particularly 
			Joe -- no doubt the reason he can't maintain a relationship -- and 
			even puts it to Paloma, asking Charlie to &quot;control his woman.&quot;</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jelski plays up the characters at 
			the expense of nearly any story development (she also wrote the 
			script, inspired by the stage play <i>Magic Afternoon</i> by 
			Wolfgang Bauer), focusing on the two male peas in their pod. Charlie 
			rants about the incompetents around him. A cameraman shooting some 
			out-of-focus footage. His mother. And &quot;stupid&quot; Paloma herself. A 
			third of the way in she's had enough and splits, allowing for the 
			leggy entrance of light-haired model Cassandra (Leslie Bibb), a coke 
			whore who is Joe's squeeze for the day.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I'm a friend of Joe's,&quot; she 
			introduces herself to Charlie and Paloma. It seems Jelski has 
			written the Spaniard back into the script, when any sensible gal 
			(fictional or not) wouldn't have given either of these cads another 
			drop of spit. Anyway, Charlie, obviously awe-struck by the new 
			blonde in the house responds, half-jokingly and even semi-lustfully, 
			&quot;Sure you are.&quot;</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Within minutes, this turgid 
			microcosm seemingly unravels as Joe breaks Cassandra's nose, which 
			gives the passionless Charlie goosebumps for the &quot;love&quot; he sees 
			between the couple. But Charlie's all talk and no action, as Paloma 
			calls his bluff. &quot;I'm so sick of this,&quot; she mourns. We're all sick 
			of it, Paloma. Her idea of escape is through the front door; Charlie 
			sees it in the shower, with a blade cutting their wrists. Anyone 
			having stumbled through the film this far is heading for the red 
			exit sign.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Where's the next monkey wrench? 
			Well it arrives soon enough with a phone call from dad: mom's dead. 
			Fetal despair, more drugs and even more alcohol follow.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">You're not going to feel 
			enlightened by <i>The Young Unknowns</i> and, frankly, you'll 
			probably benefit by keeping them unknown from your film-going 
			pocketbook. There's a spiral-down atmosphere permeating the film and 
			its assorted crankheads and control freaks, overwhelming its ounce 
			of remorse (&quot;I known I'm an asshole. Forgive me.&quot;). <i>The Young 
			Unknowns</i> is so very R-rated soap opera, with a nod toward <i>
			Clockwork Orange</i>. It's one big, ugly party monster. Speaking for 
			the rest of us wallflowers, I'd sit this one out.</font></td>
