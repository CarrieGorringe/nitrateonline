			<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Slowly, the rider drops into the

			<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I've had the most 
			terrible time the last few weeks trying to write about the movie <i>
			Cowboy Up</i>, which, after much wrangling, has recently and finally 
			bowed on home video. It's not a bad movie; in fact, it's rather good 
			for the most part, and in some ways better than a lot of the stuff 
			I've seen thrown onto theatrical screens during the past year and 
			thereby provoking a rather scabrous year-end article by Peter 
			Travers in <i>Rolling Stone</i>. Even though most of the action 
			takes place in the world of professional rodeo, <i>Cowboy Up</i>, 
			which has its flaws, hardly qualifies as part of the steaming pile 
			of do-do that Travers writes about. I've had trouble jotting off a 
			few hundred words to extol it one way or the other. Leave us first 
			look at the facts:</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Hank (Kiefer 
			Sutherland) and Ely (Marcus Thomas) are grown brothers whose father, 
			Reid Braxton (Pete Postlethwaite), was a champion competition 
			bull-rider. They've both followed his lead into the circuit, but 
			Hank abandoned being a bull-rider to become a &quot;bull-fighter&quot;, i.e. 
			the guys in rodeo clown makeup whose job it is to prance in front of 
			the bull once it's released from its pen into the arena and distract 
			it, thus allowing the rider on its back to try and last out a full&nbsp; 
			eight seconds before throwing himself clear without the animal 
			turning on him. Ely becomes injured in just such a mishap, but the 
			impetuous youth goes right back into competition, and Hank becomes 
			conflicted because he does not want to dictate to Ely what he should 
			and should not do (their father, Reid, absented himself from the 
			family years before the boys even reached adolescence), and he can 
			also see that Ely has a genuine knack for the sport.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The film -- which 
			began life some time ago as <i>Ring of Fire</i>, and there were even 
			some preview trailers made to that extent (<i>Cowboy Up</i> comes 
			from a catchphrase Reid Braxton is supposed to have used and become 
			famous for) -- features performances from several actors who have 
			stayed-the-course over the years , and to good effect. Sutherland's 
			performance as Hank is some of the most genuine and thoroughly 
			realized acting I've seen him do in a long time (he made this 
			picture prior to his &quot;comeback&quot; in the T.V. series <i>24</i>), and 
			it epitomizes a character who has come to believe that it's better 
			to be sensible and alert in life rather than battle against it, to 
			ultimately counterproductive effect: his father, Reid, believed that 
			the only way he could win in the arena was by &quot;fighting&quot; the bull 
			from the outset, and by continuing to fight every next step of the 
			way. (We see where it's gotten him, too -- a trailer behind a 
			produce company building in Las Vegas, where Ely pays him a visit 
			and Reid doesn't realize that he's talking to his own son.) The film 
			also has two portrayals of female characters who are strong and 
			speak their minds but are no less sensitive or appealing because of 
			it, Melinda Dillon as Hank and Ely's mother, who heads the family's 
			ranch in rural California (where Hank hopes to, eventually, spend 
			all his time raising bulls for competition instead of facing them in 
			the arena), and, as Ely's girlfriend Connie, Molly Ringwald. This is 
			the performance that those of us who have been following her career 
			since first seeing her some twenty years ago have been hoping she 
			would give, one that combined her natural grace with the acting 
			potential that often lay, untapped, beneath the surface in so many 
			of her film appearances. One of the best things I've seen during the 
			past year is the scene where Connie lets Ely know, in no uncertain 
			terms, how she feels about the fact that he broke a promise he made 
			to her while on the road, then came back home and just expected her 
			to forgive him. Fat chance. You can see why he'd be a little 
			hesitant over making a commitment to her, but you also can't imagine 
			how he'd let a woman like this get away from him for a second. If 
			Xavier Koller, the Swiss-born director whose handling of this 
			picture is never anything less than well-observed and considered, 
			has to direct any or all of Molly Ringwald's next pictures, by all 
			means, let it be so.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">Daryl Hannah also 
			appears in the film, looking stunning, as a professional exhibition 
			rider, but the plotline involving her character is, through no fault 
			of hers, rather suddenly and abruptly abbreviated in the finished 
			film,&nbsp; and it hurts what is otherwise a perfectly good performance. 
			I wish I could say the same about Marcus Thomas, who plays Ely. 
			Looking like a more boyish version of Dwight Yoakum, Thomas, for 
			whatever reason -- nerves, lack of experience -- looks out of his 
			depth in what is a pivotal leading role, and the picture is somewhat 
			hampered as a result of it.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font size="2" face="Verdana">The film does 
			effectively capture a feel for the characters and the world they 
			live in, from the way the riders and rodeo participants prepare 
			before their turn in the arena, to the easy rapport of the Braxton 
			brothers and the almost pastoral ambience of their home life. (This 
			also brings up the question that Scout Foundas first posed last 
			September in <i>Variety</i> as to why movie studios figure they 
			should put their money and resources behind a deemed &quot;bankable&quot; 
			movie like <i>Stealing Harvard</i>&nbsp; while other more worthwhile 
			pictures languish, unseen and undistributed. Nia Vardalos' labor of 
			love, <i>My Big Fat Greek Wedding</i>, was still playing in theaters 
			after most of last summer's blockbusters had closed, and 
			word-of-mouth has spread like wildfire over Tom DeCillo's film <i>
			Double Whammy</i> since it premiered in the U.S. -- on home video -- 
			in December.) Which leaves us with the fact that <i>Cowboy Up</i> is 
			about, well, country. I have a horror of country music, an even 
			bigger horror of line dancing (which makes a brief, hackle-raising 
			appearance in one scene in the film). I've never particularly liked 
			Westerns (&quot;The Western is an infantile genre,&quot; John Simon wrote, 
			churlishly), which causes consternation among friends who happen to 
			think highly of John Ford pictures. (I've never even been able to 
			sit through <i>Hatari</i>!, Howard Hawks' African-set Western. 
			Sorry, Sean.) Perchance then, in the fullness of time, if I fail the 
			final judgment and the chips are stacked against me, I may be 
			consigned to the fiery pit where, to the sounds of Wanderin' Magooch 
			and his Texas Playboys singing such standards as &quot;My Baby Was a 
			Heifer (But My Wife's a Texas Rose)&quot;, I will have to spend eternity 
			chained to a bucking mechanical bull while having to swing a 
			ten-gallon hat in one hand and yell kai-yai-yippie-kai-yay. Either 
			that, or a multiplex where every screen is showing the 1979 remake 
			of <i>The Champ</i>.</font></td>
