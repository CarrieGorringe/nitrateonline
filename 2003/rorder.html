            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>You could practically hear
            people in the audience scratching their heads as the end credits for
            <i>The Order</i> came up: Huh? wot was THAT all about? And you
            absolutely couldn't blame them. Brian Helgeland's new movie, which
            he wrote and directed, bolts from the gate at the get-go and happily
            gallops off into the land of confusion, never to return.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Heath Ledger, wearing fashionably
            unshaven patches of beard about his face, and muttering most of his
            dialogue in a way which puts Harold Pinter's &quot;posh
            mumblers&quot; to shame, plays Father Alex, a Catholic priest
            belonging to an obscure order, the &quot;Carolinians,&quot; who are
            both scholars and charged with dealing with &quot;ghosts, demons,
            and all manner of the undead.&quot; He also still says Mass in
            Latin, because, he says, it was the way he was taught (despite the
            fact that Vatican II did away with all that in the 1960s). He and
            another &quot;Carolinian,&quot; Thomas (Mark Addy), hie themselves
            to Rome when a third member of their order turns up dead, and their
            thrilling adventures include running into Peter Weller, playing a
            cardinal who smokes cigarettes he takes out of a black cigarette
            case trimmed with red; two children, a boy and a girl, whom Alex
            describes as, &quot;Orphans. Of what, I don't know.&quot;; some sort
            of subterranean anti-Vatican which looks like the Kit Kat Klub in
            Sam Mendes' production of <i>Cabaret</i> (you half-expect Alan
            Cumming to come whirling in at any minute), and where the
            door-person is a bald man wearing a silver lame evening gown; and a
            gentleman named William Eden (Benno Fürmann), whom Alex spends a
            lot of time palling around with despite the fact that, if his
            brother is supposed to have helped Michelangelo construct the
            Vatican, he would have to be around 500 years old.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mr. Eden is a professional
            &quot;sin eater,&quot; able to alleviate people of their sins before
            dying if for some reason they are not able to make a final
            confession. He and Father Alex engage in a conversation in
            conundrums about beauty and truth, and fly around on Eden's private
            jet, but Alex never seems to notice that this all looks an awful lot
            like the Temptation in the Desert from the Gospels (so much for
            being a scholar). There's also Mara, played by Shannyn Sossamon with
            short black hair and the look of an undernourished fashion model --
            she tags along with Alex despite the fact that she once tried to
            kill him. (Police Officer (to Alex, referring to his notes):
            &quot;She tried to shoot you at an 'exercise class'?&quot; Alex:
            &quot;No, at an 'ex-or-cism'.&quot;) She introduces herself by
            saying, &quot;The nightingales are gone.,&quot; then states to Alex
            that &quot;it's you and me until the wheels fall off.&quot; After
            they, inevitably, make love (so much for being a priest), he gives
            her a bouquet of sunflowers, a bloom Mara describes as being God's
            &quot;brilliant mistake.&quot; All you can do is stare at this movie
            in disbelief. One would say that the characters, in order to get
            themselves into some of the fixes they get into in this movie, must
            be dumber than dirt, except that you'd have to be able to tell just
            what it is they are doing in the first place. This is a film where
            people say, in all seriousness, &quot;I am the conductor of the
            night train.&quot; Peter Weller, with his close-close cropped hair,
            looks somewhat like a bowling pin. And, at one point, a knife fight
            breaks out in the middle of a cavernous, ornate basilica.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The reason given for the movie
            being held-up from its original January release date was because the
            visual effects for the &quot;sin-eating&quot; episodes looked like
            &quot;calamari.&quot; They no longer look like calamari, but the
            rest of the film is in need of repairs.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
