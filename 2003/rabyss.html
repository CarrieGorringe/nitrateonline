            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>,
            4 April 2003</i></font><p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">James &quot;King of the World&quot; Cameron 
			is back on the big, big, big screen (i.e., wider, higher, deeper) 
			with his visually overwhelming, large-format 3-D IMAX presentation
			<i>Ghosts of the Abyss</i>, an &quot;unscripted&quot; documentary that takes 
			us miles down in the Atlantic for a close-up glimpse of the wreck 
			that was once the glorious Titanic. That ghost-filled sea queen has 
			received the brunt of his attention for many years, particularly in 
			one helluva blockbuster, Academy Award winning film. You remember 
			that one, don'tcha? With Bill Paxton, one of the stars of Cameron's 
			1997 epic, a brainy group of technogeeks get to play with some 
			mighty impressive toys that allow the rest of us to briefly 
			(sixty-one minutes) marvel at one of the twentieth century's 
			greatest industrial undertakings and saddest moments.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The unfortunate part of this $13 
			million production (chump change compared to its theatrical cousin) 
			is that you may go cross-eyed watching it. Or toss your lunch. There 
			was a pre-screening announcement by a flight attendant, er, I mean 
			an employee of the Maryland Science Center in Baltimore, where the 
			film opens April 11, warning of possible side effects from this 
			&quot;unique projection technology,&quot; including nausea and/or dizziness. I 
			had a vision she was motioning her hands skyward toward the side and 
			back exits for quick escape in the event of a crash. Then I checked 
			under my seat. There was no floatation device under it, or oxygen 
			mask overhead. The screening letter neglected to suggest I bring 
			along Dramamine.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In watching this digital 
			three-dimensional documentary, all viewers must wear glasses with 
			polarized lens. The naked eye will see horizontally overlapping 
			images on the screen. These cinematic phantoms, when properly viewed 
			through the slightly oversized polarized lens (they easily cover any 
			normal prescription spectacles) push the images out from the screen, 
			creating the 3-D illusion. The good news is that the glasses, made 
			of tempered plastic, are imported from Italy (whoa!). The bad news 
			is that no matter how you don them, those audience members 
			positioned close to the mammoth, multi-storied screen (hence the MAX 
			in the IMAX) will become disoriented when watching certain images, 
			particularly those pushed up to your face. Of course, the 3-D 
			impression can provide for some eerie trick photography, say of a 
			submersible's exterior claw mechanism snapping at your face. 
			Conversely, there are more than a few moments where <i>Ghosts of the 
			Abyss</i> will overload your brain when forcing the added 
			dimensional perspective. I was watching the film from half-way back 
			and even that was a chore. I recommend heading back as far as your 
			feet can take you. You'll be that much closer to the exit, too.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Of course, when it works -- and 
			it's a 50/50 proposition -- it's a marvel to watch. I particularly 
			liked the deep ocean background flaked with plankton, overlaid with 
			several inserts floating on multiple planes. There are quite a few 
			imaginative touches, particularly the juxtaposition between 
			old-fashioned stereopticon slides of the mighty ship and digital 
			recreations of the behemoth.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Basically starting from the bottom 
			of the technological ladder, Cameron, with his brother, Michael, an 
			engineer, took several years crafting two small cutting-edge 
			underwater bots, amusingly nicknamed Jake and Elwood, after the 
			characters made infamous by John Belushi and Dan Aykroyd and 
			collectively known as The Blues Brothers. (Otherwise the levity is 
			kept to a minimum.) By the time the excursion started in August 
			2001, the two small gadgets, attached to two Russian Academy of 
			Sciences submersibles by lengthy, but lightweight, fiber-optic 
			cabling, could maneuver through some of the more inaccessible areas 
			of the ship. The remote controls were handled by drivers in the two 
			mini-subs (one with Paxton, a nagging observer) that would spend 
			long days several miles below the ocean's surface, scouting out the 
			Titanic's hidden realm, including its elaborate dining room and 
			extensive engine area.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Paxton's &quot;role&quot; merely adds a 
			recognizable face. He's overanxious about the whole goings-on, 
			whether scripted or not. Perhaps the first part of the film's 
			tagline (&quot;Unscripted. Groundbreaking. Historic.&quot;) is more a 
			marketing disclaimer than a come-on, that you shouldn't expect much 
			in the way of story. During purple-lipped Paxton's initial, annoying 
			descent, he's constantly peppering the sub's Russian commander with 
			concerns about oxygen, batteries, etc. Cameron would have been 
			better off jettisoning this dialogue instead of the crew's carbon 
			dioxide. At other extended moments throughout the hour, the camera 
			watches Paxton from the ocean depth as the actor stares through the 
			porthole in perpetual &quot;gee whiz&quot; awe. Consummate filmmaker that he 
			is, Cameron could have tightened up the film considerably when 
			Paxton's doing his thing, especially allowing for its short length. 
			In contrast, the ghostly cast -- taken from the more than 1,500 
			passengers and crew who perished when the &quot;unsinkable&quot; sank -- 
			travel through time and dimension as digital ghosts overlaying the 
			rusting hulk and its CGI-restored original glory. Captain Edward 
			Smith, White Star Line Managing Director J. Bruce Ismay (who 
			occupied the ship's best suites), socialite Molly Brown, et al, 
			appear translucently in relation to ongoing revisionist historical 
			commentary based on discoveries show in the film. The only tension 
			derives from a segment in which Jake rescue's a battery-drained 
			Elwood from deep within the ocean liner.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like its subject's fateful April 
			voyage ninety-one years ago, <i>Ghosts of the Abyss</i> makes it 
			about two-thirds of the way to its port before sinking.</font></td>
