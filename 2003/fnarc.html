</font><font face="Verdana" size="5">Shades of Ray<br>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="4">Interview with Ray Liotta<br>
</font><i><font size="1" face="Verdana">interview by <a href="../kj.html" target="_top">KJ 
Doughton</a>, 10 January 2003</font></i></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">As Henry Oak, the seething 
human grizzly bear from <i>NARC</i>, Ray Liotta shoots, pistol-whips, and 
punches many of the film’s unlucky supporting characters. Some of the worst 
punishment is dealt out to Busta Rhymes and Richard Chevolleau, who play two 
drug-dealing thugs enduring a brutal interrogation from Liotta while shackled to 
chairs. </font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Circling his quarry like 
Roger Ebert closing in on a buffet table, Liotta hurls verbal and physical 
intimidation in the aggressive manner of Ted Nugent slinging arrows at a 
black-tail buck. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Reclining on a leather couch 
in a cavernous corner of Seattle’s Four Seasons Hotel, Liotta is sipping from a 
bowl of soup. Despite being weary from two straight days of fielding press 
questions, the New Jersey-born actor is more gregarious and welcoming than most 
of his high-strung onscreen characters. He’s dressed in black, a gold chain 
around his neck providing the wardrobe’s only hint of color. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The neutral clothes only 
accent his striking, blue eyes, which blaze with the same intensity they 
reflected in <i>Something Wild</i> and <i>Field of Dreams</i>. When amused or 
giggly, Liotta tilts his head forward and pushes out a mischievous, throaty 
snicker. Meanwhile, he’s lean and fit, a healthier, more upbeat shadow of <i>
NARC</i>’s mammoth crimefighter Oak.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I gained 25 pounds and used 
several movie tricks to look bigger,&quot; he reveals of the role, slurping down 
another spoonful of broth. &quot;I’m seen wearing a coat much of the time, which 
added a lot. I put makeup under my eyes to look tired and worn out. Shaved my 
hair to make it look thin. Even in the way I moved, I wanted to make him very 
self-assured and strong. After all, his name is <i>Oak</i>.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The resulting transformation 
is one of the most astonishing examples of onscreen shape-shifting since 
Liotta’s fellow accomplice in <i>Goodfellas</i>, Robert DeNiro, ballooned into a 
grotesque human whale for the final frames of <i>Raging Bull</i>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There’s more to Oaks than 
heft. He’s also a deeply conflicted crime fighter grieving the deaths of both 
his wife and his police partner. Like <i>Lethal Weapon</i>’s Martin Riggs, or 
John Travolta’s mourning agent in <i>Face-Off</i>, the character’s losses 
intensify his rage and focus on the job. However, don’t look for the slick, 
comic-book approach of directors John Woo or Richard Donner when <i>NARC</i>’s 
opening scenes flash from the screen. As its star is quick to point out, <i>NARC</i> 
instead embraces the herky-jerky, warts-and-all realism associated with such 
seventies classics as <i>The French Connection</i>, <i>Serpico</i>, and <i>The 
Onion Field</i>. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;When I talked to Joe 
Carnahan, the film’s director, I asked him how he wanted to shoot,&quot; explains 
Liotta. &quot;Joe said he was going for the rawness of seventies police films. ‘The 
French Connection’ was very cutting edge when it came out. Very brutal and very 
real. And it established a certain type of antihero, who wasn’t all good, and 
wasn’t all bad.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In contrast to Oaks’ angry 
Goliath is <i>NARC</i>’s other key character, the understated Nick Tellis (Jason 
Patric), who reluctantly returns to police work after being suspended from the 
force. Following his involvement in a harrowing, gory drug bust in which a 
pregnant woman is shot, Tellis nurses his emotional wounds at home, assisted by 
a loving wife and new baby. The family’s growing financial problems eventually 
motivate Tellis’ return to the narcotics trenches, after being offered his badge 
back.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At its core, <i>NARC</i> is a 
psychological thriller, following Oak and Tellis as they investigate the murder 
of another narcotics officer. Accented by hand-held camerawork and a washed out, 
faded color scheme reminiscent of <i>Traffic</i>, the film is a striking 
antidote to goofy, juvenile crime outings like <i>XXX</i>. With its gritty, 
minimalist production values, you could almost call it <i>The Blair Witch 
Precinct</i>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meanwhile, its tormented duo 
has more in common with the Popeye Doyles and Frank Serpicos of the world than 
they do with Vin Diesel. The complexity of its law enforcers distinguishes <i>
NARC</i> from other special effects dominated police films of recent years.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">During a key scene, Officer 
Oaks confides in new partner </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Tellis from the driver’s side 
of a parked patrol car, revealing how his wife’s death from cancer has impacted 
the cop’s police work. Without this great love to anchor him, Oak explains, he 
has become a more effective crime fighter.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I kinda figured that he had 
met his wife in junior high, and never touched anyone else once she died,&quot; 
explains Liotta. &quot;It all became about work, and the obsession about getting bad 
guys. That’s how he took out his anger. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;He became the first one in 
the door, and he didn’t care if he got shot or not. Losing his wife was 
devastating for this guy, but he wasn’t about to kill himself. He’d save that 
for the <i>other</i> guy.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The edges of Liotta’s thin 
lips raise into a grin as he says this, his head again tilting forward before 
another smart-aleck cackle escapes the actor’s mouth. His mannerisms are darkly 
charming, bringing to mind the comment made by Lorraine Bracco while playing his 
onscreen wife in <i>Goodfellas</i>. After his character beats a bullying 
neighbor boy to a pulp, she confesses of his sinister charisma, &quot;I had to admit 
– it turned me on.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like Tom Sizemore, Gary 
Oldman, and Dennis Hopper, Liotta has used this dark magnetism to play a 
smorgasbord of seedy, unsympathetic souls. The airborne, jet-stalking psycho 
from <i>Turbulence</i>. His crooked Man in Blue from <i>Unlawful Entry</i>. 
Melanie Griffith’s unstable boyfriend in <i>Something Wild</i>. When asked how 
he’d define such lowlifes, he’s quick to coin a term.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Combustible?&quot; Liotta offers 
with a barely audible sigh. Clearly, he’s been through this line of questioning 
before, and quickly makes reference to the lighter side of his acting resume.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I would like to think that I 
was good in <i>Dominick and Eugene</i>, <i>Corinna Corinna</i>, <i>Muppets from 
Space</i>, and <i>Operation Dumbo Drop</i>. For some reason, people are quick to 
cast me in villain roles. I also think that the bad guys stand out in peoples’ 
minds.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Asked if he stayed up nights 
rifling through vintage police films for acting inspiration prior to NARC’s 
filming, Liotta shakes his head.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;No, I didn’t use anything to 
shape the role. I don’t like to do that, because I don’t wanna subconsciously 
borrow from someone else. I wanna create my own stuff. I was certainly 
influenced by those kinds of movies. That’s why I wanted to do this. But the 
script was Joe’s take, and it’s my job to fulfill his vision. I didn’t rely on 
any past characters, though.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Alongside his onscreen work, 
Liotta is also associated with NARC as a producer. Having recently started his 
own production company, Tiara Blue Films, Liotta has three other films in 
pre-production, and an HBO television series on the way. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I just wanted to do more 
things on my own,&quot; he explains of Tiara Blue Films, also helmed by his wife, 
Michelle Grace, and Diane Nabatoff. &quot;I wanted to be more pro-active. As an 
actor, you often wait until someone gives you a script, and hope that they hire 
you.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;There was a period awhile 
back where I wasn’t too crazy about the scripts I was getting, and ‘NARC’ was 
the first one to come across our desk after the company was formed that we 
really liked.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meanwhile, video game 
aficionados can hear Liotta’s voice work while playing Play Station 2’s Vice 
City. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;It was something I’d never 
done before,&quot; he explains of the game. &quot;I like to spread my wings and try new 
things. It was fun.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">One thing Liotta doesn’t 
associate with fun is providing commentary on special edition DVD’s. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I don’t like that stuff,&quot; he 
confesses bluntly. &quot;I’ll do it every now and then for certain movies. I guess 
it’s good for students and people who wanna know, but you lose some sort of 
magic, by revealing all of the secrets.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Could we get out of here?&quot; 
Liotta suddenly requests, fanning the air with a hand. &quot;It’s getting too smoky.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Indeed, the Four Seasons 
lounge is quickly resembling one of the hazy, cigarette-filled gangster bars 
from <i>Goodfellas</i>, the Scorsese epic in which Liotta starred as Mafia 
kingpin Henry Hill. Finding a less cough-inducing table space in the hotel’s 
airy, vast lobby, Liotta explains his grass roots approach to promoting <i>NARC</i>.
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;’<i>NARC</i> is a special 
kind of movie, one that requires two people to tell two more people. I’m hoping 
that if we show it to enough people who like it, word will spread. It’s not your 
typical Hollywood story, and it’s told in a very realistic way.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Realistic, indeed. <i>NARC</i> 
pulls no punches as it guides viewers into the den of a disease-plagued junkie 
picking at his privates and begging for a hit of freebase. Later on, we follow 
the film’s brave protagonists as they stumble upon a bloated body floating in a 
bathtub, green with age.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Will audiences be ready for 
such uncompromising images? Liotta is optimistic&nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;It’s gonna be some people’s 
cup of tea, but won’t be for everyone. I heard a story once about ‘Goodfellas’ 
being screened, where a few people walked out. Marty (Scorsese) was there, and 
was asked about how he felt. He said, ‘Good. That means that they were effected. 
They were <i>moved</i>.’ </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;This movie is similar. It’s 
definitely raw and goes to the edge. If you prefer <i>Sweet Home Alabama</i> or
<i>My Big Fat Greek Wedding</i>, you may not get there. However, <i>NARC</i> is 
ultimately a thriller, and I think an audience will always be around for that 
kind of film.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Noticing a publicist 
approaching the table, Liotta checks his watch and stands up. &quot;Time to go?&quot; he 
asks her, preparing to answer yet another series of questions with yet another 
Seattle-area journalist. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Sorry,&quot; he explains 
apologetically. &quot;I’ve gotta do another interview, then get on a plane.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The rushed actor gives a 
quick, firm handshake. Then, like the ghost of Shoeless Joe Jackson vanishing 
into <i>Field of Dreams</i>’ Iowa cornfield, Ray Liotta vanishes from sight.
