            anyone who has ever listened to and marveled at the recordings of
            such groups as Cream, Lynryd Skynyrd, John Coltrane’s exiquisite <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Giant Steps</i>, The Allman Brothers, and anything from the vast output
            of Atlantic Records, there is one more name that should be part of
            their repertoire: Tom Dowd, the engineering genius who not only made
            it possible, but also definitive. Director Mark Moorman captures it
            all in his absorbing documentary, <i>Tom <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Dowd
            and the Language of Music</i></i>. Through interviews with Dowd,
            Atlantic Records’ founder Ahmet Ertegun, Jerry Wexler, Dickey
            Betts, Eric Clapton and others, Moorman creates a rich portrait of
            both the Columbia Unversity-trained physicist-turned-artist, and the
            history of the recording process itself. Beginning in 1947, Dowd was
            still faced with having to record directly to disc. Tiring of its
            limitations, and thanks to Dowd’s efforts, Atlantic Records was
            the first record company to have eight-track recording facilities by
            the mid-‘50s, no mean feat, since Dowd had to build the recording
            console from radio-station reject parts (prior to the 1960s, that
            was the only source of material). Moorman also carefully documents
            the life of a studio engineer during the 1950s: chaos. Dowd recounts
            how he had to record the Coasters at 4:00 p.m. one day, then work
            with Charlie Mingus at midnight. There was little time for leisurely
            retakes.<o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">When
            Atlantic Records moved away from jazz to go more mainstream in the
            1960s, Dowd took his skills and used them to record Aretha Franklin
            in her classic recordings at Muscle Shoals and Cream’s
            &quot;Disraeli Gears&quot; before moving on to Derek and the
            Domino’s &quot;Layla&quot; and all of the Allman Brothers’
            albums. While watching footage of Dowd at work, one is reminded of
            someone who worked by instinct, always knowing when the
            &quot;right&quot; moment had been reached. Eric Clapton summed up
            Dowd’s abilities thusly: &quot;Most of the success of our
            [Cream’s] early recording could be laid at his door.&quot; Dickey
            Betts described Dowd as a psychologist who would dig out of the
            performers everything that they were capable of doing. All who
            worked with him describe him as a man who put everyone at ease in
            his presence. Sadly, Tom Dowd died on October 27, 2002, but this
            documentary is a fitting memorial to this grand talent behind the
            scenes.<o:p>
