			</font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../kj.html" target="_top">KJ Doughton</a>, 25 April 2003</i></font><p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="5">Entertaining Surprises</font></p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">After his recent nice-guy turns 
			in such emotional films as <i>Moonlight Mile</i>, Dustin Hoffman 
			completely reinvents himself in <i>Confidence</i>. Playing the 
			film’s villain, a kinky crime boss known as The King, Hoffman 
			conjures forth the spirit of an older, wiser Ratzo Rizzo and leaves 
			a trail of slime that completely immobilizes his co-stars. When we 
			first meet this scruffy, oily little sewer rat, he is furiously 
			channel surfing between horse races, porno films, and CNN newscasts 
			on a wall of surrounding televisions. The King, it would seem, is 
			the natural-born poster child for attention deficit disorder.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It comes off as a bit strange, 
			then, that Hoffman emerges as the most human character in <i>
			Confidence</i>. A patchwork quilt equal parts <i>The Sting, The 
			Grifters, Ocean’s Eleven, Pulp Fiction, and Jackie Brown, </i>this 
			tale of con men, double crosses, and mind-bending plot twists 
			features suave Edward Burns as an ambitious grifter named Jake Vig. 
			The opening scenes illustrate what Vig does best, as he and a backup 
			team of crooked cops, pickpockets, and other swell folk swindle a 
			“mark” out of his cash-heavy briefcase. Unfortunately, the stolen 
			money belongs to The King, and Vig is understandably shaken when one 
			of his crew members is dispatched with a bullet to the head, in what 
			appears to be an act of retaliation. Will Vig be next on this angry 
			lowlife’s hit list?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Attempting to patch things up with 
			Hoffman’s underworld kingpin, Vig visits his nemesis face to face. 
			Creating his home base from an incredibly sleazy strip bar filled 
			with barely legal teenaged dancers, The King accepts Vig’s offer to 
			retrieve his money – and then some – through a complex bank loan 
			scam. This time around, Vig’s “mark” is big-fish banker Morgan Price 
			(Robert Forster), a longtime rival of The King.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Assisting Vig in his heist is a 
			motley crew that features Gordo (Paul Giamatti), a buddy with a weak 
			bladder who always seems en route to the nearest men’s room, and 
			Miles (Brian Van Holt), who often spends his share of the take on 
			strippers and lap dances. Lily (Rachel Weisz), a pickpocket whose 
			sexy-tough attitude finds favor with Vig, also joins the team, while 
			a couple of crooked L.A. cops (Donal Logue and Luis Guzman) round 
			out this den of flimflam masters.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To give away the detailed plot 
			blueprint of <i>Confidence </i>would be to spoil its many 
			entertaining surprises. Suffice it to say, the watertight wrap-up 
			seems to pass careful scrutiny, as persistent FBI agent Gunther 
			Butan (Any Garcia) enters the picture. As an intricate tangle of 
			loose ends, which are pleasingly tied together during its final 
			scene, the movie is admirable. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Unfortunately, the perpetrators of 
			such crafty swindles are a cynical, bloodless bunch that fails to 
			elicit much sympathy. When Vig and Lily talk a paternal jewelry 
			store owner out of a pair of earrings by convincing him that they 
			know his daughter, it’s meant to be cool and shrewd, but comes 
			across as merely mean-spirited. There’s ultimately more dimension 
			and humanity in Hoffman’s creepy entrepreneur than there is in Vig’s 
			antisocial hustler, an arrogant yuppie with Ken Doll looks and the 
			empty soul of a tailor’s dummy. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meanwhile, much of <i>Confidence</i>’s 
			dialogue falls all over itself trying to one-up Tarantino’s tart 
			tongue. Before the film’s first scene has ended, we’ve been privy to 
			such verbiage as, “I’ve gotta pinch a loaf,” “Don’t mess up the 
			hoop,” and “You’ve got a lot of sack.” Later on, two men compare 
			family dental plans from the front seats of a sedan, in much the 
			same way that Samuel Jackson and John Travolta waxed philosophical 
			about cross-cultural culinary cuisine in <i>Pulp Fiction</i>. Such 
			rapport was crisp ten years ago, but it sounds awfully familiar this 
			time around. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What isn’t familiar is how Dustin 
			Hoffman embodies the sleaziest role of his career. In what could 
			have been a criminal stereotype, Hoffman plays The King as a toothy 
			slob with the groping, fidgety hands of a chronic sex offender. In 
			one scene, he undoes two shirtbuttons, places Weisz’s hand on his 
			chest, and requests that she feel his heartbeat. Soon, he has his 
			own intrusive paw on her flesh, exclaiming, “My God, you’re 
			beautiful.” Later, he grabs Vig’s face with both of his hands, 
			demanding, “Don’t get me scared.” This tactile neediness is far more 
			disturbing and original than anything a typical bruiser thug could 
			have brought to the role. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As a self-assured exercise in style 
			and plotting, I suppose that <i>Confidence</i> works. Yet, there’s 
			something emotionally unsatisfying about its characters, as they 
			fleece anyone unfortunate enough to cross their paths. Despite its 
			handsome cinematography, slathered in thick, neo-noir shades of red 
			and blue, the film has no-one to root for. Place your bets on 
			Hoffman’s terrific portrayal of a weasely, wisecracking pervert, 
			however, and you’re sure to get your money’s worth.</font></p>
