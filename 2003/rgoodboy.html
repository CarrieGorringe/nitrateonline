            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan
            Lybarger</a>, 10 October 2003</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Because <i>Good Boy!</i>
            involves talking dogs who are far more advanced that the people who
            are their alleged masters, it's easy to dismiss it as a knock off
            kid flicks like <i>Cats and Dogs</i>.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While there's not much to get
            excited about with the new film, it does have some interesting
            touches that set it apart from its predecessors. These bits don't
            make it great entertainment, but they put a grin on your face in a
            way that the other films couldn't.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The first and most important is
            that director John Hoffman uses special effects to serve the story,
            whereas <i>Cats and Dogs</i> went overboard with giving the animals
            James Bond-like gadgets and practically bludgeoned viewers with the
            images.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Working with the folks at Jim
            Henson Productions, Hoffman and company treat the idea of dogs being
            intellectually superior to humans as a matter of fact. The dogs look
            as if they are actually talking, and the spaceships fly
            convincingly. Nonetheless, the filmmakers never feel the need to
            stop the tale's pacing in order to emphasize the cool effects
            they've created.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The story, adapted from Zeke
            Richardson's book <i>Dog's from Outer Space</i> by Richardson and
            Hoffman deals with an earnest lad named Owen Barker (nicely played
            by Liam Aiken from <i>The Road to Perdition</i>) who walks other
            people's dogs in the hope of later having one of his own.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">His folks (<i>Saturday Night Live </i>veterans
            Kevin Nealon and Molly Shannon) restore old houses for a living, so
            the family is always moving and never settling any where long enough
            for Owen to make friends. Considering that most of the kids in his
            current neighborhood pick on him, it's easy to see why Owen would
            prefer the company of a dog.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When his folks are forced to let
            him have the pooch he's always wanted, Owen chooses a feisty little
            creature who interrupted the boy's walk by rousing the other
            animals. When the dog that he's named Hubble runs off, Owen follows
            him and hopes to take him back but discovers that the animal is
            working with strange electronic devices.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Owen then awakens and discovers
            that Hubble speaks (with Matthew Broderick's voice). In fact, he can
            now understand what all the dogs in his neighborhood are saying, and
            that the situation looks potentially grave.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hubble's been sent from the dog
            star Sirius to determine if Earth's canine's have properly conquered
            Earth the way they've dominated other planets in the galaxy.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After talking with the other dogs
            Hubble becomes dismayed because Earth's dogs have become, well,
            pets. He and Owen diligently try to create a ruse of superiority
            before his superior, the Greater Dane (voice by Vanessa Redgrave)
            comes to Earth to prevent her from ordering all dogs back to Sirius
            for retraining.</font></p>
            <p><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">Good Boy!</font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">
            is occasionally clever, but is never laugh out loud funny or
            gripping. Instead, it has a genial tone that usually carries the
            picture. Hoffman and Richardson do create a few clever moments. For
            example, Hubble recoils in horror when he discovers that toilets are
            not drinking vessels.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The most interesting thing about <i>Good
            Boy!</i> is the voice acting. The thespians selected to talk for the
            dogs give the animals distinct and clear personalities and do it so
            well that one expects the creatures to talk off screen. Delta Burke
            is almost typecast as a proud poodle, and Carl Reiner seems at home
            as a lazy mountain dog. The real standout, though, is Brittany
            Murphy (<i>8 Mile</i>) as an Italian greyhound named Nelly. Murphy's
            nervously high-pitched voice seems eerily at home in the dog's body.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Because <i>Good Boy!</i> manages to
            elicit some engaging moments from a seemingly timeworn setup, it
            feels more disappointing when the flaws surface. While it's obvious
            that people walk dogs for reasons other than exercise, there are a
            few too many jokes about feces and flatulence. Also the bullies who
            taunt Owen seem meaner than necessary. Some adults at the screening
            I attended recoiled when the cruel lads started throwing rocks at
            Hubble and his pals.</font></p>
            <p><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">Good Boy!</font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">
            gives its viewers a lot more than the annoying trailers would imply
            and deserves special credit because, unlike the trailers, it lacks
            that annoyingly overplayed tune by the Baha Men.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"></o:p>
