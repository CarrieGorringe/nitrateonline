            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>No, just
            because the director's name is (Casey) La Scala, you won't find a
            hint of opera in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Grind</i>.
            Then again, cultured fans of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">La
            Traviata</i> might be up in arms for their La Scala even being
            mentioned in any association with this film or its first-time
            helmer. The music in it exemplifies the film in general: extremely
            awful. Here is a mindlessly tepid excursion into the world of
            not-at-all-extreme skateboarding, disguised as a post-adolescent
            road movie with very little of the actual sport on display,
            especially by the film's &quot;stars.&quot; Ralph Sall's
            mind-numbing screenplay is about as exciting as watching ice melt.
            Based on this, his sole feature screenwriting credit, Sall best
            retreat hastily to his day job, as a successful song and music
            producer, although based on the composer/music producing hat he dons
            in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Grind</i>, with the music
            too loud and high octane to match the unexciting visuals, he may
            have problems with some of his former clients, including Paul
            McCartney, Aerosmith, and Jewel.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For someone who
            can barely remember the last time (i.e., a few decades ago) he was
            on roller skates—and he has never ridden a board (so I am writing
            this as an &quot;outsider&quot;)—<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Grind</i>
            isn't likely to bring aboard any of its viewers not previously
            involved with the sport. For anyone not associated with the
            vernacular, grind is scraping one or both axles of a skateboard on a
            curb, railing, or other surface. Maybe the producers are waiting for
            the DVD release to include all of this grinding missing in the
            theatrical release. Ah, silly me, in deference to the &quot;story
            line&quot; they obviously wanted to showcase the cast's acting
            talent, or in the case of poor Randy Quaid, how you can embarrass
            yourself under a ton of clown makeup. What grinding you do hear are
            your teeth pulverizing the ticket stub you dare not show anyone as
            proof you actually sat through this stiff effort.</font></p>

            Chicago-area high school graduates (really?) Eric Rivers (Mike
            &quot;Grounded for Life&quot; Vogel), Dustin Knight (Adam &quot;The
            O.C.&quot; Brody), and slacker Matt Jensen (Vince &quot;Rat
            Race&quot; Vieluf) decide to ditch their fast-food-chain jobs (Chili
            'N Such is the name, so flatulence and worse are the sophomoric
            game) or other dreary mall life existence in favor of crashing the
            national skateboard circuit without a required sponsor.
            &quot;Sweet&quot; Lou Singer (Joey Kern), a ladies’ man six years
            out of high school (and none the smarter) going nowhere except into
            a bevy of hot chick pants, is approached by the trio to come along
            with them on their quest—and in his vehicle. When the dad of
            Wednesday, one of Lou's generic teen-bait vixens, gives chase to the
            womanizer, this easily triggers a lame plot device (unfortunately
            not a small explosion) and maneuvers a quick getaway in Lou's van,
            ostensibly used in a dog and cat grooming business, but probably
            used more for petting. The foursome<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>rechristen the vehicle and themselves as the faux
            professional extreme boarding entity Super Dupers. Groping from town
            to town on fumes (not all of it from the car) and false hopes, they
            are determined to make themselves jackasses, er champs, or die
            telling lame jokes.</span></font>

            interact with real life professional skaters, a family of clowns
            (Matt's parents), a lot of hot, busty babes, and too much toilet
            humor. As such you can flush the acting. Jennifer Morrison as the
            girl with the Pepsodent smile is an attractive catch and some
            character depth, but she's awash in a sea of morons. Even the cameos
            will and should be quickly forgotten: Stephen Root, Bobcat
            Goldthwait, Tom Green. Others lay hidden behind enough makeup that
            they can safely disavow ever having appeared in the film. Is that
            you, Dave Foley?</span></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">This
            whole film comes across as a turgid excuse for entertainment,
            offering glimpses of Kansas, Colorado, and other states at their
            worst. Would you expect anything better from a film that celebrates
            projectile vomiting? <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Grind</i> is as funny as a torpedo in a drained motel pool (ha, ha, ha)
            or as bad sing-a-longs (to music no one knows, but somehow find the
            words). Continuity is constantly tossed downwind (how did the clowns
            know to show up in Santa Monica?), and ending the film with a wink
            at spaghetti western should have Sergio Leone suing for defamation
            of character. Even the end-credit outtakes fall flat, so don't
            expect any tail end consolation. Director La Scala can't direct his
            way out of this can of half-baked beans.</span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"></o:p>
