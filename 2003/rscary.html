            when you thought the <i>Scary Movie</i> franchise had run out of
            ideas, here it comes again -- looking like it's run out of ideas.
            Where Shawn and Marlon Wayans' first film was a surprisingly fresh
            satire of already-self-satirical slasher flicks (and, not
            incidentally, promised no sequels), <i>Scary Movie 2</i> felt
            strained, scavenging &quot;old&quot; horror films like <i>The
            Exorcist</i> for material (also not incidentally, the Wayans were
            fairly vocal at the time concerning their discomfort with doing the
            sequel they promised not to do). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For
            <i>Scary Movie 3</i>, they have left the project to the man they
            ripped off to begin with, venerable director David Zucker, of <i>Kentucky
            Fried Movie</i> and <i>Airplane!</i> fame. Working with him is
            writer Pat Proft (who co-wrote the <i>Naked Gun</i> movies), and
            Craig Mazin. Together they've come up with a string of jokes,
            increasingly unfunny as they settle into something of a plot and the
            trajectory becomes obvious. And the string is uneven: the appearance
            of Michael Jackson impersonator by way of <i>The Others</i> is
            nastily entertaining, just as the abuses of Mother Teresa are
            arduous. Such erratic rhythms are familiar from Zucker's previous
            grab bag movies, though here even the non-formula of that formula is
            wearing thin. Besides, the fact that he's looking for work that
            copies his own, following the flat-out awful <i>My Boss' Daughter</i>
            and <i>Rat Race</i>, is a little sad, but hardly surprising. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            this installment, perpetually plucky Cindy Campbell (Anna Faris)
            returns as a styling blond, all grown up into a TV anchorwoman
            (presumably, a vague nod to Courteney Cox's Gale Weathers). She
            comes on a videotape that, once viewed, brings on a phone call
            announcing the watcher's horrible death seven days later (here the
            caller occasionally sounds like <i>Lord of the Rings</i>' hissy
            Gollum). As in Gore Verbinski's &quot;original&quot; <i>Ring</i>,
            itself a remake of the Japanese <i>Ringu</i>, this business is
            introduced via a couple of not-so-smart girls discussing their
            experience with a certain scary &quot;video.&quot; Because these
            hyper-voluptuous Catholic School Girls are played by Pamela Anderson
            and Jenny McCarthy, some jokey discussion is given over to another
            infamous disturbing video, involving a boat. (If nothing else, Pam,
            a.k.a. Striperella, again demonstrates the enormity of her breasts
            and some bizarrely inchoate sense of her own comedic limits and
            values.) <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Following
            this wacky prelude, <i>Scary Movie 3</i> starts piling up the
            spoofs: Cindy looks up her friend Brenda Meeks (Regina Hall), whose
            death in the last film is apparently exaggerated, who has also seen
            the tape; that is, she's going to die again, this time leading to a
            series of not-so-hilarious grotesqueries visited upon her corpse.
            Charlie Sheen appears as the damaged former Father Tom, whose farm
            is beset by ominous crop circles à la <i>Signs</i> (the scene where
            he flashes back to the tragic car accident includes the cutesy
            in-joke of Sheen's real-life wife Denise Richards as the prescient
            dead wife). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Here
            again, the film offers up the wise trooper (Camryn Manheim) who is
            evacuated from the film almost as soon as she shows up, and the
            movie invites the same annoying question (this time spoken by Tom,
            rather than left to you): if the aliens have mastered space travel,
            how come wooden doors confound them? Also as before, the aliens make
            ostensibly spooky appearances, rustling cornstalks and trilling in
            the darkness. Presumably, either Alien #1 (Troy Yorke) or Alien #2
            (Marco Soriano) also appears walking through the backgrounds of
            human assemblies, gazing at the video cameras trained their way. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">One
            change-up comes in <i>SM3</i>'s intertwining of yet a third movie's
            plotline with the two primaries: Tom's brother, George (Simon Rex),
            introduced via &quot;portentous&quot; camera spins that give Tom and
            George mild whiplash, is a young man with &quot;a dream, to have a
            dream.&quot; Namely, he wants to be an earnest white boy rapper, à
            la <i>8 Mile</i>. (This is <i>Scary Movie 3</i>'s best joke -- <i>8
            Mile</i> as approximate horror movie.) George's ambition introduces
            the badly wigged Mekhi Phifer character, Mahalik (Anthony Anderson),
            who loves George a lot, and emcees the rap battles in Da Hood (only
            a short bus ride from the farm). In this capacity, he observes,
            &quot;Finally, the white man is going to school the black man on how
            to rap.&quot; And yes, George throws down with lyrics about
            mayonnaise and Wonder Bread, beating out Fat Joe in front of
            everyone.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Lest
            you fret that the white man does too much schooling in <i>Scary
            Movie 3</i>, <i>The Matrix</i> rears its cheaply digital-effected
            head, in the form of Orpheus (Eddie Griffin) and Aunt &quot;Just
            call me the Oracle&quot; Shaneequa (Queen Latifah, who might as well
            stick to the phone-service commercials for all the good she's doing
            her career with this role). Not that Cindy actually learns much in
            this episode, but Shaneequa does deal appropriate vengeance on that
            annoying hair-brusher in <i>The Ring</i>'s hideous death's-a-coming
            video. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">By
            the time the film winds down to its several anti-climaxes, Zucker
            and company have apparently wholly lost steam. And so he taps his
            favorite go-to guy, Leslie Nielsen, to play President Harris, with
            Chief of Staff John Wilson (D. L. Hughley) and Secret Service Agent
            Thompson (Ja Rule in a suit, playing Tupac in his headset).
            Washington's connections to the movie's alien business and the
            videotape business actually look tenuous here, even given the
            obvious reason the Pres should be interested. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            any event, Harris and his security team pile into the official SUV
            to track down Cindy, who's conveniently at Tom's farm (don't even
            ask how she gets there -- it's the ordained collision of plot
            shards) and two apparently competing sets of hiphop artists
            (including Method Man, Redman, RZA, Raekwon, U-God, Macy Gray, and
            Master P) who proceed to shoot each other dead. What this has to do
            with anything is something of a mystery, until you consider that, if
            the moral is to make nice with those who look &quot;other&quot; (and
            that message is uttered a few times here), including aliens and
            grisly little girls who have drowned in wells, what better way to
            underline the idea than to kill off the wealthiest hiphoppers, so
            other even to these other others?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
