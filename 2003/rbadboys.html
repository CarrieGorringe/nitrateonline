            louder, longer. In <i>Bad Boys II</i>, Miami detectives Mike Lowrey
            (Will Smith) and Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) are back big time,
            doing just what you know they'll do. In fact, you might almost lay
            out the sequel yourself: here they annoy their white captain (Joe
            Pantoliano) and there, Marcus' infinitely patient wife (Theresa
            Randle); there they make fun of the homoerotic charge that underlies
            their pretty-boy partnership; there Marcus makes funny faces; and
            here, Mike works his superstud mojo. Not a surprise in sight. Unless
            you count that Marcus now has a sister, DEA Agent Syd (Gabrielle
            Union), so fabulous and charismatic that she makes the whole
            &quot;boys&quot; concept look mostly old-fashioned. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Reportedly,
            this &quot;long awaited&quot; sequel was slow off the blocks because
            the 1995 original's players have in the meantime become major movie
            stars (while their schedules have surely been filled, their fees
            have also escalated). At the time of <i>Bad Boys</i>' release, no
            one expected two black TV actors to carry a Hollywood buddy film (at
            the time, &quot;interracial&quot; was as far as the previously
            white, pre-Jackie Chan genre had gone), and Michael Bay was a
            commercial director just breaking into movies. The nonstop deluge of
            action and hilarity worked: <i>Bad Boys</i> made much money ($141
            million worldwide) and the principals' movie careers were launched. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Where
            the first film was by turns formulaic and dizzy (especially in
            Lawrence's impersonations of his partner's player-cop routine),
            Number Two reflects a sustained confidence, and lots more formula.
            For all its manifest energy, Ron Shelton and Jerry Stahl's
            screenplay tends to creak along, piling up plot-proof stunts and
            repeating the same sorts of character &quot;conflicts&quot; that
            apparently worked so well the first time. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">And
            so: Marcus remains the nervous nelly as action hero, explaining to
            the new department shrink that he's rally not &quot;angry&quot; that
            Mike is such an egotistical hotshot and has literally, if
            accidentally, shot him in the ass; Mike, meantime, remains the
            ladies man, serviced by his younger and prettier shrink, and so
            earning an A in whatever passes for fit-for-duty grades in the
            Miami-Dade PD's Narcotics Division. As if all this isn't mirthful
            enough, Marcus is also trying to calm himself by chanting when he
            gets upset: &quot;Wooo-sa! Wooo-sa,&quot; he exhales, frequently. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            film starts with an appropriately spectacular set piece. As head of
            TNT (Tactical Narcotics team), Henry Rollins dons night vision
            goggles and barks orders to his men awaiting, while Mike and Marcus
            crash a local Klan's cross burning, emerging from beneath their
            &quot;undercover&quot; white hoods with huge guns drawn and low
            angle camera circling (this particular technique is one of Bay's
            favorites, and he uses it again and again and again in this film, as
            if to make up for the lack of actual narrative movement). Mike and
            Marcus stumble through the infamous <i>Cops</i> theme song, engage
            in some n-word-laced banter, then realize (oh no!) that the TNT
            won't be coming through as planned. They just have to shoot and
            explode a whole passel of Klansmen, who slobber and curse according
            to their type. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">To
            counter these Caucasian cretins, the film offers the middle-class
            black family: Marcus and wifey with three nice kids, a huge house on
            the water, and a standup pool of which he is especially fond. As he
            contemplates de-partnering with Mike (he's requested a transfer:
            gee, do you think he'll go through with it?), the family and Mike
            have a barbeque. Syd arrives from New York, ostensibly on
            &quot;vacation&quot; but really on an undercover mission. Sadly,
            she's confined to scenes that mark Mike and Marcus' increasing
            tensions, because she -- seemingly sensible -- has inexplicably
            fallen for Mike. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Since
            the boys so clearly need to work out their relationship, Syd offers
            the perfect means when her drug-money-laundering deal goes wrong and
            a car chase ensues. Nothing like a little macho posturing and fast
            driving to dissipate buddy disagreements. When Syd takes off down
            the highway, pursued by determined and depraved killers (including
            one character cleverly called &quot;Blond Dreads&quot; [Kiko
            Ellsworth]), the boys decide to help, in high speed fashion, driving
            Mike's very fast and shiny Porsche. Voila: car chase number one (out
            of many). When one of the villains commandeers as a new-car carrier,
            his buddies start pitching cars off the back; they flip and roll,
            crash and smash, so noisily and extremely that the (admittedly
            lengthy) scene steps up the <i>Matrix Reloaded</i> digitized highway
            biz considerably (Martin Lawrence has said in interviews that cars
            actually flipped over his head while making the film: if this is the
            case, he's earned his millions). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Amazingly,
            the cases they're all working on overlap: the KKK guys are moving
            drugs for the same dealer Syd's trying to bust, one Johnny Tapia
            (Jordi Mollà), a Cuban immigrant with a daughter, an elderly
            mother, and a crew of stereotypes (including a poorly used Jon
            Seda). At the film's start, he is also retro-invidiously aligned
            with smarmy Russian club-owner Alexei (Peter Stormare), apparently
            in place to allow salacious shots of underdressed kids in his club,
            dancing, kissing, and overdosing, as well as an occasion for Johnny
            to demonstrate his ferocity (Alexei's thuggish underling, played by
            Oleg Taktarov, suffers a horrific death). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Johnny's
            sensational scheme to move drugs and money in and out of Cuba,
            inside dead bodies, grants <i>Bad Boys II</i> excuses for all sorts
            of vulgarities and horrors. Mike sticks his hands inside assorted
            corpses' chests; Marcus hides under a sheet with a big-breasted
            body; an array of corpses fall off a getaway truck, careening into
            the camera at street-level, splatting as cars run them over. You get
            the idea: all these cadavers make for great, visceral gross-outs, to
            be sure, but they don't do much for developing characters or
            storylines. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">As
            the movie is not only directed by the ham-handed Bay but also
            produced by the King of Overkill, Jerry Bruckheimer, it emphatically
            does not know when to quit. (There are at least three finales in it,
            and the first, coming about ninety minutes into this 144-minute
            enterprise, seems most effective.) The penchant for excess leaves
            the film lurching from scene to scene, each its own little moment,
            with the car chases punctuating the acts, boisterously. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">While
            Smith utters more profanity in this single film than in the rest of
            his career, Lawrence takes the opportunity to flex his improv chops:
            a bonding moment that accidentally takes place in front of an
            electronics store video camera leaves shocked customers gasping at
            the boys' intimacy issues (Marcus is concerned that, following an
            accident on the job, he's been left &quot;flaccid,&quot; and Mike
            suggests that they agree on a &quot;boundaries box&quot;); Marcus'
            ingestion of two ecstasy pills leads him to fondle his own nipples
            and express his true love for Mike; and Marcus acts out Lawrence's
            own aversion to rats when M &amp; M pose as exterminators to
            infiltrate Johnny's infested mansion. Soon Marcus is at the end of
            his rope, announcing, &quot;This has been the worst, most emotional
            cop week of my life!&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">As
            funny as these emotional calisthenics are supposed to be, they are
            decidedly less riveting than the action -- and everyone knows it.
            Thus, the film takes the structure of a musical, with dialogue
            scenes only serving to move you from one action piece to another. By
            the time they take off for Cuba (entering the third mini-movie
            within the movie), and drive a humvee down a hill full of shacks,
            running over and through rooftops, the film's sheer outrageousness,
            not to mention its outrageous class politics, is fully visible. For
            this invasion, they need extra firepower and get it, including
            useful high tech surveillance courtesy of the CIA: this is
            undoubtedly <i>Bad Boys II</i>'s most outrageous fantasy, that this
            agency has its act together. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">And
            still, despite and because of the film's tedious surfeit -- all the
            raging testosterone, the expensive rides, the fiery explosions, the
            too-earnest payback -- it is the only franchise during this
            franchise summer to feature two black stars (three if you count
            Union's minimal, though typically fine contribution). Coming amid
            today's disturbing Helpful-Magical-Solicitous Negro trend (wherein
            black characters show up only to serve white ones), <i>Bad Boys II</i>,
            with its unapologetic focus on independent, appealing, and
            ecstatically aggressive black men, seems a more remarkable feat than
            it would otherwise. <o:p>
