            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by Nicholas Schager, 
			14 February 2003</i></font><p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">After 
			the back-to-back successes of <i>X-Men</i> and <i>Spider-Man</i>, 
			Marvel Entertainment had good reason to feel like its comic book 
			properties were finally getting the A-list treatment and respect 
			they deserved. Well, the streak ends with <i>Daredevil</i>. Ben 
			Affleck stars as the titular hero, a blind lawyer named Matt Murdock 
			by day and red leather-clad do-gooder by night, using his enhanced 
			senses and martial arts skills to champion the common man against 
			the evildoers who stalk Hell’s Kitchen’s dank, rainy alleyways. With 
			his horned mask and penchant for leaping from and swinging around 
			the city’s skyscrapers, frequently casting an ominous shadow to 
			frighten his prey before swooping down to exact justice, he’s like 
			Batman’s less popular, more uninteresting, brother.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And like the caped crusader, 
			Murdock was drawn into the world of crime fighting as a means of 
			avenging the death of his parent, a streetwise former boxing champ 
			nicknamed “The Devil” (played with two-dimensional nobility by David 
			Keith) who, before his untimely end, made with Matt “a silent 
			promise to never give up, to be fearless.” Matt is blinded in a 
			freak toxic-waste accident while going to show Dad his report card – 
			Straight A’s! – but, when he recovers, finds that his other four 
			senses are incredibly acute, the best of which is a radar-like sense 
			of hearing that allows him to “see” simply by picking up on his 
			environment’s sound waves. At one point, Matt, utilizing his amazing 
			power of smell, correctly predicts that rain is about to fall 
			moments before the sky turns overcast. This is what we’ve been 
			reduced to sitting through: the superhero as Al Roker.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As a kid Matt is harassed by some 
			thugs, but after his accident, he gets to pay back the bullies with 
			some kung fu moves, and it’s hard not to remember having seen this 
			song and dance in last summer’s <i>Spider-Man</i>. But then again, 
			if it’s originality you’re looking for, you’ve come to the wrong 
			place. Fans always make a big deal over the fact that Daredevil, 
			unlike his heroic brethren, doesn’t have supernaturally-granted 
			abilities – he’s just a normal guy with heightened senses, although 
			one would be hard pressed to see how a man can leap around the 
			city’s rooftops, sometimes traveling hundreds of feet in freefall, 
			and not break all his kneecaps upon landing without the benefit of 
			some genetic alteration. They also claim in his defense that Murdock 
			is not a billionaire like Bruce Wayne or Iron Man’s Tony Stark, 
			although how he affords his metal-clad apartment lair and walking 
			stick/multipurpose weapon on the earnings of his law practice – 
			which represents the downtrodden innocent, and is usually paid for 
			its services in things like sporting goods and carp – are beyond me. 
			Even Matt’s comedic sidekick Franklin “Foggy” Nelson (John Favreau), 
			who staunchly believes that giant alligators roam the city’s sewers, 
			wouldn’t believe that Daredevil could afford such swank 
			accoutrements.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There are plenty of laughs in <i>
			Daredevil</i>, but Favreau is the only one eliciting them 
			intentionally. Matt falls in love with a beautiful stranger named 
			Elektra Natchios (Garner), an appropriate name given how 
			unbelievably cheesy Garner’s performance turns out to be. One can 
			only assume that she would have been named “Elecktra Doritios” if 
			Frito-Lay had come through with the product-placement cash (instead, 
			for Daredevil, it’s all about the Heineken). Elektra and Matt 
			introduce themselves to one another by sparring, <i>Matrix</i>-style, 
			in a city playground, and the scene surprisingly strikes a balance 
			between silliness and giddy inspiration. But writer/director Mark 
			Steven Johnson couldn’t direct his way out of a subway station, and 
			has made the <i>Battlefield Earth</i> mistake of framing every other 
			shot in a cockeyed fashion because, well, he thinks it looks cool. 
			During Matt’s only courtroom scene, he detects that the man on the 
			stand is lying because he can hear his heart rate speed up, and 
			Johnson decides that the visual accompaniment to this revelation 
			should be to madly tilt his camera this way and that, with a couple 
			of hilariously swift zooms into close-up thrown in for good measure.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still, these annoying stylistic 
			decisions are better than the action sequences, which are hectically 
			edited, shot in strobe lights or reflecting rain, and rife with 
			unbelievable computer-generated imagery. Judging from Daredevil’s 
			weightless leaps around the city’s towering edifices, CGI clearly 
			hasn’t progressed very far in the intervening months between <i>
			Daredevil</i> and <i>Spider-Man</i>, and Johnson wisely cloaks much 
			of the computer trickery in near total darkness. The only time one 
			of Johnson’s ideas and execution come together is in the depiction 
			of Daredevil’s sonic radar – a swirl of blue-black apparitions and 
			image outlines that comes much closer to capturing the character’s 
			super-hearing than the comics, which use circular radar lines coming 
			out Daredevil’s head to indicate his “Devil sense.”</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Besides his on-again, off-again 
			romance with Elektra, Daredevil also gets two villainous baddies to 
			confront. The Kingpin is a dapper businessman who secretly runs all 
			the crime in New York City, and may have had something to do with 
			the death of Daredevil’s father; played by the enormous and 
			enormously affable Michael Clarke Duncan, the Kingpin is an arrogant 
			cynic who believes that no one is ever really innocent. 
			Unfortunately, he’s not given much to do, and thus the final 
			confrontation between him and our masked avenger lack the requisite 
			amount of weighty significance necessary for such a climactic 
			showdown. More successful is the Kingpin’s hired assassin Bullseye 
			(Colin Farrell), an insane Irish bloke whose pinpoint throwing 
			accuracy allows him to turn even the most mundane everyday objects 
			(paper clips, pencils) into deadly weapons. Dressed like a Hell’s 
			Angel reject and displaying a circular target imprint on his 
			forehead (which he rubs for good luck before throwing stuff), 
			Farrell’s Bullseye goes so far over-the-top that he winds up being 
			the sole thing worth looking forward to in <i>Daredevil</i>. 
			Farrell, all exaggerated grunts and wide-eyed maniacal stares, is 
			the only one who gets the joke that Johnson’s film is, and he has a 
			blast riding roughshod over everything in his path.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If only Affleck seemed to be having 
			such fun. The newly-crowned “Sexiest Man Alive” is credible as blind 
			do-gooder Matt Murdock, but donning his alter ego’s mask saps the 
			actor of his cheerful charisma, and the only performance he can 
			muster is one in which determined grimacing weakly stands in for 
			tortured gravity. While Affleck’s boyish charm doesn’t jibe with his 
			character’s solemnity, at least Johnson gives him something to do, 
			which is more than can be said for Favreau (reduced to unimportant 
			jokester) and Joe Pantoliano as tabloid journalist Ben Urich (left 
			to perform a dull investigation into whether Daredevil and Kingpin 
			are real). But Johnson’s film is all about missed opportunities. 
			Watching one of the lamest love scenes in recent memory – which 
			begins with a statue of a man grabbing a woman’s breast before 
			segueing into Affleck and Garner’s softly-lit PG-appropriate sexual 
			posing – one gets the sneaking suspicion that Batman never would 
			have embarrassed himself like this.</font></td>
