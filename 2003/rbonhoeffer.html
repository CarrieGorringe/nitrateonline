            through the theology section of any Borders or Barnes &amp; Noble
            bookstore, you’ll find dozens of books by or about Dietrich
            Bonhoeffer. The Lutheran theologian, who died in 1945 at the age of
            thirty-nine, had a series of astonishing achievements and insights
            during his short life. Books like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Cost of Discipleship</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Ethics</i>
            examined the role of the Christian Church and its relationship to
            the modern world and are required texts in seminaries nearly fifty
            years after his death. <o:p>

            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Bonhoeffer’s
            actions, however, are even more intriguing than his theories and
            texts. Compelled by his beliefs against war and racial intolerance,
            he was one of the earliest and staunchest German opponents of the
            Nazis, helped smuggle Jews to safety and was eventually executed for
            his part in a series of attempts to kill Adolf Hitler.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>He opposed the injustices of the Third Reich when many of the
            German churches were too afraid or appeared to be endorsing the
            Nazis. It’s easy to view him as both a hero and a martyr, and
            Martin Doblmeier’s new documentary, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Bonhoeffer</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">,
            </span>does nothing to dispel that image.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Thankfully,
            Doblmeier examines his subject in a thorough and clear-headed manner
            that’s worthy of the subject. In many ways, seeing Bonhoeffer’s
            human side makes the theologian seem even braver and his ideas seem
            more relevant. For example, when Bonhoeffer was asked to speak at a
            funeral for the father of his Jewish brother-in-law, he, advised by
            fearful Lutheran Church officials, declined. It was a decision he
            later deeply regretted. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Acts
            like this one were atypical. Without the state support that most
            churches in Germany received, Bonhoeffer helped found the Confessing
            Church denomination and even spoke against Hitler on national radio
            the day after Hitler became Chancellor. The film also addresses how
            Bonhoeffer was able to reconcile his pacifist views with
            participating in an assassination plot.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Doblmeier
            vividly illustrates how the religious world in the first half of the
            twentieth century helped shape Bonhoeffer’s views and deeds.
            Whereas German churches had fervently supported the first World War,
            Bonheoffer, who lost an older brother in the conflict, viewed war as
            anathema to Christ’s example and teachings. The director also
            explores the actual nature of Anti-Semitism in German churches and
            how it evolved. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">The
            film also demonstrates the surprising influence of his brief stay in
            the United States. Studying in New York during the 1930s, Bonhoeffer
            was bothered by how whites would attend black churches and applaud
            the choirs but would deny members of the congregation their civil
            rights once the services were over. Returning to Germany, he saw
            clear parallels between American racism and the persecution of the
            Jews.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">The
            tone of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Bonhoeffer</i> is
            reverent, if a bit overly staid. Fortunately, Bonhoeffer’s ideas
            are so intriguing, and his story so engrossing that more
            experimental documentary techniques might have been distracting. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Despite
            the film’s ninety-minute length, Doblmeier presents an astonishing
            amount of detail. The interviewees include Bonhoeffer’s students
            and his surviving relatives and friends as well as contemporary
            theologians who do a fine job of explaining the lasting impact of
            his theological advances. Doblemeier also quotes extensively from
            Bonhoeffer’s own writings, which are nicely read by Austrian actor
            Klaus Maria Brandauer. Doblemeier even includes some intriguing
            testimony from the South African Nobel Laureate Archbishop Desmond
            Tutu, who recalls the similarities between his personal struggles
            against Apartheid with Bonhoeffer’s.<o:p>

            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">In
            addition to the diligence with which the documentarian has examined
            his life, Bonhoeffer himself might have been proud of how Doblmeier
            initially presented his film. When the official Sundance festival
            rejected the movie, Doblmeier drew crowds to the film and attracted
            the attention of distributors by showing it – where else -- at
            some of the Park City, Utah churches</span></font>
