is a Dirty Word in Hollywood<br>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="4">An Interview with Ray Harryhausen<br>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="1"><i>Interview by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan
Lybarger</a>, 28 November 2003</i></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>For a fellow who made his name by working in
isolation, stop-motion animation expert Ray Harryhausen knows how to work a
crowd. Some of the cinema's most talented artists have difficulty describing
their craft or meeting the people who love their work.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The eighty-three-year-old Harryhausen, however,
loves to mingle with his fans and even sits through screenings of the films with
them, whispering amusing behind-the-scenes stories to anyone lucky enough to be
nearby.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Participants at last fall's Halfway to
Hollywood Film Festival in Kansas City not only got to meet him and screen his
films, but the faithful who hung around with him even got to meet his
&quot;coworkers.&quot; He shows us the skeleton swordsman who battled the heroes
in his films <i>The 7th Voyage of Sinbad</i> (1958) and <i>Jason and the
Argonauts</i> (1963). While it looked formidably life size on the big screen,
it's only eight inches tall in person. The tiny figure has all the joints of a
full size mass of bones. A more life-size alien from <i>Earth vs. the Flying
Saucers</i> stands behind him as he signs autographs for a long line of
admirers.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ever since he saw <i>King Kong</i> as a boy,
the Los Angeles native has been following in the footsteps of Willis O'Brien,
who made the puppet gorilla and dinosaurs come to life in that film. After
teaming up with his idol on <i>Mighty Joe Young </i>(1949), Harryhausen made a
splash with a resurrected dinosaur in <i>The Beast from 20,000</i> <i>Fathoms</i>
(1953). The animator then teamed up with producer for Charles H. Schneer for a
series of Cold War chillers like <i>It Came from Beneath the Sea</i> (1955) and <i>20
Million Miles to Earth</i> (1957).</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After that the two began to take Harryhausen's
creatures into newer, fantastic settings. They used material as diverse as Greek
mythology (<i>Clash of the Titans</i> from 1981) and Jules Verne (<i>The
Mysterious Island</i> from 1961).</font></p>
<p><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">Clash of the Titans</font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">
may have been his last feature with his stunning artificial creatures, but his
recent years have been far from idle. Alert members of the audience during <i>Elf</i>
will hear his voice coming from the mouth of an animated polar bear cub. He's
also completed a project that he had started decades before. The twelve-minute
short, <i>The Story of the Tortoise and the Hare</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">,</span>
has been completed with the help of Mark Caballero and Seamus Walsh and has
become popular on the film festival circuit and gained the master animator a
whole new generation of fans.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While Harryhausen's recent work has kept him in
the spotlight, his classic films have inspired some of today's top filmmakers,
even if they don't use his unique methods. In <i>Monsters, Inc</i>., Mike (Billy
Crystal) eats at a sushi bar called &quot;Harryhausen's,&quot; and Robert
Rodriguez gave the computer-generated creatures in <i>Spy Kids 2: Island of Lost
Dreams</i> a more stylized movement so they would carry themselves like the
creatures in Harryhausen's films.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ever the gentleman, he took the time to shake
hands with his fans even during the middle of the interview. Maybe part of the
reason that happy geeks like me still flock to meet him at events like these is
because he treats them as seriously he does his craft.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>Dan Lybarger: </i></b>I got an e-mail
from Mark Caballero. I found out about the <i>Tortoise and the Hare</i> project
that you'd been working on. That started about fifty years ago, didn't it?</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>Ray Harryhausen: </i></b>The first part,
yeah, was. I started it fifty years ago and then abandoned it, and then Mark and
Seamus [Walsh] wrote me and said they'd like to finish it. They saw Richard
Schickel's program [<i>The Harryhausen Chronicles</i>], and there was an excerpt
of some of the footage that I'd shoot. So, they finished it, and everybody seems
to like it.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>Yeah, you won an Annie [the
top award in animation] for it</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>RH: </i></b>We won an Annie award and
several other types of awards.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>I loved the joke where you
said that if you had seen the Dino De Laurentiis <i>King Kong</i> you'd have
[become] a plumber.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>RH: </i></b>That's a little exaggerated.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>What was it about [the
original] <i>King Kong</i>?</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>RH: </i></b>There were many things about <i>King
Kong</i>. I think it's the definitive, greatest fantasy film that's ever been
put on the screen. It was way ahead of its time, and it first they put a written
score for a fantasy film by Max Steiner. That made it all the more impressive.
Willis O'Brien, of course, had done <i>The Lost World </i>before that, and <i>King
Kong </i>was his great triumph and for Merian Cooper, who produced it.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>Whereas some parents would
say, &quot;Oh, I wish you could get obsessed with accounting or something.&quot;</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>RH: </i></b>I could have been obsessed
with <i>Little Caesar</i> with Edward G. Robinson and become a Godfather today.
I got obsessed with <i>King Kong</i> because it was a wonderful fantasy. It took
you by the hand from the mundane world into the most outrageous fantasy that's
ever been put on the screen.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>Your father not only bought
you a camera but later in your career your father built the armatures for the
creatures. Your mom even dressed them.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>RH: </i></b>Yes, they were very
cooperative. They didn't see an end in sight, nor did I. But I just felt it was
a compulsion. I <i>had</i> to do it. Maybe the fickle finger of fate was at
work.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>As a high school kid, and
through Mr. O'Brien's niece, you were able to meet him. Was it intimidating to
show him these little things you had done?</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>RH: </i></b>I was a little nervous about
it, but I had just won a prize at the museum for a stegosaurus setting that I
had made in miniature. I put the animal in the suitcase and took it down to
M-G-M when he invited me to see <i>War Eagle</i>'s [an uncompleted O'Brien]
preparation. I showed it to him, and he was very courteous about it. He didn't
tell me, 'It stinks.&quot; [laughs]</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>A friend of mine who does
computer graphics told me some of the same things that Willis O'Brien told you,
that you have to study anatomy.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>RH: </i></b>He said the legs of my
stegosaurus looked like sausages, which they did. So he said, 'You'd better
study anatomy.&quot; So I went back to school and studied anatomy. Now all my
figures look like Arnold Schwarzenegger [laughs].</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>You also worked with George
Pal. Did you work on the <i>Puppetoons</i>?</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>RH: </i></b>I worked on the first twelve <i>Puppetoons</i>.
George, when he first came over from Paramount, I was the only other animator he
had hired for quite a while, and then he finally hired some more. He and I used
to work at nights until twelve sometimes trying to get a sequence into the
laboratory before it closed. And then he finally got some more animators
involved.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>The <i>Puppetoons</i> had
fairy tale stories because they were public domain, is that correct?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>RH: </i></b>The fairy tales came after
the War [World War II]. They were drafting people at the time, so I figured I
should sign up for something where I knew what I was doing. So I took a course
in photography that Columbia Pictures and Eastman Kodak were sponsoring to be a
combat cameraman. I didn't realize they were shot like clay pigeons, so I
studied to be a combat cameraman. Thank God, I didn't end up that way. I did
make a little 16 mm film that lasts about five minutes about building a bridge,
how you could use animation to instruct soldiers. My teacher at Kodak saw it,
and he showed it to Frank Capra, and I got transferred to the Special Service
Division.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Frank Capra was just starting this <i>Why We
Fight</i> series, and various other films, <i>Nuts and Bolts</i>, Army Navy
Screen Magazine, that type of thing and <span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic">[<i>Private</i>]<i>
Snafu</i></span> cartoons. Also at our post was Ted Geisel, Dr. Seuss. I made
some <i>Snafu</i> characters for him.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>When did you first start
working for O'Brien to do <i>Joe Young</i>?</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>RH: </i></b>That was after the War in
1945. Obie started preparing it. I kept calling him up and showing him my recent
footage, and not many people were interested in animation at that time. Finally,
when he got the go-ahead to start the preparation, I became his assistant until
it was time to do the animation, which was much later. There was about a year of
preparation on that picture.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>One of the things that keeps
popping up as I've been studying you is stuff was not something like, &quot;Oh,
I can just whip this out.&quot;</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>RH: </i></b>Oh, no, no. We had a whole
year of preparation. Obie made hundreds of drawings, and I mounted them for him
and labeled them. And he made continuity drawings. We made so much preparation
people don't realize.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>Now when you were working
with Mr. Schneer, you were producing about thirteen frames [of animation
footage] a day? [Standard film speed is twenty-four frames per second.]</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>RH: </i></b>That was just a rarity for
the skeleton sequence [from <i>Jason and the </i>Argonauts] where you had split
timing and synchronization to worry about. And I only averaged thirteen frames a
day for while. Sometimes you can shoot twenty-five feet a day. Sometimes, it
depends on the character and how complicated the scene is.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>The Cyclops scene in <i>The
7th Voyage of Sinbad</i> must have been a real challenge because it's striking
how well you were able to let us know he's been blinded. How did you model those
movements because you can instantly tell?</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>RH: </i></b>I just felt that setup was
the way it should be. Because everything you see in that picture is the first
take. I never had time or money to do a retake. We made the picture for
$650,000, the whole picture.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>Even then that was
microscopic.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>RH: </i></b>Even then, but today you
can't even buy a costume for that.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>One of things that really
struck me was how well Kerwin Mathews [who played Sinbad] handled the battle
scenes. He must have been a hell of an actor because he has to recoil from blows
he hasn't received.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>RH: </i></b>That's an actor's job. They
have to use their imagination, and he was very proficient</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>He seemed to have a
consistent view for how big this thing was.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>RH: </i></b>We rehearsed the whole thing
with somebody like Enzo Musumeci [Greco], who was a swordsman who taught Kerwin
how to do the sword sequences. And I would work with Enzo, and we'd lay out the
scene, and he would portray the skeleton all during rehearsal. After a while,
after they had rehearsed about seven or eight times, we shot a piece of film of
Kerwin &quot;shadowboxing&quot; so to speak. That's the piece of film I would
use to put the skeleton.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>You were in the remake of <i>Mighty
Joe Young</i>.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>RH: </i></b>As an actor, a much simpler
way to live [laughs].</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>Were you happy with the way
they treated it?</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>RH: </i></b>Well, it was a different
concept. Everybody has a different point of view. The first <i>Joe Young</i> was
more or less a send up of the <i>King Kong</i> type of film. Max O'Hara [played
by Robert Armstrong] was Merian Cooper, and he was the pivot point of the whole
picture, but these people felt they wanted to make [the theme] animal
conservation so they changed the whole concept. I thought it was a well-made
film, but I didn't think it was suitable for the subject. <i>Mighty Joe Young </i>was
basically a theatrical concept rather than a serious thing like animal
conservation.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>You have an edge over the
people who do the computer stuff. They always say that they have to think
&quot;what kind of surface is this?&quot; or &quot;how is it worn?&quot; Much of
that's already there [in your films].</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>RH: </i></b>But I had to learn how sculpt
because I couldn’t find anybody. I couldn't afford to hire anybody. So I had
to learn how to sculpt. I had to learn how to make the molds. I learned so many
different things in order to achieve what I did. I was a one-man show. I never
had assistance until <i>Clash of the Titans</i>. We got behind because of a
technical problem.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>You had a hand in selecting
locations.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>RH: </i></b>I always went out and found
the locations because they involved special effects enormously, so I'd go out
and find the locations before anybody else came.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>I thought it was cool that
you were adamant about getting a location in Spain versus a backlot.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>RH: </i></b>We wanted something
completely different. It was another reason we fled to Europe to get fresh
locations. You can't keep using Malibu Beach as a lost island.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>In the later [films], you
shared a producer credit with Mr. Schneer, but you had done much more than just
the effects [in the others as well].</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>RH: </i></b>I did nothing more than when
I started out with <i>Mighty Joe Young</i>, <i>The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms</i>.
I did the same thing until <i>Clash of the Titans</i>. In those days, I was very
modest, and I didn't learn for good many years that &quot;modesty&quot; is a
dirty word in Hollywood.</font></body></html>
