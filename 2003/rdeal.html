            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In <i>How to Deal</i>, the pop
            singer Mandy Moore, continuing to show promising acting ability,
            plays Halley, a Jersey girl who, during the course of her junior
            year in high school, has her cynical impressions about men and the
            impossibility of having true and genuine relationships with them
            confronted, then affirmed, by Macon (Trent Ford, amiable and not
            quite as louche as the advertising art makes him out to be), who
            starts out as friends with her but then wants to become more
            serious.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">By the end, Halley -- who also has
            an older sister (Mary Catherine Garrison) who's getting married, a
            best friend (Alexandra Holden) who's going to become a mother, and a
            mother (Allison Janney) who's finalizing a divorce with the sisters'
            clownish father (Peter Gallagher, who looks rather too clownish) --
            finds a way to deal with men, and life, in all its
            &quot;messy&quot;, &quot;out-of-order&quot; fashion (two terms used
            by the fiancé How to Deal&quot; tries to be thoughtful and
            pleasing, but it also comes across as a little blanded-out. The
            movie seems to find a way to get Moore and Ford's characters into a
            clinch by the end more for the reassurance of the audience than
            anything else (and this is not necessarily a &quot;spoiler&quot;, by
            the way). However, the picture, without being preachy or
            instructional, does suggest that girls should think and take
            responsibility for how they live their lives and what they
            themselves do and do not feel comfortable or right about, even if
            it's not a part of the accepted norm.e, played by Mackenzie Astin,
            to describe, affectionately, Halley's sister).</font></p>

            tries to be thoughtful and pleasing, but it also comes across as a
            little blanded-out. The movie seems to find a way to get Moore and
            Ford's characters into a clinch by the end more for the reassurance
            of the audience than anything else (and this is not necessarily a

            being preachy or instructional, does suggest that girls should think
            and take responsibility for how they live their lives and what they
            themselves do and do not feel comfortable or right about, even if
            it's not a part of the accepted norm. Not a bad idea, at a time when
            some pop icons feel like they need to grease themselves up in order
            to attract an audience. Moore's character chops her hair short at
            the beginning of the film in reaction to something her dad says, and
            isn't afraid to look as if a lawn mower just did a job on it. And
            she convincingly plays some difficult scenes where her adolescent
            character puts the breaks on her actions for reasons she's not
            entirely sure about -- she's going into areas where she doesn't feel
            like she should go, right now, and she takes the risk of following
            what her instincts are telling her, even if that's not going to make
            everyone happy, and even if it's not easy for herself, either.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film features strong
            performances by Holden and by Janney, whose character channels her
            disappointments over how things turned out with her marriage into
            such things as chopping vegetables and wedding the flower beds (the
            latter scene is a particular hoot); the late Nina Foch plays an
            adorable, medicinal cannabis-smoking grandmother -- the movie
            presents her rather risibly, even though Foch's performance is not.
            While the movie keeps its aim at being entertainment at the
            forefront, it turns out to be a small triumph for Moore, who creates
            a character who has integrity but is also someone you can relate to.
            You hope Trent Ford's Macon respects and appreciates what he's
            getting in the end with this girl.</font></td>
