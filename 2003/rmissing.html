            most effective moments in Ron Howard's <i>The Missing</i> concern
            Cate Blanchett's face. As Maggie, a &quot;healer&quot; in 1885 New
            Mexico, she contends with any number of daily difficulties, from
            single-parenting her daughters -- fractious Lilly (Evan Rachel Wood)
            and solid citizen Dot (Jenna Boyd) -- to making time for stalwart
            lover Brake (Aaron Eckhart). Not to mention the healing. In her
            first scene, she yanks out an old woman's bad tooth: as the patient
            wails, Maggie's own face is hard. And, oh yes, she asks, &quot;Can
            you pay me for this today?&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Maggie's
            toughness is at once enhanced and complicated by Blanchett's
            stunning beauty, and she does tends to select roles that frame her
            similarly, from <i>Elizabeth</i> (1998) and <i>Charlotte Gray</i>
            (2001) to <i>Heaven</i> (2002) and <i>Veronica Guerin</i> (2003).
            Here, she's downright bedraggled by film's end, as she spends weeks
            on dusty trails in search of Lilly, who is, within minutes of the
            film's start, kidnapped by a band of miscreants with plans to sell
            her to nasty Mexicans. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Maggie
            asks the sheriff (Clint Howard) to help, and he consults the
            military via telegraph, noting the wonders of the newfangled
            technology. Gazing outside while he natters, Maggie sees the
            fast-approaching future in the form of a voice-recording device,
            come to town with a fair. Feeling guilty that she made Lilly work
            instead of attending the fair, Maggie watches a girl smile as she
            hears herself. The reverse shot of Blanchett's face tells you
            everything you need to know, in one perfectly composed moment. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Salvatore
            Totino's camera repeatedly seeks out this face, and it never fails
            to convey complex emotional mixes. But while Maggie has wisdom and
            grit beyond most women in westerns, she's also confined by an
            increasingly contrived plot. For one thing, there's her long-absent
            father, Samuel Jones (Tommy Lee Jones, suddenly returned to atone
            for abandoning his family twenty years ago to live with the
            Chiricahua Apaches. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">How
            fortunate: not only can Jones track the kidnappers, he's also
            guarded over by a mystic hawk, plays action hero (leaping through
            windows and off cliffs, punching and kicking), and has an old Indian
            buddy Kayitah (Jay Tavare), who happens to be seeking the same
            marauders, who happen to have taken his son's wife to be. The saga
            that follows vaguely resembles <i>The Searchers</i>, with
            complications laid on top of those already structuring John Ford's
            original. Maggie the Indian hater learns to appreciate Jones'
            usefully potent magic, especially after she observes the cavalry,
            led by the excessively smarmy Lt. Ducharme (Val Kilmer), loot the
            home of a butchered white family. When she protests such disrespect,
            Ducharme shrugs it off as a symptom of spending too much time on the
            road, essentially. But he also makes clear that the worst fallout of
            the cavalry's use of Apache scouts amounts to &quot;contagion&quot;:
            race-mixing, he snorts, is all bad for the white race. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            whole scene makes Maggie think some; already worried that her
            father's immorality has to do with his &quot;Indian&quot;
            affiliations, she's struck by how wrongheaded the white guys in
            charge appear. But while <i>The Missing</i> raises this question --
            and again, Blanchett's face gives it suitable gravity and complexity
            -- it can't seem to stop from reducing the villain to that most
            egregious of scary stereotypes: the psychotic Apache <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">brujo</i></b> (witch). Pesh-Chidin
            (Eric Schweig) casts evil spells from across great distances, big
            pimps the poor girls he's stolen, and snarls and grimaces so as to
            accentuate the horrible scars on his face -- like some bizarre
            Halloween maskish reference to <i>The Searchers</i>' Cicatrice
            (Henry Brand). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Even
            amid his conventional horrors, the <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">brujo's</i></b>
            most disturbing trick is a resonant one, given the film's attention
            to technologies of the &quot;future.&quot; Pesh-Chidin wears small
            framed photos of his victims pinned to his vest; he forces a quaking
            white photographer to shoot these images for him, then flaunts them.
            Grimly haunting and glittering in the sun, they signify yet another
            recording practice, specifically the capture of faces. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">While
            this technology grants the pleasure of Blanchett on a wide screen,
            for Pesh-Chidin, image-taking is a means to possess bodies if not
            souls, to proclaim the supremacy of his will. His power is such that
            he lords over an oddly multi-raced band of marauders (which serves
            as an example for Lt. Ducharme of the dangerous consequences of
            race-mixing -- obviously, he's not fond of Jones either).
            Pesh-Chidin's gang includes whites and Indians (these last being
            disgruntled former cavalry scouts, mad at their abuse by racist
            white soldiers, now making money by way of the dominant capitalist
            system that has so abused them. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">That
            they are will be selling their &quot;merchandise&quot; south of the
            border compounds the film's multiple dilemmas regarding national and
            race boundary. Yet the film's focus remains unnecessarily resolute
            -- the father-daughter business takes up all its emotional energy.
            And so, Maggie and Jones play flipsides of John Wayne's Ethan
            without ever representing the invidious aspects of his narrow vision
            -- they come together to embody a new and improved
            &quot;searcher&quot; times two, who can forgive and be generous, one
            not locked in a past framed by fear and violence, a past comprised
            of racist legacy. With Kayitah and his son riding along as noble
            sidekicks, these better searchers make use of multiple magics, bible
            passages as much as native spirit chants, along with some sharp
            shooting, in order to rescue the stolen girls and defeat their
            enemies. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Certainly,
            Jones' devotion to the &quot;Indian&quot; ways is initially a
            problem for his daughter (he's like Costner's character, Dances With
            Wolves, going home again). Her budding tolerance looks toward a
            melding of cultures that never quite occurs. If only the film might
            have managed its many strands in a less reductive form. As it is, <i>The
            Missing</i> indicts the general push of modernization, as white
            populations move West and South, glances briefly at other futures
            offered by technologies (recording and military), and can't quite
            grapple with the displacement that is the white settlers' lot, by
            definition. <o:p>
