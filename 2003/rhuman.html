            Benton's <i>The Human Stain</i> looks sideways at racism. To that
            end, it opens in 1998, during the summer when Clinton, the States'
            &quot;first black President,&quot; is being impeached. According to
            narrator Nathan Zuckerman (Gary Sinise), the national obsession with
            self-righteous judgment and &quot;sanctimony&quot; frames the saga
            of aging classics professor Coleman Silk (Anthony Hopkins). <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Adapted
            by Nicholas Meyer from Philip Roth's 2000 novel, <i>The Human Stain</i>
            begins with a crisis for Coleman, who falls victim to a certain
            &quot;political correctness.&quot; A 35-year veteran teacher,
            department head, and dean at a small liberal arts college in
            Vermont, he is introduced holding forth on Achilles as a model for
            the Western literary tradition, in which the hero, Coleman intones,
            &quot;gets the girl.&quot; As such tradition speaks to presumptuous
            cultural desire, Coleman condemns and celebrates it at the same
            time: he sees through it and wants it too. As much as he is able to
            elucidate his world, he is, at the same time, its product.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            becomes clear when he notes that two of his students have never come
            to class. Frustrated, he calls them out, wondering aloud if they are
            actual beings or what he calls &quot;spooks.&quot; Little does he
            know that the missing students are black. And so the tedious tempest
            in this teacup begins. His own colleagues condemn his choice of
            language, however he intended what he said, and he resigns in a
            huff. He knows what he meant: why can't they just take his word for
            it? <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">When
            his loyal wife is so upset by the news that she dies -- on the spot
            -- by aneurysm, he can blame his accusers for yet another crime. Or
            at least this is what he tells the fellow he taps to write his
            story, Zuckerman, famous novelist and fellow Jew, who happens to be
            summering in a nearby cabin. Though Nathan asserts that the older
            man can do his own self-inventing, the two do become friends, and in
            the end, Nathan does tell the story, in and as <i>The Human Stain</i>.

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Coleman's
            life is complicated considerably when he meets the erratic,
            exciting, and utterly lovely Faunia (Nicole Kidman), college
            janitor, post office clerk, and cow milker. Her workaholism is less
            a matter of ambition (she was born rich and abandoned/was rejected
            by her family) than a way to keep busy. That is, the mythically
            named Faunia has her own unhappy history, including abuse by her
            stepfather, which is not a little creepy, considered alongside her
            erotic hijinks with a newly invigorated (that is, Viagra-ed)
            Coleman. She's a pistol, though, and he's moved by her toughness as
            much as by her vulnerability and stunning beauty: right after she
            invites him inside her above-the barn apartment, she growls,
            &quot;If you're lookin' for sympathy, you've come to the wrong
            place. I don't do sympathy.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            the relationship turns more earnest (at least according to Coleman's
            version of events, related to Nathan), so do the problems and
            presumptions that come with. She suspects that he likes
            &quot;fuckin' a cleaning lady,&quot; and even more urgently,
            Faunia's estranged husband, Lester (Ed Harris), turns out to be a
            glaringly damaged cliché of a Vietnam veteran. He functions here
            mostly to threaten the blissful couple, and indict the bad
            government and surveillance practices, as he uncraftily suggests to
            the shrink who queries him. As per his &quot;confessional&quot;
            function with the doctor, Lester gives up not only his own
            longstanding rage, but also the harrowing secret source of Faunia's
            own self-loathing while threatening her and Coleman with
            stalker-style violence.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            tends to happen in such grandly schemed stories, Faunia's
            self-abhorrence is more than matched by Coleman's, if not in precise
            kind, then in cultural verdict -- each is identified by trauma, his
            by race and hers by gender (or the expectations of gender). Nathan
            the narrator withholds Coleman's secret, that is, his blackness,
            until that point in the film when he must lapse into clumsy
            flashbacks. These reveal Coleman as a young boxer and college
            student (Wentworth Miller), with his family, and en route to his own
            life-defining secret, his decision to pass. It doesn't help matters
            that Miller resembles Hopkins not a whit (especially odd in this
            context is Hopkins' accent, perhaps affected as part of his passing
            apparatus; suffice it to say that Hopkins is distracting). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's
            hardly a coincidence that Coleman's pass involves bedding white
            women -- his first enthrallment involves blond coed Steena Paulsson
            (former <i>Real World</i>-er Jacinda Barrett). He instructs her on
            boxing, they laugh and have sex, the &quot;miscegenation&quot;
            moment bathed in golden light. He's frightened and thrilled by the
            untruth, takes her home to his mother Dorothy (flawless Anna Deveare
            Smith), whereupon Steena's horror at his deception (to underline:
            not his mother's, but the blond's) convinces him not to stop
            deceiving, but to do so relentlessly -- he will never again see his
            train porter father (Harry Lennix) or his decent, supportive mother.
            Her anguish at this news is moving, his resistance to her pain is
            horrifying: she sees immediately that he hasn't thought it through,
            that the lie precludes his fathering children (as the chance of a
            child revealing his race is too possible and too fearsome). His
            brother warns him to steer clear of the family. In other words, this
            decision is final. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">While
            Coleman plainly prospers following his decision -- he attends Pitt
            instead of Howard, imagines himself into a world of privilege and
            presumption he had only glimpsed previously, gets that gig at the
            college -- he's also, the film suggests, suffering, at least after
            he loses his job and the wife dies. Faunia is the one, the film
            supposes, who both reflects and understands him truly (this before
            she has a heart to heart with a crow, literally, after a fight with
            Coleman). &quot;I see you, Coleman,&quot; she insists. &quot;I see
            anger and I see shame. I see everything.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            film insists on Coleman's continuing tragedy, the self-hatred that
            drives and sustains it, and the ways it reflects a self-destructive
            and wholly unstable culture. While Nathan doesn't even learn of this
            self-shaping secret until it is too late (yet another facet of the
            tragedy), the film's structure reveals it sooner, which is all to
            the good, as Coleman's previous life scenes are the film's most
            well-acted and convincing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">While
            Nathan is expressly surprised to learn that the man he thought was
            Jewish is black, he also notes the irony of his having his career
            ended by being judged racist. Neither Nathan nor the film wrestles
            with the essential devastation here -- that Coleman bent his life to
            outwit the racist order that sought to identify him, but he also
            capitulated to it, and paid every day of his life. Nathan goes so
            far as to wonder whether admitting his blackness would have undone
            the charge of racism, not seeing that in fact, his life and his lie
            are functions of racism. <o:p>
