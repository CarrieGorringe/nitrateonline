            first kid you see in <i>Elephant</i> is headed to school. John (John
            Robinson) is riding uneasily with his drunken dad (Timothy Bottoms),
            the car weaving down a suburban street. The sun shines. The car
            nearly hits a mailbox. And John, sighing at the routine, has had
            enough. &quot;I'll drive,&quot; he announces, as the car pulls to a
            lurchy stop. Dad is dazed, vaguely flummoxed: &quot;What's the big
            deal?&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            deal, of course, is John's frustration, which he's to doing his best
            to ignore. By the time his father is wondering out loud if maybe
            John wants to go hunting with him this weekend, you're likely
            thinking that this kid, so polite and so put upon, is the shooter.
            This is because you know going in that Gus Van Sant's remarkable
            movie, winner of Cannes' Palme d'Or and Best Director prize, is
            about &quot;Columbine.&quot; Along with Paul Ryan's <i>Home Room</i>
            and Ben Coccio's <i>Zero Day</i>, <i>Elephant</i> takes up the
            events and effects of that terrible day when two boys carried
            assault weapons into their high school's hallways, taking deadly aim
            at startled fellow students and teachers. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            John will not be a shooter. Rather, he'll be one of several students
            <i>Elephant</i> follows through the day. After John, the camera
            picks up Elias (Elias McConnell), who's strolling school-ward with
            camera in hand, taking photos of kids he happens upon. He explains
            to one gothy couple that he's &quot;developing his portfolio...
            portraits mainly,&quot; assuming a future that he can have no idea
            will be disrupted this afternoon. They lean into one another,
            posing, as Eli suggests, &quot;Be a little happier.&quot; Right.
            It's funny, almost. They are happy, probably. But you won't see them
            again, so you can't know. They shuffle off through the dry leaves
            underfoot. They're young, they've got stuff to do, even if you'll
            never know what it is. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At
            school, Eli tends to his work in the dark room, encouraging another
            young artist, while other students go about their business. An
            obvious golden couple makes arrangements for the evening's
            activities, conferring about kegs and whom to invite; Michelle
            (Kristen Hicks), embarrassed by her apparent bodily imperfections
            (this being high school, all such stakes are too high), sits on a
            bench in the locker room, as girls behind her giggle and comment:
            the camera gradually approaches and circles Michelle's face, etching
            her pain into the very air; a trio of apparently perfect girls
            (Brittany Mountain, Jordan Taylor, Nicole George) sit in the
            cafeteria, where they chat about shopping and loyalty, eat a few
            chips, then head to their appointed bathroom stalls, where they
            vomit and flush in unison; and the Gay/Straight Alliance discusses
            how you read &quot;gayness,&quot; as the camera slowly circles the
            room, revealing the difficulty of just such reading. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            utter lack of urgency in these diurnal rhythms resonates throughout <i>Elephant</i>.
            For while the kids make dates and plans, you know, moment by moment,
            that catastrophe is imminent. Those coming to this film in search of
            &quot;answers,&quot; or any sort of sustained argument as to why
            such violence occurred will leave wanting. It offers no
            explanations. When you do see the killers to be, Alex (Alex Frost)
            and Eric (Eric Deulen), they don't look like monsters. They look
            like anyone else in this Portland, Oregon high school. They just
            happen to be wearing fatigues and carrying guns with sacks of
            grenades and ammunition. From here, the film cuts back and forth in
            time, showing Alex and Eric at home, watching a Nazi rally in some
            tv documentary, awaiting the arrival of their mail-order weapons,
            and playing a video game that looks a lot like Van Sant's last film,
            <i>Gerry</i>, as well as &quot;Für Elise&quot; on the piano. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Van
            Sant says the film's title references Alan Clarke's 1989 BBC film of
            the same name, about violence in Northern Ireland, specifically, the
            &quot;metaphorical elephant in the room no one wanted to
            recognize.&quot; The question is, what is there to recognize? What's
            at stake in not recognizing (or not wanting to recognize), and for
            whom? When people looked back on Columbine, fingers pointed every
            whichway, at Marilyn Manson and &quot;Doom,&quot; at satanic rituals
            and websites. Some folks noted that the boys were bullied (and here
            Alex suffers a spitball assault in biology class, and they lounge at
            home watching Nazi rally footage on tv, imagining the sense of power
            such seeming &quot;solidarity&quot; conjures). Before the shootings,
            however, no one was looking. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's
            ironic, perhaps, that shortly after <i>Elephant</i>'s initial
            limited release in the States, Columbine authorities released a long
            sat-on videotape of Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, with a couple of
            friends, target-practicing off in the woods. Laughing and fooling
            around, they look like other kids. Except, of course, you know more
            about them now than they did when they made the tape, and what you
            know makes the tape chilling, obvious, dire. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">Elephant</span></i><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;">
            never forgets that its shooters, Alex and Eric, also look like other
            kids. It doesn't demonize them, but instead, watches, alternately
            patient and tense. Frustrated and unhappy, ignored by most adults
            and abused by their peers, the boys seek connections while living in
            a culture where guns and vengeance narratives are not just normal,
            but also vaunted. Just before they costume themselves for the
            assault, they shower and go on to have sex, the stall peeped through
            a doorframe, pushed against the frame's edge. The scene might strike
            viewers several ways, not least being the potential charge that the
            kids are &quot;gay,&quot; a seeming symptom of their deviance. But
            this is too easy, and <i>Elephant</i> is never easy. Rather, the
            little bit of fear and desire evinced in their brief dialogue
            (&quot;I've never even kissed anyone&quot;) suggests, gently, that
            they are confused and sad, seeking only to have sex before the death
            they know is coming.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">&nbsp;

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Equally
            cryptic and intelligent is a character who shows up late, during the
            shooting spree, Benny (Bennie Dixon). The only black kid with lines,
            he walks through the school's hallways, not running from the sounds
            of gunfire and explosions, but toward them, as if he will rescue
            someone (and he does do that, sort of, helping a panicked girl out a
            ground floor window). When he does come on one of the shooters,
            however, the adventure you might have been hoping for -- hoping
            against hope, perhaps, thinking for a minute the film might turn
            into something it isn't -- can't emerge. And so the incoherent,
            unreasonable, and unfathomable violence continues. <i>Elephant</i>
            doesn't explain and it does not back down. It does ask you to look. <o:p>
