            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan
            Lybarger</a>, 14 November 2003</i></font>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>One of the
            more painful aspects (among many) in watching <i>Space Jam</i>, was
            a nagging sense that its creators had only a passing regard for the
            Looney Tunes characters or the remotest understanding of why viewers
            fell in love with Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck or Tweety in the first
            place. The voice actors frequently did a sloppy job of imitating the
            late, great Mel Blanc's distinctive touch in the classic cartoons.
            Further, the antagonistic relationships the characters had toward
            each other that made the original toons so funny was lost. Even
            though Bugs and Daffy had been used to plug products before, any
            serious lover of the Warner Bros. characters had to feel offended at
            being asked to pay theatrical admission for a ninety-minute Nike
            commercial</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">To its credit, <i>Looney
            Tunes: Back in Action</i> is an attempt to make up for how the first
            movie cheated the characters and their fans. Director Joe Dante
            helmed <i>Gremlins</i>, which was loaded with the kind of irreverent
            humor that made the Warner Bros. cartoons a naughty alternative to
            Disney's fare, and writer Larry Doyle is a veteran of the
            entertainingly caustic <i>Daria</i> and <i>The Simpsons</i>.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">People who, like
            me, love the series, will marvel at how well these guys know the
            source material. Look closely, and you'll spot the mother bear from <i>Bugs
            Bunny and the Three Bears</i> still making goo-goo eyes at Bugs
            after all these decades, and voice artist Joe Alaskey, who does
            Bugs, Daffy and a few others, manages the unenviable task of
            imitating Blanc's sounds expressively enough to match the needs of
            the current story.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">While the
            affection for the originals is really refreshing, <i>Looney Tunes:
            Back in Action</i> still stumbles over some formidable hurdles. For
            one thing, the originals were designed to keep a crowd occupied for
            a few minutes until the feature kicked in, not to take up an entire
            feature. Like <i>Saturday Night Live</i> sketches put on film (try
            sitting through eighty minutes of Dan Ackroyd doing that nasal
            Conehead voice), explosions and cartoon violence can get old in the
            long run.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">One also wishes
            Doyle had developed his story the way he sneaked in dozens of in
            jokes. The film begins with Bugs and Daffy sitting in with Warner
            Bros. executives (played by live action actors) during a fierce
            contract negotiation. As can be expected, the terminally jealous
            duck is tired of being the rabbit's foil. This time, however, an
            exec (Jenna Elfman) who's impatient with the bird's consistent prima
            donna behavior fires him.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Because the
            Looney Tunes are so much a part of the culture, the long series of
            self-referential gags isn't a problem at first. It's funny watching
            Bugs, Daffy and other Toons wandering around the studio complaining
            about the current demands of filmmaking. For example, Porky Pig
            bemoans that his trademark stammer is deemed &quot;politically
            correct,&quot; but execs inform him he's no longer funny without it.
            It's too bad the story doesn't stay on the lot because that's where
            it's most entertaining.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">When a bumbling
            security guard named D.J. Drake (Brendan Fraser) gets fired after
            trying to get Daffy off the lot, the two discover that D.J.'s father
            Damian Drake (Timothy Dalton) is more than Warner's top star. It
            turns out that Damian is so good at playing spies because he is one
            and has stumbled across a diabolical plan by the Acme corporation to
            enslave the world to its shoddy merchandise.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Imagine an entire
            planet reduced to imitating the Coyote's futile quest for the
            Road-Runner, and you can see the comic potential. Instead, the film
            gradually loses momentum. The long scenes where Steve Martin hams it
            up as Acme's Chairman of the Board don't help. Martin's strutting
            and preening aren't particularly funny, and at times he's too busy
            out-contorting his animated costars instead of trying to create a
            more worthwhile character. To be fair, the material doesn't give him
            much to work with. It's an indication of what's wrong with the rest
            of the film.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent:0in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">None
            of the human performers are as fun as their cartoon counterparts,
            and the adventure itself is short on thrills and is sometimes stingy
            on laughs. When your human contributors are as talented as Martin or
            Joan Cusack, this is inexcusable. Maybe the film might have worked
            better if it had been completely animated.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent:0in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There
            are enough freeze-frame moments to make <i>Looney Tunes: Back in
            Action </i>a decent rent. As with <i>The Simpsons</i>, there are
            gags that can't be easily seen while the film is running normally.
            Fans of Dante's earlier films like <i>Gremlins</i> and <i>Matinee </i>can
            spot funny cameos from actors who have been his regulars, and some
            of the most obscure Looney Tunes characters casually stroll by.
            Still, this is not the sort of content that merits spending $80
            million.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The new <i>Looney
            Tunes</i> <i>Golden Collection</i> box set features some astute
            comments from Dante, Alaskey and their collaborators. Their love for
            the Warner Bros. cartoons is better served there than it is in their
            own film.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"></o:p>
