            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by KJ Doughton, 24 
			January 2003</i></font><p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Welcome 
			to the inappropriately named <i>City of God</i>, a dust-encrusted 
			slum that taints Rio de Janeiro’s postcard-worthy beaches and 
			hotels, packed with roving gangs of amoral youth that rob, rape, and 
			shoot with shocking indifference to human life. Stewing in this 
			impoverished pot of ramshackle Brazilian housing projects, many of 
			these trigger-happy marauders are too young to shave. But they wield 
			an arsenal of illicit street weapons that would make Travis Bickle 
			stand up and take notice. Indeed, Cidade de Deus is less a city of 
			God than an open sewage valve from the gates of Hell. </font></b>
			</p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>City of God</i> opens with an 
			explosion of cutting knives, stomping feet, and cooking meat as a 
			street barbecue gets underway.&nbsp; The camera jostles about, like a 
			freight train struggling to remain on track, before zeroing in on a 
			fleeing chicken that doesn’t want to end up on a plate. Like a pack 
			of hungry wolves, several would-be diners pursue the terrified, 
			clucking bird as it navigates down stairwells, through alleys, and 
			across heavy road traffic.&nbsp; The abrupt, unexpected chase is a 
			telling hint at to how director Fernandes Meirelles will stage the 
			rest of his film – with furious momentum at a breathless pace.&nbsp; Like 
			Quentin Tarantino, Paul Thomas Anderson, and Martin Scorsese, 
			Meirelles explores the world’s darkest corners with a surprisingly 
			chest-pounding zest for life.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After <i>City of God</i>’s opening 
			scene slaps viewers in the face, the film rewinds to the sixties and 
			introduces us to its prepubescent, fresh-faced leads.&nbsp; There’s 
			Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues), who yearns to be a photographer, Lil’ 
			Dice (Leandro Firmino da Hora), a cherubic psychopath whose 
			horse-sized pearly whites show up best during the enthusiastic 
			shooting of rivals, and Benny, a mellow child-hippie with 
			coke-bottle glasses and a Woodstock afro.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We watch these children become 
			corrupted nearly from the time they leave the womb, as the trio 
			observes older siblings robbing gasoline trucks and looting hotels.&nbsp; 
			Any possibility of redemption through love is quickly stomped out 
			for these crooked role models, as they woo jaded women who seem to 
			know where everything will ultimately end up.&nbsp; &quot;Hoods don’t talk,&quot; 
			says one seen-it-all girl, &quot;they smooth talk. And they don’t stop. 
			They just take a break.&quot;</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Eventually, death takes its toll on 
			the City of God’s older generation of gangsters, leaving the turf to 
			younger upstarts.&nbsp; The most vicious kids, like Lil’ Dice, will rule 
			the roost and inherit the slum’s illicit drug trades.&nbsp; During one 
			hyperkinetic montage, the entire hierarchy of drug cartel employment 
			is outlined like a vocational training video. We’re shown assembly 
			lines of Brazilian families cheerfully manufacturing cocaine, 
			dividing their wares into packets and bundles. Such dope then falls 
			into the hands of delivery boys, while &quot;lookouts&quot; alert the cartels 
			to the presence of authorities by retrieving flying kites from the 
			sky as a type of reverse smoke signal. Upward mobility might 
			culminate in a position as &quot;soldier,&quot; before one ultimately attains 
			&quot;manager&quot; status.&nbsp; All this is contingent upon the cartel employee 
			surviving his first few days at this unholy trade.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>City of God</i> is meticulous in 
			its descriptions of well-intended individuals caught up in these 
			ferocious waves of street crime. One of many story threads follows 
			Knockout Ned, a bus driving ladies’ man, whose thirst for revenge 
			leads him off the path of righteousness and into the cartel scene.&nbsp; 
			Initially, Ned explains that he’s a principled gangster who insists 
			on &quot;no killing of innocents.&quot;&nbsp; Gradually, however, he learns that 
			such rules seldom survive on the unpredictable playing field of 
			criminal life.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meanwhile, Lil’ Dice rules the <i>
			City of God</i> with a cruel iron fist. In the most horrific of the 
			movie’s many wrenching scenes, he demands that a gang wannabe shoot 
			one of two street kids from a younger upstart gang. As the assassin 
			debates which target to fire on, the pair of little ones look on in 
			horror, whimpering all the while. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Despite the film’s despairing vibe, 
			Meirelles injects some hope in the form of Rocket. Although he 
			laments living &quot;a sucker’s life&quot; and feels as though honesty doesn’t 
			pay, this fundamentally decent kid marches to a more compassionate 
			drummer.&nbsp; In a hilarious series of scenes showing Rocket’s many 
			failed stabs at gangster life, Meirelles makes clear that his 
			protagonist doesn’t have the stomach to kill. After entering a café, 
			Rocket can’t bring himself to pull a gun on the cute waitress (he 
			chats her up for a phone number, instead).&nbsp; Attempting to rob a bus, 
			he quickly reconsiders, reasoning, &quot;I couldn’t do it. The driver was 
			too cool a guy.&quot; As his peers dodge bullets and sell to addicts, 
			Rocket stands a chance at escaping from his city’s violent 
			streets.&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">According to press information, 
			Meirelles chose his cast members not from the ranks of professional 
			actors, but from the actual streets of Cidade de Deus.&nbsp; If so, these 
			non-thespians pull off miraculous performances that smack of 
			natural, spontaneous realism.&nbsp; Firmino da Hora is especially 
			convincing as that hotheaded Lil’ Dice, flashing a dazzling, Donny 
			Osmond-caliber grin even as he’s brandishing handguns and whacking 
			his rivals.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meanwhile, the director keeps 
			things flowing at a fevered pace, while tossing in chunks of homage 
			to the world’s greatest directors. A bird’s eye massacre echoes the 
			finale of <i>Taxi Driver</i>, a 360-degree camera move borrows from
			<i>The Matrix</i>, and the messy, unpredictable violence is cut from 
			the same cloth as <i>Mean Streets</i> and <i>Goodfellas</i>.&nbsp; Its 
			split-screen effects hint at early seventies cop films, and a 
			montage of prayer and carnage pays tribute to the climax of <i>The 
			Godfather</i>. Rather than rip off these past influences, however, 
			Meirelles is tipping his hat to the masters while acknowledging that 
			he’s done his homework. This guy knows what he’s doing, and his 
			flamboyant array of camera tricks is a visual knockout that matches 
			the volatile nature of his story.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In spite of the undeniable 
			technical genius employed by Meirelles, <i>City of God</i>’s mayhem 
			and the distressingly tiny tots that perpetrate such bloodshed 
			demand that one ask the question, why subject oneself to a film this 
			unflinchingly brutal?&nbsp; One reason might be to acknowledge the depths 
			to which a society can descend without a moral beacon to guide it 
			through human history.&nbsp; Like <i>Schindler’s List</i>, <i>GoodFellas</i>,
			<i>The Pianist</i>, and <i>Casualties of War</i>, Meirelles’ window 
			into Brazil’s dark underbelly reminds us of the anarchy that 
			surfaces when the price of human life hits rock bottom.</font></td>
