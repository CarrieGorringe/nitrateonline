            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by
			<a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 
			14 February 2003</i></font><p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="5">A warm hole</font></span></p>
			<p><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Lockdown</font></span></i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
			opens with a swimmer slicing through the water. An unlikely start 
			for a movie about prison, the image is also acutely appropriate, as 
			the film tracks one man's descent into the disturbing waters of the 
			U.S. penal system. Avery (Richard T. Jones) moves quietly and 
			powerfully through the peaceful, deeply blue pool, as if in a dream.
			</font></span></b></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">From here, the 
			camera cuts to a bedroom, panning happy couple photos and trophies 
			on its way to framing Avery, lying in bed with his girl, Krista 
			(Melissa DeSousa). Together, they look forward to a future that will 
			take them -- and their young son Jordan -- far beyond their 
			neighborhood. That afternoon, a scout will be at Avery's swim meet; 
			having taken some time off to support his family, he now hopes to go 
			to college on a scholarship. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Like that first 
			shot in <i>Lockdown</i>, this initial situation is unusual, and 
			promising. It appears that the film, directed by John Luessenhop and 
			written by Preston A. Whitmore II (who made the thoughtful Vietnam 
			War drama, <i>The Walking Dead</i>), will offer characters and 
			motivations you haven't seen before. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">And then: the 
			clichés. A series of crosscuts to simultaneous scenes bodes ill. 
			Cashmere (Gabriel Casseus) first appears putting it to his 
			blond-wigged girl, who makes all sorts of &quot;bad girl&quot; noise. When one 
			of his street sellers comes calling, Cash drops everything, grabs up 
			his pit bull, and heads off to take care of bidness. &quot;Why you always 
			so amped, man?&quot; asks the dealer. &quot;Time is motherf*ckin' money,&quot; 
			comes the utterly predictable answer. Mad that his minion doesn't 
			have all the money he owes, Cash kicks him down the steps and 
			dismisses him, thus: &quot;Punk bitch!&quot; </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Having 
			demonstrated his hyped-up meanness, Cash drives off in his white 
			convertible Mustang to pick up Dre (De'Aundre Bonds), a quiet, 
			vaguely anxious kid who works a regular job. Cash asks Dre for the 
			millionth time to come in with him, and Dre explains, again, that 
			his mom would kill him. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">As these two 
			drive to see their boy Avery swim, it's clear that they'll bring 
			trouble. The twist is that they are not directly responsible, but 
			only act the part. While the film's primary threesome are down at 
			the meet, a couple of thugs round the way, Broadway (Sticky Fingaz) 
			and his soon-to-be-dead buddy, roll up on a fast-food drive-in, 
			canted smoky close-ups indicating their menacing, drug-induced 
			delirium. (Danger! Danger!) When the girl at the window won't give 
			them all her (obviously meager) money, they shoot her in the back, 
			in excruciating slow motion, then drive off to dump their weapon in 
			a car that looks like theirs -- Cash's Mustang</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">From here, the 
			plot goes where you know it will. Avery and Krista go to the meet, 
			he wins his race and makes good time, and the scout, Charles (Bill 
			Nunn), tells him that he's on his way -- three schools will be 
			interested. As soon as Avery and Krista embrace in celebration, his 
			boys appear in the white Mustang. Cops pull them over, Cash behaves 
			badly, and, a brief courtroom montage later, the three friends since 
			childhood are on the bus to a New Mexico prison.</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Once inside, 
			each is assigned to a different sort of cellmate. Cash hooks up with 
			Clean-Up (Master P, also executive producer on the film), the 
			joint's major drugs and goods mover. And Dre ends up with Graffiti 
			(David Shark Fralick), the resident Aryan a**hole who makes the poor 
			kid his bitch. And Avery gets a mentor, Malachi (Clifton Powell), 
			who schools him by reading from <i>Invisible Man</i>: &quot;Mine is a 
			warm hole, and I say this to you because it is incorrect to assume 
			that because I am invisible and live in a hole, I am dead.&quot; </font>
			</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Avery painfully 
			comes to terms with his own hole, and even finds some ways to make 
			rudimentary sense of it in the raging insanity of lockdown. He takes 
			a stand in defense of Dre, eventually extending himself beyond a 
			standard, if understandable, self-interest. And he learns some 
			important lessons about self-sacrifice. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The film also 
			gives Avery help that his friends do not have: though he suffers 
			brutal abuse from guards and fellow prisoners (Clean-Up sets the 
			tone when he roughs him up on the basketball court), he is also 
			fortunate to have folks working his case on the outside. Krista 
			collaborates with Charles, whose daughter happens to be an attorney 
			with spare time to spend on her dad's interests. This lucky 
			combination happens on a series of narrative contrivances; for 
			instance, they find a ready-to-be-turned Broadway, in prison for 
			life for another murder, as well as a judge who is willing to read 
			new documents, no questions asked. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Still -- and 
			while these character types and plot points are overly familiar to 
			anyone who's seen a prison movie or an episode of <i>Oz</i> -- <i>
			Lockdown</i> takes its political and ethical subjects seriously. Its 
			examination of gang affiliations and brutal hierarchies in prison 
			includes attention to the contraband economy that sustains violence 
			and criminal activities. Rehabilitation, in other words, hardly 
			seems the penal system's goal. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">True, as 
			Charles observes, &quot;It's not supposed to be easy. It's prison.&quot; At 
			the same time, the egregious abuses that occur in prison are real, 
			part of a systemic racism and degradation, as much as they are 
			instances of individual deviance. Melodramatic and sincere, <i>
			Lockdown</i> makes this case sensationally, but it does make it, in 
			ways that distinguish it from sensational prison flicks like 
			Seagal's trippy <i>Half Past Dead</i> (2002) or Stallone's 
			histrionic <i>Lock Up</i> (1989). <i>Lockdown</i>, in ways less 
			stylized than Walter Hill's <i>Undisputed</i>, underlines that the 
			institution is premised on abuse, cruelty, and a presumption that 
			all prisoners, guilty or not, &quot;deserve&quot; what they get, for being in 
			wrong places at wrong times. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">And, no small 
			thing, the film also boasts many fine performances, in particular by 
			Jones (best known recently for his co-starring role on <i>Judging 
			Amy</i>), Powell (<i>Dead Presidents</i>), and young Bonds (Junior 
			in <i>Get on the Bus</i>, currently incarcerated, in real life, for 
			manslaughter, a point that the PR machinery is emphasizing, 
			including an interview with him, from prison, on the official 
			website). </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">And Master P, 
			last seen on the big screen for a minute in <i>Undisputed</i>, 
			acquits himself admirably. Recently, he's been concentrating on his 
			son Lil' Romeo's career, stating in interviews that he wants to move 
			away from the street-tough, bling bling focus that characterized his 
			own work as an MC, and toward &quot;community&quot; and &quot;family&quot; concerns. 
			He's apparently putting his money where his mouth is. Though <i>
			Lockdown</i> has been waiting for theatrical release for some two 
			years, it demonstrates that his longstanding interest in film 
			production (<i>I Got the Hookup</i>, <i>Foolish</i>) is evolving 
			into an increasingly straight-up business. </font></span></td>
