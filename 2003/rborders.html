            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In <i>Beyond Borders</i>,
            Angelina Jolie -- she of the bruised lips and limpid eyes -- plays
            Sarah, who, in her white strapless gown and pearls, has no sooner
            finished pogoing to &quot;Should I Stay or Should I Go&quot; on the
            dance floor of a London formal-dress charity benefit in 1984 than
            she is knocked to one side by Nick (Clive Owen), who angrily
            denounces everyone in the room for eating fancy foods and drinking
            fancy wine while he's scrambling to find food and medicine to help
            the starving Ethiopian child whom he's (exploitatively) brought
            along with him. Sarah is so moved that she takes a convoy of food to
            the refugee camp in (then) war-torn Ethiopia, where, along the way,
            she rescues a child being stalked by a vulture (just like in the
            Pulitzer Prize-winning photograph) -- the child expresses its
            gratitude by glaring at her in what looks like decidedly CGI-created
            eyes. Nick also expresses his gratitude by ridiculing Sarah for
            wearing perfume for a trip into the desert -- he'll later confer his
            approval by noting that she did not wear perfume when she treks into
            Cambodia to see him.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Owen's Nick is definitely the more
            interesting of the two: he asks for help from the international
            community by issuing such subtle statements that go something like,
            &quot;They should get off their f**king asses and get the f**k down
            here!... It's the same s**t every time!&quot; He also isn't above
            smuggling guns under prosthetic legs and medicine packages -- when a
            Cambodian officer (Burt Kwouk) finds them, he starts switching Nick
            with what looks like a car radio antennae, until Jolie's Sarah steps
            in and really puts the kicks in! (All that training for the Lara
            Croft movies.) Later, after the scene with the baby and the live
            hand grenade, she and Nick will lead a long line of refugees,
            through the jungle, through the rain, to a Red Cross camp on the
            Vietnamese border, after which they will make passionate (but
            discretely-presented) love, then make cute post-coital banter. (He:
            &quot;Shall I ring down for room service?&quot; She: &quot;Chocolate
            cake, and air conditioning. That would be lovely.&quot; They're in a
            tent, mind you.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In part, this is a movie about
            Angelina Jolie's hair. Engaged in a serious conversation with her
            sister (Teri Polo, who's good), one can only notice how her hair
            falls in little bangs over her forehead. In the Cambodian jungle,
            the rain only makes it look darker, fuller, and more flowing. This
            is probably because her hair stylings are the most dramatic thing
            about her in this movie. The girl has serious emotive problems --
            she seems to have retreated as an actress over the years -- and her
            line deliveries, even in SDDS sound, can become as low and muzzily
            inaudible as in <i>Tomb Raider</i> (and she isn't even using an
            accent, here). I am aware that, in real life, she is engaged in
            actual humanitarian work in some of the places that also turn up in
            the movie, but one gets the impression that the film expects is to
            give it extra points just for dealing with the subject of relief aid
            to begin with, and that Jolie wants us to read a lot more into her
            earnstwhile presence, here, than is actually there. She is not
            terribly expressive; when she tries to be really expressive, she
            gets goggle-eyed.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film uses its first episode, in
            Ethiopia, to point up famine relief, the second the problem with
            land mines. (The bodies and ruined limbs are presented decorously in
            both.) The third, though, is devoted to rescuing not famine victims
            or victims of political terror but to rescuing Nick, disappeared
            somewhere into war-torn Chechnya, the current troublespot-du-jour.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Amid landscapes and backdrops of
            black, grays, and ghostly whites, Sarah, in a fetching (hopefully
            fake) fur hat and dark coat, runs across the snow with bullet-pocked
            Nick, and they look like something out of a second-rate version of <i>Doctor
            Zhivago</i>, where Yuri and Lara were trying to outrun the
            Bolsheviks. When one of the characters steps on a landmine and goes
            poof! you have a most unpleasant reaction.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film makes you think -- of
            Audrey Hepburn, who knew something about hunger when she and her
            family lived in the Netherlands under Nazi occupation, devoting the
            last 20 years of her live to famine aid in Africa and getting an
            international ban on land mines going when nobody else was
            interested. Of Médicines sans Frontières, and the volunteer medics
            in the documentary <i>Afghanistan Year 1370</i> who were performing
            truly heroic and selfless work. Sarah's husband (played,
            thanklessly, by Linus Roache, who is made to look like a drip) stays
            at home, even after she has caught him cheating on her, to look
            after two kids, one of whom isn't even his own. &quot;We'll talk
            about everything when I get back,&quot; instructs Sarah, wearing the
            latest in international relief chic, as she pushes her luggage out
            the door to save the world.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"></o:p>
