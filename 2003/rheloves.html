            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by Nicholas Schager, 
			14 February 2003</i></font><p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Audrey Tautou, the enchantingly 
			impish star of <span style="color:black">Jean-Pierre Jeunet</span>’s
			<i><span style="color:black">Amélie</span></i>, must have decided 
			that the best way to branch out as an actress was to go psycho. In
			<i>He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not</i>, Tautou plays Angélique, a 
			gifted student painter head-over-heels in love with her cardiologist 
			boyfriend Loïc (Samuel Le Bihan). Angélique is housesitting for a 
			family in Bordeaux, and the darling city – a vibrant, picturesque 
			wonderland of wine and roses – reflects the exhilaration of her 
			charmed life. Her only problem in the world is the annoying fact 
			that Loïc is married, and his wife is expecting their first child. 
			But despite the warnings of her friend (and secret admirer) David (Clément 
			Sibony), Angélique remains steadfast in the belief that Loïc will 
			soon leave his old ball-and-chain for a life with </font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This, however, is no simply 
			romance. Director Laetitia Colombani’s supposedly cheery film makes 
			an abrupt shift at its midpoint, devolving into a <i>Fatal 
			Attraction</i>-style portrait of female obsession; the film – which 
			spends the first forty minutes showing us life through Angélique’s 
			eyes – rewinds and begins again, this time showing us the same 
			events from <span style="color:black">Loïc’s very different vantage 
			point. It turns out that Angélique barely knows the strappingly 
			handsome if somewhat milquetoast doctor, and the scenes we’ve 
			previously witnessed of the two enjoying one another’s company are 
			nothing but the distorted projections of her severely warped mind.</span></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color:black">Ho hum. 
			Once this tired narrative device has reared its ugly head, what 
			we’re left with is a predictable tale of infatuation run amok. 
			Tautou, channeling Glen<span class="msoIns"><ins datetime="2003-02-18T07:54" style="text-decoration: none" cite="mailto:Carrie%20Gorringe">n</ins></span> 
			Close but coming up with little more than Amélie&nbsp; with a vacant 
			stare, apparently wants to distance herself from the wholesome, 
			playful image she’s now associated with. Unfortunately, the results 
			are about as convincing as casting Doris Day as the Angel of Death. 
			Tautou is given increasingly bizarre stalker affectations – first 
			she sends Loïc a rose and a note, then a painting of himself, and 
			finally a human heart with an arrow through it – but those enormous 
			doe eyes and irresistible dimples sabotage her attempts at real 
			psychosis.</span></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color:black">Even 
			disregarding the film’s latent misogyny – which, like many cinematic 
			tales of love gone awry, portrays deranged affection as a distinctly 
			female malady – <i>He Loves Me, He Loves Me Not</i> is very little 
			fun, and, even at ninety minutes, is easily thirty minutes too long. 
			Much of that unnecessary time is spent with Le Bihan’s </span>Loïc<span style="color:black">, 
			who, decked out in plain suits and spectacles that fail to convince 
			one of his intellect, is burdened by a reaction-only role that 
			simply requires him to look anxious and frightened. That the payoff 
			for our patience is a numb-skulled explanatory finale that, in a <i>
			Psycho</i>-inspired touch, provides a pat clinical explanation for 
			Tautou’s disturbed behavior, merely exposes the film’s considerable 
			lack of imagination.</span></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color:black">Colombani 
			has stated that her inspiration for the film was <i>The Sixth Sense</i>, 
			whose surprise ending forced viewers to reassess the validity of 
			everything that had preceded it. But by giving us the twist mid-way 
			through the film and then taking deliberate steps to show us how our 
			initial assumptions were wrong, the film is like a mildly clever 
			joke ruined by the ensuing explanation of why it’s funny. </span>
