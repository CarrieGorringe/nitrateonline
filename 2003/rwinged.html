            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			Nicholas Schager, 18 April 2003</i></font><p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">With its 
			majestic vistas of swooping birds traveling thousands of miles for 
			their annual migrations, Jacques Perrin’s <i>Winged Migration</i> is 
			one of the few films I’ve ever seen that is as suitable for my cats’ 
			viewing pleasure as for my own. A nature documentary that will 
			primarily appeal to those who find the planet’s feathered 
			inhabitants an endlessly fascinating subject for study, Perrin’s 
			documentary is filled with euphoric moments that transport us into 
			the heart of the migrating birds’ journey, placing us alongside them 
			as fellow voyagers on their regular fall and spring journeys for 
			food and safety. But be warned: with only scant narration and a few 
			meager subtitles providing basic information on the birds we’re 
			watching, the film doggedly follows its airborne travelers without 
			ever giving us much insight into their particular habits or 
			characteristics. It is a film both picturesque and blatantly empty.</font></b></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Perrin employed 
			over 450 people (including seventeen pilots and fourteen 
			cinematographers) for three years to capture the footage found in <i>
			Winged Migration</i>. Yet for all their hard work, what they’ve 
			ultimately compiled is gorgeous but context-less footage of birds in 
			transit. Perrin and his co-directors Jacques Cluzaud and Michel 
			Debats used a wide array of aircraft – some created specifically for 
			this film – in order to literally become part of the migrating 
			swarm, and there are numerous close-up aerial shots of the birds 
			that are breathtaking in their clarity and proximity. Whether it’s 
			the Eurasian Crane slicing through the air while making its 2,500 
			mile trek from Spain to Borneo or the Bar Headed Goose leaving India 
			for the Far East steppes, the film allows us to glide alongside 
			these regal creatures, darting in and out of their ranks with 
			seemingly effortless grace.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Perrin 
			occasionally interjects banal and overblown comments over the film’s 
			visual splendor, chiming in with pronouncements such as “Their 
			migration is a fight for life” that undermine the power of his 
			film’s images. Given Perrin’s penchant for making his scripted lines 
			sound either melodramatic or prosaic, and the infrequency of 
			informative tidbits, the film can’t maintain any sense of momentum 
			or consistency. The film jumps back and forth between various flocks 
			at different points in their migration, and after a while the 
			material blends together into one stunning but lifeless collage. The 
			impressive variety of birds on display (filmed on all seven 
			continents) are given no distinction by Perrin’s reverential gaze; 
			many are seen in all-too-brief snippets that merely highlight a 
			peculiar characteristic – for example, the Albatross’ penchant for 
			staying in the air over the ocean for amazing lengths of time – and 
			most others are presented with none of the vital background 
			information necessary to fully convey the epic nature of their 
			journeys. When we see a flock of birds reaching New York City’s 
			shores after their fall migration, the World Trade Center towers 
			glistening in the morning sunlight, the image is at once 
			heartbreaking and totally false, a carefully programmed moment 
			designed to make us feel as though the film is about more than 
			random visual brilliance. Similarly, an army of King Penguins 
			stretching as far as the camera’s eye can see is indisputably 
			striking. Not being told anything about these flight-impaired 
			creatures, however, is a nearly unforgivable deficiency.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If <i>Winged 
			Migration</i> is mainly a National-Geographic special distilled to 
			abstract proportions, there are enough awe-inspiring moments to 
			provide momentary exhilaration. Watching the Red Breasted Goose – a 
			bullet-like bird with red and black feathers that, in their design, 
			recall an imposing fighter jet – zip through a smoke-spewing Eastern 
			European refinery, only to have one of its flock wind up mired in 
			industrial waste, is just one of many entrancing moments provided by 
			the film; the problem is that once this scene is over, we never 
			glimpse these awesome birds again. Brain and Mr. Bungle – our 
			family’s avid and enthusiastic bird-watching felines – might find 
			this material mesmerizing, but I suspect that most human moviegoers 
			demand more depth from their nature programs than this superficial 
			documentary is willing to provide.</font></td>
