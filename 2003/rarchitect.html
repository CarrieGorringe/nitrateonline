            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Nathaniel Kahn's first feature, <i>My
            Architect</i>, takes him on a journey through his childhood and his
            problematic relationship with his father.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Now, we've all seen tedious versions of this
            I-never-knew-my-father paradigm before in countless documentaries,
            but Kahn's story was different;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>not only did Kahn not know his father, but as the film
            progresses, it transpires that no one else did as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Louis Kahn was one of the giants of mid-twentieth-century
            architecture:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>among his
            projects were the Salk Institute in La Jolla, CA, the Scripps
            Institute in Philadelphia, and the government buildings of Dacca,
            Bangladesh.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>His
            buildings are characterized by their special insistence upon their
            stark forms and the ways in which they allow natural light to flood
            into wide-open spaces, an ironic metaphor for the way in which Kahn
            conducted his personal life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>After
            his mysterious and anonymous death in Penn Station in 1974, it
            transpired that Kahn had been leading a triple life with two serial
            mistresses and two additional children born out of wedlock.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Moreover, the families lived within miles of each other, but
            only encountered each other at Kahn's funeral (the encounter was,
            needless to say, not a pleasant one, Kahn's wife having literally
            ordered the mistresses not to make an appearance). Nathaniel's life
            was characterized by both comic and tragic incidents:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>his father would appear at his house, once a week, usually
            under cover of darkness, spend some time with the
            &quot;family&quot;, then depart in the middle of the night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>His mother, despite her professional background (she was a
            landscape architect), seemed to play a role straight out of a weepy
            melodrama;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>she spent
            years hectoring Kahn to leave his wife for her (indeed, there is a
            strong implication in the film that the effects of Kahn's
            triple-dealing were beginning to take a toll:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>his fatal heart attack appeared to coincide with a promise he
            had supposedly made to Nathaniel's mother that he would, in fact,
            divorce his wife).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Nathaniel
            Kahn, left with no real legacy from his father in any sense of the
            term (his father died in debt), resolves to visit his buildings and
            his lovers, attempting to discover who his father really was.</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In examining his father's life,
            Kahn encounters a man who had always lived according to his own
            rules (he had lost several contracts – among them the opportunity
            to reshape downtown Philadelphia during the 1960s -- because of his
            refusal to compromise his standards), and his responses to other
            people's attitude toward design was not always politic.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>He could also be remarkably insensitive (upon hearing that
            his second mistress was pregnant, Kahn's response was, &quot;Not
            again!&quot;).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Yet, he
            also was capable of a degree of personal loyalty (the film implies
            that one of the reasons that Kahn did not divorce his wife had much
            to do with the fact that she had been his primary means of financial
            support early in his career), however imperfect or incomplete.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>How to explain this man who was so direct in his work and so
            equivocal in his personal life?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>After five years of examination and travel, Nathaniel Kahn
            finds, at best, only a partial answer, in the person of a government
            representative from Bangladesh, who tentatively posits that Kahn was
            a man who was brilliant but remarkably &quot;immature&quot; in his
            private life – the old &quot;Transgressive Genius&quot; chestnut.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </span>In what are the most painful moments in the film, Nathaniel
            Kahn confronts his mother and, though his questions, obliges her to
            come to terms with the years she wasted living in her own illusions
            about her lover;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>she,
            too, is a victim of incompleteness, albeit that which she willingly
            (or willfully?) inflicted upon herself and her son.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Perhaps, as Nathaniel Kahn's extensive use of archival
            materials demonstrates, the real answer to Louis Kahn's identity
            lies exclusively in the works he left behind, and, as much of his
            work was not realized during his lifetime, it seems as if his son's
            work (i.e., to understand his father) is destined to suffer the same
            end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><i>My Architect</i>
            is an absorbing work, both damning and enlightening.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"></o:p>
