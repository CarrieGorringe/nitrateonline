            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 7 February 2003</i></font><p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Class -- real class -- is dying 
			in American film, but, brother, that's not stopping 'em from chasing 
			after it, still. Mel Gibson brought about a minute of it to <i>What 
			Women Want</i> when he picked up a brown fedora and did an impromptu 
			softshoe to a Sinatra recording. And the ballet of umbrellas 
			(photographed by the late, great Conrad Hall) during a climatic 
			scene in <i>Road to Perdition</i> was one of the most gorgeous, 
			unexpected, and elegant things I saw in any film last year. Recent 
			promo spots on American Movie Classics have pretty much completed 
			the codification of Audrey Hepburn into the essential icon of class, 
			whether as the woman in a sheath dress peeking at you from behind 
			insouciant sunglasses partially hidden under a wide-brimmed hat, or 
			riding on the back of Gregory Peck's motor-scooter through Rome 
			streets. Hepburn's grace and style was hard-won, but the fact that 
			she never asked for pity or approval in exchange for it was one of 
			the things that gave her genuine class.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days</i> 
			-- which was also photographed, beautifully at times, by the fine 
			cinematographer John Bailey -- has a few moments at the end where 
			Liliane Montevecchi, the veteran French cabaret and stage star, 
			vamps her way through partygoers at a black-tie occasion, wearing a 
			cloche hat made from feathers dyed a brilliantly flaming red. 
			Montevecchi is pretty much working at half-speed, here, and her 
			performance may strike some as eccentric or corny -- she is a French 
			cabaret star, not Pink -- but it's about the closest this film ever 
			comes to the style it so desperately seeks. When she bends her body, 
			neck, and arms to form a pose for a diamond commercial being made by 
			the ad agency where Matthew McConaughey's character works, she does 
			so in a way that makes you think &quot;elegant,&quot; whether you're familiar 
			with the Erté figures which she's drawing inspiration from or not.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As for the rest of the movie.... 
			Kate Hudson plays a writer for a glossy women's magazine (edited by 
			Bebe Neuwirth, coiffed and clothed to look like Diane Vreeland) who 
			takes on the task of writing an article on how the average girl can 
			drive a guy out of her life in no time flat, once she's nabbed him 
			and, presumably, before the guy has the chance to dump her and make 
			her emotionally crash. The writers of this movie (Kristen Buckley, 
			Brian Regan, and Burr Steers -- the latter responsible for last 
			year's widely acclaimed comedy <i>Igby Goes Down</i> -- working from 
			a book by Michele Alexander and Jeannie Long) decide that the only 
			way they can get Hudson's character to pick up a guy fast enough for 
			her to start driving him crazy and still meet her deadline is to 
			have her just happen to target the one guy in a whole roomful of men 
			who, without her knowing it, has targeted her in order to win a bet 
			that he can get a girl to fall in love with him in no time flat 
			(plus win the advertising account for a diamond retailer -- the 
			reason for the black-tie party mentioned above -- to which end he's 
			egged on by two slithery women, played by the almost sinfully 
			beautiful Michael Michele and Shalom Harlow). Matthew McConaughey is 
			the actor assigned to carry out this task, and while some may find 
			his bone structure and Texas accent makes him &quot;genuine,&quot; he still 
			looks like a garter snake sliding through mulch. Kate Hudson is more 
			appealing, but then the role asks her to overdo the oochy-coochy 
			stuff -- dumping stuffed animals in her new boyfriend's apartment, a 
			potted fern, a dog from outer space, disrupting the boys' poker 
			night -- until you're ready to attack her with a hammer. She also 
			withholds sex from him, and attempts to nickname a part of his 
			anatomy, a practice I thought had become extinct after the look that 
			came over Richard Burton's face when a girl introduced him to each 
			of her bodaceous ta-tas in <i>Bluebeard</i> (1972).</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Inevitably, the two lead characters 
			realize that they've been working at cross-purposes, but so has the 
			movie: having McConaughey's character deceiving Hudson the whole 
			time actually has the effect of undercutting both her character and 
			the whole story of the movie -- after all, the title says that the 
			film's supposed to be about what a girl does to a guy -- the effect 
			of which nullifies our taking either of the lead characters 
			seriously or having any feelings one way or the other about how 
			they're being fooled. But the movie is also surprisingly short on 
			motivation: it provides no more reason for the characters to start 
			falling in love with each other than it does for them to start 
			scheming, and hence act mercenary, towards each other. By the end, 
			Hudson and McConaughey get stuck in the middle of an embarrassing 
			scene where they start yelling at each other, in rhyme, at the big 
			black-tie party, accompanied on the piano by no less than Marvin 
			Hamlisch, whose looks at the two performers pretty much sum 
			everything up.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Which brings us back to the matter 
			of class -- evoked by the film's conclusion, which is done in a rush 
			in much the same way that Shirley MacLaine rushed back to Jack 
			Lemmon's apartment in <i>The Apartment</i>. Billy Wilder could do 
			&quot;class,&quot; but he also knew that you have to have some oomph to go 
			along with it. (That film's closing line was, after all, &quot;Shut up 
			and deal.&quot;) <i>How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days</i> wants to be in the 
			same league as the fluffy, romantic, battle-of-the-sexes comedies 
			which Hollywood, from the filmmakers' point of view, used to turn 
			out on a regular basis (well, two out of three attempts) all the 
			time. In trying to keep things innocuous, though, it ends up making 
			itself toothless. But it does come up with one interesting moment: 
			Kate Hudson hijacks Matthew McConaughey's CD player at one point and 
			starts jauntily singing along to Carly Simon's recording &quot;You're So 
			Vain,&quot; a song that's supposed to be about Warren Beatty, with whom 
			Hudson's mother, Goldie Hawn, worked on the film <i>Shampoo</i>. If 
			only the rest of the film were so smart, funny, and knowing.</font></td>
