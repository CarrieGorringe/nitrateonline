            begins with a familiar bit of videotape: Rodney King's beating by
            L.A. police officers. Twelve years later, and as many times as
            you've seen George Holliday's tape, it still horrifies. Worse,
            following the Simi Valley verdicts and the L.A. uprising, it has
            become an emblem of U.S. racism and injustice. It is, perhaps, in
            this sense that the image continues to resonate most deeply. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">With
            all this in mind, the decision to start with Holliday's footage
            seems nervy. You wouldn't call up the memory or the legacy without
            something serious or at least thoughtful, to say about it.
            Unfortunately, <i>Dark Blue</i>, set in 1992, doesn't get much
            beyond using the trial of the four officers as ominous backdrop for
            its focus -- a team of corrupt, self-righteous cops. The trial pops
            up on TV screens and in conversation, as detectives worry that the
            city will &quot;explode&quot; if the verdict is not guilty. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">You
            know they're right about this, and so, you wait for the inevitable.
            Most annoyingly, by the time the inevitable comes to pass, the rest
            of the movie has devolved into conventional action-melodrama,
            complete with bad white cops' sacrifice, redemption, and just
            punishment. Its troubling race politics may not be quite so
            egregious as <i>Mississippi Burning</i> (or, for that matter, Alan
            Parker's new movie, <i>The Life of David Gale</i>, opening the same
            day as <i>Dark Blue</i>), but it's in the ballpark. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">That's
            not to say the film doesn't feature black characters with speaking
            parts, or even that these characters aren't formidable in their own
            right. You have your two black cops -- noble deputy chief Arthur
            Holland (Ving Rhames) and his efficient assistant, Sergeant Beth
            Williamson (Michael Michele) -- as well as a couple of predictably
            excessive black thugs (both well played by Kurupt and Master P; Kurt
            Russell observes that &quot;Rappers in general are really good with
            words -- they're really good with lines,&quot; but seriously, these
            cats can act). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">With
            the trial going on, Holland, for one, has his hands full: his
            diverse community, not to mention his officers, are increasingly on
            edge, and his career (he wants to be Los Angeles' first black police
            chief) is increasingly uncertain. Still, Holland, Beth, and the
            designated criminals are plainly in place to serve the larger story
            of white detectives, presuming privilege and suffering guilt. And
            this means that the issues surrounding &quot;Rodney King&quot; (the
            events and media coverage more than the man, who appears only as the
            crumpled form beneath blurred police batons). These issues --
            poverty, abuse, institutional racism -- are reduced to background,
            overcooked and accompanied by Terence Blanchard's jazz-bluesy score.
            This is a scary city, where scary figures hang out on scary corners
            and slouch with scary insouciance. No wonder the cops are tense. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Here,
            the primary tension emerges in the Special Investigations Squad.
            Much like Rampart's infamously shady anti-gang unit (CRASH), SIS
            regularly plants evidence, threatens informants, executes suspects,
            and steals from local businesses, justifying its &quot;work&quot; as
            ridding the city of drug-dealing, violent scum (this rationale will
            also be familiar to viewers of FX's <i>The Shield</i>). Adapted by
            David Ayer (<i>Training Day</i>) from a story by James Ellroy (<i>L.A.
            Confidential</i>), and directed by Ron Shelton (<i>Play It To the
            Bone</i>), <i>Dark Blue</i> comes with the usual &quot;somber&quot;
            buddy movie concerns -- overweening machismo, loyalty, racism, and
            the loss of a good woman. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Top
            SIS detective Eldon Perry, Jr. (Kurt Russell), has bits of Russell
            Crowe's Bud White and Guy Pearce's Exley in him. For the first, he's
            the Squad's muscle, dispatched by boss Jack Van Meter (Brendan
            Gleeson) to clean up messes, with whatever force seems necessary:
            &quot;Just go do what you do,&quot; snarls Van Meter. And for the
            second, Eldon comes from a long line of cowboy-cops, and feels
            pressed to live up their examples. In fact, he goes so far as to
            cite his actual-cowboy grandfather's enviable ability to go round up
            a cattle thief and hang him without any such thing as due process.
            By this point, late in the film, he's under considerable duress, and
            it could be that he's using these good old days ironically, to
            exemplify the dire corruptions of the current system. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Then
            again, maybe he wishes the good old hang 'em high days were back in
            effect. As he embodies this current system, Eldon carries a
            particular burden. He sees himself as the defender of the law,
            believing that he must work outside the law to do so. He blames his
            own extreme behavior on the fact that all the criminals are more
            extreme, exemplifying the argument made by the police officers on
            trial: Rodney King, as the defense infamously had it,
            &quot;controlled and directed&quot; the encounter, and so required
            sustained brutal force to be subdued. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Believing
            that such force is necessary, Eldon's investment in his identity as
            a cop has taken its toll. He's descended into alcoholism and, as one
            deft scene in particular suggests, feels painfully distanced from
            his corrections-officer wife Sally (Lolita Davidovich) and
            adolescent son. To illustrate, he comes home from a hard day at the
            review board, whereupon he recounts for wifey how he lied.
            Specifically, he covered up the fact that he shot a suspect because
            his wussy-newbie partner, Bobby (Scott Speedman), was supposed to be
            getting his &quot;first shoot&quot; credit. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">This
            tangle of deceits and masculine measures is only the tip of the SIS
            iceberg. Partly depressed by the partner's lack of machismo and
            partly worn down by his own excess of it, Eldon sits on the sofa
            with Sally, unable to find a way to talk to her except in bang-bang
            cop stories. She's tired of it. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">No
            surprise: Eldon misses that cue. Instead, he drinks that night, and
            next day, redevotes himself to being the perfect &quot;team
            player,&quot; in order to make order of his mounting chaos. His
            mentoring of Bobby is complicated by the fact that the kid is also
            Van Meter's nephew. Worse, said kid is increasingly queasy about the
            job's requisite immoral and illegal activities (this angle recalls
            the generational and ethical dynamics of <i>Training Day</i>).
            Still, simultaneously impressed and intimidated by Eldon, Bobby
            works hard to win approval: when he devises an adept reading of a
            crime scene, Eldon almost smiles. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">For
            an added complication, Bobby is also having girl issues,
            specifically, an affair with Beth, which he is careful not to
            mention for fear of his overtly racist partner's likely reaction.
            Though Bobby and Beth agree upfront that they don't even want to
            know each other's last names, well, things change, and he starts to
            really like this girl. Wouldn't you know, he grows a conscience
            large enough to disrupt his initiation into the SIS. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">All
            the while, subplots pile up like dead bodies. Holland is suspicious
            of the film's initial (offscreen) shooting, the one approved by the
            review board; he initiates an investigation, which in turn invites
            payback: Van Meter has incriminating pictures of him and a woman who
            is not his wife (Khandi Alexander, memorable in what might best be
            termed a &quot;thankless role&quot;). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Everyone
            plays dirty. Van Meter assigns Bobby and Eldon to a multiple
            homicide at a Korean-owned convenience store (more shades of <i>L.A.
            Confidential</i>). The primary suspects are a conveniently
            interracial team (Dash Minok and Kurupt) who happen to be working
            under Van Meter's auspices. Boss man instructs Eldon to pin the
            murders on two locals with records and Bobby grows even queasier --
            as the trial winds to its verdict and the city's minority
            communities are roiling, the film narrows its focus to the white
            guys' blooming angsts. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">At
            this point, Eldon would embody the imploding city if he had a clue
            what was wrong. Or rather, his drive toward self-awareness is made
            visual as he careens through the streets en route to the showdown;
            he's still hunting his prey, even though (or because) he knows the
            worst injury has already been inflicted and that he's largely partly
            responsible. As Eldon's life and self-image collapse, the city
            burns. And Barry Peterson's cinematography turns alternately poetic
            and devastating: looters, assailants, and frightened locals rush
            past Eldon's car: he's fierce and irrational, they're menacing,
            confused, feeling suddenly entitled in ways they'd never imagined
            possible. It's a stunning sequence, but it only reveals <i>Dark Blue</i>'s
            lost opportunities. <o:p>
