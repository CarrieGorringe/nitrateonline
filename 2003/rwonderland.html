            Holmes was the first porn star,&quot; begins James Cox's <i>Wonderland</i>.
            This is not exactly true, of course, as there were porn stars before
            and alongside Holmes, also known as Johnny B. Wadd and Big Jon
            Fallus, but none has achieved quite his notoriety. Most initial
            memories of him have to do with numbers, many of them stunning, even
            for a porn star taking full advantage of 1970s Hollywood: 14,000
            women, 2,000 porn films, 14 inches (or 13, or 15), two wives, $3,000
            a day, 50 valiums at a time, and, most horrifically, 4 brutal
            murders. <o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">This
            last figure occasions <i>Wonderland</i>, a mostly strange and lurid
            account of the contradictory stories concerning Holmes' involvement
            in the 1981 Laurel Canyon murders. That is, the gruesome
            bludgeonings of a group of Holmes' acquaintances: drug dealer and
            Wonderland abode owner Ron Launius (fuzzy-faced Josh Lucas), his
            slow-minded buddy Billy Deverell (Tim Blake Nelson), Joy Miller
            (Janeane Garofalo), and bystander Barbara Richardson (Natasha
            Gregson Wagner). Ron's wife Susan (Christina Applegate) was also in
            the house when the assailants struck -- with pipes and urgency --
            and though she survived, she suffered severe brain damage and could
            never identify the killers. While these were presumably thugs sent
            by local gangster Adel Nasrallah, a.k.a. the most generically named
            Eddie Nash (Eric Bogosian), who here comes complete with sleazy
            affect, short silk robe, and a bodyguard played by Faizon Love. Nash
            apparently sent his underlings to exact payback for a robbery of his
            home; the case was never officially solved and Holmes' part was
            never determined. Arrested in Florida six months later, charged and
            acquitted of the crime, Holmes died of AIDS-related illness at age
            forty-three, in 1988.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            story of the murders lingers in legend, in part because of the sheer
            horror of the crime scene (rendered here in bloody detail, more than
            once), and in part because of the squirmy Holmes association. One
            version informs Paul Thomas Anderson's <i>Boogie Nights</i>, in
            which Holmes, transformed into Dirk Diggler (Mark Wahlberg), appears
            a naïve victim of his own ambitions and self-delusions. In Cox's
            less rhapsodic recounting, Holmes (Val Kilmer) is a self-loving
            lout, coke addict, and liar, seemingly unable to comprehend (or much
            care about) the destruction he brings to anyone in his vicinity. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><i>Wonderland</i>
            begins when Holmes is past his porn prime, and endeavoring, sort of,
            to convince his beautiful, Farrah-haired girlfriend Dawn Schiller
            (Kate Bosworth) to come back to him. Though she's been with him for
            five years (since she was fifteen), she's tired of living in a
            series of skuzzy L.A. motels, and has run off with her Chihuahua.
            Picked up on the street and sheltered with a sputtering good
            Samaritan, Sally (Carrie Fisher), Dawn listens impatiently to her
            advice: &quot;That boyfriend of yours. Talk about your demons! He's
            bad news.&quot; But, considering the dullsville existence embodied
            by Sally, the poor girl just can't help herself when her man arrives
            to fetch her, bearing apologies for his latest infraction and, no
            small thing, good drugs. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Mr.
            Bad News' entrance -- lurching, hirsute, desperate -- is almost
            startling, emphatically establishing his look and behavior for the
            rest of the film. Still caught up in his own &quot;legend,&quot;
            he's jonesing for affection as much as for drugs or any other
            diversion. Dawn provides the reflection he needs, willing to see him
            as stud and supplier, lover and father figure. While the film takes
            a moment here to show the noisy urgency of their liaison (at this
            moment, on the Samaritan's bathroom sink), it's frankly uninterested
            in such acrobatics or in sex per se. They go through motions for a
            camera at low and close angles, cut into a semblance of jerky,
            anxious immediacy. Discovered by Sally, they run off to John's
            broken-down car, giddy and childish, big-eyed Chihuahua in
            tow.&nbsp;</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">If
            sex is not <i>Wonderland</i>'s focus, neither is the extravagant
            violence to come. This despite the fact that the murder scene --
            infamously first caught on police &quot;crime scene&quot; video, and
            the first time that such evidence was used in a courtroom -- is
            represented more than once in a Rashomon-ish hodgepodge. The first
            narration belongs to biker David Lind (Dylan McDermott, disguised
            under beard and leather jacket), a friend of Launius' whose
            flowerchild girlfriend Barbara is among the massacred. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Another
            version emerges in John's interview with a detective, Bill Ward
            (M.C. Gainey). This narrative, so obviously self-serving and cagily
            incomplete, takes the form of a weirdly ineffective seduction,
            hinting at John's previous performative skills as well as his
            onetime friendship with Bill, apparently premised on John's
            celebrity. That they're conversing for a police microphone, and both
            perform with some sense of self-importance and conspiracy, doesn't
            speak well for the cop, but it does underscore John's deathless
            charm. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Still
            another rendition of the story comes late in the film, offered
            reluctantly in flashbacks by Holmes' wife Sharon (a stunning Lisa
            Kudrow), in which he shows up at her place in shock and bloodied
            clothing on the night of the crime; she plainly resists being
            carried along by the tidal wave of John Holmes' colossal ego, but
            finds herself drawn, to him and to Dawn (an epilogue reveals that
            the women were lifelong friends, following their involvements with
            Mr. Wadd). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">All
            of these stories resemble each other in basic organization, in
            Launius' crew's infraction and Nash's retaliation. But John's
            participation, as snivelly snitch or sadistic killer or some entity
            in between, is never determined absolutely. And though <i>Wonderland</i>
            does present all sorts of explicit and harrowing images, it really
            is about the inability to represent something so elusive as truth,
            even when it might be reduced to something so apparently irreducible
            as bodies -- sexed, dead, absolutely pornographic. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">It's
            on this point, the exceedingly unpoetic ambiguity of experience, as
            it's remembered, willed, or narrated, that <i>Wonderland</i> makes
            the most sense. Though it spends some time introducing the miserable
            victims (junkies and pretenders, they incarnate the bottom John has
            &quot;hit&quot; more than they are detailed characters), as well as
            John's own self-inflations, the movie is about loss and perpetual
            transience rather than certainty. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Cox
            and Captain Mauzner's script -- drawn from an unmade screenplay by
            Todd Samovitz and D. Loriston Scott, as well as interviews with the
            real Dawn and Sharon, and various Holmes legends -- offers no
            conventionally sympathetic characters or resolution. Porn is
            supposed to be real sex, choreographed for viewer arousal. But the
            truth of it is always more complicated. Just so, there's no truth in
            this true crime, only the fictions that sustain
            &quot;Hollywood,&quot; and all of its literal costs and metaphorical
            relations. It's a grisly business. <o:p>
