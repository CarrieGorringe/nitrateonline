            Spade movies are pathetic by definition. Or more precisely, they
            repeatedly interrogate the concept of pathetic-ness, what it means
            to be considered pathetic. In films like <i>Black Sheep</i> (1996)
            or <i>Joe Dirt</i> (2001), or even his long running sitcom, <i>Just
            Shoot Me</i>, Spade engages in said interrogation. His character,
            always some spin on his so-snarky <i>SNL</i> persona, gripes about
            his pathetic life, the pathetic world, and the especially pathetic
            circumstance wherein he appears to be the only participant with a
            sensibility ironic enough to recognize just how pathetic it all is. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Spade's
            latest filmic adventure, <i>Dickie Roberts: Former Child Star</i>,
            is more of the same. Co-produced by fellow <i>SNL</i> alumnus Adam
            Sandler, it follows the efforts of Dickie (a cute blond kid who
            grows up into Spadeness) as he attempts to recover his career -- or,
            as he puts it, recover the &quot;love&quot; he experienced when he
            was a child star. Not only did he &quot;feel&quot; the affection of
            his fans, he gushes, but he also felt loved by his obnoxious mom
            (Doris Roberts in an angry <i>E! True Hollywood Story</i>
            interview), who &quot;left him&quot; once the money dried up, way
            back when. He tells this tale, not incidentally, during his weekly
            card game with the other former child stars -- Leif Garrett, Barry
            Williams, Danny Bonaduce, Screech, and one of the Coreys -- who
            commiserate with him for a minute, then wish him all the best on
            that audition he's got with Rob Reiner.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            new role will supposedly make everything right -- no more parking
            cars, no more missing his trashy girlfriend Cyndi (Alyssa Milano),
            no more conniving with his fellow has-beens, no more missing his
            miserable mom. If only, as Reiner puts it, Dickie might be able to
            call on a &quot;normal&quot; childhood for reference. But he's so
            distinctly abnormal (wearing gloves 24 hours a day, wearing the
            approximately same smirk and hairstyle as when he was a child) that
            there's little chance that Dickie will be able to make this leap
            into imaginative banality. It's just too much for his addled brain
            to wrap around. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And
            so he comes on the sort of plan that props up this sort of movie: he
            sells his apparently long-awaited autobiography, minus the juicy sex
            bits, and uses the cash to hire a family, with whom he will relive
            his childhood (for a month), or rather, live one that doesn't
            include learning feeble punchlines (his personal signature is
            &quot;That's nucking futs!&quot; and he's asked to repeat it by
            every civilian who spots him), mugging for publicity shots, doing
            drugs, and sleeping with his costars. The new arrangement means that
            Dickie/Spade gets to behave badly while remarking on the pathetic
            normalcy of his well-remunerated hosts.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">These
            are comprised of greedy car salesman dad George (Craig Bierko),
            ideal mom Grace (Mary McCormack), brother Sam (Scott Terra), and
            cute little sister Sally (Jenna Boyd). Indeed, mom is so very ideal
            that Dickie comes up with the best compliment anyone's ever paid her
            (or so she says), &quot;They don't write moms as good as you!&quot;
            (Speaking of sitcom writing, everyone in this family except George
            is blond like Dickie, so it's not hard to guess how it all falls
            out.) While Grace is pleasantly clueless (though properly appalled
            when he announces &quot;I love all this normal crap!&quot;) and dad
            is missing in action, Sam and Sally immediately recognize Dickie as
            a loser and banish him to their abandoned tree house. No matter: he
            turns it into a happening place with disco ball and &quot;Burning
            Inferno&quot; on the suddenly installed stereo system (it's so great
            when normal life works like a TV show), and the kids are
            appropriately wowed. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            bonding moment leads to more, and soon, Dickie is dissing the
            bullies who pick on Sam (calling them &quot;piggy,&quot; like it's a
            great triumph), showing Sam how to seduce the beautiful new neighbor
            girl, the strangely named Barbie (Ambyr Childers), and teaching
            Sally the most terrific choreography for her pep squad tryouts. Her
            routine is tres PG, as opposed to her rival's Britney-esque
            business; when Sally wins the day, the message appears to be that,
            for all Dickie's loud complaints about his own experience, it's
            better than what today's &quot;kids&quot; endure. Grace and the kids
            also make a point of teaching Dickie the joy of getting a new bike
            on Christmas morning, so that he's able to nail the audition. Yay
            for him. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            Dickie gets to rethink his childhood while also making current kids
            feel like their lives are &quot;crap,&quot; he also finds a way to
            rearrange his so-called adult life. By far the weirdest turn the
            film takes involves Dickie and his surrogate mother Grace. Early on,
            he observes to Sam and Sally (with whom he shares a bedroom) that
            &quot;mom&quot; is &quot;hot,&quot; and while this grosses them out
            no end, the film yuckily maneuvers the relationship so that his
            incestuous yearnings -- and hers, I suppose -- are all right. After
            all, that's what stardom is all about, feeling loved.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            <i>Dickie Roberts</i> can't even let this perversely fuzzy finale
            rest. While you're left to imagine just how odd the new family might
            be offscreen, the end credits delivers what the rest of the film is
            really about -- the rage that former child stars feel toward the
            idiot fans who can't understand that they are no longer the
            cardboard kiddies who appear endlessly in Nick and other reruns. A
            passel of these ex-stars -- Joanie, the boys and Marsha from <i>The
            Brady Bunch</i>, Rerun and Raj, Wally Cleaver, one of My Three Sons
            -- join for a &quot;We Are the World&quot;-style singalong, in a
            song that details their frustrations, one being the fact that
            Michael Jackson gives them all a bad name by sleeping with chimps.
            If only the rest of <i>Dickie Roberts</i> had been so focused. <o:p>
