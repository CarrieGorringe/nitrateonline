            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>That an actor's physical stature
            should have no bearing on exceptional dramatic talent is plenty
            evident in the 4'-5&quot; frame of Peter Dinklage, whose incredibly
            unassuming, introspective presence in Tom McCarthy's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Station Agent</i> borders on stoic epiphany. A big three-time winner
            at the Sundance Film Festival, here is a film with talent,
            sophistication, humor, and sensitivity rolled into a joyous,
            grief-cleansing, heart-lifting 90 minutes that earns both good
            word-of-mouth and positions itself for year-end acclaim on more than
            a handful of top-ten best lists. McCarthy, heretofore a Broadway
            actor who has also been a series regular on <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Boston
            Public</i> and appeared on <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Ally
            McBeal</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Practice</i>, and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Law &amp;
            Order: SVU</i>, makes a surprisingly assured debut as a first-time
            feature director-writer. He's penned a dandy of a script and
            garnered memorable performances from Dinklage, Paula Clarkson, and
            Bobby Cannavale as the core triumvirate in a tale of despair,
            isolation, awkwardness, and from-the-emotional-ashes friendship in a
            small New Jersey town, appropriately named Newfoundland. McCarthy
            even manages to end the film at just the right moment.<o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Dinklage, who made a strong
            impression in his first film role nearly a decade ago (Tom DiCillo's
            hilariously dark comedy <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Living
            in Oblivion</i>), and is a regular on the New York stage, also has a
            brief yet powerfully malevolent bit in Will Ferrell's holiday
            one-joke shtick-fest <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Elf</i>.
            In <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Station Agent</i>, he's
            Finbar (Fin, for short) McBride, a reclusive dwarf fascinated by
            trains and their lore, yet never a passenger. After inheriting a
            derelict train depot that once served a once-proud community, he
            literally walks to his new home, traveling south from Hoboken along
            the railroad right-of-way. He's frugal and doesn't work, not that
            he's concerned about being without job (it's never mentioned);
            there's more time for train watching, rail walking, and reading. He
            spouts arcane facts about the iron horse, and its historical
            significance to our country's growth, to anyone willing to listen,
            although he has a particularly hard time with a class of elementary
            children more interested in blimps. Fin's reluctant to develop
            relationships, lest he be spurned or ridiculed. It's been a rough
            life, and apparently he likes to stay under the radar. When he's too
            fed up with the supermarket stares and the Snow White remarks, he
            unleashes his anger at the local bar, hoping the snickering and
            whispers will finally stop.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">His isolated bubble is quickly
            popped by Joe Oramas (Cannavale), a Manhattanite-in-exile tending to
            his ailing father's &quot;Georgeous Frank's&quot; hot dog and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">cafe
            con leche</i> truck, which sits across the road from the depot. When
            Fin moves in, the loquacious Joe, ever starved for a faster paced
            lifestyle or anyone with an ounce of intelligence to converse with,
            shows immediate interest in his new neighbor, to the point of
            tag-along, I'll-buy-the-beer ingratiating dialogue. A daily visitor
            to the truck is Olivia Harris (Clarkson), a mother and separated
            wife, still grieving two years after the death of her young son. She
            paints her grief in oils on canvas. Her introduction to Fin is
            priceless. Driving her Jeep SUV, she's preoccupied with her spilled
            drink or dropped item and TWICE nearly runs the clearly bewildered
            pedestrian off the road.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The characters quickly weave
            themselves into a odd friends society, opening and closing their
            hearts, and ultimately offering grown-up compassion and camaraderie.
            Even the supporting cast, particularly Raven Goodwin (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Lovely
            and Amazing</i>) and Michelle Williams (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Dawson's
            Creek</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Dick</i>), as a
            bemused school girl and a local librarian attracted to Fin's chin
            and kindness, help shape <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Station Agent's</i> comfortable, well-worn, favorite-jeans feel.
            They're extended family -- not blood related, but still experiencing
            that type of closeness and growth. Maybe that's why Joe is
            constantly calling Fin his &quot;bro.&quot;<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">McCarthy's small production, shot
            in just 20 days in New Jersey using Super 16 film stock (blowing it
            up to the conventional 35mm gauge for theatrical release), is a
            character-driven locomotive, occasionally flavored with small
            flourishes, often barely noticeable. Early in the film, a moment
            before Fin's friend and fellow worker at a model train hobby store
            collapses and dies, Fin knocks over a small toy figurine. Nice hook.
            Another plus: the original music by Stephen Trask, co-creator of the
            sublimely side-splitting <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Hedwig
            and the Angry Inch</i>, blending guitar, piano, jews harp, and an
            odd, wavering reverb which subliminally reminded me of Percy's Adlon
