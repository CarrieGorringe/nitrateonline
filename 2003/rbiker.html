            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>On
            the 30 January <i>Today Show</i>, Laurence Fishburne rolled up on
            his motorcycle. He and his mini-crew of bikers revved their engines
            and wore colorful leather jackets; after a little chitchat, Fish
            presented host Al Roker with a jacket of his very own. Happy as all
            get-out, Al tore off his overcoat and tried on the new gear, turning
            his back to the camera so everyone in TV-land could see that he was
            proudly promoting Fishburne's new movie, <i>Biker Boyz</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            fact, as Fishburne noted during his two minutes on air with Al, he
            rides, for real. Noting that the film is inspired by a particular
            bikers' subculture -- highly competitive, organized, and proud --Fishburne
            explained that the community is &quot;predominantly black, but they
            don't exclude anybody.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            detail says something about how <i>Biker Boyz</i> was made and how
            it's being marketed. Loud and rowdy as it may be, the film is
            plainly designed to appeal across demographics, with a range of
            (many) performers (Fishburne, Derek Luke, Orlando Jones, Lisa Bonet,
            Kid Rock) and a range of narrative elements (action, comedy,
            melodrama). Thematically, it looks backward and forward at once:
            back to old school Westerns (the aging hero confronts the young gun)
            and forward to the next logical step in the genre most raucously
            represented by <i>The Fast and the Furious</i>. Drawing from video
            games, extreme sports, the WWF, and Saturday morning cartoons, these
            new-fangled flicks are short on character complexity, long on
            incredible visual display -- spinning camerawork, digital timing (as
            in &quot;bullet&quot;), and thrilling stunts enacted by busty girls
            and buff guys.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Based
            on a <i>New Times</i> article by Michael Gougis and scripted by
            Craig Fernandez, <i>Biker Boyz</i> is also careful to respect its
            sources, showing the bikers in their various glories -- they're not
            boozing smackdown hooligans, but lawyers, husbands, doctors, and
            what we might call venerable women (see, for instance, Half and
            Half, played by Salli Richardson, tough chick extraordinaire -- who
            garnered applause from the biker club audience with whom I saw the
            film <i>every</i> time she appeared on screen). They're also
            energetically multi-racial, which makes them of a piece with recent
            action film casts: <i>The Transporter</i>, <i>The Matrix</i>, <i>The
            Scorpion King</i>, and anything Vin Diesel (a one man multi-culti
            cast).<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            latest version of the smash-action adventure is plainly designed to
            appeal across multiple communities -- gendered, raced, aged, and
            classed. The story involves father and son conflicts, youthful
            passions, elder responsibilities, and inter-gang competitions.
            Possible larger frameworks -- legal or social -- only exist on the
            edges, to make bike racing slightly difficult (at one point,
            faceless cops bust up a match; in another, offscreen authorities
            make the bikers move their contest from a safe raceway to a farmer's
            dirt road). For the most part, the bikers live in their own world,
            in Southern California -- drinking, zooming, posturing, popping
            wheelies, getting intricate tattoos, and riding into all kinds of
            sunsets. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            central narrative involves Fishburne's renowned biker, Smoke, and a
            young upstart named Jaleel (Derek Luke). The latter's father, Slick
            Will (Eriq La Salle), is Smoke's mechanic, and the kid (whose
            nickname is, apparently significantly, Kid) resents that he appears
            to do whatever Smoke says and Smoke, leader of the Black Knights
            Club, gets all the public respect and glory. When, in one of the
            first scenes, his father is killed in a freak accident (he's not
            even riding), Kid briefly drops out of the scene to reassess. He
            returns, of course (&quot;Six months later,&quot; reads the helpful
            title), to challenge Smoke to a Big Race. This against the noisy
            resistance of his mother, Anita (Vanessa Bell Calloway), who tells
            him that in the ER, where she works, they call bikers &quot;organ
            donors.&quot; This point about the risks of biking is certainly made
            in the first brutal death scene, and a sign of Smoke's maturity is
            his realization that there are more important things to do than win
            races. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still,
            he's initially distracted by persistent mini-challenges from bikers
            like Dogg (Kid Rock), who tends to bump opponents off the track.
            Meanwhile, Kid has his own obstacles to overcome, namely, the rules
            of the biker set. To get access to Smoke, first he has to put
            together his own crew, in order to rise to the level of legitimacy,
            so he starts a club with his buddies Stuntman (Brendan Fehr) and
            Primo (Rick Gonzalez). Visibly &quot;diverse,&quot; this trio
            attracts a next generation of bikers to their organization: the
            first two newbies are Filipino, played by real life brothers Dante
            and Dion Brasco. Clever, gifted, and brash, these kids are quick to
            mount outrageous stunts, daring their elders to keep up. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            basic Western structure -- Kid and Smoke's rivalry -- makes for a
            predictable plot trajectory: Kid will learn some lessons, &quot;King
            of Cali&quot; Smoke will have to face his own demons, Anita will
            reveal a secret, and Kid's bodacious girlfriend, Tina (Meagan Good),
            will show some skin. It also grants the proceedings traditional
            emotional weight. (It helps that Luke, of <i>Antwone Fisher</i>
            fame, and other participants are solid performers -- no Paul Walkers
            here.) Most often, the film's emotional tensions take the form of
            soap operatic close-ups (Bell Calloway most definitely carries these
            scenes). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">That's
            not to say that everyone has a decent role; some characters feel
            like they've been cut, rather cruelly. Terrence Howard, Djimon
            Hounsou, and Tyson Beckford have about two or three minutes on
            screen each; designated troublemaker Wood (Larenz Tate) picks on Kid
            and sparks a fight; and, as Smoke's infinitely patient current
            squeeze, Queenie, Lisa Bonet spends too much time gazing up at her
            big-chested man. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Director
            Reggie Rock Bythewood (who made the sharp TV-industry breakdown, <i>Dancing
            in September</i>) keeps the pace pumping (at least until the
            predictable end). The images alternate between ostentatious
            titillation shots (tracking short-shorted girls or showing cleavage,
            especially during the Black Knights Bikini Bike Wash), high-octane
            racing images (some mutating into blurry-edged &quot;tunnel
            vision&quot; POV frames, suggesting the rider's otherworldly
            concentration), and dramatic domestic scenes (handheld, intimate,
            poignant). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Amid
            all the conventional movie dazzle, <i>Biker Boyz</i>'s most
            important idea is the bike. However you read it, as a sign of
            freedom or aggression, individuality or conformity, potency,
            masculinity, and/or beauty, the bike is broadly mythic, proudly
            ritual, absolutely immediate and material. It looks great in the
            stunts and trick shots, and its on-screen speed is downright
            visceral. What's remarkable about this film is that, at last, the
            bike's power and appeal are granted to a &quot;predominantly&quot;
            black, multi-racial group of folks who &quot;don't exclude
            anybody.&quot; And that's radical. <o:p>
