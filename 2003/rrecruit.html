            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>At one point in <i>The Recruit</i>,
            Al Pacino stops and turns to the young, fresh-faced male organisms
            sharing a van with him and tells them that they must go into a bar
            and return with an &quot;asset who is willing to have sex&quot; with
            them. That means they're supposed to pick-up some girls, folks, and
            -- hey -- this is a training exercise, so that, one day, they will
            be able to go out and serve as top-flight intelligence operatives
            for their country. Watching this, I wondered if any of the people I
            went to school with at BYU ever found themselves going through this
            sort of training after they had responded to one of the regular
            recruitment drives that the CIA held on-campus (If you had
            mathematics skills or Russian language skills, they were
            particularly interested in you). Back then, women not only wanted
            but expected to be treated as women, as well as equals. Now, they're
            called &quot;assets.&quot; Something I don't think Lana Turner or
            Susan Hayward would expect to be called prior to women's-lib,
            either. That's progress for you.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Colin Farrell, of the deep, dark,
            wounded eyes and sturdy shoulders, plays James, who is convinced by
            Pacino's character, Walter Burke, that he has a brighter future
            ahead of him working for the Agency than he would as a software
            designer (debate that as you may). Training for rookies turns out to
            include constant surveillance and mock interrogations utilizing live
            electricity. Then, James has to snoop on one of his fellow trainees
            -- lovely Layla (Bridget Moynahan, Ben Affleck's main squeeze in <i>The
            Sum of All Fears</i>), who speaks fluent Farsi and may be a mole
            planted to ferry out some dangerous information. James must expose
            Layla, but what's to stop him from thinking that Burke has fed a
            similar story to Layla, thus pitting the two of them against each
            other for whatever purposes he wanted? As Burke continually asserts,
            the only thing for certain is that nothing is what it seems.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A while back, the director Roger
            Donaldson did <i>No Way Out</i>, a not-bad betrayal thriller (when
            it wasn't showing Kevin Costner and Sean Young trying to perform a
            full pin-down on each other) set at the Pentagon. <i>The Recruit</i>,
            filmed in mournful, gun-metal grays and blues, is one of Donaldson's
            better recent efforts, though I would hesitate to put it alongside
            his earlier, fine work in <i>Smash Palace</i>, <i>The Bounty</i> and
            <i>Marie</i>. Once you've figured out, about an hour into the
            picture, how James and Layla are going to play each other out,
            there's not much else left, even when the plot attempts an elegant
            triple-twist <b><i>foité </i></b>at the climax. There's one really
            fine kicker at the very end of the picture, though, but the bulk of
            the film feels like we've seen much of it, in one form or another,
            somewhere else before.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The kicker at the end may<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>work in part because of the way Colin Farrell plays the
            scenes where James expresses emotion over his vanished father, who
            may or may not have been working as an undercover agent. I've yet to
            see Farrell's acting talent explode across the screen -- since this
            is essentially commercial fodder, albeit with most of it's &quot;i's&quot;
            dotted and &quot;t's&quot; crossed, he may be saving his best stuff
            for a role that warrants it. Pacino gives an operatic performance
            where he keeps us off-kilter by finding unusual ways to cadence and
            inflect his line deliveries -- it's not as bad as his eye-bugging
            performances in <i>Scarface</i> and <i>Devil's Advocate</i>, but I'd
            hate to see him start relying on the same set of mannerisms and
            routines in film after film, the kind of thing which has seriously
            crimped Robert Duvall and Robert De Niro's recent work. As he showed
            in <i>Insomnia</i> last year, Pacino still has the ability to be a
            vital, searching performer. We'd like to be fooled as to whether he
            is or is not a Mephistophelean character in <i>The Recruit</i>, but,
            actually, he gives us the answer right from the start, so we wait,
            with polite attentiveness, to have it confirmed.<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
