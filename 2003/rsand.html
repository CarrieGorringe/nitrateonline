            is at the center of <i>House of Sand and Fog</i>. Pitted against one
            another for ownership of the titular residence off the San Francisco
            coast are Kathy (Jennifer Connelly) and Colonel Massoud Amir Behrani
            (Ben Kingsley). She's miserably addict, following her husband's
            leaving (this rendered in a couple minutes worth of flashback as she
            lies to her mother about how great things are going). He's former
            Iranian Air Force, run out of town when the Shah fell, now working
            multiple menial jobs (road crew, gas station attendant) to ensure
            that his family continues to live in the semi-opulent style to which
            are accustomed. <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kathy
            lost her house, inherited from a father who worked 30 years to
            possess it, because she didn't open her mail for several weeks, thus
            missing a wrongly issued notice that she owed a commercial property
            tax. As she doesn't know of this bad news, she's evicted from the
            house, which is subsequently auctioned off. Behrani scoops it up for
            a pittance, initiates &quot;improvements&quot; (namely, a widow's
            walk to look over the somewhat distant sea), in order to sell it for
            lots more, then refuses to sell it back for the original price when
            the error is found out by Kathy's lawyer, Connie (icy Frances
            Fisher). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Based
            on the best-selling novel by Andre Dubus III, Vadim Perelman's movie
            sets up this conflict as a general metaphor for a raft of other
            conflicts, between cultures, nations, generations, genders, and
            races. While it boasts a signature powerhousey performance by
            Kingsley and a more intriguing one by Connelly, it's weighted down
            by its overstated significances and emerging tragedies, which demand
            distracting plot contrivances. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kathy
            is, in Behrani's resentful eyes, the archetypal wifty
            &quot;American,&quot; undeserving of her privilege, an unwitting
            participant in U.S. domination. When Kathy's cause is taken up by
            Deputy Sheriff Lester Burdon (Ron Eldard), her crimes only look
            compounded. This especially when he adopts an ineptly macho pose,
            acting the part of a racist thug with immigration department
            connections in order to scare Behrani into giving up the house,
            Lester is more pathetic than potent. The fact that Lester also falls
            in love with Kathy, leading him to abandon his aggravated wife (Kim
            Dickens) and teary kids, confuses an already confusing situation.
            Though Kathy is distressed enough to welcome his attentions, she's
            also unstable enough not to recognize what's at issue -- either for
            herself (feeling abandoned) or for Lester (needing to be needed). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Conversely,
            Kathy sees the Colonel as a tyrant, bullying his traditionally
            submissive wife Nadi (Shohreh Aghdashloo) and teenaged son Esmail
            (Jonathan Ahdout). As Behrani understands this to be suitable
            patriarchal behavior (he presumes to own Nadi, and to be passing on
            property and rights pertaining to Esmail), embodying the kind of
            order that he sees missing in lax U.S. citizens, there's no way that
            he's going to back down when he's so accused. Indeed, when Connie
            informs him of the legal niceties involved, and that he might indeed
            do the right thing and return the house to this dispossessed girl
            without actually losing anything, he knows he's won. He's in the
            right, he's going to use the U.S. system against itself, he's going
            to reign again, if only in his own household and the estimation of
            his relatives. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            sense of melodrama stems from the film's insistence on both Kathy
            and Behrani's urgent motional and political investments in the
            house. No one can back down from his or her ardent position, and
            that allows the film to drift implausibly into overheated
            situations. As Kathy's emotional situation becomes increasingly
            dire, Lester thinks he's got his together, asserting that, once he's
            slept with her, he'll be able to tell wifey &quot;the truth about
            how I feel.&quot; That he has little inkling of consequences or
            really, how he &quot;feels,&quot; is par for his course. Eldard is a
            resourceful and mostly underused actor, but his part here is
            comprised of emotional leaps, from despair to devotion to
            desperation, and it's increasingly difficult to follow his thinking,
            as even his desire to save Kathy soon warps into an anomalous test
            of his own will. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            this capacity, Lester repeatedly fulfills Behrani's expectations of
            the ugly American, at the same time confirming Behrani's
            self-understanding as a man of refinement and insight. He sees right
            through Lester's tough posing and complains to his superior officer,
            a turn of events that leaves everyone compromised by the law. This
            development -- Kathy, Lester, and Behrani are all feeling
            marginalized and beset by mainstream institutions -- shifts their
            relationships to one another. Once white guy Lester loses his legal
            (and presumption of cultural) authority, his desperation quite
            exceeds that demonstrated previously by the usual outsiders to
            power, Kathy and Behrani. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            is the most forceful indictment made by <i>The House of Sand and Fog</i>:
            it acknowledges that a sense of helplessness inspires bad behavior,
            whether self-destructive or aggressive, as much as any more common
            notion that power corrupts. That such loss and damage are premised
            on the desire (right?) to own property and control capital, is as
            gloomy a reading of the &quot;American Dream&quot; as any in a film
            this year. <o:p>
