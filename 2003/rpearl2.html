            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>, 26 December 2003</i></font><p>
			<b><font size="2" face="Verdana">Delft, Holland never looked so 
			luxurious, even on a frosty wintry day, as it does in <i>Girl With a 
			Pearl Earring</i>, one of the most beautifully mounted films of the 
			year, thanks in large part to the stunning cinematography by Eduardo 
			(<i>The Wings of the Dove</i> and <i>What Dreams May Come</i>) Serra 
			and vibrant production design by Ben Van Os, who helped create the 
			cold-to-the touch look of last year's <i>Max</i>,
			<span style="color:black">Menno Meyjes's debut that created a 
			disturbing portrait of a pre-dictator Hitler as a young artist</span>. 
			There's also a splendid score by Alexandre Desplat that paints well 
			with the sunlight and shadows against the monochromatic grey and 
			brown visuals. This new British-Luxemburg co-production starring 
			Scarlett Johansson in the title role is also a first feature, from 
			editor and documentary/telefeature filmmaker Peter Webber, who 
			reveals a steady hand slowly turning the pages of Tracy Chevalier's 
			acclaimed 1999 novel as adapted by Olivia Hetreed, also a film 
			editor credited with her second produced screenplay (following her 
			introductory effort, <i>A Small Dance</i>, by a dozen years).</font></b></p>
			<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">You can sense Webber's passion for 
			the film's more renown subject, Dutch master Johannes Vermeer, and 
			that character's unsure, forbidden relationship with the 
			fictionalized Griet (Johansson), a tilemaker's peasant daughter 
			whose reputation totters between a mild case of anxiety and 
			damnation. Theirs is but one of the very speculative bindings that 
			envelop the ravishing film. And therein lies the problem, that the 
			story is basically a modern day soap opera wrapped in a 17th century 
			bodice. While most of the cast gets in the proper period mood 
			underneath the Dutch wardrobe and makeup, some of the performances 
			ring hollow, especially Colin Firth as the henpecked 
			husband/brilliant artist turned soul-seller, whose dour expressions 
			rain on everyone else's parade. Johansson gets acres more out of her 
			role, again proving she has real talent. I suspect she'll collect 
			kudos and a statuette for this or her contribution as one of the 
			forlorn souls (Bill Murray being the other) adrift in Tokyo in <i>
			Lost in Translation</i>. While Tom Wilkerson doesn't have much 
			screen time, he definitely makes you remember his part as Vermeer's 
			lecherous patron Van Ruijven, who protected the artist from the 
			vicissitudes of the 17th century Dutch economy. Also Essie Davis, as 
			Vermeer's beautiful, tight-fisted, and religiously tormented wife 
			Catharina), registers extremely well as a woman on the verge of a 
			breakdown.</font></p>
			<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Griet is the girl from the 
			proverbial wrong side of town forced to find work as the Vermeers' 
			indentured maid servant when her father is blinded in a kiln 
			accident. She lands, somehow, at the Vermeers' doorstep with a great 
			deal of Catholic disdain tossed at her by their uppity, 
			higher-than-thou class values.</font></p>
			<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">The drudgery of endless washings, 
			scrubbings, and silver polishings are enlightened first by a glimpse 
			of the work of her master. And then of the long-haired, sad puppy 
			master himself, who convinces her to sit for him and become the 
			subject of his most famous painting. (Scholars believe that it was 
			one of Vermeer's half-dozen daughters that was the actual figure.) 
			It's not so much love that Griet feels for the artist, but pity for 
			the forlorn artist and the too many women (wife, mother-in-law, 
			daughters) suffocating his life, although Griet does show a keen 
			interest in learning about his craft. Hey, her father is, or was, an 
			artisan; like father, like daughter. The family (other than the 
			master of the house) never warm to Griet, especially the 
			mischievously evil, curly-haired 12-year-old daughter Cornelia (Alakina 
			Mann), and bitterly cunning mother-in-law Maria Thins (Judy Parfitt), 
			who quickly sees through how the girl is wont to be the painter's 
			muse. They belittle Griet at any chance, accuse her of stealing or 
			sneaking about or shirking her duties. As for the brooding artist 
			himself, he says nary a word until a half-hour has passed. Cillian 
			Murphy, the star of the hugely successful <i>28 Days Later</i>, is 
			back dealing with dead meat on a lighter scale as Pieter, the 
			Vermeer's butcher (not to be confused with Pieter Van Ruijven, who 
			never gets called by his first name in the film), who is attracted 
			to Griet. He's a clever lad anxious to impress. Griet, her awe held 
			in restraint so as not to respond too boldly when Vermeer shows her 
			his artist's tools, shows a growing uneasiness in his casual 
			closeness. It's interesting hat the filmmaker associates darkness or 
			blackness with this intimacy, when he covers her with his robe to 
			show her the technical marvel of a camera obscura or when he helps 
			her grind up a blackish substance with a mallet.</font></p>
			<p><font size="2" face="Verdana">Tensions build, rumors fly, and 
			green-eyed monsters flitter about the frosty air of the local 
			marketplace. Yes,<i> Girl With a Pearl Earring</i> is a sight for 
			sore eyes, but there's something missing here that would make the 
			film a truly mesmerizing piece. A good story.</font></p>
