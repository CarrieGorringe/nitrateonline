			<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700"><font size="2">
			Navy SEAL Lieutenant A.K. Waters (Bruce Willis) doesn't talk much. 
			He's one of those durable military types who tend to show up in U.S. 
			war movies, duty-bound, descended from John Wayne. Or better, 
			descended from a pervasive idea of John Wayne, the one where he's 
			uncomplicated and grandly heroic (which, in fact, he hardly ever 
			was). Waters believes he is unmovable, able to handle whatever comes 
			his way. And, at least at first, he appears to be right. </font>
			</span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">Waters initially appears in Antoine Fuqua's <i>Tears 
			of the Sun</i> returning from an especially tough mission. You can 
			tell this because, as he strides across the deck of the USS Harry S. 
			Truman (&quot;somewhere off the coast of Africa&quot;), he looks the slightest 
			bit weary in his super-uprightness. Striding beside him, his loyal 
			and rugged men -- Red (Cole Hauser), Zee (Eamonn Walker), and Lake 
			(Johnny Messner) among them -- look equally square-jawed, primed, 
			and begrimed from their time in the field. And then they get the 
			order they most fear and desire: Captain Rhodes (Tom Skerritt) sends 
			them on another perilous mission, of some utmost importance. </font>
			</span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">Their &quot;priority task&quot; is the extraction of U.S. 
			citizen/French-born Doctors Without Walls physician Lena Hendricks 
			(Monica Bellucci). It seems that, in a fictional echo of the Biafran-Nigerian 
			civil war, her patch of Nigerian jungle has recently turned 
			particularly dangerous, as the introductory voiceover has already 
			told you. Muslim rebels have assassinated the President and his 
			family, and are now rampaging through the country, killing all 
			Christians they can find. The Muslim rebels are indeed horrific -- 
			as quick to take a machete to a priest's neck as to burn down the 
			&quot;house of god&quot; he begs them to respect. Their eyes are hard; they 
			wear red berets and green uniforms; they hiss when they speak. And 
			they're led by the ominous Colonel Idris Sadick (played by 
			poet-activist turned actor Malick Bowens), a brutal, taciturn 
			terminator.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">Lena can't know that all this is headed her way. 
			Waters, the green-face-painted soldier who would also be a 
			terminator, informs her. When he first sees her, she's angelic, in 
			mid-operation, covered in blood, her staunch assistant, Patience (Akosua 
			Busia), close by her side. Told she has to go, she refuses; she 
			won't leave, she says, without &quot;my people,&quot; that is, the Nigerians 
			she's tending. Waters is momentarily stumped by stubbornness. But, 
			ever determined and on task, he figures out a way to get his job 
			done: he lies. That is, he agrees to move her people with her. They 
			traipse through the jungle with his men on guard, to the LZ. Only 
			then does she realize that there aren't enough helicopters to take 
			all the refugees. And only then does Waters' inured capacity for 
			cruelty become crystal: he hoists her on his shoulder, deposits her 
			in the waiting bird, and they take off. Below them, wailing men, 
			women, and children. </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">Spectacular and heartbreaking, this chopper shot is 
			all too familiar in recent U.S. war films. (And, for that matter, in 
			recent U.S. urban movies.) Hovering, roaring, the whirly-monster 
			grants a poignant bird's eye view of panic: the Nigerians know 
			exactly what's headed their way. And the view belongs to the 
			interlopers, the SEALS and the doctor, those who leave, who can 
			leave. Their dramatic departure makes their perspective small (or 
			maybe vast): the refugees recede, the blades' thrumming overwhelms. 
			Lena shoots Waters a horrified look. Scrunch-faced, suddenly, he's 
			conflicted. </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">This sort of moment, as <i>Tears of the Sun</i> tells 
			it, is the repeated tragedy of &quot;surgical&quot; U.S. interventions: 
			swooping in, swooping out, never understanding the lives they've 
			disrupted and deaths they've brought on. Heroic as they may see 
			themselves, U.S. troops tend to look different to those communities 
			they circle, observe, penetrate, and leave. Waters can't think about 
			doing the right thing (as if there is one right thing to be done). 
			He has orders. He has somewhere else to be. </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">Of course, this isn't quite the end: the story takes 
			turns, illuminating rising tensions between understanding and 
			rigidity, sympathy and stoicism. During a long hump through the 
			jungle, Lena is almost waylaid by a rebel at night. She's saved by 
			Waters, who slides in like the stealth killer he is, slices the 
			would-be way-layer's throat, then wipes the blood off his knife. 
			Cold, he repulses but also moves Lena: he's saved her life after 
			all. But he's frightening, adept at maintaining pain (but it's not a 
			tumah!). Lena's passion proves instructive, and soon, Waters is 
			making decisions in the field that controvert his military orders. 
			Back on the ship, the captain yells into his phone, mad like he's 
			Perry White slamming Waters' Clark Kent. </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">Alex Lasker and Patrick Cirillo's script has Waters 
			going through his own unlikely fast change, turning all moral and 
			empathetic after spending a few days with Lena and &quot;her people.&quot; He 
			goes so far as to engage his men despite their strict &quot;rules of 
			engagement&quot; edict -- no shooting unless you're shot at. One of the 
			film's most distressing sequences occurs when Waters and crew 
			discover a band of revels raping, torturing, and slaughtering a 
			village full of people. The SEALs take out target after target (as 
			each target is assailing a helpless victim). They perform expertly, 
			viciously, and righteously. Their violence is justified by the 
			violence of the barbarians (who, Patience says, cut off nursing 
			mothers' breasts so they cannot feed their children). Surely, 
			killing these fiends is morally sound.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">Still, and to its credit, the film's action here is 
			somber rather than thrilling; you can root for the SEALs, but the 
			toll on them is visible. Waters' decision to go off-mission (&quot;We 
			have a new mission&quot;) dooms him and his men to a no-return of 
			complete engagement: they must follow through, they can't extract 
			and leave. But while they might wonder about his motives (&quot;What are 
			you doing!?&quot;), they mostly go along because they are loyal soldiers, 
			and earnestly want to do good work. </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">When he finally asks for their feelings on the 
			matter, the surviving black team member holds out the longest in 
			granting his approval. But then he takes his LT aside and reassures 
			him: &quot;These are my people too. For all those years we've had to 
			stand down or stand by, you're doing the right thing.&quot; And for all 
			the violence and frustration in the movie, this moment -- the grave 
			and reluctant Zee's full-on engagement with the cause Waters has 
			redefined -- is what Waters (and the film, apparently) has been 
			waiting for. How odd (and familiar) is this scenario? The white guy 
			will save the grateful, black oppressed, when he finally &quot;gets it.&quot; 
			Thank god. </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><i><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">Tears of the Sun</font></span></i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
			was conceived before 9-11 (its original title, <i>Man of War</i>, 
			was changed following the attacks), but here and now, it's morphed 
			into <i>Black Hawk Down</i> without the skeeddaddly camerawork and 
			with a bizarrely &quot;happier&quot; ending, following elaborate and rousing 
			action: explosions, firefights, rushing about. Given the current 
			moment, this moral lesson (do something for real people, rather than 
			follow orders that have no sense of the world they're affecting) 
			reads like an endorsement of &quot;preemptive&quot; striking... especially if 
			you're willing to hump through the jungles to Cameroon and leave out 
			collateral-damaging bombs. </font></span></td>
