            ten years in the conceiving, the showdown between New Line's most
            persistent franchise players proffers much slashing of skin and
            spurting of blood. In the plainly titled <i>Freddy vs. Jason</i>,
            Freddy Krueger (Robert Englund) doesn't even begin to let on that
            maybe he's met his undeadish match in Jason Voorhees (played this
            time out by Ken Kirzinger). Indeed, Freddy sets up the challenge,
            sort of on purpose. Feeling &quot;forgotten&quot; since his last
            outing (in <i>New Nightmare</i>) nine years ago, he schemes to
            rekindle fear in the 'hood, by digging Jason out of his deathly
            slumber and sending him round to carve up some naïve teens. <o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">A
            notorious egomaniac (&quot;You are all my children now!&quot;),
            Freddy's annoyed that the current Elm Street residents are
            blissfully ignorant of his rep. This is because the authorities
            (cops and doctors) grabbed up any young people whose dreams he has
            visited and committed them to a psych ward many miles out of town.
            Here the kiddies play checkers and loll about in hospital pajamas,
            downing dream-suppressing drugs and trying not to rile the guards.
            That is, until young Will (Jason Ritter, son of John) glimpses a TV
            news report (on station KRGR -- cute) of a murder at the home of his
            first love, Lori (awesomely bosomed Monica Keena), that is, Freddy's
            old place. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Though
            Will hasn't seen her since they were both fourteen, as he's been
            institutionalized for four years, he's determined to warn her; so he
            and his buddy Mark (Brendan Fletcher) break out (much like Michael
            Myers of that other slasher franchise, not owned by New Line) and
            roar into town. When they start issuing dire warnings (&quot;Coffee:
            make friends with it!&quot;), Lori and her best friends -- Kia
            (Kelly Rowland) and Gibb (Katharine Isabelle, last seen gnawing on
            her dates in <i>Ginger Snaps</i>) -- are suitably horrified, having
            been at the crime scene the night before, but most everyone else
            thinks these boys are nuts, having bought the party line laid down
            by the intransigent sheriff (Garry Chalk) and Lori's snivelly ad
            (Tom Butler), that what you don't understand must be repressed. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">And
            so, these poor kids do like Nancy's mom (the unforgettable Ronee
            Blakeley) used to -- they self-medicate. So that you don't miss this
            detail, they go so far as to organize a rave in the local cornfield,
            complete with glow sticks and pickup trucks and homemade booze. High
            and promiscuous: clearly, they must be punished. Jason arrives with
            his sword, hacking through the corn stalks, and soon enough, yet
            another generation of Elm Street teens arrive at the grim
            realization that adults are useless when it comes to serial killers,
            or anything else. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Initially,
            Freddy's plan swims along: Jason doggedly marauds and Freddy feels
            increasingly &quot;stronger,&quot; more and more able to get inside
            kids' dreams and torture them with the sorts of personalized horrors
            that are his trademark. (To be fair, Jason has an inventive moment
            of his own, when one of the ravers douses him with alcohol and sets
            him and his weapon ablaze, such that he cuts through torsos and
            heads with fiery aplomb.) The tack Freddy takes with Lori is
            especially foul, as, in between snaking his tongue at her, he makes
            clear his special interest in abusing little girls. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Their
            dreary lives at stake, the kids catch on to these machinations
            quickly; they then proceed to explain it to each other about four
            times. (On seeing Jason act out at the rave, a stoner named Freeman
            [Kyle Labine, apparently modeling his performance on Silent Bob's
            Jay] discerns, &quot;Dude! That goalie was pissed about
            something!&quot;) Organizing themselves into a core, in-the-know
            crew that includes one semi-adult, the ineffectual Deputy Stubbs
            (Lochlyn Munro), they endeavor to fight back. Little do they know
            that their puny lives are mere bagatelle compared to the King Kong
            vs. Godzilla-like face-off, which is set in motion when Jason
            decides (as much as the Cro-Magnon-ish Jason decides anything) to
            keep killing kids on control-freaky Freddy's turf. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Their
            extended smackdown begins inside Jason's own nightmare (that is,
            Freddy's domain) and climaxes several times at Camp Crystal Lake
            (Jason's). The transition is helped along by the kids, who reinvent
            the wheel that Nancy (the much-missed Heather Langenkamp) figured
            out back in 1984, that you can bring Freddy out of your nightmare
            into the physical world, where rules of gravity and blood loss apply
            to him. The plan is surely convoluted: suffice it to say that Lori
            wrestles valiantly with Freddy while Kia is left to give
            mouth-to-mouth to a drowning-in-his-dream Jason. Here, it's actually
            hard to say which is worse: facing Freddy's acrobatic tongue or
            Jason's incredibly yucky mouth. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            battle lurches from giddy to lumbering to literal (if digitized)
            pinball. Director Ronny Yu's staging is wild and wireworky, with
            limbs flying and bodies smashing into various basement, hospital,
            and construction site props, gooshy penetrations and even a massive
            action-movie-style explosion. Amid such spectacular mayhem, the
            generic badinage is rather at a disadvantage. Yet Kia manages to
            dunk a few, likening one nerdy boy to &quot;one of those f*ckin'
            froo-froo dogs that keeps humpin' your leg&quot; and telling off
            Freddy: &quot;What kind of faggot runs around in a Christmas
            sweater?&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">What
            kind indeed? The predominant metaphor in <i>Freddy vs. Jason</i> is,
            not so imaginatively, disease. Namely, Freddy is one and the adults
            are quarantining kids instead of seeking a cure, treatment, or
            inoculation. In this, the film is like its predecessors, assuming
            the teens' point of view -- wary, fearful, rowdy, and stubbornly
            hopeful in the face of all contrary circumstances.</span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"></o:p>
