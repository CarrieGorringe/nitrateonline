            irksome, strange: there's not much downtime in Danny Boyle's <i>28
            Days Later</i>. From the film's first moments, when a crew of
            ski-masked, PETA-style activists break into a London lab to save
            test animals, the camera is in motion, the cuts convulsive, the
            shadows ragged. One chimp is strapped to a chair, forced to watch
            terrible human violence, like Alec in <i>A Clockwork Orange</i>. As
            the wannabe rescuers approach the chimps' cages, a lab-coated
            doctor-type tries to stop them. The chimps, he blurts, are
            &quot;infected.&quot; With what, asks one girl, prone to tears at
            the sight of abused creatures. Comes the ominous, shaky-voiced
            answer: &quot;Rage.&quot; And with that, the teary girl unlocks the
            cage and the chimp leaps at her, sputtering furiously, ripping at
            her face as she screams. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Twenty-eight
            days later... reads the intertitle, and bicycle courier Jim (Cillian
            Murphy) is waking up in a hospital room. Ripping the tubes from his
            arms, he staggers down the hallway to find the place deserted, the
            ookiness boosted by Anthony Dod Mantle's grainy-digital, frankly and
            superbly hard-to-read videowork. Jim can only remember that he was
            in an accident on his bike, but can't even guess what's going on
            now. And no one's around to tell him, just abandoned vehicles and
            paper-strewn streets, as if he's Burgess Meredith wandering about in
            <i>The Twilight Zone</i>. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Following
            his accident, Jim has a wacky hair-buzz and a dazed look that
            reflects his surroundings. Jim picks up wads of money, not realizing
            yet how worthless it will be. Wandering the streets, he looks out
            from Waterloo Bridge, picks up a weeks-old newspaper with a headline
            reading, &quot;EVACUATION,&quot; and stumbles on a notice board at
            Piccadilly Circus: photos, scraps of paper, desperate pleas for help
            in finding missing people (shot before 9-11 and edited during the
            aftermath and amid anthrax anxieties, the image eerily evokes NYC's
            memorials and notice boards). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            Jim eventually discovers -- when he's discovered by a pair of
            survivors, Selena (Naomie Harris) and Mark (Noah Huntley) -- Britain
            has been decimated by the rage virus, passed on by saliva, blood,
            and other bodily fluids. Once stricken, the victim has only a few
            seconds before he or she turns into the most spastic of zombies,
            filmed and edited to resemble some speed freakish nightmare, all
            flailing limbs and staccato movements. It's <i>Night of the Living
            Dead</i> on crack. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Indeed,
            <i>28 Days Later</i>, directed by Boyle, written by Alex Garland and
            produced by Andrew MacDonald (the same team who made <i>The Beach</i>
            and are as happy to forget it as you are), is upfront about its
            inspirations (think also of Romero's <i>The Crazies</i>, John
            Wyndham's <i>The Day of the Triffids</i>, Geoff Murphy's <i>The
            Quiet Earth</i>, Thom Eberhardt's <i>Night of the Comet</i>, even
            the video-game-based <i>Resident Evil</i>), not to mention every
            real-life viral scare ever, from polio or syphilis to AIDS or SARS
            (this last, of course, a reference after the fact). Its maniacal
            mash-up sensibility extends to plot, which lurches from moment to
            moment and mood to mood. Bad (don't-go-in-there!) ideas are obvious:
            Jim's insistence on seeing his certainly dead parents leads to brief
            nostalgic misery, shocking violence (zombies coming through the
            windows and walls like they're reenacting Romero's movies), and
            lasting disaster. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At
            the same time, seeming good ideas don't really hold up either.
            Following some unsettling run-ins with roving, hyperkinetic
            infecteds, Jim and Selena meet a warmly welcoming cab driver, Frank
            (Brendan Gleeson), and his teenaged daughter Hannah (Megan Burns).
            The tender father-daughter dynamic differs crucially from Jim and
            Selena's flintier affinity; this at Selena's behest, as she knows
            you have to be able to kill an infected, no matter who it is, at a
            moment's notice (her own capacity for such violence is brutally
            demonstrated, a useful lesson for gentle Jim). Selena's worry that
            the family will only slow them down speaks to the film's basic
            quandary: is it necessary to lose traditionally &quot;human&quot;
            compassion, to match the infected's ferocity, in order to combat
            them?<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">With
            this structuring dilemma, it's no surprise that the gentlest
            characters -- Jim and Frank -- undergo the most drastic
            transformations. Indeed, the dilemma comes to a climax when the
            newly formed band leave the city in search of a &quot;safe
            haven&quot; outside Manchester, announced by a weeks-old radio
            recording. En route, they find a supermarket, where they indulge
            their hungers -- for cakes and tinned delicacies -- suggesting that
            humanity, for now, has a certain weakness for consuming treats, and
            not just from vending machines. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            haven turns out to be a military outpost commanded by one Major
            Henry West (Christopher Eccleston). The soldiers are ensconced in an
            abandoned mansion &quot;in the country&quot; (such that the dangers
            of infected assaults change shape -- in the city, they resemble
            gangs, so awful that rats run from them; out here, they're like
            marauding animals, and the soldiers appear to have designed a system
            -- lights, landmines, heavy artillery -- with which to keep them at
            bay. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Proud
            of his domain and looking to protect it at all costs, West shows off
            his cook's talents with eggs, his men's discipline and loyalty, and
            most sensationally, his &quot;experiment.&quot; This is an infected
            black soldier they were able to sedate long enough to chain up, now
            wide awake and bleeding from his eyes, snarling and speed-heaving
            against his constraints (think: frantic chimpanzee in a cage). West
            explains that he hopes to observe his development, to gauge how long
            it takes him to starve to death, as if the other zombies will ever
            run out of bodies to consume. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Here
            the film lays out another interest, less clearly worked-out than its
            obvious attention to viruses and horror movie conventions. With this
            chained zombie-soldier, <i>28 Days Later</i> takes up the ways that
            race frames the very concept of infection, as this has shaped racism
            for hundreds of years -- fears of otherness, contagion,
            miscegenation. Selena's blackness alongside everyone else's
            whiteness initially seems a non-issue, as the more significant
            difference is eruptive and horrific, the infected's transmutation
            into a non-human race. The appearance of this black soldier,
            however, potentially (and however unintentionally) redraws
            distinctions and raises difficult questions, recalling the effects
            of Ben's (Duane Jones) blackness in <i>Night of the Living Dead</i>
            (as this and the lynch mobbish sheriff's posse drew attention to
            racism and Civil Rights activism in 1968). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Here
            the effects are shifted, in part because times have changed, and in
            part because they have not (Ben's dicey dealing with an hysterical
            white woman, Barbara [Judith Odea] is still more anxiety-making than
            Jim's relationship with Selena). Selena and Jim each undergo
            specific transformations in <i>28 Days Later</i>. At first, she
            distrusts him out of hand -- no ties for this machete-wielding
            warrior woman, as she knows she needs to be able to kill anyone
            who's infected within seconds. Still, he grows on her, as he must in
            a genre picture: on seeing that he's changed (able to kill), she
            asks, </font></span><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Do you want
            us to find a cure and save the world or just fall in love and
            fuck?&quot; Now, these may not be so opposed as options as they
            seem, but her point is plain. Are Jim's goals global or immediate,
            like every other guy she's ever known?</font></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Eventually,
            Selena changes from tough, smart action girl to distressed, if
            angry, damsel (granted, this is overstated visually, as she's forced
            to don a gown as she anticipates her own gang-rape). And Jim becomes
            a vicious killer, as ready to exact ugly survivalist vengeance as
            any conditioned and ultimately desperate soldier boy. Both these
            trajectories are complicated and inexact, adhering to genre
            conventions but also strained and subversive. While the virus
            metaphor is obviously timely, the characters' seeming capacity to
            forget these nasty changes in themselves by film's end may be the
            film's most unsettling point.</font></span></td>
