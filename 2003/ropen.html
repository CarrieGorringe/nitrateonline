            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The characters in <i>Open Range</i>,
            set in the American West in the 1880s, show, among other things, a
            regard for life that encompasses both human and animal. Charley
            Waite (Kevin Costner) and Boss Spearman (Robert Duvall) have been
            running &quot;free-grazing&quot; cattle for years together when two
            of the men who work with them during one run are bushwhacked by a
            posse from a frontier town. When Charley and Spearman go into the
            town of Harmonville to settle things up, the sky opens up and it
            rains, creating a flash-flood down the main street, and Charley
            plucks a small dog caught in the current before it is swept away.
            Such an act unexpectedly wins allies for him among the townspeople
            during what lies ahead, but you get the feeling that Charley would
            have had no regrets about rescuing the animal even if it didn't.
            Yet, the town's distrust of the cattlemen is not without warrant:
            they're reacting to what happened when the last group of
            &quot;free-grazers&quot; traveled through and messed things up.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is the first picture that
            Kevin Costner has directed since the woebegotten <i>The Postman</i>,
            in 1997, and the reaction to that film seemed to have shaken his
            confidence -- his performance in <i>Dragonfly</i> was dullish and
            uncertain, and his attempt to do a character actor turn by playing a
            sleaze in <i>3000 Miles to Graceland</i> was well nigh excruciating
            to watch. If Costner's returned to the Western genre, part of the
            reason could be because he simply looks well riding a horse. (His
            first attention-getting performance was as the frisky young rider in
            &quot;Silverado&quot;.) But there's also a regard for the land where
            the story takes place, which in turn seems to infuse the characters
            with a sense of decency and moral certainty, one of the reasons why,
            when they have to take a stand, they don't do so lightly.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Duvall's character, Spearman,
            always makes sure that he's never slighting anyone who does him a
            service -- even if it's for gratis, he does not want to be overly
            &quot;obliging&quot; --and his concern over the harsh injuries
            inflicted upon the young cattle hand Button (Diego Luna, one of the
            two most excellent lads in <b><i>Y Tu Mamá También</i></b>) goes
            beyond touching -- this craggy, weathered man wouldn't want to be
            caught dead acting overtly sentimental, but he is never too far away
            for him to check on the younger man when his condition is not yet
            out of danger; he becomes a touchstone for Spearman's conviction.
            One was a bit concerned that Robert Duvall had started to coast
            along as an actor after his performances in <i>John Q</i> and <i>Gods
            and Generals</i>---playing Robert E. Lee in the latter, he blinked
            and looked as if someone had just woken him up after he'd taken a
            sleeping pill. This role, though, brings out his best performance in
            years, and he invests the character with great inner repositories of
            understanding and compassion, so that, by the end of the picture, we
            have a full intuition of who he is and why he does what he does.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Costner's initially taciturn
            character turns out to have been a former soldier who ended up
            serving in a guerilla band for the North during the Civil War,
            during which he found out that he had a great capacity for violence.
            That, plus the rainstorm that figures in the film, brings up
            comparisons with Clint Eastwood's <i>Unforgiven</i>, which you try
            to rule out of your mind while watching this picture: for one thing,
            &quot;Open Range&quot; moves at a slower pace, although, once you
            settle into it, it turns out to be a considered pace. The film
            doesn't provide as much of a clear summation of Costner's character
            as it does of Duvall's -- there's a nagging sense that something
            more is troubling Charley than we're being informed about, or need
            to know -- but there's a remarkably-staged gun battle at the film's
            climax:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>the guns go off
            loudly, and they're not accurate, and when the gunshots hit, they do
            so with force, as if every shot in itself mattered. And there's a
            feeling that, by going after the baronial rancher Baxter (Michael
            Gambon, whose performance in these climatic scenes is something
            else) and his men, the town is being rid of some lethal element in
            its physiognomy. Charley has also started up the beginnings of a
            tentative courtship with Sue (Annette Bening), sister of the town's
            doctor, and he's concerned that, if she sees a certain side to him
            (or, rather, a part of his past well-hidden), it might scare her
            off. She is scared, as she naturally well should be, but that turns
            out to be counting her short, and Bening ends up giving Sue such a
            radiant, triumphant quality that you wouldn't want to see Charley
            lose her if his life depended on it.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Before the gun battle, the film
            gives us a scene where Spearman and Charley stop in at the town's
            general store -- Spearman wants to buy some candy, something of a
            luxury out West at that time, and he wants the best candy in the
            store, which turns out to be some imported Swiss chocolate, which is
            so expensive the storekeeper has never tried it himself because he
            can't afford it. Spearman buys two bars of it, plus two good cigars,
            one of which he will later give to the livery man who has been of
            help to them (and is played, in a very good performance, by the late
            Michael Jeter). Not knowing how the showdown will go, Spearman takes
            the time to indulge his sweet tooth, and, when he and Charley are
            later hunkered down waiting to move in on Baxter's gunslingers,
            Charley checks his inside coat pocket and-<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>- yep -- his chocolate has melted in its wrapper. So he has
            it, then. This, plus a coda that establishes in what direction the
            main characters will go after the end of the story, are the type of
            things that would've been dropped by another filmmaker who was in a
            rush, who was concerned that, by a taking a few more minutes to
            provide something as trivial as character development and dimension,
            the audience would be lost. But there's a difference between a film
            being poky and being thorough. <i>Open Range</i> is ultimately
            solid, but not slow.</font><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="5"></o:p>
