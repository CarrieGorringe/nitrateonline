            </span>broad humor and subtle observations about the 1960s

            </span>The Turtles (best known for their 1967 pop hit, &quot;Happy
            Together&quot;) reminisces fondly, and with as much accuracy as he
            can muster (recalling the old saw about not having lived through the
            '60's if you could actually remember anything about them), about the
            time he and his bandmates toured London, and their encounters with
            the crème de la crème of the British rock world, among them Graham
            Nash, a very zoned-out Donovan, an acidulous John Lennon, Brian
            Jones and, of course, Jimi Hendrix.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The Jimi Hendrix that Kaylan encounters is on the verge of
            international stardom – at the time of their meeting, Hendrix was
            two weeks away from his legendary coming-out at the Monterey Pop
            Festival – and in love with the measure of fame and social
            acceptance that he has received in England;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>he was not yet the self-described, paranoiac &quot;fugitive
            from public opinion&quot; that he would become in less than two
            years, although the seeds of self-destructive behavior were already
            on display.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Quite taken with Kaylan, Hendrix invites him to a dinner that
            consists of a greasy spinach omelet, with French fries plastered
            with malt vinegar, all washed down with copious amounts of scotch
            and Coca-Cola, followed by brandy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Without giving too much away, the dinner has a rather
            disastrous --<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>and
            hilarious -- finale.</b><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yet the film is more than just a
            steady stream of personalities;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>it may be a docudrama (as screenwriter Kaylan himself slyly
            noted after the screening, poetic license is an author's perogative,
            especially if you weren't completely <b><i>compos mentis</i></b> at
            all times during the period in question), but the film's hyperactive
            visual style and its subtle, subtextual, meditations on what made
            the so-called Summer of Love tick – so subtle that they seem
            almost like throwaways --<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>lift
            it above the average I-was-there mindset that often mars these types
            of memoirs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Two scenes
            in particular – including a &quot;discussion&quot; between Frank
            Zappa and &quot;Mama&quot; Cass Elliott in an LA deli, and the
            frenetic attempts of Kaylan and his bandmate to avoid the draft by
            creatively flunking their army physical – are both standouts, as
            are the actors who have the potentially thankless task of embodying
            people whose every gesture is so famous that one false note would
            give everything away;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>instead,
            the portrayals are so exact that they border upon the eerie. As of
            the time of writing, the film does not have a distributor (it was
            produced by Rhino Records).<span style="mso-spacerun:
