            all is said and done, the only thing you can really count on in this
            world is that you never know.&quot; His hair slicked back, his face
            set in an expression resembling impassivity, Larry Gigli (Ben
            Affleck) tends to philosophize with his marks, explaining the
            futility of resisting or the percentage in paying back whatever
            money they owe his boss, the twitchy, glowery Louis (Lenny Venito).
            Larry doesn't know much. A Los Angeles-based mob enforcer who may or
            may not have aspirations, he usually appears clueless: when his
            latest assignment only gives him half the money he owes, Larry
            reports it to Louis as if it's no big deal. Though Louis puts
            considerable energy into his rebuke, it's hard to say if Larry
            understands what's at stake. His face remains a blank. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It
            could be that Affleck is acting this vacuity, or maybe he, like
            Larry, has little sense of what's at stake. In any event, much has
            been already made of his poor performance in the title role in
            Martin Brest's <i>Gigli</i>. The actor has surely added to this
            &quot;muchness,&quot; with earnest efforts to promote the film and
            his relationship with his costar, the dazzling Jennifer Lopez. The
            mid-July <i>Dateline</i> interview is especially egregious in this
            regard -- &quot;One of the things I was most struck by was how she
            was able to do the sort of rock star thing and be an actress as
            well&quot; says Ben, &quot;A lot of people have tried to do it and
            it's a really hard thing to both at a high level&quot; -- leading to
            rumors of a Jen-Ben backlash, one explanation for the outcry against
            the film.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still,
            the machine chugs along, framing <i>Gigli</i> as the occasion for
            the couple's fateful meeting. Even in this capacity, though, the
            film is wanting, offering few clues as to their depth and sincerity,
            or their &quot;chemistry.&quot; Perhaps what's revealed in Larry's
            blank face and his search for a plot to occupy his floundering
            energies, the movie is Affleck's version of <i>The Bourne Identity</i>,
            a look at the fragmentation of time and identity in postmodern
            culture, only this time in slow motion and without the violent
            choreography. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            last is somewhat unusual, given that Larry and Ricki (Lopez) are
            both professional killers hired by Louis. Their mission is to kidnap
            a federal prosecutor's autistic brother, Brian (Justin Bartha, whose
            performance careens between emulating Dustin Hoffman's Oscar turn
            and spewing like he has Tourette's Syndrome), in order to make the
            prosecutor back off the gangster Starkman (Al Pacino, whose
            embarrassing ostentation stops just short of the hoo-ha that has
            haunted him since he first ran it in Brest's lamentable <i>Scent of
            a Woman</i>). The two hirelings begin at odds, develop a mutual
            affection, and rethink their profession. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            plot sounds formulaic, but the movie is actually less so. The
            &quot;buddies&quot; don't kill anyone, don't screech around in
            Larry's pale blue Impala, and don't showdown with the gangsters or
            cops. Christopher Walken plays Jacobellis, the film's sole
            detective, in one brief scene where he asks after the missing boy's
            whereabouts: &quot;I'm searching for news of the underground,&quot;
            he murmurs. Just what's up is unclear: is Jacobellis a friend of
            Larry's? Is Larry his informant? What? When no info appears
            forthcoming, the detective leaves, never to be heard from again. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jacobellis'
            ostensible function is to tell Ricki and Larry of Brian's import,
            that is, his brother's identity. This even as they're becoming
            unprofessionally fond of the boy. Facing an imminent crisis, they
            don't leave town, return Brian or figure a way to elude Louis.
            Instead, they go for tacos. And at the food stand, Larry's love for
            his associate is cemented: when local teens with a boom box incur
            his wrath, the Sun Tsu-quoting Ricki reveals her own intimidation
            skills, namely, bullshitting about sinister-sounding martial arts
            techniques. It's an adroit mini-performance (as Lopez delivers
            throughout -- refreshingly low-key, compared to the many men who
            overact in every scene), convincing the kids to stay in school and
            Larry to rethink his macho posturing. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Impressed,
            he sets about trying to impress her in turn, even bringing her round
            (sort of accidentally) to meet his mom (Lainie Kazan), to whom he
            must give insulin injections; this allows a gratuitous and unfunny
            shot of her butt in a thong, the sort of shot that makes you wonder
            what anyone working on this film was imagining as &quot;tone.&quot;
            Then again, nothing in <i>Gigli</i> is sustained, from pace to plot
            points to character functions. It appears to have been chopped up
            and put back together again more than once. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Consider,
            for one example, the wholly bizarre scene where Larry, instructed to
            send Brian's thumb to his brother, comes up with an alternative
            plan. He has the kid stand nearby in the morgue while he saws a
            thumb off a corpse with a plastic knife; the sound inspires hiphop
            fan Brian to recite &quot;Baby Got Back&quot; -- this ill-advised
            collision of the corpse-humor from <i>Bad Boys II</i> and the
            completely exhausted white-folks-rapping joke is a serious low
            point. Brian's utter reverence for Larry is another of the film's
            puzzles, as is Ricki's growing trust in his judgment, which is
            plainly defective. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For
            all its obvious inconsistency and clumsiness, <i>Gigli</i> has one
            peculiar point in its favor, which soon becomes troubling as well.
            (Most often, the film can't seem to get out of its own way.) It has
            to do with Larry's appealing softness (despite his adamant
            palookaville-ish denial of same) and his moral education,
            specifically in the form of Ricki as lesbian. She is, of course,
            gorgeous, confident, and quick on her feet, as well as mixed up with
            the desperately infatuated Robin (Missy Crider). This relationship
            leads to the film's most flagrantly misconceived scene, a frankly
            brutal suicide attempt. Even worse than this abrupt swing in mood
            (by this point in the film, you'd think you'd be used to them) is
            what follows: at what is evidently Robin's most anguished moment (or
            at least she looks anguished, viewed through a window, at a
            distance, from Larry's locked-out and overtly yearning perspective),
            Ricki puts an end to that plotline. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">That
            Ricki is a lesbian assassin with a good heart is less complex than
            vaguely ludicrous, but it's not calamitous until she goes all <i>Chasing
            Amy</i>, that is, falling, however tentatively, for Larry. The
            motivation for this shift is missing, unless you count that he
            alternates between acting like a macho puff and a hurt puppy: which
            one of these is the &quot;real&quot; Larry, who so attracts the
            confident, canny Ricki is unclear. When he starts explaining his
            &quot;sadness&quot; to her -- he's sad because he's been sleeping
            next to a beautiful woman who's also &quot;untouchable&quot; and
            &quot;unhaveable,&quot; a &quot;dykeasaurus rex&quot; -- she looks
            at him with love. Um, why? <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Of
            the many anomalous scenes cobbled together for <i>Gigli</i>, the one
            garnering the most attention concerns Ricki's instruction to Larry
            on the overvaluation of the penis and the meaning and worth of the
            perfect lips between her legs, that is, &quot;what I am proud to
            call my pussy.&quot; That she delivers said instruction while
            stretching on her yoga mat enhances his appreciation, and his vacant
            expression here gets something like its own workout. Camera angles
            set him up, of course, to reflect viewers' similar enthrallment.
            It's no longer a masculine presumption, but a giving over to her,
            agreeing to be her &quot;bitch,&quot; accepting his own
            vulnerability and, after a fashion, generosity. Perhaps Larry is
            right, you never know. </font><o:p>
