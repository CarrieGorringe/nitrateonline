			<a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>,
            25 April 2003</i></font><p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="5">Tricks </font>

			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700">
			<font size="2">Memory is a tricky business. So are movies that mess 
			with it. In <i>Levity</i>, Manual Jordan (Billy Bob Thornton) is an 
			ex-con, released against his will after serving twenty-two years for 
			the murder of a seventeen-year-old convenience store clerk named 
			Abner Easley (played in flashbacks by Geoffrey Wigdor). Manual 
			cannot stop thinking about what he did, but he remembers it in ways 
			that suit his needs, that is, to feel guilt and pain, to pay -- 
			repeatedly -- for what he's done. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">&quot;What I 
			remember most from before was people's voices,&quot; Manual says by way 
			of introducing himself. &quot;Floating on the wind and laughing, like 
			everyone was in on something, like it all mattered somehow.&quot; You 
			might glean from this that Manual isn't feeling particularly in on 
			anything; in fact, he's become rather attached to his cell, where he 
			keeps a newspaper photo of Abner, commemorating the crime. 
			(Incredibly, twenty-three years later, the newspaper remains 
			unyellowed, poetic license inspired by writer-director Ed Solomon's 
			own memory of a man he once tutored at a maximum security prison; in 
			that case, the prisoner had killed someone as a teenager and kept a 
			photo on his cell wall.)&nbsp; The parole board commutes Manual's life 
			sentence to time served, almost as another sort of punishment: &quot;You 
			don't have that choice,&quot; they pronounce, when he says he's &quot;happy&quot; 
			in prison and would rather not leave. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">And so, Manual 
			goes forth on a mission to confront and maybe reconcile himself with 
			his memory of that fateful day. Returning to the city (shot in 
			Montreal), where he committed his sin, Manual takes to watching 
			Abner's sister, Adele (Holly Hunter). He observes her leaving her 
			apartment building, trudging through snowy alleys; he follows her 
			when she goes shopping. She soon spots him, as he's a bit of a 
			striking misfit, lanky-framed and sunken-eyed, with gray hair 
			drooping to his shoulders, and wonders if he's following her. Well, 
			yes, and he wants to carry her bags home for her. Ordinarily, no 
			way. But in a movie, such creepy coincidence tends to work out.&nbsp;
			</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Manual's lack 
			of social skills is understandable, of course, given that he's been 
			locked away all this time. Fortunately, he looks slightly less 
			shabby than he might have, as he has a place to stay and a job, 
			which come to him completely by chance (or fate). On his first night 
			in town, he stops by the convenience store where he killed Abner, 
			and in the parking lot, a pay phone rings, and on the other end is 
			Miles Evans (Morgan Freeman). This godsend runs a community center, 
			where he preaches the gospel to kids in exchange for a parking 
			space. Lots of kids come by each night, as the center is located 
			across the street from a pounding-dance-music club. He hires Manual 
			to look after the cars, and to hold after school sit-downs with a 
			crew of black and Hispanic boys whose basketball hoop is removed by 
			the city. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">One of the 
			club's frequent patrons is Sofia Mellinger (Kirsten Dunst), wealthy 
			daughter of a one-hit wonder now immersed in booze and drugs. 
			Sofia's angry and self-hating, and so, each night she disappears 
			into the club, where she sinks into a stupor. Self-confident even in 
			her self-loathing, Sofia stands up to the basketball kids, 
			recognizing that their woo-wooing isn't so threatening as they seem 
			to think it is. White girl impresses the boys, who start inviting 
			her to hang out and play pool down at the center. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Sofia is 
			similarly instructive for Manual, though he imagines that he's going 
			to be her teacher. When he carts her home one night, following her 
			lapse into unconsciousness at the club, Manual observes that she's 
			squandering her life. This makes him mad, especially when she can't 
			even remember that he drove her home, memory being a crucial sign of 
			morality for him. Soon, though, she gets him to recall for her what 
			happened; then he sees her taking care of her dilapidated mum. <b>
			<i>Voilà</i></b>, he sees that she's not just a self-squandering 
			child, but a lost soul, sad and aching, a reflection, in her snotty, 
			privileged way, of him.</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">All this 
			twisting of memory and desire leads where you might expect. Everyone 
			in sight has something to be sorry for, from Miles (who finds 
			himself question about a former worker being tracked by a couple of 
			federal agents, one played by Dorian Harewood, who needs more time 
			on screen) to Sofia to Adele, who also comes equipped with a 
			teenaged son, also named Abner (Luke Robertson), who is, for unknown 
			reasons, hanging out with a &quot;gang&quot; and getting into &quot;gang&quot; violence. 
			This bit of business is sketchy and stereotypical, an unimaginative 
			shortcut to&nbsp; predictable crisis. And while this crisis might look 
			like a means to Manual's redemption, it really just exposes the 
			skimpy script. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Even more 
			unfortunately, <i>Levity</i> uses Miles as yet another means to the 
			white guy's self-understanding. As righteous as he appears in his 
			lectures to the club kids (who scrape their shoes and look at their 
			fingers while he's talking, itching to be on their way), Miles has 
			his own troubling memory, to which the movie doesn't explore so much 
			as lay out as another &quot;reflection&quot; for Manual to ponder. Following 
			his gonzo alien-shooter in <i>Dreamcatcher</i>, Freeman's 
			performance here is admirably restrained. But what with his 
			miraculous phone call, uncanny wisdom, and convenient exit by film's 
			end, Miles looks a lot like a Magical Negro -- definitely not a 
			memory that needs to be dredged up again.&nbsp; </font></span></td>
