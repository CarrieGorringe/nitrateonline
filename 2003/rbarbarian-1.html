            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>It has been sixteen years since
            we last encountered Denys Arcand’s merry band of <b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">fin-de-siècle</i></b> boomer
            sybarites in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Decline of the
            American Empire</i>. As that film ended, history professor Rémy
            (Remy Girard) was, thanks to his tireless indulgence in serial
            adultery, in the process of ruining his marriage to the sweet but naïve
            Louise (Dorothée Berryman). In the sequel, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Barbarian Invasions</i> (<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Les
            Invasions Barbares</i></b>), time is running out for both Rémy and
            the sense of invincibility that North Americans had enjoyed for over
            fifty years. In Rémy’s case, the agony of a terminal illness is
            compounded by the decrepit excuse for a health-care system that
            exists in Quebec. Distressed over his degraded condition, Rémy’s
            always solicitous ex-wife calls their son, Sébastien (Stephane
            Rousseau), and begs him to return from his privileged life in France
            and use some of his trading skills to help his father. Once home, Sébastien,
            appalled by the situation, proceeds to prove that lots of money,
            spread liberally among the right administrators and union members,
            cuts through even the most recalcitrant of red tape. After being
            appraised of the hopelessness of his father’s condition, Sébastien
            inquires about the effectiveness of pain killers. The best solution,
            according to a doctor, is heroin. After some searching, he enlists a
            daughter of one of his father’s old &quot;friends&quot;, Nathalie
            (Marie-Josée Croze) to procure a little extra from her supplier on
            a regular basis. Soon, Rémy’s situation improves to the point
            where Sebastien decides that a final meeting of the old gang,
            including Pierre (Pierre Curzi), Claude (Yves Jacques) and Dominique
            (Dominique Michel) is in order, so that they can see Rémy through
            to the end.<o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While Rémy is enacting his own
            personal tragedy, the events of September 11, 2001 unfold,
            destroying forever Americans’ belief in their personal safety.
            Like Ancient Rome before it, America suffers the brutal consequences
            of having the barbarians breach their gates. Unlike in Ancient Rome,
            the question left unanswered, is whether or not the initial breach
            will turn into a full-fledged rout of Western Civilization.<o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As usual, the satirist Arcand has
            his pick of targets which he savages with aplomb. The constant,
            agonizingly long tracking shots of hospital hallways crammed with
            sick people signifies the severe crisis in Quebec health care (and
            the images look chillingly similar to photographs published a few
            years ago in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">McLean’s</i>
            magazine). Left-leaning historians are also ripe for the puncturing;
            in a flashback, Rémy is seen extolling the virtues of the Chinese
            Cultural Revolution to a colleague who suffered under its excesses.
            But while corrupt bureaucrats and ideologically-blinkered
            intellectuals are always relevant and easy targets, Arcand spares no
            one in pursuing his real intent: the exploration of the end of life
            itself. Even Rémy, who all of his life pursued hedonism with an
            almost sociopathic obsession, must confront not only the inevitable
            failure of the body that became the center of his real
            &quot;work&quot; -- the pursuit of pleasure -- but he must also
            confront the damage, in both his professional and personal lives,
            from having chosen to live that way. It is the ultimate in cruel
            ironies that Rémy -- who fancied himself a man of the mind -- is
            now forced to rely solely upon his mind to relive his past as his
            body deteriorates. It begs the question of whether or not Rémy
            could ever have been a real intellectual, or someone who simply used
            his intellect just enough to collect the aphorisms that justified
            his behavior. It is the question that Rémy is forced to confront
            when things come to a head at Pierre’s lakeside cottage, the place
            where it all began. As the friends gather to help Rémy through his
            final days, Arcand makes you aware that they, too, have been forced
            to confront their own lack of immortality and that, like Rémy, they
            have been playing at real life. When the friends part this time,
            they will be one fewer, but will they be wiser for the experience?
            They all seem more inert than enlightened. Only Louise appears best
            able to cope with what’s coming, but even she is incapable of
            action.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is the young people, Sébastien
            and Nathalie, who, in the face of what paralyzes their elders, act
            without hesitation to manage the impending situation in the most
            dignified manner possible, and they are the ones best able to
            confront the aftermath. Sébastien is able to forgive his father,
            and accept him for what he was. Nathalie, newly reunited with her
            mother, makes another attempt to improve her life. They, of course,
            have the advantage of time on their side, which makes the ability to
            change seem more possible, and what came before to seem like less of
            a waste. When the trappings of life fall away, as they do under the
            force of impending death, Arcand suggests that only friendships
            remain. Those, and a really good supplemental health-insurance plan,
            might be enough to make the end more palatable. <o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The performances in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Invasion
            of the Barbarians</i> are first-rate. We know the actors and their
            characters well-enough to love these old reprobates like a pair of
            well-worn slippers. But it is Croze who steals much of the
            attention. Her interpretation of Nathalie as a woman on the edge who
            is still nursing the hurt child inside, but who can still pull
            everything together when it is necessary is as much a part of the
            emotional center of the film as Remy himself. Nathalie becomes his
            nurse, and, at one point, his betrayer, but, inevitably, in coming
            to know and love Rémy, she sees the need to change her life. His
            death gives her -- and Sébastien -- strength. The second generation
            is in good hands.<o:p>
