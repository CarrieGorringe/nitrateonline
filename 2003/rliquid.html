            Savada</a>, 15 August 2003</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>I was a red-blooded, yet
            reserved, sixteen-year-old when <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Endless Summer</i>, Bruce Brown's ultimate search for the
            &quot;perfect wave,&quot; caught moviegoers's attention back in the
            mid-1960s. That hour-and-a-half documentary helped steamroll the
            already mushrooming form of recreation entertainment that now has an
            international following of four million young, old, fearless, and
            undoubtedly well-tanned individuals seeking out the best surf this
            side of the moon. Having grown up on the East Coast off the Long
            Island Sound, and having, at best, body surfed a handful of
            vacations somewhere between Atlantic City and Long Beach (New York,
            not California), I was not one of those teenage dudes inclined to
            head west and join others enlightened by the call of the board, or
            what has become known as &quot;the stoke&quot; -- the Zen-like
            passion and obsession that draws surfers back for wave after wave
            after wave. Surfing great Gerry Lopez, who made Pipeline the most
            famous wave, offers particularly insight into this philosophy:
            &quot;The first twenty years are to see if you are interested (in
            surfing).&quot; He, and just about everyone else in this film, are
            into the sport for the fun, whether competing or not. Hey, we all
            have our voices to follow. The ones I heard happened to be through
            ears that weren't filled with sea, salt, and sand&nbsp;<o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thankfully, others have followed in
            Bruce Brown's now classic footsteps -- and those of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Endless
            Summer</i>'s 1994 sequel. The voice of the surfer is back (not that
            it was missing, just encased in fictional fare such as last year's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Blue
            Crush</i> and, tangentially, in the animated feature <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Lilo
            &amp; Stitch</i>), and thirty-six years after he caught his first
            cinematic wave, Bruce has returned -- as executive producer and
            occasional talking head -- in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Step
            Into Liquid</i>, an engaging, enthralling follow-up made by his son,
            Dana Brown, who also narrates with the same witty, humorous subtlety
            that saturates what is the best surfing film ever made&nbsp;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Before the disclaimers that no
            special effects, stuntmen, or stereotypes were employed in the
            making of this film, Brown <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">fils</i>
            welcomes us with a single word: <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Aloha</i>.
            We depart, too quickly, eighty-eight minutes later, with the same
            singular subtitle. Too many people know the Hawaiian word as just
            hello and goodbye, but it also means joy, happiness, and pleasure,
            which is exactly what Brown and his incredibly talented and intrepid
            camera operators serve up. Jack-of-all-trades Brown and director of
            photographer John-Paul Beeghley do yeoman turns behind the camera as
            the film travels the world looking for the latest sea-worthy thrill
            or diversion&nbsp;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Wide angle lenses and wide screen
            images give you a surf's-eye view of the incredible on-screen who's
            who of surfing talent (not a beach bum among them) -- Laird
            Hamilton, Kelly Slater, Dave Kalama, and Ken &quot;Skindog&quot;
            Collins to name too few -- as they use short, long, and seemingly
            extraterrestrial (actually hydrofoil) surfboards to ride (standing,
            kneeling, posing, even paralyzed) any manner of big (often) and
            little waves (for the funny, human interest portions). And nearly
            every other shot in this two-year undertaking is a money shot.
            Frigging, breath-taking incredible. Brown and his water-logged
            mariners and helicopter crew visit all the expected high spots,
            including Hawaii's North Shore of Oahu; Rapa Nui, Chile, in the
            remote Easter Islands; Western Australia; Half Moon Bay, California
            (of course); Costa Rica (with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Endless
            Summer</i> co-star Robert August and its sequel's Robert
            &quot;Wingnut&quot; Weaver in tow); and the with lady professionals
            in Tahiti. There are also detours to some locations even some
            die-hard fans might have missed. Sheboygan, Lake Michigan's surf
            city for the fresh water fanatic. Riding the three-mile wake caused
            by supertankers off Galveston, Texas, in the Gulf of Mexico. Join
            the Molloy Brothers as they educate Protestant and Catholic in a
            school for young surfers in County Donegal, Ireland. Or a journey
            into the past: Vietnam vet Jim Knost returns, with his
            eighteen-year-old son, to the beaches he surfed during the war three
            decades earlier&nbsp;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Brown moves from place to place and
            piece to piece with a determined, professional grace and pace,
            stopping occasionally for the interesting aside or the memorable
            flashback. At one point he uses subtitles that comically play off
            the MasterCard commercials. He spends a few minutes with Dale
            Webster, who has hit the waves with his board every day, rain or
            shine, for nearly thirty years. He's quite the character.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like any good filmmaker, Brown
            saves the best of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Step Into
            Liquid</i> for last, taking some stout-hearted men for a 100-mile
            boat ride off the coast of San Diego, to the Cortes Bank, where the
            Everest-size (well, sixty-six-feet high) swells make the waves
            surfable maybe five days a year. The rest of the time the ocean is
            ugly backwash and white water. Incredible doesn't do this justice.
            Brown takes us from sea to majestic sea and shows us how much fun he
            and his friends are having at play in the seas of our Lord. Amen..</font></td>
