            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The first of the two Luigi
            Pirandello stories that Paolo and Vittorio Taviani have adapted into
            the film <i>Tu Ridi</i> begins with a man laughing in his sleep. In
            their neo-modernist apartment in Rome, the man's pretty,
            Russian-born wife wakes him up to ask what is going on. The man
            replies that he has no idea (his wife suspects otherwise), doesn't
            know what could be causing it, and, moreso, doesn't know what in his
            life at that moment should make him act so uproarious.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Doctor's order have forced the man,
            Felice (Antonio Albanese), to give up a singing career as a baritone
            -- he now works as an accountant for the same opera company he once
            sang for. Sitting at the desk opposite his is Tobis (Giuseppe
            Cederna), a still-young man who must walk with the aid of a cane,
            and who is subjected to the same, petty, casually cruel ritual every
            morning while walking to work. Three men come up behind him, one
            swipes his cane out from under him (causing Tobis to fall), tosses
            it to the second man, who then passes it to the third -- who, rather
            than break or do something else with it, gives it back to Tobis. The
            experience is doubly frustrating because the third man is also the
            man who runs the opera company.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Felice eventually goes to see a
            doctor about his nocturnal laughing, and the doctor turns out to
            have also studied psychology. He urges Felice to try and remember
            what it is he may be dreaming at the time when he starts laughing in
            his sleep. Felice does, but what he finds out mortifies him: what he
            is laughing at in his sleep is the infirmity of Tobis, someone whom
            Felice considers to be a friend.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Tavianis have set this story in
            what looks to be the second half of the 1950s, and from our vantage
            point, we can judge what Felice is experiencing a little more
            clearly. Dreams are often not a literal expression of anything -- in
            fact, they may be cathartic, so that Felice's laughter is actually
            an expression of the rage and helplessness that he is experiencing
            over the way Tobis is being treated. Also, all of us, at one point
            of another, have experienced a moment in our own lives when we have
            felt or expressed something that, morally or logically, we consider
            to be inappropriate. That doesn't make us a bad person -- it's part
            of life, and the important thing is how we decide to respond to
            those feelings. Felice -- who is played wonderfully by Albanese,
            with the expressive face of the common men who turned up in
            Fellini's early films -- reacts profoundly to this turn of events,
            and goes to great lengths to make up for it in a way which he feels
            is right. The story doesn't feel like its burdened with conscience,
            though -- the Tavianis have directed it with a light, brisk, concise
            touch, without playing short the meanings that lie within the drama.
            The story ends up leaving Rome altogether and ends up going to the
            country (which, like the rest of the film, is beautifully
            photographed by the cinematographer Giuseppe Lanci) and to the
            coast, where Felice meets a young woman (Sabrina Ferilli) whom he
            made a great impression on when he was still performing as a singer,
            and who is now traveling with a touring theatre company. In a rural
            trattoria, she even goads Felice into reliving some of his past
            glory by singing a bit of Puccini to the crowd. The story offers a
            tantalizing what-if: should he, a balding, middle-aged man, run off
            with this girl, or follow through with what he had initially set out
            to do when he unexpectedly met her? The story can be seen as being
            about a man who puts his own concerns for another person above his
            own, or about someone who makes a great sacrifice in order to do
            something that he sees as morally right and a point of honor.
            Whichever, at the end of the story we respect Felice's decision to
            do what he feels he must do, even if we don't entirely agree with
            it. He has earned our respect, and we respect his choice in turn.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film's second story takes us
            into totally different territory altogether. At the close of the
            19th century, a doctor (Turi Ferro) is abducted and taken by three
            partially-disguised men into the mountains to be held for ransom.
            Their captive, though, is a country doctor who has no trouble
            recognizing that the three men are brothers whom he's had a chance
            to treat for something at one time or another. Moreover, the
            doctor's family can't, or won't, pay any ransom demand, because they
            either don't have the money or don't want to part with it. The
            brothers' father decides that they can't afford to let him go,
            either, so the doctor must stay with them for an indefinite period
            of time, during which he ends up becoming more acquainted with the
            brothers -- he speaks to them of the stars, and Galileo -- and even
            with their wives and children, having what may arguably be a more
            enriching existence with them than with his more foreboding circle
            of family and friends.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Tavianis have framed this story
            with a modern-day one which starts off showing a man (Lello Arena)
            whisking a young boy from a sparsely-furnished apartment to an inn
            and restaurant in the country which is closed down during the
            off-season (and which is not far from where the story with the
            doctor took place). It looks as if we're initially watching some
            sort of child custody drama -- the boy and the man get along as if
            they were father and son, forcibly separated by a court decree --
            but what we're actually watching is a kidnapping, as well, though
            motivated by far different reasons (the modern-day story is supposed
            to be based on an actual kidnapping, and its outcome, that occurred
            recently in Italy), and it ends on a far darker note. Dark enough,
            in fact, to challenge us to question why these two stories have been
            grouped together under the title <i>Tu Ridi</i> (You Laugh). Both
            the stories have some comical elements to them. More likely is the
            fact that, in both, we see how the main characters respond when
            faced with adversity -- how they respectively &quot;laugh,&quot; in
            their own ways, at it. The realization may not hit you until well
            after you've seen the picture, and may even have flummoxed audiences
            so that, without any obvious explanation at the end, the film may
            not have been as successful as the Tavianis' previous films <i>Padre
            Padrone</i> and <i>The Night of the Shooting Stars</i>. I don't
            think that makes <i>Tu Ridi</i> a less better film than the others,
            though. By being challenging, a film can sometimes become a more
            enriching, and invigorating, experience.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Tu Ridi</i> has just been
            released for the first time in the U.S. on home video, on the Accent
            Cinema label through Facets Video. The Tavianis have just started
            filming their first feature since <i>Tu Ridi</i>, <i>Luisa San
            Felice</i>, based on a novel by Alexandre Dumas père, and starring
            Laetitia Casta.</font></td>
