            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>, 4 April 2003</i></font><p>
			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Cinderella's back and Disney 
			doesn't have her. Chalk this one up in the good ole WB column, that 
			other network (<i>What I Like About You</i>, <i>The Nightmare Room</i>) 
			which celebrates star Amanda Bynes' real 17th birthday (April 3, for 
			the natal-inclined) with this pleasant, diverting, non-offensive 
			(unless you're a snooty Brit) teen-dream variation of 2001's <i>The 
			Princess Diaries</i>. Despite the occasional clumsiness that 
			screenwriters Jenny Bicks and Elizabeth Chandler have embedded in 
			seventeen-year-old American Daphne Reynolds, Bynes blossoms as a 
			determined, resourceful young lady obsessively inclined to connect 
			with a father clueless about her existence, but a parent quickly 
			eager to make amends. Dad is dashing Lord Henry Dashwood (Colin 
			Firth), a beloved London aristocrat with a liberal streak, a 
			carefree past, a secret penchant for Cocoa Puffs, and a bohemian 
			wife (Kelly Preston), or not, depending on how you translate the 
			ancient Bedouin drumbeats. And his favorite rock group is Little 
			Feat (they rock!). Back in New York's Chinatown, Mrs. Dashwood (the 
			maybe missus) doesn't look (or sing) half-bad either in a weakly 
			written role as a devoted mom still looking for the old romance in 
			her life.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Of course this fairy tale needs 
			dark clouds to offset all the artificial sweetness. The Paynes in 
			Daphne's butt are three-fold: Alastair Payne (<i>Brazil</i>'s 
			Jonathan Pryce), the family's scummy political advisor, who 
			unceremoniously shuttled Daphne's mom-to-be, Libby, out of the 
			family's palatial abode just over sixteen years earlier; his 
			daughter Glynnis (Anna Chancellor), ensconced at Dashwood Manor as 
			Henry's stuffy fiancée; and the impeccably arrogant Clarissa 
			(Christina Cole), a.k.a. Daphne's evil, future stepsister. These 
			three are all orchestrating their own blatantly self-profiteering 
			agenda (to install their man at 10 Downing Street and obliterate his 
			hypothetical offspring), oddly missed by the plop-plop, fizz-fizz 
			man of the house (but not by his servants). There's also conceited 
			stuffed shirt Armistead Stuart (Ben Scholfield), a Cambridge 
			over-achiever anxious for a kiss from the American sweetheart, but 
			more inclined to get a kiss off.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Bynes, a former Nickelodeon star (<i>The 
			Amanda Show</i>, <i>All That</i>) more than holds her own in her 
			second feature (after <i>Big Fat Liar</i>), fighting off the ambient 
			smugness with the help of the other Mrs. Dashwood (Eileen Atkins), 
			Henry's down-to-earth mum, and Ian Wallace (newcomer Oliver James) 
			as Daphne's love interest, too often bumping into the damsel in the 
			dress at one posh outing after another (she as thirty-ninth 
			contender to the throne, he as a working stiff). And let's not 
			forget Firth, who looks damn good in black leather as he comically 
			dumbs down to his daughter's tweenish level.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The script leaves horrible potholes 
			all over the streets of London, paved over with an impressive 
			soundtrack of Clash's <i>London Calling</i>, Craig David's <i>What's 
			Your Flava</i>, and numerous other songs, including Oliver James' 
			strong rendition of James Brown's classic <i>Get Up Offa That Thing</i> 
			and two other tunes. There are several buddy sequences where the 
			action derails in deference to relation-building side trips 
			(father-daughter, daughter-lover, daughter-grandmother). Some of the 
			writing is just plain unbelievable, particularly where Henry remarks 
			that Daphne has his eyes. She's got two, alright (hey, maybe I'm 
			related, too!), but the similarities stop there. Hers are gray, his 
			are brown.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There's nothing terribly original 
			here, and some old-timers will notice <i>What A Girl Wants</i>' 
			similarities with the 1958 MGM film <i>The Reluctant Debutante</i>, 
			as both share the same source material, a mid-1950s comedy by 
			Scottish playwright William Douglas Home. In the earlier film it's 
			Rex Harrison as the suave, urbane father and Sandra Dee (!) as his 
			soon-to-be-launched-on-society daughter. Now, with a half-century 
			update, the story still remains fresh, if somewhat far-fetched. 
			Director Dennie Gordon, a student in the David E. Kelley Television 
			School (<i>Picket Fences</i>, <i>The Practice</i>, <i>Ally McBeal</i>) 
			and one other feature (<i>The Adventures of Joe Dirt</i>) handles 
			her cast well within their loosely-drawn stereotypes. The 
			photography by Andrew Dunn (<i>Gosford Park</i>, <i>Ever After</i>) 
			is brilliantly primary, ably lighting up Bynes' remarkable skin 
			tone.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>What a Girl Wants</i> is pretty 
			much Bynes' movie, and the young star rises to the opportunity, even 
			if her character suffers from a terminal case of too-perfect 
			flagrant optimism. She's a spunky actress who brings to mind Kirsten 
			Dunst in her <i>Jumanji</i> period. These gals could pass as 
			sisters. But Bynes' fish-out-of-water Daphne is effervescence 
			personified, and decked out in an abundance of elegant royal wear, 
			she's a stunner. <i>What a Girl Wants</i> will undoubtedly please 
			its intended young audience, and maybe provide a few diverting 
			minutes of entertainment for the rest of us.</font></td>
