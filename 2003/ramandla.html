            you are looking for a distant, dispassionate recounting of life in
            South Africa under Apartheid, it would be wise to avoid Lee Hirsch's
            <i>Amandla! A Revolution in Four-Part Harmony</i>. One of the great
            strengths of the film is that it makes the struggle to topple white
            minority rule deeply personal and passionate. Even the commentators
            in the film who supported the South African government's policy from
            1948 to 1993 of denying blacks basic rights and placing them into
            forced labor describe their activities in a first-hand and almost
            gut-wrenching manner.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></span></font></p>
            <p style="text-indent:0in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            American filmmaker Hirsch accomplishes this feat by achieving a
            remarkable intimacy with his interviewees and by concentrating on
            the surprisingly important role of music in the fall of Apartheid.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p style="text-indent:0in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">According
            to Hirsch and the musicians and the political leaders he interviews,
            music was able to galvanize the anti-Apartheid movement in a way
            that that no other medium could. Blacks were often denied education,
            and journalism served the interests of the white establishment.
            Protest songs were able to reach people that protest leaflets or
            conventional media could not. Music conveyed ideas that couldn't be
            expressed any other way. Many times the lyrics bluntly stated what
            couldn't be said in a speech, and the tunes often had coded lyrics.
            This was especially true because key leaders like Nelson Mandela and
            others were in jail, killed or exiled. At one point, merely
            mentioning Mandela's name could cause trouble.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Nonetheless,
            musicians also suffered for speaking out. <i>Amandla!</i> is framed
            around the execution of protest composer Vuyisile Mini. In the film,
            the government moves his body from a pauper's grave nearly forty
            years after his death to place his remains in a more dignified
            setting. Some of the most moving testimony in the flick comes from
            musicians like trumpeter Hugh Masekela and pianist Abdullah Ibrahim,
            who lived in exile for decades. Singing tunes by Miriam Makeba
            (another exile) in public could get the &quot;offender&quot;
            arrested.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><o:p>

            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">With
            all the suffering that occurred, it's remarkable that both <i>Amandla!</i>
            and its music are vibrant and rousing. Many of the tunes like <i>Madame
            Please</i> are like dirges, but much of the music is surprisingly
            upbeat, as if the notes themselves offered hope. The content and
            style of the music is also remarkably diverse. Some ditties are
            heavenly choral numbers, whereas Ibrahim's music is based in jazz.
            American-style pop and traditional percussion music also played a
            role in the movement. In fact, some of the cheeriest, catchiest
            songs have the most militant words.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">The
            militancy gets disturbing, but the most shocking moments in <i>Amandla!
            </i>come from propaganda film excerpts for the white government and
            from recollections of the people who enforced its policies. One
            particularly appalling clip from the late 1950s extols the virtues
            of passbooks, which the government required blacks to carry in order
            to travel in the country. As a white housewife examines her
            servant's records, the narrator cheerily announces, &quot;Nothing
            missing except one tooth.&quot; Later in the film, a former
            executioner named Johan Steinberg describes his old occupation with
            a glum, yet still chilling, detachment. A group of former riot
            police are eerily amusing when they recall that certain tunes seemed
            to incite greater hostilities.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt"><o:p>

            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Hirsch,
            who cut his teeth making South African music videos, shoots all of
            his talking head segments with vivid colors. Although the camera is
            often a bit overly mobile, there is a contagious visual energy that
            runs throughout <i>Amandla!</i> that fits the music and the themes
            beautifully. The</span> title comes from the Xhosa word for
            &quot;power.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 12.0pt">Hugh
            Masekela recalls how fellow trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie said he wished
            he could join the anti-Apartheid revolution because people were
            constantly singing and dancing. After watching <i>Amandla!</i>,
            Gillespie's statement seems like much more than idle praise</span>.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
