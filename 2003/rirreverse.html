			<span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="5">The Western 
			Syndrome </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Note: Plot 
			spoilers, sort of. As the movie works in reverse, technically, you 
			know the conclusion at the start. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><b>Gaspar Noé's
			<i>Irréversible</i> comes at you hard. Early scenes take you 
			careening down dark twisty hallways, deep inside a sex club called 
			&quot;The Rectum.&quot; As the camera passes men in mid-sex-acts, the 
			soundtrack roars and grinds, dragging you down even further, into 
			the mind of Marcus (Vincent Cassel), as he seeks out &quot;Le Tenia&quot; (the 
			Tapeworm, played by kickboxing champion Jo Prestia). Their eventual 
			confrontation, barely comprehensible, ends with Marcus' rape and Le 
			Tenia's brutal murder, his head bashed in with a fire extinguisher.
			</b></font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">While this 
			early sequence is so overwhelmingly visceral that the specifics are 
			sometimes illegible, the film's much-discussed centerpiece -- Le 
			Tenia's vicious rape and beating of a beautiful girl, Alex (Monica 
			Bellucci, married to Cassel) -- is plainly displayed. For nine 
			minutes, the camera doesn't move, just sets up on the floor of an 
			underground pedestrian tunnel and watches. The scene is harrowing, 
			visceral, uncommonly difficult, and it has educed vehemently 
			polarized responses, from disgust at its explicitness, to awed 
			respect for its nihilist daring and existentialist grandeur. <b><i>
			Irréversible</i> </b>has nerve, that's for sure. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">It also has 
			outrage, fear, and a severe, if skewed, sense of morality, at once 
			uncompromising and irrational. For all its menace, for all its 
			apparently scandalous cruelty, Noé's film (much like <i>Eyes Wide 
			Shut</i>, his self-declared inspiration) is primarily an indictment 
			of narrative conventions and belief systems. Disdaining the ease 
			with which violence is made thrilling and viewers identify with 
			those who perpetrate it, the movie makes a case for the complacency 
			and lack of self-reflection that stake most moral grounds. Judgment 
			and entertainment are dangerously analogous. (Consider the U.S. news 
			items titled &quot;Target: Iraq&quot; or &quot;Showdown with Saddam.&quot;)</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"><b><i>
			Irréversible's </i></b>first scene establishes the base for this 
			indictment, as the butcher Philippe (Philippe Nahon) -- the abusive 
			protagonist of Noé's first, also &quot;controversial&quot; feature, 1998's <b>
			<i>Seul Contre Tous</i></b> (<i>I Stand Alone</i>) -- recalls his 
			crimes for an impassive, chain-smoking listener: &quot;I was in the 
			joint,&quot; Phillipe says. I slept with my daughter.&quot; &quot;Ah,&quot; comes the 
			bland and profound rejoinder, &quot;The Western syndrome.&quot; </font></span>
			</p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The movie 
			proceeds to unravel this syndrome -- the guilt and desire, 
			retribution and machismo that underpin so much myth and history. The 
			plot unfurls in reverse (in twelve single takes), so that this first 
			scene will become a kind of annotation on comes after. The next 
			scene is the first to show Marcus and his fire-extinguisher-wielding 
			friend Pierre (Albert Dupontel), specifically, the consequence of 
			their punishment of Le Tenia, the man who raped and beat Alex into a 
			coma: Marcus is carried out of The Rectum on a stretcher, Pierre is 
			hauled away in handcuffs, grimly bumping along the street in a 
			police van. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The events that 
			lead up to this pathetic and devastating finale are rendered in 
			images increasingly legible, increasingly dissociated from Marcus 
			and Pierre's internal frenzies (and so, somewhat ironically, easier 
			to grasp and evaluate). It turns out that they share a sense of 
			culpability, and act to redeem themselves, as boys tend to do in 
			movies. Following a fight at a party where Marcus is inebriated and 
			obnoxious, they allow Alex, currently Marcus' girlfriend and 
			formerly Pierre's, to leave alone. Upset, she elects to walk through 
			an underground tunnel rather than navigate the traffic on the street 
			above. Here she runs into Le Tenia, a gay pimp, fuming for his own 
			reasons. The film's final moments, pre-rape, grant access to Alex's 
			experience, the secrets she withholds from Marcus, as well as her 
			(frankly, rather conventional) embodiment of life and hope. </font>
			</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">This backwards 
			structure has inevitably drawn comparisons to <i>Memento</i>, but 
			where Chris Nolan's film sucked you up inside Leonard's traumatized 
			mind, Noé's jumps from one character to another: the self-involved 
			beau, jealous ex, the self-possessed object of their parallel 
			affections. The very familiarity of these tensions makes the 
			characters' sensational fates all the more disturbing. Alex's anger 
			at the self-involved Marcus has a source that he can't know; 
			Pierre's continuing devotion to Alex shapes his relationships with 
			both his friends, in ways that none of them articulates. And each 
			makes choices that are, in effect, irreversible. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Some of these 
			choices -- especially those made late in the film (or, early in the 
			chronology) -- appear quite ordinary. Alex, Marcus, and Pierre take 
			the metro to the party, as Pierre's car is unexpectedly unavailable. 
			Marcus leaves the bedroom he shares with Alex (featuring a poster 
			for <i>2001</i>) to buy a bottle of wine, leaving Alex alone. She 
			prepares for the evening, showering while the camera watches her 
			with a detachment that's striking after the too-closeness of the 
			rape scene. Marcus acts out at the party, sloppy with some girls in 
			the bathroom, as Pierre chides him for abandoning Alex. The lovers' 
			tiff seems inconsequential, except that you know it's not. </font>
			</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The decisions 
			taken by Marcus and Pierre are momentous, and they come in a rush. 
			Standing alongside the ambulance, they're encouraged to seek the 
			rapist by a couple of brutish types, looming over them, implying 
			they are &quot;pussies&quot; to count on the cops (&quot;The police will do sh*t!&quot;). 
			The urgency of this moment, the realization that, as one thug 
			insists, &quot;Vengeance is a human right,&quot; strikes Marcus and Pierre 
			suddenly. Now their night, so confusing and awful, has a trajectory, 
			one they might make. Moved by fury and frustration, they take what 
			appears to be the film's most overtly potent decision. But they also 
			step into a moment that is almost unspeakably mundane, much like 
			some other movie: they head off to find The Rectum, accost a tranny 
			prostitute, beat up a cabdriver, their panic building all the while.
			</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The majority of 
			moments in <b><i>Irréversible</i> </b>are less manifestly charged. 
			It's only after the plot per se comes clear that they take on 
			significance. The emotional (and ethical) catch is this: though the 
			characters are unable to see beyond their separate, present moments, 
			you know the fallouts from jump. This makes Irréversible's most 
			radical aspect not its depictions of havoc and ferocity, but its 
			more gradual mindf*ck, the vengeance it takes on viewers. </font>
			</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Delivering the 
			end of the revenge tale first, the film undercuts any customary 
			emotional payoff. Marcus and Pierre's attack on Le Tenia doesn't 
			offer up the same satisfaction as a Willis, Eastwood, or Snipes 
			tearing up his sworn enemy, as you've been permitted no investment 
			in the mission or the characters. What you see at first is just 
			violence, abstract and sadistic, only meanness and savagery and 
			bloody pulpiness. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Similarly, the 
			rape occurs before you meet Alex, before you've even seen her face, 
			except as it appears, ravaged and unrecognizable, on a stretcher 
			headed to an ambulance. &quot;Time destroys everything,&quot; asserts a 
			written title. Well, yes, but it also grants resonance and creates 
			meaning. It provides readers with seeming distance and 
			overdetermined perspective, lets you make (what you presume is) your 
			own sense. That you rarely feel responsible for the sense you make 
			is to the point. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">If 
			responsibility remains elusive, eventually, the context for <b><i>
			Irréversible</i>'s</b> horrors becomes obvious. (So does its 
			non-causal timeline: the murder seems to result from the rape, the 
			rape from a quarrel, the quarrel from a realization, etc.) This 
			context is simultaneously cynical and melodramatic, more familiar 
			and more traumatic than the initial, intimidating obscurity of that 
			scene in the Rectum. Finally, you know, there is no sense to what 
			happens, no moral frame, no cause, even if you want to make it. The 
			only sense here is that Western syndrome, the meaning imposed on 
			events by those with the capacity and nerve to interpret and own it. 
			Control, however, remains impossible. And that's what the Western 
			syndrome will never acknowledge.&nbsp; </font></span></td>
