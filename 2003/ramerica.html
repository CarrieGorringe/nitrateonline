            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>A deeply personal, wishful film
            from Dublin-born and -based director-writer Jim Sheridan (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">My
            Left Foot</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">In the Name of
            the Father</i>), <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">In America</i>
            is easily one of the year's best features. Anyone thinking otherwise
            has the heart of a hardened cynic. Shaping the tragedy of a dead
            sibling (Sheridan lost his 10-year-old brother Frankie three dozen
            years ago) with the help of his two daughters, Naomi and Kirsten,
            Sheridan has crafted a poet's vision of himself as the determined
            breadwinner for an young immigrant family struggling with emotional
            ghosts. Their financial burdens play second fiddle to the
            finger-pointing tragedy that has decimated the family's wellbeing.
            In what appears to be an unusual writing process, each Sheridan
            sister submitted separate scripts with distinctly different
            p.o.v.'s; their father selecting scenes from each.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Taxi driver and struggling actor
            Johnny Sullivan fits actor Paddy Considine like a glove. Actually,
            everyone cast in this film shows the same smooth confidence that
            befits the sentimentally sound screenplay. I still recall
            Considine's breakthrough role as an impressively creditable bully in
            Shane Meadows' <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">A Room for
            Romeo Brass</i>, followed by outings in Polish director Pawel
            Pawlikowski's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Last Resort</i> (as a bingo caller who salvages the downtrodden life of
            a young Russian mother and her potentially juvenile delinquent son),
            and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">24 Hour Party People</i>,
            a small hit on last year's art house circuit. He has matured nicely
            professionally, considering he never intended to act for a living.
            He embraces Sheridan's careworn Irish everyman, cradled by a
            compassionate wife (Samantha Morton), and supported by two small
            children, the angelically innocent Ariel and the eternally
            perceptive Christy, a 10-year-old who narrates this tale of hope
            lost and regained. Morton, adorned with the same buzz cut she wore
            in Steven Spielberg's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Minority
            Report</i> shares top billing in her smaller, but magnificently
            graceful role, one bordering on sainthood. Sisters Emma and Sarah
            Bolger make a stunning contribution, particularly the latter as the
            older sibling who is constantly videotaping the family's expressive
            comings and goings, but more often playing doctor, closing the
            psychological wounds that threaten the Sullivan's fragile mental
            health.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The family, having arrived via
            Canada to a glowing, pulsating New York, alight in an rundown
            apartment building blighted with drug addicts and transvestites, and
            a lift that hasn't worked forever. Persistently they barrel through
            their fears, grief, and meager funds, refusing to bow to those
            disappointments that would send many American shrieking away in the
            desperation to darker climates. But the Sulivan unit is strong
            beyond what circumstance has given tem. They appear comforted by the
            city's omnipotent heart, constantly hovering above the Manhattan
            skyline in the shape of a slender, smiling moon. Here is the story
            of Lady Liberty welcoming huddled masses to the land of dreams.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And screams. Within their tenement
            is a troubled soul who has cut himself off from the world around
            him. Mateo (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Amistad</i>'s Djimon Hounsou) is the portrait of the black Nigerian
            artist as a angry man, whose rage melts when the two Sullivan girls,
            on their first Halloween outing, nobly pound him out of his
            reclusive isolation and mystically connect his life spirit with
            theirs.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film aches to be anytime. The
            family does take in an air-conditioned viewing of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">E.T.</i>
            to escape one of those trademark New York summer days, thus placing
            it squarely in 1982 (the year Sheridan first journeyed to the Big
            Apple for his only formal film training at NYU). Beyond this carbon
            dating, the film is timeless, spiritual standard time. The Spielberg
            masterpiece makes another appearance on a family outing to Coney
            Island, where the family gambles their rent money in a nail-biting
            carnie game that escalates badly as Johnny attempts to win a $30 <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">E.T.</i>
            doll for his daughter.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There are heartrending moments
            sprinkled throughout the film, which cinematographer Declan Quinn
            has encased in a lovely glow. Perfectly luminous, not garish. He
            gets us sympathetically close to the family—so familiar with the
            close-ups and medium shots that we tend share their emotions, see
            their demons, and giggle with them as they take a cool shower on a
            hot day or carve angels in the snow.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's not all butterflies and roses;
            there's a distrustful store owner who won't spot Johnny two bits for
            an electrical plug; a self-righteous, coke-sniffing, rapping white
            stockbroker who Johnny mercifully boots out of his cab; and a
            near-death experience with a local junkie. Ultimately, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">In
            America</i> supports the old adage, &quot;Home Sweet Home.&quot;
            It's more. A painfully poignant and sensitive study of the human
            spirit and its nobler sider. The film bursts with affection,
            particularly the AIDS-infected, soul-liberated Mateo, who confesses
            powerfully to a momentarily selfish Johnny that he is in love with
            Johnny's family, his unborn child, his anger, anything that lives.
            Sheridan balances this anger with touches of magic and whimsy, of
            snowball fights, and human benevolence. Revel in it and put aside
            for 100 minutes the terror that grips our daily world. Pray that we
            all practice random acts of kindness and be as fortunate as the
            Sullivans. Let the film stay with you in those lost moments in your
            life. There's plenty of infectious hope <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">In
            America</i> to spread around. It's worth sharing.<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
