            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>, 3 </i></font><i>
			<font face="Verdana" size="1">January 2003</font></i><p><b>
			<font face="Verdana" size="2">Another in the steady stream of 
			documentary and biographical features dealing with World War II 
			persecution, it's obvious from the title that filmmakers
			<span style="color:black">Dana Janklowicz-Mann and Amir Mann area 
			headed east, Far East, in retelling a historically significant, and 
			personal, episode detailing how one international city welcomed tens 
			of thousands of German Jewish refugees while the world's democracies 
			refused them.</span></font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Not overly elucidated on during the 
			course of<i> Shanghai Ghetto</i>, the Evian Conference, held in the 
			summer of 1938, was a significant gathering of officials from 
			thirty-two countries, including the United States (represented only 
			by a businessman-friend of President Roosevelt) and Great Britain. 
			At the conclusion of this nine-day meeting, sympathy for the war's 
			refugees was expressed, yet action was nil in allowing immigration 
			quotas to be relaxed for the German and Austrian Jews, and other 
			political outcasts, to escape the deadly German <i>judenrein</i>, 
			the Nazi cleansing that would eventually take millions of lives. 
			Hitler considered the Evian &quot;non&quot; decision an opportunity to suggest 
			the world didn't want the Jews. A few months later Josef Goebbels, 
			Hitler's propaganda minister, unleashed <i>Kristallnacht</i>, &quot;the 
			night of broken glass,&quot; setting thousands of synagogues aflame, 
			destroying Jewish businesses, and kidnapping tens of thousands of 
			male Jews. Nearly as quickly, fleeing Germany became a priority. 
			Amid the escalating fear (&quot;There's no safety for us anywhere&quot;), 
			escape was difficult.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hence, it was with great 
			reservation that tens of thousands of Jews fled Nazi Germany via 
			loophole and the Suez Canal (and in later years through Siberia) to 
			this Chinese outpost, colonized by Western interests yet then under 
			the control of the Japanese. A handful of these temporary residents, 
			including the father(-in-law) of the filmmakers, come forward and 
			reveal their survival stories. Their talking heads are amplified by 
			archival photographs, family snapshots, stock film, digital footage 
			of two survivors (<span style="color:black">Betty Grebenschikoff</span> 
			and<span style="color:black"> Harold Janklowicz) returning in 2000 
			to visit their old homes),</span> and a dabbling of chronological 
			magnifications by several historians who have extensively researched 
			the topic.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While the civilized world demanded 
			visa and passports for legitimate entry into their countries, the 
			port of Shanghai was the only place that would allow entry without 
			either. Shortly after Japan's victory over China ceded control of 
			the city, passport control laxed. Visas were only required to book 
			tickets on the ships departing from the European war arena. The 
			trip, often with first class accommodations, was unlike the 
			horrifying immigration stories of bodies stuffed in steerage. The 
			three or four week journey provided luxurious cabins, plenty of 
			food, even some entertainment. While some passengers attempted to 
			make unscheduled departures in Egypt, hoping to smuggle themselves 
			into Palestine, most of the seafaring crowd relaxing as the war's 
			horror faded, but never forgotten, with each sunset.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When the refugees arrived in the 
			Japanese-ruled enclave, they found freedom. They also found little 
			employment, no potable water, and bare toilet facilities (i.e., a 
			bucket) Although adrift in an alien culture, they also found two 
			other Jewish communities already settled in the city: The wealthy 
			Baghdadi Jews -- including the Kadoorie and Sassoon families, and 
			the Russian Jews who fled their country following the 1917 
			revolution.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The new, massive immigration into 
			the impoverished Hongkew quarter along the Wangpoo River found 
			authorities unprepared for the onslaught. Housing and food problems 
			were dealt with on some levels by the Baghdadis, and later the Joint 
			Distribution Committee, a U.S. philanthropic effort. Despite 
			arriving penniless, the Germans flourished with their own schools, 
			sports clubs, newspapers, and theatre (German and Yiddish). They 
			were tolerated and certainly better off than the oppressed Chinese.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Until Japan entered the war.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Baghdadis, considered British 
			subjects, were imprisoned after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. On 
			February 18, 1943, the Japanese ordered the segregation of the Jews 
			in Hongkew. Yet this &quot;ghetto&quot; was one without walls. Any 
			non-Oriental face belonged either in the British jail or the cramped 
			ghetto area, where families often slept ten to a room.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Laura Margolis, unceremoniously 
			dumped by the JDC in the dirty, hot, humid, crowded, and 
			foul-smelling city, recounts her attempt to stabilize the situation, 
			including a daring accomplishment -- getting permission from the 
			Japanese rulers to continuer her fundraising endeavors, now turning 
			to the Russian Jews for assistance.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Martin Landau's dispassionate 
			narration is complemented by a sedate score composed by Sujin Nam 
			and performed by Karen Han (<i>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</i>) 
			on the erhu (a two-stringed violin). This fascinating story is all 
			the more touching under the capable hands of the husband-wife 
			filmmakers, who are self-distributing their project. <i>Shanghai 
			Ghetto</i> is an absorbing, anguished story, perhaps too composed to 
			strike a more than passing emotional note. It is an enlightening 
			window to one world that closed its doors to humanity, and another 
			that swung them open.</font></td>
