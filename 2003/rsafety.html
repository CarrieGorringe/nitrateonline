            Fuchs</a>, 7 March 2003</i></font><p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">
			<font face="Verdana" size="5">Still</font></p>
			<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
			Objects seem safe. Unknowing and un-needy, they absorb desires and 
			ask nothing in return, accommodating by definition. That's why you 
			brush your doll's hair, trick out your car, frame your art. You can 
			love your objects without fear of rejection. Or so you think. Rose 
			Troche's <i>The Safety of Objects</i>, which she adapted from A. M. 
			Homes' short stories, suggests otherwise. Here, objects offer only 
			temporary respite, and when you realize they can't sustain the 
			illusion of safety, the drop-off is devastating. &nbsp;</font></b></p>
			<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">To 
			make this rather obvious point, <i>The Safety of Objects</i> offers 
			a series of disturbing relationships between humans and their chosen 
			objects, most obsessive or destructive, all selfish and 
			distressingly heedless. These relationships fester in a suburban 
			neighborhood, where folks have too much time and space, too many 
			objects around them. In this, the movie resembles other recent burb-breakdowns, 
			from Ang Lee's sobering <i>Ice Storm</i> and any of Todd Solondz's 
			increasingly grim visions to the portentous <i>American Beauty</i> 
			and the soapy <i>Life as a House</i>. &nbsp;</font></p>
			<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Much 
			like these films, <i>Safety</i> features a range of characters, 
			across four families, harboring lots of secrets. Lawyer Jim Train 
			(Dermot Mulroney), for example, is passed over for a promotion and 
			walks out, not exactly quitting (so his secretary wonders when he's 
			coming back, and covers for him) and explaining his sudden 
			appearance back home as the result of a &quot;bomb threat.&quot; (The 
			terrorists have won, perhaps, when they serve as an excuse for this 
			self-indulgent dweeb.) When Jim suspects that his wife Susan (Moira 
			Kelly) is having an affair (and even more monumentally, for him, 
			feels pressured by her request for a new dishwasher), Jim resets his 
			own sights on a great big object -- an SUV that a local radio 
			station is giving away, in a contest at the mall. &nbsp;</font></p>
			<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">When 
			he finds that he's too late to enter the contest (one of those 
			keep-one-hand-on-the-vehicle-till-all-other-drop deals), Jim 
			compromises in order to reach his all-important goal. He picks a 
			likely winner, his neighbor Esther Gold (Glenn Close). She's already 
			in the contest at the urging of her daughter Julie (Jessica 
			Campbell), who wants the car less than she wants her mom to get it 
			for her. Julie's reason for being so needy is obvious: for months, 
			Esther has been spending all her time attending to another object, 
			Julie's comatose brother Paul (Joshua Jackson). Glimpsed in 
			flashbacks that lead, slowly, to the car accident that leaves him in 
			this state, once aspiring rock star Paul now lies hooked up to tubes 
			and gauges, still and unchanging. (And frankly, it's not a little 
			weird to see Pacey so laid out.) For Esther, Paul's ever-after 
			unconsciousness makes him perversely safe to love: he'll never leave 
			her, never get in trouble worse than what he's in now. &nbsp;</font></p>
			<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Paul 
			is thus the film's most excruciating object, and his vegetative 
			condition -- so resonant and so inexorable -- affects everyone. As 
			Esther makes him the focus of her desperate devotion, Julie and his 
			father (Robert Klein) withdraw in horror and guilt, and his 
			girlfriend, Annette (excellent Patricia Clarkson), feels herself the 
			object of everyone's accusations. She's not wrong, especially when 
			it comes to the couple of girls who had crushes on Paul, now 
			checking out his coma-penis under the covers and watching Annette 
			through her bedroom window, across the yard. &nbsp;</font></p>
			<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The 
			film's objects continue to accumulate: Annette's daughter Sam 
			(Kristen Stewart) is bravely tending to her autistic sister (Haylee 
			Wanstall), and bearing up under her mom's moodiness and drinking and 
			her dad's astonishing selfishness (he comes to visit only to 
			announce that he's marrying his decidedly unmaternal younger 
			girlfriend, then accuses Annette of turning his children against 
			him). &nbsp;</font></p>
			<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sam 
			focuses her energies on basketball and her lively best friend Sally 
			(Charlotte Arnold), daughter of the wise and weary Helen (Mary Kay 
			Place, who steals every scene she's in, as usual). They smoke 
			cigarettes, they giggle, they share secrets. But for all her efforts 
			to fashion a life for herself outside the pathologies of adults, Sam 
			can't quite elude all damage. She's been turned into another sort of 
			object by the local gardener, Randy (Timothy Olyphant), himself 
			mourning a terrible loss and fixated on Sam, not for her, but for 
			what he projects onto her. &nbsp;</font></p>
			<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For 
			all the objectification and distraction going on in <i>The Safety of 
			Objects</i>, one relationship does stand out. Taking a cue from his 
			frightened and frustrated father Jim, young Jake Train (Alex House) 
			has found the ideal target for his adoration, a Barbie-type doll 
			named Tani (perfectly, and deviously, voiced by Guinevere Turner, 
			star of Troche's first film, <i>Go Fish</i>). Technically, the doll 
			belongs to Emily (Charly Chalom), but whenever Jake has a chance, he 
			takes her away for a bit of kissy-face and lustful chatter. &nbsp;</font></p>
			<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><font face="Verdana" size="2">While 
			the film tends to offer these stolen moments as a kind of dire 
			comedy, as when, in a family restaurant scene, he takes Tani under 
			the table to converse, as his fellow diners look on in some 
			distress. Jake is, of course, emulating behavior he's seen 
			elsewhere, his father's for instance, treating people (his kids, his 
			wife, his coworkers) like objects, unable to imagine they have 
			feelings or needs commensurate to his own. &nbsp;</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But beyond the like-father, 
			like-son match, Jake also reflects most everyone in this 
			neighborhood, and, the film implies, the extended community of 
			self-involved individuals that comprises the burbs. This makes 
			Jake's story funny, if you're feeling superior, and tragic, if 
			you're feeling sympathetic. In any case, if you're feeling anything 
			for someone who's not you, you're a step ahead. </font></td>
