			</font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 16 May 2003</i></font>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Down With 
			Love</i> is empty -- save for the zowie decor (and despite the fact 
			that the film has landed, in hot pink, on the cover of the latest 
			issue of &quot;Film Comment&quot;). The filmmakers and production designers 
			went to town creating a dream of modernist design for the story, the 
			setting for which is New York City, the time -- &quot;Now! 1962!&quot;</font></b></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">They've also 
			tried to revive the Doris Day and Rock Hudson battle-of-the-sexes 
			comedies, with much of the same formula. Renée Zellweger plays one 
			Barbara Novak, who has come from the sticks of Maine to promote her 
			new book, which seeks to emancipate women by getting them to trade 
			men for chocolate. (If this had been set some ten years later, I 
			would have liked to have seen how someone like Erica Jong would've 
			handled such a treatise.) Ewan McGregor, with his head (and body) 
			hair dyed black, plays one Catcher Block, a playboy feature story 
			writer for &quot;Know&quot; magazine who sets out to torpedo Novak's book 
			(which displaces <i>Profiles in Courage</i> from the number one spot 
			on the <i>New York Times</i> best-seller list), but the only way he 
			can get anywhere near her is by impersonating an aw-shucks 
			astronaut, named &quot;Zip Martin&quot;, from Cape Canaveral (just like Rock 
			Hudson impersonated a Texan for Doris Day in <i>Pillow Talk</i>).</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">I remember when I 
			thought the head of our university film society was insane to 
			program &quot;Pillow Talk&quot; as the end-of-term movie one semester. Knock 
			me on the head and call me &quot;Woody&quot;: the film, which I hadn't seen 
			before, turned out to be a howl. A lot of the success of the Rock 
			Hudson and Doris Day movies had to do with the surprise chemistry 
			that develops between the two charismatic, unpretentious stars, who 
			affectionately rib each other and aren't afraid to let themselves be 
			ribbed, or to look a little silly during the process, in return. 
			(Hudson's &quot;stricken&quot; look in <i>Send Me No Flowers,</i> possibly 
			derived from the Douglas Sirk dramas he'd made in the 'Fifties, is 
			classic.) In <i>Down With Love</i>, it's not as if Renée Zellweger 
			and Ewan McGregor don't bring out the best in each other; they don't 
			bring anything out in each other, and neither does the movie. 
			Wearing a black tuxedo and tie, McGregor bends to one side to look 
			relaxed and debonair and turns into an oblique strip of plastic with 
			a grin such as one would see on someone waiting for the needle to go 
			in during an anti-rabies treatment; Zellweger, dolled up in one 
			&quot;stylish&quot; outfit after another (broadloom knit prints, explosions of 
			tulle), purses her lips into a bow, talks breathily, and prances 
			around. They're a collection of mannerisms in search of characters, 
			and the film further adds insult to injury by giving the characters 
			in the picture some rather, uh, unsubtle dialogue that's supposed to 
			pass for sophisticated double-entendre. (&quot;I've been waiting two 
			minutes to eat your hot dog!&quot; And, during one scene that turns out 
			to involve a telescope, &quot;Put your hand on it and tell me when you 
			get it in the right spot.&quot;)</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The secondary 
			leads fare no better. David Hyde Pierce pretty much repeats his 
			Niles Crane performance in the T.V. show <i>Frasier</i> to play 
			McGregor's Tony Randall-ish sidekick. (Randall himself puts in a few 
			brief, and magisterial, appearances, showing us how it's done.) And, 
			as a book editor who befriends Barbara in the city, Sarah Paulson is 
			sometimes enveloped in a cloud of cigarette smoke that seems to be 
			an attempt to satirize how cigarette smoking has been banished from 
			most of our current movies and living spaces.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film does 
			accomplish one dazzling moment, when Barbara's book is promoted on 
			the Ed Sullivan show when Sullivan introduces a guest who will sing 
			&quot;a song of the book&quot;: Judy Garland, herself, who then performs &quot;Down 
			With Love&quot;, the Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg song that we just 
			heard, newly performed, over the film's animated, precocious opening 
			credits. McGregor and Zellweger perform a new song (co-written by 
			Marc Shaiman) over the closing credits, in a sequence that 
			painstakingly, and fondly, recreates the look of the &quot;thrilling&quot; new 
			medium that was then color television. As for the rest of <i>Down 
			With Love</i>, it is a valentine without a center.</font></td>
