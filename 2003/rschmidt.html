            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../kj.html" target="_top">KJ Doughton</a>, 3 January 2002</i></font><p>
			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Warren Schmidt (Jack Nicholson) is 
			a slave to routine, shackled with golden handcuffs during his final 
			days of work as a respected, financially secure insurance actuary. 
			The sixty-six-year-old Nebraskan obediently sits at a desk, waiting 
			for the clock to strike five. By all accounts, it would seem that 
			this soon-to-be retired husband and father is a success. He boasts a 
			sprawling, spacious home in Omaha, forty-two years of marriage, and 
			a spanking new Winnebago in the parking lot. However, as the sun of 
			Schmidt’s perfectly acceptable existence begins to set, the man 
			feels unsatisfied and empty. At a retirement party, he reluctantly 
			accepts the farewell of a yuppie successor, before enduring a string 
			of toasts congratulating Schmidt on &quot;devoting his life to something 
			meaningful.&quot; </font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Why is it, then, that beneath the 
			new bathrobe sent by his soon-to-be-married daughter, something is 
			eating at the man? </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Retirement is a difficult 
			adjustment for Schmidt. This creature of habit continues to wake up 
			a half-minute before his alarm goes off at 7:00 a.m., then finds 
			sanctuary in a home desk space similar to that which he inhabited at 
			Woodsman of the World Insurance Company. Schmidt completes crossword 
			puzzles and reads the paper. Dropping in at Woodsman, the retiree 
			notices that his old desk papers have been boxed and unceremoniously 
			stacked next to a corporate dumpster. It’s heartbreaking. Assessing 
			his life, perhaps for the first time ever, this reserved, regimented 
			Midwesterner laments &quot;the wrinkles, the sagging skin, and the veins&quot; 
			he observes in the mirror. Clearly, this image can’t be an accurate 
			reflection. Meanwhile, Schmidt calls into question his marriage. 
			&quot;Who is this old woman that lives in my house?&quot; he asks, while 
			picking internal, unspoken battles with his longtime mate. </font>
			</p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In a hilarious montage of 
			slow-burning irritation, Schmidt grumbles about the habits and 
			mannerisms that define his wife, Helen (June Squibb). Pulling keys 
			from her purse long before arriving at the car. Tossing out 
			&quot;perfectly good food, just because the expiration date is past.&quot; 
			Reminding him not to &quot;dilly dally&quot; when he’s out and about.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Desperate to beef up his routine 
			with something of substance, Schmidt responds to a television 
			advertisement by Childreach urging watchers to sponsor Tanzanian 
			orphans &quot;for $22 a month.&quot; Encouraged by the organization’s 
			literature to correspond with such children, Schmidt begins a 
			letter-fueled, long distance relationship with six-year-old Ndugu, 
			whom he sponsors from afar.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Such letters are a candid catharsis 
			for Schmidt, and he writes to Ndugu about his most heartfelt, 
			impassioned feelings and thoughts. One chuckle-inducing scene has 
			the senior write, &quot;The guy who took my place at work is a cocky 
			bastard,&quot; before he quickly reviews the expression, remembers who 
			his audience is, and crosses it out. The waves of desperate words 
			also act to contrast Schmidt’s flat, shallow interactions with 
			family and friends, and his inability to connect with others on 
			anything more than a surface level. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A turning point in Schmidt’s 
			unhappy life occurs when his wife suddenly dies. Her passing thrusts 
			the widower into a messy awakening, as he’s forced to reckon with 
			unresolved conflicts and troublesome secrets lingering in the family 
			closet. For instance, there’s the troubling family that his daughter 
			Jeannie (Hope Davis) intends to marry into. Her suitor, Randall 
			Hertzel (Dermot Mulroney) is a Colorado waterbed salesman with Elvis 
			sideburns, a mullet, and a yellow button on his sport jacket that 
			reads, &quot;ASK ME.&quot; After consoling Schmidt on the loss of his wife, 
			this future son-in-law excitedly exclaims, &quot;I’ve got an investment 
			opportunity for you, and it’s <i>not</i> a pyramid scheme.&quot; It’s the 
			comment to make any prospective father-in-law shake in his boots. 
			Schmidt must also come to terms with passive-aggressive Jeannie, who 
			scolds her father for not giving his wife higher priority. &quot;Why did 
			you get her the cheapest casket?&quot; asks Jean shortly after Helen’s 
			funeral. Responding defensively, he blames Mrs. Schmidt for sinking 
			their money into the yet-to-be-driven Winnebago. &quot;I was willing to 
			go as far as the Minnie Winnie,&quot; he complains, &quot;but she wanted the 
			Adventurer!&quot;</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>About Schmidt</i>’s final act 
			sees its protagonist venturing across the country in a frantic quest 
			to stop the marriage between Randall and Jeannie. It culminates in a 
			riotous meeting between the standoffish hero and Randall’s 
			earth-muffin mother (courageously played by Kathy Bates), an 
			uninhibited boozer whose startling confessions make &quot;disclosure&quot; 
			seem a dirty word. &quot;I breast-fed Randall until he was five,&quot; she 
			cheerfully admits. &quot;Other people objected, but look at the results!&quot;</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>About Schmidt</i> is a 
			hysterically funny movie, but its laughs come from moments of both 
			uncomfortable truth and inspired vision. An insect splattered across 
			a windshield. Ceramic miniatures skidding across the roof of a motor 
			home. Nicholson struggling atop an undulating waterbed mattress. 
			Bates letting it all hang out for a startling hot-tub romp. Like the 
			criminally underrated Ben Stiller vehicle <i>Flirting With Disaster</i>, 
			Alexander Payne’s movie induces both giggles and tears as its 
			frustrated subject limps along in search of greater meaning through 
			a landscape more infinite that his past trappings had even hinted 
			at.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ultimately, <i>About Schmidt</i> is 
			about one man’s awakening from the coma of routine, and his 
			snowballing realization that life is what you make of it. Within the 
			conventions of career and marriage, Schmidt is an honorable, 
			accomplished man. But perhaps in other areas of his existence, he’s 
			still just starting from scratch.</font></td>
