            <p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Because the James Bond films
            have been around so long, they have often become self parodies. This
            makes it hard to fashion a really good satire because 007
            misadventures like <i>You Only Live Twice</i>,<i> Octopussy</i> and <i>The
            World Is Not Enough</i> have eliminated the need for such a film.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>From the disjointed <i>Casino Royale</i> to the uneven <i>Austin
            Powers</i> sequels, the satires wind up being less amusing than
            their targets.</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">Johnny English</font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">
            carries on this groan-inducing tradition despite featuring a couple
            of factors that could have really helped. For one, it stars the
            talented British comic Rowan Atkinson of <i>Mr. Bean</i> fame, who
            played 007's comedy relief in <i>Never Say Never Again</i>. Neal
            Purvis and Robert Wade, the screenwriters behind the last Bond film <i>Die
            Another Day</i>, would seem like the ideal people for the task.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The personnel are certainly in
            place, but the inspiration is not. While Atkinson thankfully gets to
            repeat the physical humor of Bean, <i>Johnny English</i> wallows in
            the gross-out antics of the <i>Austin Powers </i>flicks but has none
            of their energy or inventiveness. Atkinson's title role is an MI:7
            desk jockey who idolizes the field agents and would like to fill
            their shoes. When all of the remaining agents are assassinated,
            Johnny gets his wish, but he quickly proves why he had never been
            given an assignment outside of Whitehall. Ordinary weapons like
            pistols have a habit of malfunctioning in his hands, and his assumed
            knowledge of espionage lore leads him to break into wrong buildings.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Despite his almost Freudian
            ineptitude with guns, English correctly surmises than many of MI:7's
            recent headaches are actually due to a French prison mogul named
            Pascal Sauvage (John Malkovich), who is a distant relative of the
            British royal family and wants their throne for himself.
            Fortunately, Johnny also has some help from his far more competent
            assistant Bough (Ben Miller) and a stunning but enigmatic woman
            (Australian singer-model Natalie Imbruglia) who keeps showing up on
            the trail of Sauvage's thugs.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The plot of this might have been
            more fun if Purvis and Wade, who collaborated with William Davies
            from such flops as <i>Stop Or My Mom Will Shoot</i>, had chosen
            additional targets to the Bond franchise. When the <i>Austin Powers</i>
            movies work, it's because Mike Myers and his cohorts manage to
            skewer '60s and '70s pop culture as a whole, giving them more
            potential targets once the Bond japes get old. Instead, these folks
            play the storyline so faithfully that there's really no suspense,
            comic or otherwise. Because the plot twists come like clockwork, the
            impact of the payoff is blunted. Some viewers might even feel so
            prescient that they may send in applications to MI:6. Atkinson's
            pratfalls soon become more obligatory than giggle-inducing. Adding a
            few poop jokes doesn't help, either.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There are some genuine delights,
            though. Atkinson can be very funny because he has no fear of making
            a complete and utter fool of himself. Watching him lip-syncing to
            ABBA is a lot funnier than going through the Bondian motions.
            Malkovich, who really outclasses this flick, throws himself into the
            role with abandon and frankly deserves more free time.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Before the film came to the U.S., <i>Johnny
            English</i> scraped up over $100 million. It's fitting that Robbie
            Williams belts out the film's theme song because both he and the
            film just don't seem that interesting on this side of the pond.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
