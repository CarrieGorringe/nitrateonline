            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hopefully, sympathetically, <b><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">da</i></b>! At least I have been persuaded that a group of highly
            motivated and classically-trained musicians (who all speak and sing
            perfectly understandable English) from Obninsk, a city sixty miles
            south of Moscow, is much more than just your five-and-dime
            blue-plate special. Of all the Nashville-bound performers grabbing
            for the brass ring, Bering Strait <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">finally</i>
            seems poised for the recognition that Seavey so obviously wants her
            audience to hoist upon these poised, anxious, and easily watchable
            kids. After a nearly four-year rollercoaster struggle (crisply
            edited down to ninety-eight minutes) to get their music heard and
            eventually embraced by the masses, these five jacks and two jills
            now find their vulnerable selves empathically captured on
            high-definition tape tumbling down hill after hill of busted record
            deals, occasional homesickness, and the difficult replacement of the
            original bass player. I was reminded of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">This
            Is Spinal Tap</i>'s spontaneously combustible moments when an
            apartment shared by several members of Bering Strait burns down. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Ballad</i>
            is anything but comic, however, as Seavey and her crew showcase the
            frustration of her foreign-born Jobs and that of their American-born
            manager Mike Kinnamon, a bald-headed father figure who counsels and
            houses the kids throughout their extended, emotional wasteland of
            broken dreams and re-discovery. Kinnamon deserves a yeoman's serving
            of gratitude for embracing these strangers in a strange land (the
            Russians and the film crew) and nearly losing his shirt (his other
            businesses failed as he tried to feed everyone) forever fostering
            those backstage Mickey Rooney-Judy Garland visions of performing at
            the Grand Ole Opry.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Seavey, whose two most notable
            efforts have been <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">A Paralyzing
            Fear: The Story of Polio in America</i> for PBS and Discovery
            Channel's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Battle of the
            Alamo</i>, which she co-directed with Academy Award-winning
            filmmaker Paul Wagner, began the journey of her latest effort when
            she was searching to expand her <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">oeuvre</i>
            beyond her previous purely historical pieces. A huge
            country-and-western fan, she contacted then Arista music executive
            Tim DuBois in early 1999, inquiring if there was any up-and-coming
            talent she could photograph on the way to success. DuBois offered up
            seven Russian teenagers (well, the drummer was actually in his
            twenties) his label had just signed and Seavey took the bait.
            Traveling to Nashville, where the director heard the first four
            recordings by the recently arrived group, a deal was quickly struck.
            The Japanese co-producer, NMK, came aboard as filming started in
            July 1999, catering to the large base of C&amp;W fans back home (oh,
            you didn't know it's big over there?). The downside of the film's
            release on Japan's high-definition service was its elimination it
            from Oscar contention in the Documentary category. It's certainly
            not the first time that a well deserving film has been shut out of
            the Academy Award competition by asinine rules.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Seavey's expected quick turnaround
            of eight months to deliver her feature evaporated with the
            unexpected demise of Arista. Questions about whether the film would
            continue, let alone get finished bore heavily on her; Bering Strait,
            which had formed by Ilya Toshinsky in 1990 under the name <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Vesyoly
            Dilizhans</i>, was on the verge of losing its own battle with
            America and retreating to its motherland. Such heartbreak is the
            stuff great country-and-western songs are made of. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Ballad of Bering Strait</i> multiplies that familiar refrain,
            panning across the numerous banner headlines as subsequent,
            seemingly solid, recording deals go awry amid various corporate
            breakups. Thank goodness for fairytale endings.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The digital imagery photographed by
            Erich Roland is rock solid, particularly in catching some of the
            Russian landscape when the filmmakers traveled back to the former
            USSR to backfill the personal perspectives of the individual artists
            (and their seasonally changing hair styles, colorings, and lengths,
            not to mention the additional ear piercings). Each member gets their
            time in the cinematic sun. Lead vocalist Natasha Borzilova recalls
            the sadness surrounding the death her father, a nuclear scientist
            contaminated in the aftermath of Chernobyl. Banjoist Ilya Toshinsky
            amusingly startles some Russian conservatory professors with his
            medley of Natchez Trace and Foggy Mountain Breakdown. Lydia Sanikova
            (keyboards, vocals) has trouble persuading her family that she'd
            rather sing professionally than become a lawyer. Alexander &quot;Sasha&quot;
            Ostrovsky (dobro, steel guitar, lap steel), Alexander Arzamastsev
            (drums), Sergei &quot;Spooky&quot; Olkhovsky (bass), and Sergei
            Passov (fiddle, mandolin) round out the troupe. Passov left the
            group after filming was completed and returned to Russia.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film shines when the band
            shines. And the band shines when it's playing. The harmonies remind
            me of the Dixie Chicks and the Judds, which makes perfect sense
            since the songs in the film and on the CD were recorded and mixed by
            Brent Maher, who produced all the Judd albums and co-wrote many of
            their hits. The only problem I had was that the music heard on the
            film is generally muddied by unfortunate microphone placements. Now
            that I've gotten a taste of Bering Strait, I ache for more music and
            less talk.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            Ballad of Bering Strait</font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2"> is
            one of the handful of features to actually be digitally projected in
            the Washington, DC, market (an exclusive engagement at Landmark's
            Bethesda Row venue begins at the end of February), which happens to
            be home to Seavey, who founded and is current director of George
            Washington University's The Documentary Center (the film's
            co-production entity). I could have and should have caught <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Ballad</i>
            when it played the Washington, DC, Film Festival last spring (where
            it shared the Audience Award); Bering Strait came onstage after the
            screening and performed a thirty-minute set.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The good news is that the film has
            already opened in New York City and Los Angeles, its theatrical
            presentation sponsored by CMT/Country Music Television and
            Microsoft's Windows Media Player in association with Digital Cinema.
            The bad news is that it's unlikely to find a much wider theatrical
            audience. Emerging Pictures presented the film to a variety of
            distributors just prior to the DC Film Festival screening, but
            Emerging's CEO/President (and founder of Cinecom and Fine Line
            Features) Ira Deutchman, who became attached to the film after it
            was finished, found that none felt there was an audience for a film
            about an unknown country and western band. Instead, Emerging is
            handling distribution chores itself. Country Music Television saw
            the film last April and quickly embraced the project and decided to
            allow the film to be seen in theatres before it airs on its cable
            channel on March 21. Michael Koch and Richard Lorber also announced
            the film would be the premiere release for their new DVD label later
            this spring. In the meantime, Seavey and her distributor are closely
            watching the box office (the New York opening was somewhat slowed by
            the massive snow storm last weekend) before possibly expanding into
            eight other markets considered good indie movie/music cities.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It doesn't hurt that Bearing
            Strait, the group's instrumental number on their just released CD
            (which proves that some fairytales do come true) on the hot
            Universal-South label, has just been nominated for a Grammy. The
            disk contains twelve great songs and three Quicktime movies,
            including a six-minute video compiled from <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Ballad</i>
            footage (including some un-released material).</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Just to expand with a final thought
            on how hard it has been for this group to get recognized, speaking
            from a critic who knew nothing of this film until yesterday morning.
            A bookstore across the street from the theatre that will be showing
            the film wasn't stocking the record. They said they had two copies,
            but neither could be found. I next went to Best Buy and scoured the
            racks under &quot;B,&quot; to no avail. One of their snooty floor
            people told me their computer showed seven copies in stock.
            &quot;They're there. Go find them.&quot; Where were they? Care to
            guess? Under &quot;Strait,&quot; as in George. Some moron in the
            corporate office coded the release under the letter &quot;S,&quot;
            figuring this must be a relative of that other country and western
            star. When informed of this error, store management shrugged.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And you wonder why these Russian
            kids have had such a hard time getting people to find them?</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Despite all the hardships,
            disappointments, and crestfallen faces that overfill <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The

            well behaved and well-centered individuals bearing up under the

            permeates <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Ballad</i>'s short
            breath that will force many a viewer to embrace the film, its
