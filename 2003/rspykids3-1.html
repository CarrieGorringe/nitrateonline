            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan
            Lybarger</a>, 25 July 2003</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="5">Fuzzy Logic</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Frequently using locations not
            far from his Austin, Texas home, writer-director Robert Rodriguez
            offers discount budgets but still manages to pass on the thrills to
            his viewers. Rodriguez’s action and kiddie films succeed because
            of his enormous technical skill (he also edits, operates the camera,
            writes the music and performs other tasks) and because his films are
            clearly made with love.</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">His detractors might dismiss
            Rodriguez for making only popcorn flicks, but he can’t be labeled
            as a hack because his movies have a contagious passion that’s
            missing from similar mainstream movies. For example, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Agent
            Cody Banks</i> was made in Hollywood by some established hands, and
            it’s not nearly as fun or even as visually impressive as the
            weakest of Rodriguez’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Spy
            Kids</i> films.</font></p>
            <p><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Spy
            Kids 3-D: Game Over</font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">, his
            latest, is indeed the clumsiest of the trilogy, but he still manages
            to insert just enough thrills and surprises to make the effort
            worthwhile. His latest adventure for sibling agents Carmen and Juni
            Cortez (Alexa Vega and Daryl Sabara) lacks the cohesion of the first
            two films while it still maintains their kitchen sink approach. This
            time around a demented game designer named the Toymaker (Sylvester
            Stallone) manages to capture Carmen’s brain and wants to use his
            new offering to make slaves of the world’s children.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Juni enters the game (titled Game
            Over) himself in order to save her in the same manner that Neo
            enters the Matrix or Jeff Bridges went online in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tron</i>.
            He quickly enlists the help of his grandfather (Ricardo Montalban)
            to battle the game’s numerous obstacles. Grandpa lost the use of
            his legs in an accident and is maybe a little too eager to help
            because the Toymaker is responsible. In the game, however, Grandpa
            now has the body of a superhero to go with his wizened intellect.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The logic of Game Over is a bit
            fuzzy. True, it is the work of a madman, but it would be nice if we
            could figure out how Juni and the other kids he winds up enlisting
            in his cause manage to advance. The adrenaline jolt of the first
            movies is blunted because it’s hard to determine how dangerous
            each level is.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Fortunately, nobody goes to see
            these movies for plotting. On the eye-candy side, Rodriguez eagerly
            explores the possibilities of shooting in 3-D. Objects fly at the
            viewer at regular intervals, and Rodriguez comes up with all sorts
            of cool ways to fill the “expanded screen.” We get to see races,
            trips to the moon, giant robot battles and other delights. Some of
            these tricks actually give the actors plenty of room to show off.
            Stallone not only gets to play a bad guy, but through some nifty
            makeup portrays the three consciences (a soldier, a scientist and
            some type of hippie) who tell the Toymaker what to think. Stallone
            approaches all four roles with a gusto that has been missing from
            his work for the last few decades. It’s also a treat to see
            Montalban use his urbane charm to do something other than
            commercials. Even if he didn’t get those cool CGI legs, he does
            project a dignity that goes hand-in-hand with his character’s new
            powers. In addition, no one else can say, “Corinthian leather”
            with quite the same flair.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Antonio Banderas and Carla Gugino
            have smaller roles as the Cortez parents in this installment, but
            fans of the series will get to see all of their favorite characters
            make a bow toward the end. There’s even an amusing visit from
            everyone’s favorite hobbit during the second act.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The 3-D scenes are lengthy but
            offer breaks so that viewers can give their eyes a break. Older
            audiences might find the glasses a bit too small for comfort.</font></p>
            <p><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Spy
            Kids 3-D</font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2"> also offers an
            ending that’s refreshingly free of vindictiveness. In so many
            films aimed at kids, the story is resolved by having the bad guy
            meet some kind of hideous death (think of the fate of Scar in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Lion King</i> or the villains in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Agent
            Cody Banks</i>). <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Spy Kids 3-D</i>
            concludes with a much friendlier resolution and extols teamwork over
            conquest. Rodriguez gets a little heavy handed with this magnanimous
            approach, but it’s a better attitude for kids than vengeance.</font>
