            Doughton</a>, 17 October 2003</i></font>
            <p><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mystic
            River</font></b></i><b><font face="Verdana" size="2"> is a
            character-driven murder mystery that keeps us guessing in more ways
            than one. The celluloid version of Dennis Lehane’s downbeat novel
            throws us onto the streets of Boston in search of a young girl’s
            killer. However, the true suspense behind <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Mystic
            River</i> involves whether director Clint Eastwood will deliver a
            classic (ala 1992’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Unforgiven</i>),
            or one of his passive, mediocre throwaways (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Rookie</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Blood Work</i>).</font></b></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Eastwood’s efficient, economic
            approach to filmmaking is as legendary as his scowl (he’s the
            antithesis of an impassioned romantic like Francis Ford Coppola in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Apocalypse
            Now</i> mode). While it’s easy to admire his by-the-numbers
            reliability, one sometimes gets the impression that
            Eastwood-the-director is on auto- pilot. Sure, he gets his movies in
            on time and under budget, but it would take a pretty big microscope
            to find any energy in 1997’s anemic <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil</i>.</font></p>
            <p><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mystic
            River</font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">, however, is a
            sprawling story that benefits from Eastwood’s stripped-down
            approach. There are no jive-talking Tarantino exchanges here, and no
            crowd-pleasing pyrotechnics. This allows the director to focus on
            solid acting to guide his grim, complex story of loss and
            retribution to a haunting, tragic crescendo. This time around,
            we’re talking A-List Eastwood.</font></p>
            <p><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mystic
            River</font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2"> is introduced by a
            long tracking shot through the low-rent side of Boston. Squawking
            seagulls and honking cars compete for a listener’s attention,
            while shirts and pants pinned to clotheslines stretch between houses
            like ornamental streamers at a community party. Yet, this is one
            bleak party. You can almost see the paint peel from the wall behind
            two men talking baseball on a rickety porch.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We’re hastily introduced to three
            kids playing street hockey in front of these scrubby homes. Jimmy,
            Dave, and Sean are buddies who stop to etch their names in a wet
            block of cement before two intimidating, trench coat wearing older
            men approach them from a nearby car. Posing as a cop, one of the
            strangers leads Dave into the vehicle and whisks the lad away.
            Dave’s experience with the men is not pretty. For four days, the
            youth is abused by these covert pedophiles in a dark, dingy basement
            that looks like the Gimp’s kinky hideaway from <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Pulp
            Fiction</i>, before he escapes their grimy grasp.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Flash forward to adulthood. Hoodlum
            Jimmy (Sean Penn) poses as a benign grocery store owner, Sean (Kevin
            Bacon) is a cop, and Dave (Tim Robbins) is a zombified husk of a
            man, still reeling from the misdeeds endured so many years ago.
            Since Dave’s abduction, the trio has disbanded, with Jimmy and
            Sean plagued by survivor’s guilt, while Dave wanders the streets
            like something out of a George Romero film.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When Jimmy’s teenaged daughter is
            murdered, however, their lives intersect once again. In a jarring
            scene, Jimmy attends a younger daughter’s first communion at
            church, while cop-on-the-case Sean and police sidekick Whitey
            (Lawrence Fishburn) go about the grueling task of finding and
            identifying the body of the gangster’s firstborn. Outside the
            chapel’s front steps, Jimmy is alerted to his older child’s
            murder, goes understandably ballistic, and vows revenge.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The neighborhood’s emotional
            turmoil intensifies with news that basket-case Dave saw the girl
            shortly before her demise, and had blood on his hands upon returning
            home that night. His wife (Marcia Gay Harden) is understandably
            concerned at her husband’s injured palm, and not quite convinced
            of Dave’s story that a mugger’s assault caused the gash. As
            waves of fear and paranoia surge over her, Harden appears as a dazed
            deer staring into headlights.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Is Dave the killer? Will Sean crack
            the case? And how far Is Jimmy willing to go, to quench his mad-dog
            lust for revenge?</font></p>
            <p><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mystic
            River</font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2"> sounds like a routine
            police procedural, and there’s plenty of expository dialogue
            peppering the film’s leisurely pacing. Scenes of Sean and Whitey
            questioning subjects, handing out cards, and requesting, &quot;If
            you think of anything, give us a call,&quot; are as familiar as .357
            Magnums in a Dirty Harry film. What isn’t familiar here --
            especially when compared to the Joel Silver hybrid of cartoonishly
            violent cop outings -- is the restrained level of action. In fact, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Mystic
            River</i> is an entirely character-centered event, with Eastwood’s
            actors earning their keep. Unlike the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Matrix</i>
            or recent <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Star Wars</i>
            episodes, where blue screens and digital technology replace
            humanity, the only special effect in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Mystic
            River</i> is its parade of painful revelations, confrontations, and
            investigations.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sean Penn outdoes himself as Jimmy,
            sporting the graying temples and prison tattoos of a rebel con made
            older and wiser by time in the clink. Sean and Whitey can sense
            Jimmy’s wiry edginess, wary that this tiger is ready to pounce.
            &quot;The tension in his shoulders,&quot; observes Whitey as the
            anguished father leaves a Q &amp; A session, &quot;that’s from
            prison.&quot; It’s clear that these law enforcers know their
            query.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meanwhile, Tim Robbins plays Dave
            as a damaged man stumbling through life in a perpetual daze.
            Something’s been taken from him, and the battery is almost dead.
            It’s a heartbreaking performance.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Mystic
            River</i> echoes Eastwood’s previous exploration of true-life
            violence, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Unforgiven</i>, by
            tracing how death and depravity stain one’s life for generations,
            leaving seeds to take root in each branch of a tainted family tree. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Mystic
            River’</i>s finale, in which some characters find solace, some are
            marked for future doom, and others coldly justify the violations
            that have gone before, is as gripping and unsparing as movies get.
            Less kinetic than any of Eastwood’s early spaghetti westerns, the
            world of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Mystic River</i>
            would put The Man With No Name into a coma. Even so, it’s a world
            far more disturbing than the land of Leone, even without the blood,
            guts, and guns.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"></o:p>
