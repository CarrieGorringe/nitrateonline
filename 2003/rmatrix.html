            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>,
            16 May 2003</i></font><p class="MsoPlainText">
			<span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="5">Like a splinter in 
			your mind</font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText">
			<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700"><font size="2">
			It's hard to be Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne). It's hard to be 
			anyone in the Matrix, since everyone is enslaved whether they know 
			it or not, but it's extra hard for someone with a sense of history, 
			spirituality, and community to live inside a system devised to 
			stifle same. As his name implies, Morpheus is a keeper and proponent 
			of dreams. He's also devoted to the war against the machines, the 
			prophecy, and the One, a.k.a. Neo (Keanu Reeves). To these ends, 
			he's a stanch warrior and provocative thinker, as well as a black 
			man in a world where the machines' agents tend to be white men in 
			suits. </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">In <i>The Matrix Reloaded</i>, again, the world and 
			the agents are programs. They are precise and certain, where humans, 
			even as they are committed fighters and friends, are doubtful. 
			Between these communities, Morpheus' unwavering, apparently 
			fanatical faith is useful but also threatening. This is the rub he 
			embodies, this large black man in a movie about a much paler One. 
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">Indeed, the bulk of the film is dedicated to Neo's 
			athletics: bullet-timing (still the coolest effect); zooming through 
			space, fist outstretched like Superman; and some fighting 
			mad-choreographed by Yuen Wo Ping. No matter whom he faces -- Seraph 
			(Collin Chou); 100 Agent Smiths (Hugo Weaving) in the born-infamous 
			Burly Brawl, or the gnarly twin ghosts (Neil and Adrian Rayment) -- 
			Neo is faster and better (even if, on occasion, the CG is so anemic 
			that his digital face looks cartoonishly flat). Neo appears to be 
			power-kicking his way through a series of choices, as is his 
			supposed destiny. </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">The whole free will and destiny thing bedevils <i>
			Reloaded</i>, as well as its product line, now waging a long-awaited 
			onslaught on consumers. Immersed in its own legend and expectations, 
			in love with its two-years-in-rendering set pieces, and keen to 
			&quot;revolutionize&quot; moviemaking (as well as make a ton of money), <i>
			Reloaded</i> can't be so innovative a meld of genres as the first 
			version. Following the original and also Neo's search for the truth, 
			the film takes an episodic structure: Neo goes here and there, to 
			chat with the Oracle (Gloria Foster), to find the Keymaker (Randall 
			Duk Kim), to stop whatever next nefarious deed will be imagined by 
			Agent Smith. </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">The pieces are at once too mythic and too fragmented, 
			but then, as the makers keep insisting, it's only the second part of 
			a three-part opus. So, believe. As the sequel's adherents -- that 
			is, its major players and Joel Silver -- trundle from one interview 
			to another, from <i>106th &amp; Park</i> to Leno to <i>Access Hollywood</i>, 
			they're looking more and more like good Matrixian citizens, 
			promoting freedom of thought and, oh yes, purchase of tickets, 
			leather dusters, and <i>Animatrix</i> dvds. </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">Morpheus, at least, stands his ground, as unstable as 
			it must be. &quot;Everything begins with choice,&quot; he proclaims. Yet his 
			own choice to believe in the prophecy of the Oracle has led to 
			ridicule and rumors about his insanity. As his superior officers 
			chide his lack of flexibility or nuance, Morpheus starts to seem a 
			poster boy for the Matrix's big fat no-exit problem: red pill or 
			blue pill? Coke or Pepsi? Choose away. It's all the same. </font>
			</span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">Throughout <i>Reloaded</i>, Morpheus faces 
			challenges. The first come from Tank's replacement, Link (Harold 
			Perrineau, Jr.), who's unsure that his reputedly crazy captain quite 
			understands the risk of a particular order. Morpheus leans into his 
			chair and cuts loose with one of his patented low-volume assertions, 
			all stylishly meditative and convincing: Link must trust him. Cut to 
			Link, nodding, &quot;I do, sir.&quot; </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">Such zennishness makes Morpheus notorious as a 
			renegade in the (mostly computer-generated) city of Zion, where free 
			humans congregate, a last bastion against the Machines who are 
			tunneling toward them as the film begins. And the powers that be -- 
			embodied here by harrumphy Commander Lock (Harry Lennix), 
			white-haired Councilor Hamann (Anthony Zerbe), and Councilor West 
			(Cornell West, celebrity academic, in a role written for him by the 
			excessively well-read Wachowskis) -- make use of Morpheus to stir 
			Zion's rowdy, faceless crowd. Hamann urges him to deliver a dose of 
			what Morpheus terms &quot;truth.&quot; </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">In his oratory, however, this truth turns oddly 
			mundane: &quot;A century of war, and we are still here! Let's shake this 
			cave!&quot; And with this declaration of resistance, the mostly of-color 
			Zionites dance while Neo and Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss) steal away. 
			The film cuts between these parallel, slowed-down <b><i>carpe diem</i></b> 
			scenes, the same urgent drum-track under both: bodies writhe and 
			leap on the party floor as the sweaty white-ish couple (Keanu being 
			in perpetual racial flux) engages in earnest, neck-craning sex.
			</font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">The chosen couple's once faint resemblance to one 
			another has become more acute this time, as they mirror one another 
			in profile, sharp black outfits, and martial arts flippiness. As 
			well, their love takes on other expressions, including sacrifice and 
			deep penetration (including matrixy green effects). Neo's messianic 
			mission includes Trinity as audience to his convincing Persephone, a 
			busty (and apparently lonely) program played by Monica Bellucci, 
			that his tongue down her throat is as meaningful as when it's down 
			Trinity's (Neo fakes it for the greater good). They also must listen 
			politely to the hyper-rationalizing of Persephone's mate, the 
			perniciously French Merovingian (Lambert Wilson). &quot;Zee way of all 
			zeengs is causality,&quot; insists this program, perhaps as a way to 
			justify his sexual cheating. &quot;Choice is an illusion,&quot; he says, 
			&quot;Created by zose weez power for zose weezout.&quot; </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">Zee Merovingian makes a good point. And it's worth 
			remembering, as he sits at his fabulously appointed banquet table, 
			that he's part and parcel of the Matrix (&quot;weeth power&quot;), vending its 
			stuff and philosophy for eager consumers of poetic simulacra, 
			ideological significance, and multifaceted ass-kicking. Choice is an 
			illusion for most, which doesn't make it less promising or 
			necessary. <i>Reloaded</i> depends on it, delivering serials 
			treatises and stunts (including the delirious action centerpiece, a 
			fourteen-minute freeway kick-and-smash). With all this visual fun, 
			how can ideological angst matter? </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">&quot;The One was never meant to end anything,&quot; observes 
			an apparent authority. This seems true (the One was meant to 
			generate a mini-industry), but at the same time, it seems willful, a 
			means to challenge the prophecy and the choice, the cause and the 
			effect. Neo's (probably only pseudo-meaningful) tongue passes for 
			truth, as does Morpheus' grave declaration of the choice he's made, 
			so long ago: &quot;It is our fate to be here. It is our destiny.&quot; The 
			question is, who is &quot;we&quot;?&nbsp; </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">The most mesmerizing wild card in Morpheus' array of 
			choices and beliefs is his ex, the formidable Captain Niobe (Jada 
			Pinkett Smith). Fierce, tenacious, and amazing to see, Niobe changes 
			everything. But she has too little to do (see especially her 
			silliest line, to Morpheus, &quot;Go kick his ass!&quot;). So audacious and so 
			stunning, Niobe just needs more time. She gets it in the tie-in 
			game, <i>Enter the Matrix</i>, where she's the featured character 
			(though Jada reports that her stepson Trey doesn't like to play 
			&quot;her,&quot; preferring instead the Ghosts as his surrogate self/selves; a 
			wise ten-year-old choice). </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">Niobe does fill up her time, in a way that suggests 
			her relationship with Morpheus will, as they say, evolve. But her 
			role only underlines that time in <i>Reloaded</i> needs rethinking. 
			It's endless and ahistorical, but it's also attached, to bodies and 
			traumas. In references to Greek and Christian mythologies, Western 
			and Eastern philosophies, art and comic books from everywhere, the
			<i>Matrix</i>es make clear that the of-color bodies everywhere in 
			sight are meaningful and, in whatever sense you might imagine, true. 
			It's not that the stories in and of the Matrix are too complicated, 
			it's that they don't quite measure their complications against the 
			particular bodies represented. And this is exactly why it's hard to 
			be Morpheus.</font></span><hr size="1">
