            don't want to be crossing Lara Croft (Angelina Jolie). Not only does
            she maintain an advanced arsenal in her Buckinghamshire mansion,
            train rigorously in martial arts, leap from tall buildings, shoot
            with deadly aim, and look like a Bond girl in a bikini, she also has
            no problem punching out sharks. <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            particular moment in the clumsily titled <i>Lara Croft Tomb Raider:
            The Cradle of Life</i> is giddy and preposterous, and as such, one
            of the film's most delightful. The entire digitized stunt takes only
            a few seconds: trapped deep underwater in Luna's Tomb, where she's
            been raiding an orb of some significance, Lara escapes collapsing
            columns and brutal assault by Chinese bandits, only to realize that
            she needs speedy transport to the surface (as the bandits have
            destroyed her vehicle). Floating in her silver wetsuit, her face
            contorted like a scary mermaid's, Lady Croft entices a shark with a
            whiff of her own blood, cold cocks it, and then, as it whooshes away
            in a huff, she hitches a ride on its fin. Girl power, yeah!<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jan
            de Bont's sequel to Simon West's famously incoherent original (2001)
            includes many such demonstrations of Lara's resourcefulness, but
            this is the zaniest and, no small thing, the speediest. For the most
            part, the movie belabors its heroine's prowess, under Alan
            Silvestri's unimaginative technobeat. It stutters into stop-motiony
            slo-mo for major exploits (crashing through neon signs, two-fisted
            shooting, sexual liaising) and prolongs other scenes showing stunt
            people in full-on action mode, as when Lara and her partner leap
            from a high-rise with Rocky-the-Squirrelish webby-wings, floating
            among shiny office buildings and billboards until they find their
            appointed landing spot. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">These
            computer-enhanced physical feats -- rather painfully uneven in
            execution and representation -- are here made secondary to Lara's
            personal evolution. No longer hung up on reuniting with her father
            or even finding a worthy mate, Lara this time is mostly mad (this
            more or less corresponds with Jolie’s current,
            all-honesty-all-the-time self-promotional tour, chatting with
            Barbara Walters, Leno, or the women of <i>The View</i>, making clear
            that her adopted son Maddox has changed her perspective, that her
            thirteen tattoos are variously meaningful, that she's come to terms
            with herself: &quot;I think we're on this planet to learn about
            ourselves and each other&quot;). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Lara,
            with more firepower at her disposal, takes a more righteously
            belligerent approach to her self-healing. And so, her practice
            fighting session with trainer Hillary (Christopher Barrie) takes the
            form of a peculiarly brutalizing conversation: they whomp away with
            sticks in between questions and answers, frowning like they really
            don't like each other. Quite different from her balletic bungee
            routine in the first film, the session is stunning in its own right,
            with focus on her irate face revealing Lara's resolve, fury, and
            urgency. She's not playing. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            her business this time out is considerably less interesting than she
            is. Former Nobel Prize winner and &quot;modern day Dr. Mengele&quot;
            Jonathan Reiss (Ciarán Hinds) designs and sells biological weapons.
            His present project involves locating that orb Lara briefly held, as
            it is a map to Pandora's Box, a literal container of
            population-decimating plague. The Chinese bandits (called Shay-Ling)
            who stole the orb from Lara at film's beginning, are now in the
            process of delivering it to Reiss. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            order to locate the Shay-Ling, Lara cuts a deal with a former lover,
            Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler), now incarcerated in Kazakhstan,
            where he performs daily calisthenics off his cage ceiling. Described
            as a former officer in the Royal Navy turned mercenary and traitor
            to the Empire, Terry is proud of his lack of scruples, disparaging
            Lara's notorious softness in this area. Their &quot;relationship
            issues&quot; color the adventure slightly, primarily as metaphor:
            his treacheries cast Lara, rather weirdly, as equated to
            &quot;England,&quot; as the abandoned object; and Lady Croft's
            stubborn and often violent autonomy (enabled, of course, by her
            wealth, station, and loyal servants) makes her a lively feminist. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still,
            she needs Terry's expertise on this point, and so they take off for
            China and Hong Kong, and elsewheres &quot;East.&quot; Here, they
            predictably find trouble of the exotic variety -- shoot-outs amid
            neon-signed rooftops and terra cotta warriors, swiftly edited
            martial arts face-offs, and strangely sparse urban populations.
            Their perfunctory efforts to reconcile don't so much add drama or
            depth as they make you think of all the betrayals Jolie's been
            talking around in interviews. Lara's means of coping -- kicking,
            glaring, handcuffing -- seems appropriate.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At
            the same time, Lara is of course dealing with other stuff like, oh,
            plague. On its surface, <i>Cradle of Life</i>'s explicit anxiety
            about a biological weapon of mass destruction sounds timely. But the
            specific practical and ethical issues remain undiscovered; the plot
            is <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark</i> revisited, complete with ancient
            legend (the plague wiped out Alexander the Great's army, after which
            he hid it and the map), light peeping out of the box, and all
            variety of creatures and trials en route to its current location, in
            &quot;Africa,&quot; namely, Kenya.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And
            so, once again, white folks head to the &quot;dark continent&quot;
            to confront their deepest fears and find their untapped strengths
            (The story is so old and yet, so new: witness G.W. Bush's use of
            &quot;Africa&quot; as one of his sixteen scary words.) The village
            elders predictably warn Lara not to seek out the box, a secret best
            left unfound. She has an answer, something to do with saving the
            world. Besides, the admonition runs more or less counter to her
            raider's credo that &quot;Everything lost is meant to be
            found!&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            other words, even Lara Croft might learn a thing or two from the
            wise Masai. And this means that the world-traveling, linguistically
            diversified, superrich gorgeously outfitted Lady embodies the
            planet's best future, open to someone else's thinking, as long as
            it's generally compatible with hers. The fact that the bad guys tag
            along for the showdown (on a set that a friend of mine likened to
            the excessively corny <i>Harry Potter</i> forest) only makes her
            look more like the deferential, culturally sensitive savior. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Indeed,
            Lara's empathy and insight are conveyed by her reunion with college
            classmate Kosa (Djimon Hounsou). They have certainly followed
            different career paths: while she's been gallivanting about the
            planet in search of tombs to raid, he's gone back home, where he
            works to &quot;improve the life of the Masai&quot; (this according
            to Hounsou in the press kit). But they maintain mutual respect for
            one another. When she drops into his jeep by parachute, Kosa asks,
            so playfully, &quot;Why can't you do anything the easy way?&quot;
            (Ah yes, why indeed?) Her pert answer: &quot;Because I wouldn't want
            to disappoint you.&quot; Living up to expectations and her own
            record, Lara, at least, appears to know who she is. Now, if only her
            movies did her justice. <o:p>
