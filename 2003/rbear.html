            Lybarger</a>, 31 October 2003</i></font>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>When <i>Sinbad
            </i>flopped this summer, many blamed its poor showing on a
            diminishing market for hand drawn animation</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is nonsense.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The reason <i>Sinbad</i>
            flopped is because it had a dull, underdeveloped story and a
            disappointingly flat vocal turn from Brad Pitt as the title
            character.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Similarly, the
            Disney studio's new offering <i>Brother Bear</i> looks great no
            matter what medium was used to create it. But the story conveyed by
            these lovely images lacks the creativity and wit of a typical Pixar
            flick or even Disney's much livelier <i>Lilo and Stitch</i>.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Although there
            are five writers credited with the script for <i>Brother Bear</i>,
            it seems more as if they copied and pasted material from other
            sources but forgot what made the originals work.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">True, it's
            adequate fare for kids. The toilet jokes are mercifully absent, and
            the tykes won't learn anything from this film that you'll regret
            having to explain later.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still, the same
            could be said for <i>Finding Nemo</i>, and it's far more
            entertaining.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">You can almost
            hear the pitch meetings as the story progresses (&quot;It's <i>Pocahontas</i>
            meets <i>Treasure Planet</i>.&quot;). Set in the age long before
            Europeans settled in North America, the new film centers on a
            callow, self-absorbed lad named Kenai (voice by Joaquin Phoenix).
            The youngster is about get his own totem so that he can officially
            be declared a man in the tribe. Kenai's age might indicate he's an
            adult, but his mind and heart are far more immature.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Before you can
            say <i>The Emperor's New Groove</i>, Kenai wrongly kills a bear he
            blames for his brother's death, and the spirits of the tribe's
            ancestors turn him into a bear as punishment. Unlike that film, the
            humor here simply doesn't work.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Casting Rick
            Moranis and Dave Thomas to do voices for moose versions of their Bob
            and Doug McKenzie characters sounds cute, but somehow these guys
            just aren't funny when beer isn't involved (hops are mentioned
            tangentially, but that's it). It also doesn't help that Kenai is so
            self-absorbed that viewers get tired of waiting for him to get his
            act together. At least David Spade's arrogant character in <i>Groove</i>
            spouted enough giggle-inducing wisecracks to make him tolerable.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent:0in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">About
            the only character with any personality Kenai encounters during his
            punishment is a frisky little bear cub named Koda (voice by Jeremy
            Suarez). The lad has been separated from his folks and earnestly
            tries to worm his way into Kenai's heart. The pairing reminded me of
            Shrek and his pal the talking Donkey, only I don't recall looking at
            my watch during that film.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent:0in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Directors<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Aaron Blaise (a former animator) and Robert Walker (a former
            layout supervisor) do create a gorgeous reworking of the Pacific
            Northwest. The colors are tastefully muted, and the film is a lot
            more enjoyable if you can tune out the sound.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent:0in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's
            hard to tell which is more cloying: the dialogue (&quot;I always
            wanted to have a brother.&quot;) or Phil Collins' anemic score. Once
            upon a time he was once a contributor to Genesis during their
            interesting periods, and his first solo album was eerily
            enthralling. No such luck here.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent:0in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Despite
            some &quot;ethnic&quot;-sounding percussion, the songs here sound
            even blander than the ones he wrote and performed for <i>Tarzan</i>.
            It doesn't help that most of these tunes run during long, plotless
            sequences where the images do little more than look pretty. At 85
            minutes, <i>Brother Bear</i> is heavily padded. Any score that
            manages to make the Blind Boys of Alabama and Tina Turner seem
            boring deserves a special room in Hell.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If the folks at
            Disney had spent more time trying to get the script right instead of
            shoehorning that syrupy music, illl-informed pundits wouldn't be
            decrying the end of hand-drawn animation. The crew at Pixar devote
            as much if not more energy into their stories as they do their rich
            visuals, and it shows. And they are the only studio who should be
            allowed to run phony blooper reels at the end of their films.
            There's one in <i>Brother Bear</i>, and it's as tedious as the rest
            of the movie.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's not the
            technique that's the problem. It's the minds behind it.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"> <o:p>
