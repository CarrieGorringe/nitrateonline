            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>If this month’s two biggest
            comedy releases are any indicator of the national mood regarding
            American race relations, then it’s clear that we haven’t
            progressed very far since the days of Martin Luther King and Malcolm
            X. As with the offensively bad Steve Martin-Queen Latifah
            catastrophe <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Bringing Down the
            House</i>, Chris Rock’s black man-as-presidential candidate <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Head of State</i> finds much about white folks to laugh at, turning a
            ninety-five-minute film into an overlong routine about black people
            showing their pale compatriots a thing or two about being hip(-hop).
            Like a stand-up comedy routine at the Apollo, both films are deeply
            rooted in the schism between cool blacks and square whites,
            attempting some sort of light-hearted critique about racial
            prejudice but, in practice, only confirming long-held stereotypes
            about both groups. That we haven’t yet moved past scenes of
            silver-haired white goofs dancing and singing along to Nelly’s
            &quot;Hot in Herre&quot; is either a testament to our unwillingness
            to let go of long-held derogatory generalizations about one another,
            or proof that Hollywood can’t confront such issues except through
            familiar and outdated comedic formulas. Or both.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Rock, on his comedy CDs, HBO show,
            and guest appearances on Bill Maher’s now-defunct <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Politically
            Incorrect</i>, has proven a willingness to attack racial and social
            issues with both hilarity and incisive candor. What’s so
            dispiriting about <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Head of
            State</i>, however, is that the comedian seems to think that
            expanding his critiques to feature-length form requires a
            cookie-cutter white southern governor as the enemy and lots of
            &quot;bling bling&quot; style as a positive counterpoint. The film
            begins with what seems like an unending stream of one-liners left
            over from one of the stand-up’s previous routines, as Rock’s
            alderman Mays Gilliam attempts to fight for the common man, but
            winds up losing everything – his job, his car, and his
            opportunistic fiancé (a perfectly cast Robin Givens). When things
            couldn’t get bleaker, the Democratic powers-that-be arrive to
            convince Mays to run for president; their original candidate has
            just died in a plane crash and the party’s leader (James Rebhorn)
            wants to put up a minority candidate that will surely lose but help
            make the party look more racially open-minded, thus indirectly
            bolstering his own planned 2008 campaign. Suddenly, Mays is
            traversing the country preaching to his constituency, but the
            campaign doesn’t take off until the streetwise alderman begins
            speaking from the heart – by which I mean dressing in Adidas
            jumpsuits, making rap video campaign commercials, and labeling his
            campaign &quot;MG2K4&quot; (that’s &quot;Mays Gilliam 2004,&quot;
            for those not down with hip-hop acronyms).<o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Rock directed and co-wrote <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Head of State</i>, and his acidic barbs occasionally hit their mark with
            humorous results, such as when, upon trying to figure out why
            Democrats would want him as a candidate, Mays immediately imagines
            himself getting assassinated. Rock packs his film full of
            non-sequiturs and running audio jokes – an omnipresent Jay-Z track
            plays whenever he’s in transit, even if that means while riding
            his bike; a background song lyrically emphasizes everything being
            said during a scene – and the abundance of comical asides does
            help distract from the simple-minded premise they’ve been grafted
            on to. Bernie Mac pops up now and again as Mays’ even more
            unconventional bail bondsman brother Mitch, and has a few inspired
            zingers of his own for a Larry King-ish talk show host who wants to
            know Mitch’s position on NATO (Mitch passes off his ignorance by
            claiming that he thought they were talking about his friend Nato
            Jenkins).</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But for every funny gag – of
            which there are a fair share – there are moronic elements such as
            Mays’ election-day opposition, a redneck vice president named
            Brian Lewis (Nick Searcy) who likes to proclaim &quot;God Bless
            America, and no place else!&quot; and is repeatedly referred to as a
            war hero and Sharon Stone’s cousin. Given the fact that, for the
            past decade, the American political arena (at least when it comes to
            presidential hopefuls) has moved closer and closer to the middle,
            and that a similar Southern-born president was embraced by the black
            community for much of the 1990s, this characterization of whites as
            nefarious racist elitists is worthy of nothing but groans. In <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Head
            of State</i>, however, if you’re not a bad whitey, you’re a
            good-hearted ridiculous whitey, such as Mays’ political advisor
            Martin Geller (Dylan Baker, clearly picking up a paycheck), who
            comes around to chanting &quot;The roof, the roof, the roof is on
            fire&quot; in a display of his newfound coolness. Mr. Rock, you’re
            better than this.</font></p>
