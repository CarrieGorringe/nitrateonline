            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In the ineffable <i>Honey</i>,
            Jessica Alba plays the title character, who works as a barkeep in
            dance club by night, a music store by day, teaches hip-hop dance
            classes at the local youth center, finds time to hang with her girl
            pal Gina (Joy Bryant, previously seen hanging out with Derek Luke in
            <i>Antwone Fisher</i>), and aspires to become a dancer in music
            videos. She not only gets discovered, by a smug, wouldbe-down video
            director (David Moscow) -- he makes her choreographer! That's right
            -- Honey has a shot at becoming the next Paula Abdul!</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Then, crisis: the youth center run
            by her mother (the usually wonderful Lonette McKee, who scowls a lot
            in this film) is on the verge of collapse, so Honey sets her sight
            on buying a storefront that she can turn into a dance studio
            (Honey's mom has been insisting to her daughter that &quot;hip-hop
            can't take you to places ballet can&quot;, although Honey, while
            rehearsing in one scene, knows what a &quot;plie&quot; is), so that
            she can provide hope and opportunity to the kids in and around the
            projects who have become her friends, and....</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jessica Alba looks a little like
            Jennifer Beals in <i>Flashdance</i>, but she grins and is as
            indefatigably upbeat as a hip-hop Sonia Henie. She always says
            &quot;thank you&quot;, even asks someone at one point if she
            remembered to tell them &quot;thank you&quot;. She gets the love of
            a good-hearted, basketball-playing young man (Mekhi Phifer) who
            works as a barber, and she doesn't sell herself short.
            (&quot;Dancing isn't what I do. It's what I am.&quot;) The movie
            turns out to be a squeaky-clean entertainment for young audiences
            who are into the hooks, plundering countless old movie clichés and
            recycling them with a new sheen, at a time when rap and gangsta
            artists are openly threatening each other with murder in no
            uncertain terms. (And it's positioned to be a breakout underdog film
            hit during the holiday season, like last year's <i>Drumline</i>.)
            It's hard to tell what parts of <i>Honey</i> are supposed to be
            taken as humorous, however. I have no idea if people are able to as
            effortlessly bust a move in musical unison in real life as the
            people do in this film -- I figure part if it, in the film, is for
            expediency's sake -- but Honey blowing off someone who writes her
            nine-thousand dollar cheques when she's in the middle of organizing
            and presenting a dance benefit goes beyond credibility. And Honey's
            bacon ends up being saved by a miraculous intervention made by Missy
            Elliott, played in the film by Missy Elliott (who does provide the
            few genuinely funny moments the film's got in its corner, even if
            she is threatening her limousine chauffeur during one of them).<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The talented Mekhi Phifer looks
            resigned in many of his scenes, but he tries, and two of the young
            kids who Honey befriends are played, rather well, by Lil' Romeo (who
            picks up a move that he uses at the dance benefit while spending
            time in Juvey!) and the cherubim-faced Zachary Isaiah Williams. I
            must say that Alba even manages to look appealing even when she
            looks, and sometimes moves, like Britney Spears does in that <i>Me
            Against the Music</i> video where she chases an unmistakably
            terrified Madonna all over the place (and if you had someone who
            looked like THAT chasing after you, you'd be scared, too). And some
            of the recording artists, in the music videos Honey helps stage, who
            are named &quot;Tweet&quot; and &quot;Ginuwine&quot; -- that's their
            real names!&nbsp; Missy Elliott does invoke the shade of M.C. Hammer
            at one point, so I hope some of these guys are banking some of what
            they're making, right now.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"></o:p>
