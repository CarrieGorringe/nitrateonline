            acts as if its characters deserve the horrible ends they meet -- the
            unspoken ode of all those slasher movies back in the 1980s -- and,
            worse, it doesn't seem to care. Which, of course, begs the question
            as to why we should.</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A group of five college-aged kids
            go on a vacation break to a cabin located in a wooded, lakeside area
            (actually, the wooded, lakeside North Carolina countryside), where
            they conspire to doing nothing more than drink, roast marshmallows,
            and engage in some acts of rutting. Within forty-eight hours after
            their arrival, though, they have been exposed to what the movie will
            only refer to as a &quot;flesh-eating disease&quot;, but which looks
            like one of the viruses from Richard Preston's book <i>The Hot Zone</i>
            which is capable of liquefying the human body with record speed.
            Finding themselves in the middle of a pandemic, the kids quickly
            turn against each other before finally being annihilated altogether.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The filmmakers (who made this film
            at about the same time as Danny Boyle's similar <i>28 Days Later</i>)
            set out to make first and foremost a good, scary movie, and they
            succeed in creating ordinary settings and situations which fill up
            with a steady sense of unease, laced with doses of black humor --
            strangely emptied-out landscapes, a little girl who is continually
            addressed as &quot;Dennis&quot; and who will bite anybody foolhardy
            enough to get within striking distance of her. What the filmmakers
            fail to do is give us anything new. There are plenty of lifts from
            other movies (most noticeably, the ending of <i>Night of the Living
            Dead</i>, only, in Romero's movie, it meant something and wasn't
            used, as it is here, as a toss-off), but the blanket nihilism just
            seems like a callous pose as well as an excuse against coming up
            with anything creative or inspired -- some of the characters in the
            movie act strangely as if they'd just contracted the highly
            contagious disease, addling their senses, but it turns out they
            haven't (which then makes us wonder from what viewpoint we're
            supposed to be seeing the action from). Also, some of the things
            that the film asks us to giggle or chortle over are the kinds of
            things only a cretin would laugh at (which then makes us feel as if
            the film's playing-down to us as if we were slobs)</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The acting is generally good,
            especially considering that large chunks of the dialogue are made up
            of conjugations of the f-word, and there are some amusing moments
            from Giuseppe Andrews as a police deputy who, like somebody sneaking
            a joint in class, says that he knows where all the best party action
            is occurring at in the vicinity. As for the movie, though, what
            starts out as engaging ends up as flip, glib, and cynical -- scary,
            but it ends up leaving you down.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"></o:p>
