            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by Nicholas Schager,
            21 November 2003</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>There are so many things wrong
            – and repulsive – about Universal’s new adaptation of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Cat in the Hat</i> that it’s hard to know where to begin.
            Nonetheless, a good place to start is by saying that the film’s
            only notable triumph is its success in becoming the preeminent
            example of the vulgarization of children’s entertainment. Crass
            and offensive, the film is intent on being cute and clever, witty
            and daring, sweet and bawdy through a fusion of immature gags for
            the little ones in the audience and racy asides for the grown-up
            chaperones forced to accompany them. The fact that a children’s
            literary classic is being desecrated by stale urine jokes and
            rampant sexual overtones, it seems, makes no difference to the
            filmmakers so long as the energy is high, the pace is quick, and the
            action is bustling.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            Cat in the Hat</font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">, unlike any
            other children’s film in recent memory, seems determined to
            sexualize the supposedly kid-friendly proceedings. If the Cat
            isn’t raising his hat suggestively in response to a photo of the
            kids’ alluring mom (Kelly Preston), he’s picking up a used
            garden tool and, with a naughty smile to the audience, calling it a
            “dirty hoe.” References to genitalia (specifically, the Cat
            being spayed or neutered), snot, vomit, and gas abound, but what’s
            shocking aren’t necessarily the individual moments, but their
            cumulative effect. By the time evil villain Alec Baldwin is seen
            digging for lint in his <span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">prosthetically</span>
            enhanced spare tire’s belly button – and the Cat is seen dancing
            with socialite (and budding amateur porn star) Paris Hilton – the
            entire film has become infected with the stench of cheap vulgarity.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Less surprising is the film’s
            steadfast belief that kids’ attention spans are about as long as
            Danny DeVito is tall. The screenplay (by Alec Berg, David Mandel and
            Jeff Schaffer) piles rapid-fire sight gags on top of garish musical
            numbers on top of obnoxious parodies to produce an experience
            that’s both visually overloaded and substantively hollow. Director
            Bo Welch, a longtime production assistant, subscribes to the idea
            that a static frame is a worthless frame, and his camera zips this
            way and that in order to create a sense of perpetual motion,
            concocting lots of oblique angles and rapid-fire pans and zooms
            around the film’s candy-colored sets. The result is a film that
            seems to be in an enormous hurry to get somewhere, although its
            final destination is so predictably false and saccharine that one
            wonders at the end what all the commotion was about in the first
            place.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mike Myers, hidden under a layer of
            make-up similar to Jim Carrey’s in 2001’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">How
            The Grinch Stole Christmas</i>, plays the titular feline, a magical
            creature who appears on a rainy afternoon to spice up the lives of
            two miserable kids stuck at home with their babysitter. Conrad
            (Spencer Breslin) is a troublemaker about to be sent away to
            military school by his mom at the urging of her dastardly boyfriend
            Lawrence (Baldwin), and Sally (a painfully precocious Dakota
            Fanning) is an uptight know-it-all without a fun bone in her body.
            Ordered to keep the house neat for the impending cocktail party Mom
            must throw for her boss (an unbearable Sean Hayes), the kids sit
            around the house bored out of their minds until the cat appears.
            Myriad jokes ensue. The house gets dirty and the kids freak out.
            Pesky imps named Thing #1 and Thing #2 appear, as does an anxious
            goldfish. The collision of fantasy and reality threaten to destroy
            the house. More jokes ensue.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">One hates to provide such a facile
            synopsis, but there’s no getting around the fact that, for all the
            tumult, very little actually occurs in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Cat in the Hat</i>. In place of actual plot development, the film
            quickly devolves into a showcase for Mike Myers’ endless mugging,
            with the actor turning the beloved cat into a grotesque amalgam of
            Austin Powers and some of his old <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Saturday Night Live</i> characters (bathtub-confined Simon, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Coffee
            Talk</i>’s Linda Richman, hypoglycemic toddler Phillip). Myers has
            a grating penchant for ending every scene by guffawing to the camera
            and then wildly flailing his arms and legs while running off-screen,
            only to re-appear in the next frame dressed like Carmen Miranda or
            an infomercial host. His improvisatory performance is so
            persistently forced and abrasive that one immediately loses the
            ability to buy into the film’s premise in the first place. Why,
            one can’t help but wonder, does that Cat sound so much like Mike
            Myers juiced on amphetamines?</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still, Myers’ over-the-top antics
            aren’t nearly as distasteful as the film’s offensive and
            inappropriate ribald humor, which seems right at home alongside the
            film’s numerous subtle (and not-so-subtle) corporate
            advertisements. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Cat in the
            Hat</i> isn’t so much a movie as an extremely long commercial for
            Universal’s Dr. Seuss-inspired products and tie-ins. When Myers’
            isn’t shamelessly hawking Universal Studios during the film – he
            somehow fails to understand that shilling a studio’s ancillary
            corporate products with a self-conscious wink doesn’t make the
            shilling any more palatable – he’s embodying a character
            that’s been transformed into a mechanism for the studio to sell
            stuffed dolls and other such children’s merchandise for the
            holiday season. In <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Cat in
            the Hat</i>’s rampaging cacophony, one can hear a cash register
            chiming over and over again.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"></o:p>
