            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Statement</i> is the kind of inert, serious-minded Holocaust-themed
            film that makes you pine for campy Nazi-hunting adventures like the
            Laurence Olivier-Gregory Peck Hitler cloning saga <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Boys from Brazil</i>. This earnest historical suspense yarn from
            director Norman Jewison (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Fiddler
            on the Roof</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Hurricane</i>)
            concerns a former Vichy government murderer sought by both a dogged
            French judge and the ex-Vichy bigwigs who want their secret
            Nazi-sympathizing pasts concealed. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Statement</i> (based on the novel by Brian Moore) wants to be both a
            thriller and a revelatory historical exposé, but on both counts it
            falls flat. Stern and stolid, Jewison’s film can’t muster an
            ounce of edge-of-your-seat tension, and, even worse, its
            condemnation of the Vichy government amounts to little more than an
            inadequate slap on the wrist.</b><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Pierre Brossard (Michael Caine)
            killed seven Jews in 1944 as a willing member of the Vichy
            government’s military police. Although pardoned for his crimes
            years later, Brossard is forced back into hiding by a pesky new
            Crimes Against Humanity law that has made him both fresh bait for
            prosecutors interested in nabbing France’s remaining Vichy-era
            criminals, and a dangerous nuisance to those in government who would
            prefer Brossard not spill his guts about the current
            administration’s ties to the Vichy regime. As portrayed by Caine,
            Brossard is a devout religious man hiding, like a simpering coward,
            in abbeys across the country for fear that his capture will surely
            mean spending his final days locked behind bars. Yet when confronted
            with life-and-death decisions, the trembling, agitated Brossard
            undergoes a startling transformation – his eyes turn cold, his
            lips contort into a snarl, and his movements become swift and
            deadly. He’s like a wounded dog who, when backed into a corner,
            bares some mighty impressive fangs.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Judge Annemarie Livi (Tilda
            Swinton) and her military sidekick Colonel Roux (Jeremy Northam) are
            hot on Brossard’s trail, suspecting the fugitive is being
            sheltered by both the Catholic Church and the government.
            Unfortunately, their tenacious, Veronica Guerin-like investigation
            – characterized by demanding immediate answers with rude bluntness
            – soon becomes a wearisome expository device constructed to give
            us some filler about Brossard’s powerful friends. As they race to
            find Brossard, Swinton and Northam exchange limp banter with erudite
            snappiness in English and without a French accent (thus giving the
            film a peculiarly British feel), and they eventually deduce the
            conspiracy that’s keeping Brossard temporarily safe with
            unbelievable ease. Charlotte Rampling fares better as Brossard’s
            scorned wife, instilling the film with some passion and vitriol
            during a scene in which she is reunited with her husband-on-the-run.
            Yet as befitting a film with jumbled priorities, Rampling disappears
            almost as soon as she appears, thus turning a potentially
            fascinating detour into just another distracting narrative
            affectation.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meanwhile, a covert organization
            purporting to be friends and family members of Brossard’s Jewish
            victims have hired assassins to silence the former Vichy lackey.
            Jewison, however, reveals this group’s true colors fairly early on
            by showing us their ringleader perched, with regal Gallic
            narcissism, at an imposing desk with the French flag hanging in the
            background. Rather than saying something interesting about the ways
            in which ordinary citizens helped conspire with the Vichy government
            to aid and abet Jewish persecution, the film merely offers us an old
            white guy (in this case John Neville) as the monstrous symbol of
            French collaboration. The result is a shameful cop-out in which the
            Vichy government – presented as a few evil, power hungry rich men
            – is reduced into an easily quantifiable, and thus easily
            rectified, mistake that can be effortlessly digested by mass
            audiences. Ironically, such simplification is what ultimately makes <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Statement</i> difficult to stomach.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"></o:p>
