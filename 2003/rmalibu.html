			<a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 25 April 2003</i></font><p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>By the end of
			<i>Malibu's Most Wanted</i>, the comedian Jamie Kennedy has just 
			about managed to drive you up the wall with his whiny, one-note 
			performance as B-Rad, who has come down with what one character 
			calls the worst case of &quot;gangstaphreni'&quot; (pronounced with the &quot;a&quot; 
			dropped off the end) ever seen. B-Rad, who is otherwise as white as 
			Wonder bread, has gone to such lengths to look, act, and talk like a 
			gangsta that his father arranges for a mock-kidnapping that will 
			drop him straight into South Central L.A. in an effort to have him 
			&quot;scared white&quot; once and for all.</b></font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">A satire on 
			privileged white kids who want to be like black kids from Compton is 
			long overdue, but this comedy turns out to be pretty wan -- no 
			sooner do the jokes step through the doorway onto the screen than 
			they fall over and play dead. Taye Diggs and Anthony Anderson are 
			not bad as a pair of actors who are hired by B-Rad's father (Ryan 
			O'Neal, hanging in there) to stage the fake kidnapping, and who keep 
			worrying over whether they're getting all the details right (&quot;Am I 
			'indicating'?&quot;) so that they're convincing enough as kidnappers with 
			a bad attitude. But the paucity of roles for black actors, and the 
			ones they often find themselves stuck in, was better satirized by 
			Robert Townsend in <i>Hollywood Shuffle</i>, back in 1987, and in 
			less screen time. Jamie Kennedy's way of acting and speaking---&quot;Why 
			yor doin' dis tu a broh-der?&quot;, and &quot;Ah'm jus' a rappah, streit-up!&quot;---in 
			fact recall the regrettable ways in which African-American 
			performers were obliged to play stereotyped behavior in Hollywood 
			films of the 1930s and '40s. And, in its way, this movie is 
			reinforcing a whole new set of stereotypes for African-Americans: 
			guys who shoot off guns when they're not chugging on malt liquor, 
			and women who dress, primp, and strut in ways that shamelessly show 
			off their booty, and who are ready to get-down with the first guy 
			who turns them on.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">If not for this 
			last bit, the movie would otherwise be harmless. About the cleverest 
			it gets is when it has Snoop Dogg -- who has gone from rap musician 
			to spokesman for &quot;Girls Gone Wild&quot; videos and object of Bill 
			O'Reilly's wrath -- providing the voice for a talking rat in one 
			scene: after telling B-Rad that he's not Stuart Little, he perks his 
			spirits up by encouraging him to be who he's supposed to be (and not 
			be a pretender). The movie is essentially about being allowed to be 
			who you are, but we never see beyond the facade of Kennedy's 
			character, which was developed originally for his WB comedy program. 
			It still hasn't moved beyond the sketch phase -- the character's 
			more of an idea than a character. (B-Rad's mom is played in the 
			movie by Bo Derek, and this is the first time since I saw <i>The 
			Jazz Singer</i> in 1980 -- when Laurence Olivier played Neil 
			Diamond's father -- in which I wondered how two people who looked 
			like Ryan O'Neal and Bo Derek could've produced someone who looked 
			like Jamie Kennedy.) The movie doesn't give us any idea of what's 
			&quot;genuine&quot; about B-Rad or why he's adopted this pose. He's emptier -- 
			and, after a while, shriller -- than the frozen &quot;mod&quot; poseurs of the 
			'60s (who, at least, arguably dressed better), so when the movie 
			gets all well-intentioned at the end, it seems like the biggest 
			put-on of all. There's no &quot;there&quot;, there, or any &quot;why&quot; or &quot;how&quot;, for 
			that matter. The talking rat was right.</font></td>
