            Miranda Grey (Halle Berry) is worried about her puffy-faced patient,
            Chloe (Penélope Cruz). It appears that the girl, incarcerated at
            the very cold and creepy Woodward Penitentiary for Women for killing
            her stepfather, is &quot;embellishing her rape story.&quot; During
            one of those movie-style shrink-sessions where the camera circles
            them, hunched over a table inside a cage, Chloe asserts that she's
            being raped in her cell by the devil: &quot;He tore me like paper,
            he opened me like a flower of pain, and it felt good.&quot; When
            Miranda encourages Chloe to ease up on the details and trust her,
            the patient hands her <i>Gothika</i>'s tagline: &quot;You can't
            trust someone who thinks you're crazy.&quot; <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Chloe
            erupts into paroxysms of spit and resistance, so that the guards
            come in to drag her off. Miranda, meanwhile, begins her long walk up
            from the institution's bowels, her shoes clicking on hard floors, to
            the upper floor offices. Here she meets with her supervisor, Doug
            (Charles Dutton), who stands her in front of a mirror and assures
            her that she's brilliant and rational, that she'll figure out how to
            make Chloe &quot;accept&quot; her fantasy as such. At which point,
            he kisses her, mouth open wide -- and the audience around me erupted
            into screams and titters. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Within
            seconds, it's revealed that Miranda and Doug are married, and the
            scary moment is past. But the mismatch (so very apparent to my
            fellow viewers) haunts the rest of the film, partly because the kiss
            is interrupted by Dr. Pete Graham (Robert Downey, Jr.), hovering at
            the office door like the potential illicit love interest he's
            supposed to be. That would be an interest for Miranda, though Pete
            (and Downey, for that matter) is so dodgy and odd, he might easily
            slide the other way. Doug's diffidence and Miranda's rejection of
            Pete's dinner offer are plainly setting up intrigue that, drearily,
            never pays off. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Rather
            than dig into complex human relations, <i>Gothika</i> careens down
            another road altogether, an increasingly mundane plot trajectory
            initiated when Miranda drives off a literal road on her way home
            that night. Caught in a horrendous thunderstorm, she's frightened by
            the specter of a ravaged white girl, hair wet and bedraggled, face
            bloodied, and the next thing you know, she's in a drafty cell at
            Woodward, wearing an unfashionable open-backed gown. Pete stops by
            for an update: she's killed her husband and gone crazy. And oh yes,
            she's seeing dead people. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Scripted
            by Sebastian Gutierrez and directed by Mathieu Kassovitz (who made
            the brilliant <i>La Haïne</i>), <i>Gothika</i>'s tentative
            intelligence pretty much collapses following this extended set-up.
            The ghosty girl shows up periodically, at one point throwing her
            against the cell walls for the apparent purpose of encouraging her
            to escape (the logic here is somewhat sketchy). Though Pete briefly
            notes that he should not even be assigned to the case, silly movie
            logic demands that he step up. So, even as Miranda is wondering
            whether they ever had an affair, he asks her for &quot;the last
            thing you remember,&quot; scooting up near to her and inviting her
            to be the &quot;rational&quot; scientist he knows she can be. Her
            eyes sunken, her face ashen, Miranda still looks like Halle Berry,
            following some serious makeup sessions (not to mention the broken
            wrist she suffered during filming). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">While
            Pete seems alternately beguiled and repulsed by his erstwhile crush
            (they had no affair, he says, because she was &quot;married to the
            boss,&quot; though the film invites you to distrust Pete, if only
            because he's so obviously un-smart), Miranda's new cellmates are
            less wowed. Spotting her in the cavernous common room, Chloe sits
            down to welcome her to the &quot;other side&quot;: &quot;You're one
            of us now,&quot; she smiles. When Miranda protests that she doesn't
            &quot;belong here,&quot; Chloe smiles again, reminding her of the
            implacably smug logic of the sane, as they judge the insane:
            &quot;If you're here, it must mean that you belong.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            ooky dismantling of seeming sense understandably rattles Miranda,
            whom Pete &quot;the most logical person I know&quot; (and such
            assessment might be taken with a sizable grain of salt). She meets
            with several male authority types -- her lawyer Teddy (Dorian
            Harewood, and it's good just to see him), Doug's best friend Sheriff
            Ryan (John Carroll Lynch), her supervisor at the hospital, Dr.
            Parsons (Bernard Hill) -- but none is able to set the situation
            straight or her mind at ease. In fact, the boys all tend to fall in
            a line with Pete, assuming she's crazy, resenting that she's killed
            their pal Doug. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">You
            might intuit here the beginnings of a political argument, having to
            do, perhaps, with societal gender expectations or maybe
            institutional abuses of prisoners. But the movie doesn't stretch so
            far. Instead, it offers a mildly intriguing and repeated
            restructuring of oppositions -- dream or reality, sane or insane,
            trust or distrust -- provides for an increasingly distracting lack
            of narrative cohesion. On one level, this hardly matters; it's a
            gothic thriller and something of a murder mystery, so it's not
            supposed to be linear. Still, some scene-to-scene connection would
            be good. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Though
            the ghosty girl is eventually granted a name and particular
            relationship to Miranda, as well as a righteous fury, she's resolved
            into such a cliché of a motivation (for Miranda at least) that the
            movie can't recover. Such pedestrian grounding (which pretends to be
            moralistic but is mostly hysterical) renders the paranormal activity
            -- and more importantly, <i>Gothika</i>'s challenges to distinctions
            between sane and insane -- strangely humdrum. <o:p>
