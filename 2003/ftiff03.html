<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">With the
advent of the 2003 festival, it appeared as if things had finally returned to
normal after two years of chaos. The tragedy of September 11, 2001, did more
than cause the cancellation of a day’s screenings: it threw the festival into
an emotional turmoil, as people cared more about loved ones and trying to get
home than in trying to see the latest film. 2002 drifted somewhat uneasily
through its paces as the &quot;anniversary&quot; year, marking the horrors of
before. This year, however, there was a considerable relaxing of tensions among
all participants, as the race to see every film possible returned to its usual
fever pitch.<o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">And, as
usual, the films ran the gamut, from the sublime, zen-like poignancy of Sofia
Coppola’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Lost in Translation</i> to the
utter banality of the Japanese horror film <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Grudge</i>, which tried to be <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
Ring</i>, but ended up succumbing to the dubious level of being both
unintentionally funny and tedious, all at once.</span></font><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-ansi-language:EN-US">
