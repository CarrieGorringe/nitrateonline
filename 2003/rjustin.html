            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>From Justin to Kelly</i> is an
            attempt to do a modern-day equivalent to the 1960s beach party
            movies, with their light, disposable plotlines and goofy atmosphere
            and sense of humor, only, here, with hip-hop music, the kind of
            heave-and-jerk choreography that turns dancers into robots, and cast
            members who are wearing a whole lot of nothing. I don't consider
            myself to be a prude, and my high-school class had different and
            more relaxed values than our parents did, but there were moments
            during this movie where I found myself surprised to be watching
            actors walking around wearing outfits that made them virtually
            unclad, especially since this is a movie aimed at a fairly young
            audience. When the vixenish, back-stabbing Alexa (Katherine Bailess)
            exclaims, &quot;You think Kelly has what I have?,&quot; one look at
            the bikini top that she barely has on provides the answer to that
            question really fast. And it was definitely a mistake to cast Greg
            Siff in a supporting role opposite the male lead, Justin Guarini --
            Siff's pecs and ab muscles (along with a couple of other things) are
            hanging-out in almost every one of his scenes, while Justin, for
            whatever reason, is thoroughly covered in polo shirts and T-shirts
            throughout. It reminded me of the anecdote where Groucho Marx, after
            seeing Cecil B. DeMille's <i>Samson and Delilah</i>, said something
            to the effect that the only thing that was really wrong with the
            movie was that Victor Mature had a bigger bust than Hedy Lamarr. If
            anything, <i>From Justin to Kelly</i> confirms that we are indeed
            living in the time of the Cult of the Flesh, a landscape of the
            bronzed and bulbous, a desert of self-absorption where people
            exhibit themselves without care or concern over how tacky or déclassé
            they may actually appear to be.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">However, criticizing this movie --
            and less kind-hearted souls will surely be trampling all over it
            from now until the end of the year -- is, as David Denby wrote about
            <i>Xanadu</i> back in 1980, like shooting arrows into a ghost. This
            is the type of movie where drinks spill on people in order to create
            plot turns. There's loads of dialogue to hoot over (&quot;Hey,
            Justin! You gotta get us into the Margarita Madness party!&quot;
            &quot;See ya at the bikini contest!&quot; &quot;She's one bonnet shy
            of Amish!&quot;). There are plenty of songs, but the only memorable
            one is -- my stomach be still -- a climatic rendition of the
            ulcerous Seventies song &quot;That's the Way I Like It.&quot; I have
            not seen the <i>American Idol</i> TV show and I've only seen the
            tail end of a music video Kelly Clarkson made for her new album, so
            I'm coming to Clarkson and Guarini fresh. Clarkson has screen
            presence, and she definitely can sing (although the filmmakers
            fumble her big song number near the end) -- she has the unique gift
            of being able to deliver a song powerfully without looking like
            she's trying hard, and I would be interested in seeing where she
            goes from here. Guarini does not have much of a screen presence
            (which is probably why he's constantly upstaged by Siff), sings
            passably (at least, here), and, most unfortunately, does not click
            onscreen as a romantic lead with Clarkson. <i>Grease</i> was not the
            best-made movie musical, but a lot of people were willing to forget
            that because John Travolta and Olivia Newton-John worked well
            together as a screen couple.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The folks who made <i>From Justin
            to Kelly</i> don't seem to know how to put a movie together, and the
            film has been dingily photographed -- in one scene, Justin and Kelly
            sail into a sunset that's supposed to be golden but instead looks
            greasy and smoggy. There's no explanation why Alexa spends the
            entire movie trying to sabotage things between Justin and Kelly --
            she wants Justin for herself, but Lord knows why (unless she has a
            thing for guys with really, really frizzy hair). There's a scene set
            during a whipped-cream bikini contest where we never get a good look
            at the contestants (the movie's supposed to be family entertainment,
            after all), and Siff's character falls for a really, really cute
            female police officer (Theresa San-Nicholas) because he gets
            turned-on by handcuffs. This comes off as being somewhat less
            credible than Jody McCrea falling for Marta Kristen's mermaid in <i>Beach
            Blanket Bingo</i>. But, lest we get the wrong idea, the dialogue is
            sprinkled with reminders about the negative objectification of
            women, and other sincere right-thinking intentions. See? Making
            movies is easy.</font></td>
