            feature, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Sinbad: Legend of the Seven Seas</i>, makes one wonder if anyone is
            checking the scripts for these things before they go through all the
            time and expense of putting them into production. For one thing, the
            story is a complete mess, full of inexplicable plot turns,
            contradictions and reversals which ruin everything. More on what's
            wrong with the rest of the film later.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Eris, the goddess of chaos, wants
            to get her hands on the hologramic &quot;Book of Peace&quot; so that
            she can wreak havoc and disorder; she convinces the roistering
            seafarer and thief Sinbad to steal it for her, but then turns right
            around and takes it herself, anyway (in which case, why ask Sinbad
            to do it for her in the first place?). When Sinbad agrees to go
            fetch it back for the rulers of Syracuse (a Sicilian locale, by the
            way -- the characters and story have been scrupulously
            de-Arabianized), Eris says that she will give the book to him if he
            answers one question -- a highly anti-climatic promise of whether
            he'll return it or not. (This from a deity that can sic sea monsters
            onto ships.) &quot;You're lying,&quot; she says after Sinbad gives
            his answer, and gives him the boot, just like we already thought she
            would. And the ending is even more exasperating.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This lack of focus affects the
            entire picture -- while it's not entirely the fault of Brad Pitt,
            who voices the character, this Sinbad sounds like someone you'd run
            into at a supermarket. He delivers flippant neo-quips --
            &quot;Gentlemen, it's been a pleasure robbing with you.&quot; -- in
            the manner of that ultimate Eighties quipmeister, screenwriter Shane
            Black. The script also includes vomit jokes and other puerile
            witticisms, such as when Sinbad shuts Marina (voiced by Catherine
            Zeta-Jones) in with the ship's dog (who, for some reason, is shown
            constantly drooling -- does this animal need his shots?) and says,
            &quot;If he starts hugging your leg, it means he likes you.&quot;
            (One wonders if they changed &quot;humping&quot; to
            &quot;hugging&quot; in order to get a PG rating.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There's an island that turns out to
            be a really, really, REALLY big fish, but some of the other
            creatures aren't up to the small miracles that Ray Harryhausen used
            to whip up for producer Charles H. Schneer's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Sinbad</i>
            pictures. (Harryhausen designed, made, animated, lighted, and
            photographed all of his stop-motion creations himself, which gave
            them a distinctly individualized quality, from the wondrously
            slithery dinosaur in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Beast
            from 20,000 Fathoms</i>, with its switching tail, to the gamboling
            trained elephant in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Valley of
            Gwangi</i>.) While Marina reeducated Sinbad on how women aren't as
            weak as men think they are, I found myself watching the film and
            yearning for Kerwin Mathews and Kathryn Grant. (At least there
            aren't any Bryan Adams songs.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And what's with the vulgarity
            creeping into current so-called &quot;family&quot; pictures? Last
            year, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Snow Dogs</i> opened with two jokes during the first seven minutes that
            I found to be particularly inappropriate for children; the year
            before that, there was <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">See
            Spot Run</i>, with its &quot;I'm covered in caca!&quot; scene.
            What's more, I fear that parents are resigning themselves to finding
            unexpected instances of crudeness in films they're taking their kids
            to see. Outfits like CleanFlicks are already snipping away at films
            and censoring them for customers. I would rather see Hollywood
            producers exercise some good, old-fashioned Good Taste, instead.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"></o:p>
