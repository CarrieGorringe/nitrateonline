            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by
			<a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 
			14 February 2003</i></font><p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>As the great-great grandson of 
			Union soldier Robert Lybarger, I have to confess that good American 
			Civil War stories like <i>Gone with the Wind</i>, <i>Glory</i>, <i>
			The Red Badge of Courage</i> or even <i>Pharaoh's Army</i> do have a 
			special place in my heart. This is true even if the films come from 
			a perspective my ancestor would not have liked. For example, Robert 
			would have hated the way that Victor Fleming depicted his fellow 
			veterans of Sherman's March to the Sea in <i>Gone with the Wind</i> 
			and that film's sanitized presentation of slavery. Nonetheless, all 
			of these movies force us to look at what makes us Americans and to 
			examine how our lives are better or worse because of the struggle. 
			Sadly, screenwriter-director Ronald F. Maxwell's new prequel to his 
			moving and engrossing <i>Gettysburg</i> comes short of qualifying. 
			Despite working with some of the same cast members and with a much 
			larger budget (<i>Gettysburg</i> was originally intended as a TV 
			miniseries), Maxwell's new movie lacks the clear focus and the vivid 
			characters that made the first film so memorable.</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Gettysburg</i>, which was 
			adapted from Michael Shaara's Pulitzer Prize winning novel <i>The 
			Killer Angels</i>, dealt entirely on the titular battle. <i>Gods and 
			Generals</i>, adapted from the prequel written by Shaara's son Jeff, 
			is all over the place, starting with the dawn of the conflict and 
			ending at the battle of Fredericksburg. In addition, <i>Gods and 
			Generals </i>also lets viewers in on the personal lives of the lead 
			combatants. We get a peek at General &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson's domestic 
			life and some of the reasons why Colonel Joshua Lawrence 
			Chamberlain, a religion and philosophy professor instead of a 
			professional soldier, joined the Union cause. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">These factors should have helped <i>
			Gods and Generals</i> become more involving and relevant, making the 
			story much deeper than a bunch of blue and gray bodies decorating a 
			field. Instead, these establishing sequences are as stiff and 
			stilted as a college history lesson delivered by a professor who 
			knows his material but has lost his passion for it. A good example 
			is the sequence where Chamberlain (played again by Jeff Daniels) 
			argues with his wife Fanny before going into training. Mira Sorvino 
			and Daniels valiantly struggle with Maxwell's stiff dialogue but do 
			little more than spout platitudes. We get a glimpse of some of 
			Chamberlain's values, but Lawrence and Fanny's relationship and how 
			it might have influenced him on the battlefield is never developed.
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In fact, Daniels' top billing is a 
			misnomer. Most of the film actually follows &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson, and 
			Daniels' brief appearances seem more distracting than enlightening. 
			His scenes are supposed to be a build-up for his later and more 
			substantial appearance in <i>Gettysburg</i>. In the context of <i>
			Gods and Generals</i>, however, the scenes involving Chamberlain and 
			the 20<sup>th</sup> Maine are intended to lead up to the &quot;later&quot; 
			story but instead make the new film's 
			three-hour-and-forty-five-minute running time seem more oppressive. 
			It's a real shame because Chamberlain's tale (his background as a 
			bookworm made him an unlikely warrior, but his quick thinking and 
			his occasionally unmilitaristic approach made him a winner on the 
			battlefield) has more interesting components than Jackson's, as it's 
			presented here.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Stephen Lang (who played General 
			Pickett in <i>Gettysburg</i>) portrays Jackson as a strict general, 
			a brave warrior, a loving husband and a pious Christian. All of 
			these traits are commendable, but in the end Jackson emerges as 
			little more than a nice guy who kicked Yankee butt. Jackson is 
			haunted by the death of his first wife in childbirth, but the 
			relevance to struggle is only sporadically pertinent to the story.
			</font></p>
			<p style="text-indent:0in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's also a 
			shame that Maxwell couldn't have done more with Robert Duvall's 
			portrayal of Confederate mastermind Robert E. Lee. As with 
			Chamberlain, he seems inserted with only fitful relevance to the 
			rest of the film. Nonetheless, it's actually an improvement over the 
			first film. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In <i>Gettysburg</i>, the only bad 
			performance came from Martin Sheen as the same character. From his 
			laughable &quot;Suthun&quot; accent to his hyperactive gestures, Sheen came 
			across as someone only fools would place in charge of an army. 
			Duvall, however, projects a quiet, wily dignity and is fun to watch 
			even if his scenes aren't that consequential. This may be due to the 
			fact that the actor is actually portraying one of his own ancestors. 
			If only he'd been recruited for the first movie</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">There are other improvements in <i>
			Gods and Generals</i>. Thanks to the fact that Ted Turner, who 
			financed both films and had cameos in both, put up more money in the 
			new one, the battle scenes and the landscapes are less 
			claustrophobic and often breathtaking. In <i>Gettysburg</i>, the 
			budgetary constraints revealed themselves in the makeup. Most of the 
			actors sported wigs and alleged facial hair that didn't seem 
			remotely biological, much less human. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Nonetheless, it was the 
			performances behind those phony beards that gave <i>Gettysburg</i> 
			its power. After a while the gripping performances that Daniels, Sam 
			Elliott, Tom Berenger, and the late Richard Jordan gave made a 
			viewer forget the unconvincing prosthetics and concentrate on the 
			story and the people in it. For all its length, <i>Gods and Generals
			</i>(the shorter of the two films) never achieves that same empathy.
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This may explain why the packed 
			audience of hundreds at the screening I attended all groaned loudly 
			when the closing titles informed them that <i>Gods and Generals</i> 
			was actually part of a trilogy. It's a safe bet that no one 
			attending that night will be waiting in line for <i>The Last Full 
			Measure</i> should it ever be filmed.</font></td>
