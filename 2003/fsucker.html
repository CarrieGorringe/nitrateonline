</font><font face="Verdana" size="5">Why Sucking Be Super<br>
</font><font face="Verdana" size="4">Interview with Jeff Daniels<br>
</font><i><font size="1" face="Verdana">interview by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan
Lybarger</a>, 24 January 2003</font></i></p>
<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jeff Daniels is greeting well-wishers at a 
premiere, but you aren't likely to see this one on <i>Entertainment</i> <i>
Tonight</i>. Except for a couple of publicists, he's greeting fans alone. 
There's no red carpet, the star is dressed more like a member of Pearl Jam with 
flannels and jeans. The snowy weather out the window looks nothing like LA It's 
actually Kansas City.</font></b></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When I finally get through to him, I ask if 
he'd be willing to sign my copy of Woody Allen's <i>The Purple Rose of Cairo</i>, 
in which he plays both a movie character who walks off the screen into Mia 
Farrow's complicated Depression-era life and the actor who played him and now 
wants him to return to the movie. I told Daniels how much I loved the movie and 
that is was an intriguing blend of Luigi Pirandello's <i>Six Characters in 
Search of an Author </i>and Buster Keaton's <i>Sherlock Jr</i>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After signing, he points to the poster for his 
newest flick (which he also wrote and directed), he replies, &quot;This one's going 
to be just like it.&quot; After a second or two, a mischievous grin creeps over his 
boyish face. The first clue that his statement might be a bit of a joke is that 
the new film is titled <i>Super Sucker</i>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While he may have worked on prestige pictures 
like <i>The Purple Rose of Cairo, </i>last fall's <i>The Hours</i>, <i>Terms of 
Endearment</i> and <i>Gettysburg</i>, his most popular role is probably Harry &quot;Har&quot; 
Dunne from Peter and Bobby <span class="MsoHyperlink">
<span style="color: black; text-decoration: none">Farrelly</span></span>'s <i>
Dumb &amp; Dumber</i>. <i>Super Sucker </i>deals with a feud between two vacuum 
cleaner salesmen named Fred Barlow and Winslow Schnaebelt (Daniels and Harve 
Presnell). In a conceit that would make the Farrellys proud, Barlow is unable to 
compete with Schnaebelt's superior organization until he discovers a forgotten 
attachment called the 'Homemaker's Little Helper' and its ability to operate in 
'hard to reach places.' </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If the idea of vacuum cleaner and these bizarre 
unintended benefits seems outlandish, Daniels explained in a later roundtable 
interview that the web is full of people who seemed to have more than an 
emotional attachment to their home cleaning systems. &quot;It's been two years, maybe 
a little longer since I did the research, but (there are) a lot of chat rooms, a 
lot of those,&quot; he recalled. &quot;They would get together, and they would talk about 
their vacuum cleaner collections. That's where I found out about the 'nap 
nipper.' 'Question: Does anybody have a nap nipper on the Hoover 2500 1958 
model? I can't find the little whatever. I'm missing one part. And so on.' 
Somebody from Arizona would say, 'Well I've got that. I'll send one because I've 
got a Hoover 2900.' And they were just going back and forth, so I was able to 
pick up 'oscillating brushes' and a lot of the other terminology from those 
guys.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">He also found the situation to be a way of 
commenting on Midwestern attitudes toward sex. He elaborates, &quot;Aside from 
looking for a comic idea for our second film, I was in London shooting <i>101 
Dalmatians</i>. It's 10:00 at night, and on page three of the tabloids, there's 
nudity. In Europe and Amsterdam, they just seem to be a lot more open. You come 
back to America and 'The Land of the Free,' and it's this [he makes a gesture as 
if he's trying to hide something], especially in the Midwest.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Living in Michigan and wanting to shoot films 
here about [the region], there's a funny idea about the veneer of normalcy that 
we portray, and behind closed doors Bunny Barlow (played by Michelle Mountain) 
is upstairs with the 'Homemaker's Little Helper.' It just sounded funny, and 
then for him to not even comment on it or to judge it or anything. Fred's first 
reaction is, 'This could sell,' which pushes the comedy even further. Instead of 
marriage problems, it was really just kind of treated normally.&quot; He adds, &quot;When 
you see Bonnie in bed with the thing, it’s the headboard and stuff like that. 
Plus, if we’re gonna go graphic with it, then we’re a porn [film]. And also do 
just that and get her rolling over because it’s all about Fred’s reaction.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Fred Barlow's optimism is endemic within sales 
culture, and Daniels eagerly researched it and incorporated it into the film. &quot;I 
actually slipped into a sales convention in Toledo with a thousand Fred Barlows. 
They had a thousand of them, from Dayton, Ft. Wayne, Michigan, all over the 
place. I literally -- when they had these curtains at this banquet hall -- had a 
video camera. This would have been the lead story on the Toledo news if they'd 
have caught me back there.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Listening to Daniels recalling his research is 
almost like getting a free performance. He assumes characters as he speaks and 
instantly assumes their personas. &quot;It was like a revival, very evangelical. They 
were really getting these guys pumped up. You could see the people who were 
trying to take the gig that thought they might be able to make some money. 
They'd die after a month. They just don't want to go door-to-door. This is their 
last meeting. They aren't going to last,&quot; he recalls, every now and then playing 
both audience and emcee. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;And then it's the other guys -- Rob from 
Sylvania, Ohio, who sold last year $450,000 worth of vacuums, literally. That 
was his number. He was the number one guy. They bring Rob up here, and Rob gets 
the Ferrari because it's such a huge industry. And they give Rob the car. 'You 
want to be like Rob, don't you? How many of you want to be like Rob?'&quot;</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Daniels' comparison between <i>Super Sucker</i> 
and <i>The Purple Rose of Cairo</i> wasn't a complete jest, though. Like his 
former director Woody Allen, Daniels made <i>Super Sucker</i> and his previous 
directing effort, <i>Escanaba in da Moonlight</i>, with regional performers and 
technicians, in this case Michigan, instead of importing Hollywood talent. &nbsp;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When he hasn't been appearing in films for 
other directors, Daniels has, since 1991, been writing plays, acting and 
directing with the Chelsea, Michigan-based Purple Rose Theater Company. Veterans 
from this group have collaborated with Daniels on both films. For example, 
Purple Rose veteran Matt Letscher, who plays Barlow's protégé, Howard, in <i>
Super Sucker</i>, has built on his experience to land prominent roles like the 
lead he plays in the TV series <i>Good Morning, Miami</i>. He and Daniels ended 
up collaborating on non-Purple Rose projects like <i>Gettysburg</i> and its 
prequel <i>Gods and Generals</i>. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Allen's emphasis on regional (in his case, New 
York) talent has obviously left a strong impression on Daniels. He recalls, &quot;For 
years, [Allen] would shoot in the fall, edit in the spring, and he'd be writing 
the next one. Everybody on the crew knew that they would be going back to work 
on Labor Day and shoot Woody's next movie. He was just churning them out. I 
can't do that, but when we're ready to go again, there will be a series of phone 
calls to the same guys. It won't be, 'It's the third movie; we have five 
million; let's get some people from LA' We're developing the people that we 
have. We're only going to get better.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Selling Michigan-based films is a good deal 
harder. Daniels has had to use some Fred Barlow-like ingenuity to get <i>
Escanaba in da Moonlight</i> and <i>Super Sucker</i> to find venues and 
audiences for the films. Distributors balked at both movies, even though <i>
Super Sucker </i>won the audience award at U.S. Comedy Arts Festival in Aspen, 
Colorado. With both films, Purple Rose became the distribution company as well 
as the distributor.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Making films with a mainstream sensibility on 
the kind of budget that seems more suited to a Hal Hartley or a Jim Jarmusch 
film has forced Daniels and his collaborators to practically create their own 
market. He recalls, &quot;It’s cost us. It’s hurt us. We know we’re battling the 
perception of indies, which is serious, meaningful and important, uncommercial. 
And Sundance has told us that. We were close on our first film and even closer 
on this one. They said, 'When it comes to picking a drama that’s uncommercial or 
something like that or a comedy like yours, we’ll pick the drama every time.' We 
argue that, but it doesn’t matter. We’ve been told by distributors, 'You’ve made 
a mainstream, commercial comedy on an indie budget. Too bad you didn’t have $ 30 
million and Adam Sandler playing your protégé.' And you’re going, ‘Is is funny? 
Did it work? And is there room in the indie world for comedy?’&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While distributors and festivals may have been 
unwilling to deal with the Purple Rose films, exhibitors have been far more 
open. &quot;With <i>Escanaba</i>, we had thirty screens in Michigan,&quot; Daniels 
recalls. &quot;We called up the theaters and malls, got into these malls and 
multiplexes. They said, 'Hey, if it sells Cherry Cokes, we're there.' And it was 
a comedy about deer hunting in Michigan, and it outsold J-Lo and Matthew 
McConaughey's <i>The Wedding Planner </i>three-to-one. Yeah, we were only in 
Michigan, but it grossed $2.3 million in Michigan and Wisconsin. We're not gonna 
do big in Florida, but Hollywood noticed.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;We're in first-tier theaters. I was surprised 
with <i>Escanaba </i>because I thought the studios had it all locked up and 
there would be a battle. With <i>Escanaba</i>, they said that if it sells, we'll 
put it on screen number eight. We had some theaters in Michigan and Indiana 
where the studio called and said, &quot;Get that thing out of there. We want J-Lo on 
two screens.&quot; They said, &quot;Well, J-Lo ain't selling, and this one is. They're 
lined up to see this one. Send me something that works, and I will.' They're 
cowboys, these exhibitors. They're willing to talk back. We had one theater in 
Detroit that played <i>Escanaba</i> for one night, and then the studio called 
and said, 'Get it off there.' Only one theater of how many? It sounds pretty 
good,&quot; he says. On video, <i>Escanaba in da Moonlight</i> eventually sold 85,000 
units.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Super Sucker</i>, which doesn't have as 
pronounced a Michigan slant, opened even wider on January 24, 2003 [Super Bowl 
weekend] on 125 screens in Michigan, Illinois, Ohio, Wisconsin, Minnesota, 
Kansas and Missouri. As with its predecessor, it's playing in multiplexes 
contrary to industry logic. &quot;Why can't we open in the middle of the country? Why 
does it have to be New York and LA? Their answer is 'because that's the way it's 
done.' So, we just said there's a better way to do it. Give us the distribution 
money. We'll even take less advance -- no advance -- and a back end, and let us 
do this. We know how to do this,&quot; he says. &quot;It was shot in the Midwest, made in 
the Midwest about the Midwest. Let’s open it in the Midwest. We’re often 
ignored. We get it later. We're treated like we're not sophisticated; we won't 
get the jokes. If it was up to my partner Bob Brown, we'd never go to New York 
and L.A, or the last two cities we'd go to in America would be New York and LA I 
hope we have that problem,&quot; he says with a grin. When asked what he thinks of 
his side gigs of writing and directing, Daniels says he enjoys directing while 
finding it to be a bit like being a traffic cop. As for writing, he states, &quot;I 
ask anybody 'Are you a writer?' And if they just say, 'I love it.' I say, 
'You're not really a writer. That scene that you won't deal with, the one that's 
really terrible on page twelve, you need to deal with it now. As you sit there, 
just eight hours, and it's just two pages. All that means, is it's just not 
working. It's maddening. I love and hate it.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The release of <i>Super Sucker </i>comes 
between Daniels' appearances in two films that are radically different from his 
broad comedy. He plays Ed Harris' estranged lover in the somber but acclaimed 
adaptation of Michael Cunningham's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel <i>The Hours</i> 
and reprises one of his most popular roles in the upcoming Civil War drama <i>
Gods and Generals</i>. On the former film, Daniels says, &quot;It really is 
wonderful. It's got a great shot at Best Picture. For me, that was like being in 
an All-Star Game. Not only the girls [Meryl Streep, Nicole Kidman and Julianne 
Moore], but Ed Harris, John C. Reilly, [director] Stephen Daldry, Stephen 
Dillane, and [playwright and screenwriter] David Hare. I just basically knelt in 
front of him when I met him.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In <i>Gods and Generals</i>, Daniels reprises 
his role as American Civil War hero Lieutenant Colonel Joshua Lawrence 
Chamberlain, the same character who won him similar acclaim in <i>Gettysburg</i>. 
Chamberlain is one of the actor's favorite roles, so he eagerly recalls doing 
the research.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;When I did the research on [Chamberlain], I 
went to Maine,&quot; says Daniels. &quot;I met a couple of guys, Tom Desjardin, who's 
written about the 20<sup>th</sup> Maine [which Chamberlain commanded], was the 
only guy up there not to treat him like Jesus. I remember going to some of the 
Historical Society people and saying to them, 'What are his flaws? I can't play 
a saint. I've got to play his weaknesses.' One woman said, 'He had no flaws,' 
and she was dead serious. Tom said, 'The wife, maybe the wife. Maybe he was 
trying to prove to his wife, who was constantly going to New York that he wasn't 
just a Bible-thumping professor, that he was a man.' That's stuff that you can 
use. So, that helped.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Much of what makes Chamberlain a fascinating 
cinematic and historical figure is the fact that, as a former religion teacher, 
he was far from blood-and-guts commander. When he is assigned to deal with a 
group of mutineers, he gets them to fight through persuasion instead of 
punishment and still manages to lead a victorious defense against a ferocious 
Confederate advance. &quot;It was not his world. I think Tom Desjardin said, 'If you 
do nothing -- he thought this was going to be a disaster, a Hollywood actor 
doing Gettysburg -- show his ability to think on his feet.' That's the key to 
Chamberlain. You can see it on Little Round Top when they put Chamberlain in 
position in the movie. Think your way through this problem. You can see it right 
before bayonets and that whole thing, thinking. I don't have it planned already. 
There isn't any textbook He's thinking his way through it,&quot; explains Daniels. He 
adds that fans of the first film will be treated better production value in the 
newer film. &quot;If you like <i>Gettysburg</i>, you'll love this one, I hope, 
because we had more money. Ted Turner wrote a check for $55 million. That's 
different than the money we had to shoot the miniseries <i>Gettysburg</i>. It 
was shot for the square box. Only after the fact did we -- Ted, the guys at TNT 
-- said, &quot;This is a movie. It'll win the Oscar, and suddenly, it was a four-hour 
movie. It wasn't shot as a movie, which is widescreen and vistas, and that's 
what we were able to do with <i>Gods and Generals</i>.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Daniels also fondly recalls humanizing an even 
more imposing historical figure, George Washington, in the A&amp;E production of 
Howard Fast's <i>The Crossing</i>, which comes out on DVD in February. He 
recalls, &quot;We worked hard to make him a man, not the myth and to take him off the 
dollar bill. I was pouring through this one book that said he was aloof, quiet, 
moody -- all of those things that are playable or the flaws. We tried to do 
that. We also had the advantage of that it was only three days in his life, not 
seven years or something. It was just that concentrated period, so it allowed us 
to be specific to that piece of time. But we tried to be authentic, versus the 
dollar bill come to life.&quot;</font></p>
<span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Daniels also realizes that 
he's created another icon of sorts. Wherever he goes, there are questions about 
playing Harry in <i>Dumb and Dumber</i>. He also has a diplomatic reply for 
those who wonder why he wasn't recruited for the new prequel <i>When Harry Met 
Lloyd: Dumb and Dumberer</i>. &quot;Jim (Carrey) wasn't interested; the
<span class="MsoHyperlink"><span style="color: black; text-decoration: none">
Farrelly</span></span>s aren't involved; nobody contacted me. It was probably 
cheaper to cast two guys in their twenties. I wish them the best, and I hope 
they got signed to long contracts. I'd be willing to do a cameo,&quot; He said. He 
then added that he hoped that during the process of performing the cameo a truck 
would back up, dumping large sums of money.</font></span><hr size="1">
