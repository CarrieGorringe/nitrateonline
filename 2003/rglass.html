            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by <a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias
            Savada</a>, 14 November 2003</i></font>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Slick. Real
            slick. Real sick. That Stephen Glass is some character.</b></font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">First, let me say
            I have no sympathy at all for Mr. Glass, the formerly esteemed and
            still extremely young journalist whose well-documented downfall
            duped and disgraced a dozen or so editors and writers at <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            New Republic</i>, the current-events-and-policy publication often
            referred to as the in-flight magazine of Air Force One. The story
            now is available in a neat, clean, and smart cautionary film tale
            courtesy of first-time director Billy Ray. Glass, who also wrote for
            <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Rolling Stone</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Harper's</i>, and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">George</i>, was
            fired for fabricating dozens of articles. He outraged his fellow
            journalists, caught his editors with their commas down, and
            otherwise disappointed and ultimately disgusted his professional
            family. All that trust and admiration, and, apparently, too much
            wide-eyed innocence. Boy, what suckers. Of course, we knew that
            before the lights went down to start <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Shattered Glass</i>, if you followed the news, broken online by <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Forbes</i>
            Digital Tool and then broaden by Buzz Bissinger's article in the
            September 1998 issue of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Vanity Fair</i>. Sadly, even the shamefully brazen centerpiece of this
            mess can still bottom-feed off the public, as Glass has since
            published a thinly-veiled novel about a hotshot reporter who lies.
            That book is unfortunately rising in the ranks at Amazon.com's
            website, moving up 15,000 spots since just after the Halloween
            opening in New York City and Los Angeles. It should be off the
            charts.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ah, but I
            digress. Maybe I just don't like people who constantly dress in
            solid-blue oxford shirts over crew-neck t-shirts, with those Harry
            Potter frames hugging a cherubic mug. Hayden Christensen, brother of
            producer Tove Christensen, succeeds in putting the best face forward
            capturing Glass as sick/slick puppy in wolf's clothing. He's such an
            entertaining guy, spinning stories at numerous staff meetings that
            make everyone laugh and smile; or thoughtfully, and obsessively,
            remembering, three years after a casual mention, how someone likes
            her beer served. Without delving into the underlying reasons beneath
            his character, the actor blazes glory in creating a compassionate
            Svengali, of a debonair word swindler perpetrating fictional myth
            (twenty-seven stories passed muster with the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">New
            Republic</i>'s fact checkers) before unraveling with further lies,
            deceptions, and a bowl of tears. Christensen, horribly directed in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Star
            Wars: Episode II</i>, a turgid sequel to a dull prequel, thankfully
            builds off the sympathetic character he played to wide acclaim in
            Irwin Winkler's drama <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Life as
            a House</i>.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For all the suave
            anti-hero that Christensen exudes, we still can root for the real
            heroes who uncovered the fraud: Adam Penenberg (Steve Zahn),
            flummoxed by the audacity that a Glass piece on hackers is
            completely unverifiable through any of the Internet search engines;
            and editor Chuck Lane (Peter Sarsgaard), who had replaced the
            beloved and charming Mike Kelly (Hank Azaria). Zahn, best known for
            his distinctly comic, clueless roles--including a Klingon-speaking
            friend of Eddie Murphy's in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Daddy
            Day Care</i>--offers a more serious character, yet imbued with a
            comic twinkle, of the reporter who can only confirm one fact in the
            story, that Nevada is indeed a state of the union. Sarsgaard, best
            known for his role opposite Hilary Swank in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Boys
            Don't Cry</i> (which also featured Chloë Sevigny, who has a role
            here as an appreciative colleague), hits his marks just right. He's
            the boss, torn between dispiriting hope, a mutinous staff, and
            journalistic disaster, who eventually earns the respect he deserves&nbsp;<o:p>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The co-author of
            bigger-than-life efforts <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Hart's
            War</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Volcano</i>, Billy Ray has turned off the high beams and focused on
            objects that are closer than they appear. He has crafted an
            entertaining film, filled it with understated performances, and
            delivers a small pearl. It's generally a straightforward piece, yet
            he imaginatively sets up the fable with faux footage of the
            fabricated hacker Ian Restil, his &quot;agent,&quot; and an entire
            software company. A parallel line has the Glass character regaling
            students at his former high school with his day-in-the-life-of
            experiences, earning the adoring, yet ultimately empty, attention of
            his too-susceptible teen crowd.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This journalistic
            debacle, which is by no means a unique situation (reference: Jayson
            Blair), gets a wonderful treatment in the hands of a freshman
            director. As casually mentioned by a <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">New Republic</i> receptionist late in the film, and which many astute
            viewers early in the film would have wondered about under their
            breath, this all might have been avoided if the faked articles had
            been supplemented with photographic proof. No photos equals no
            truth. Thankfully, we have the cinematic truth of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Shattered
            Glass</i> to remind us that there are endearingly likable dirty
            rotten scoundrels loose amongst us.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"></o:p>
