			</font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>,
            25 April 2003</i></font><p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the comedy <i>Anger 
			Management</i>, Adam Sandler, that oval-faced lamb with the abashed 
			look of a high-schooler working the drive-through window at a 
			McDonalds, plays Dave Buznik, a meek, schlubby little guy who is 
			forced by court mandate to take an anger management course after he 
			is accused, wrongfully, of committing an assault. How funny could 
			that be? The counselor who's assigned to him is a genuine nut named 
			Dr. Buddy Rydell, who's&nbsp; played by Jack Nicholson and, with greasy 
			hair and scrubby&nbsp; beard, is almost in full Jack Torrance mode, but 
			not quite, although maybe it would have been better if he were. You 
			can figure out in the first ten minutes how the rest of the film is 
			going to go -- the counselor is going to keep doing things to Dave, 
			who actually doesn't have an anger management problem to begin with, 
			until, finally, Dave explodes; problem is, there's over an hour and 
			a half to go once you've figured it out, so it's one slow, 
			scene-by-scene crawl towards the </font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The picture recycles all of the 
			stuff we've seen in Sandler's previous comedies -- people who gawk 
			at him, people who act mean to him for some reason, people who 
			humiliate him for some reason, gross-looking people, people who pull 
			pranks on Sandler, girls who are sluts, people who bully Sandler, 
			misunderstand him, pick on him, try to antagonize him, laugh at him, 
			have bigger penises than him or otherwise make him feel inadequate 
			(well, as the indispensable Rik Mayall said in <i>The Young Ones</i>, 
			&quot;It's not the size of it but what you do with it that counts!&quot;), and 
			on and on. After a while, you wish Dave would do or say something 
			clever in response to all that's done to him -- one moment, Dr. 
			Rydell is hopping into bed with Dave, tries to spoon with him and 
			then breaks-wind, the next he's goading Dave, for &quot;therapeutic&quot; 
			reasons, to try and hit on a girl at a bar, using an outrageous 
			pick-up line -- but, more than ever, Sandler seems to be working in 
			two modes: either violently out-of-control, or dotingly moseying his 
			way through scenes like one of Carnation's contented cows. P.T. 
			Anderson was able to shape (and give some context to) Sandler's 
			persona so that it approached something resembling art in <i>
			Punch-Drunk Love</i>, but, working here with director Peter Segal 
			(who previously did <i>Nutty Professor II</i> and the Chris 
			Farley-David Spade comedy <i>Tommy Boy</i>), the comedian seems to 
			be stuck in a rut. Dave never seems to realize that he's the object 
			of endless games-playing perpetrated by a complete and total fraud, 
			so he's duped over and over again. The movie falls into the category 
			of those who keep driving down the road despite the fact that 
			they're running on three tires and a flat: once you fix the flat 
			tire, though, there's no longer any reason for the movie to exist</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Anger Management</i> has a 
			number of other problems, too, from the fact that the plot doesn't 
			make any sense, to shots that don't match and some extremely 
			inelegant lighting and cinematography (credited to Donald McAlpine, 
			whose work is usually much, much better than this), and some really 
			weird cameos, including Heather Graham as a girl who strips down to 
			Red Sox underwear (that's Red Sox as in the ball team); John C. 
			Reilly as a Buddhist monk (this is probably your only chance to see 
			someone yanking on a Buddhist monk's loincloth after they have been 
			decked); Harry Dean Stanton as a blind man who gets beaned by a 
			tennis ball -- deliberately; Rudolph Giuliani, who tells Dave, 
			during a Yankees game, to give his girlfriend a &quot;five-second 
			Frenchie&quot;; and Woody Harrelson as a German-born transvestite 
			prostitute (for the record, he looks like a cross between Rutger 
			Hauer and the socialite Jocelyne Wildenstein). John Turturro also 
			makes a frenetically unfunny appearance in a supporting role, 
			showing how, in the space of ten years, he's turned from a really 
			excellent actor into a really bad one who doesn't seem to care 
			anymore how he looks. (Sandler's scenes with Marisa Tomei, who plays 
			Dave's girlfriend, allow a genuinely sweet quality to emerge in the 
			movie from time to time.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Nicholson maybe thought he'd try 
			and catch a vibe off of one of the hot young performers, here, but 
			it doesn't work: he can't seem to figure out how to make the 
			character work (and neither can the filmmakers -- they try to make 
			it appear that Dr. Rydell has set all this stuff up for Dave's 
			benefit, but it's nonsensical), and he has some wretchedly unfunny 
			lines to deliver, such as, &quot;What is your position on breast 
			implants?&quot; He seems miserable and, worse, monotonous: Nicholson 
			plugs some mannerisms into the role, and then coasts. I got the same 
			feeling I had watching the scene where Marlon Brando rides, at full 
			speed, down a hillside in a bathtub towards some livestock in <i>
			Bedtime Story</i> (1964): we don't need to see Marlon Brando doing a 
			scene like this, and we don't need to see Jack Nicholson doing a 
			movie like the one that <i>Anger Management</i> has turned out to 
			be. Nicholson's too good an actor, still, to have to stoop to 
			appearing in a low comedy where, among other things, he has to get 
			laughs by doing a couple of scenes where he sings &quot;I Am Pretty&quot; from
			<i>West Side Story</i>. Maybe Nicholson should have had a look at 
			what happened when Robert De Niro sang the same song last year in <i>
			Analyze That</i>.</font></td>
