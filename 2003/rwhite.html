with Mike White</font><font face="Verdana" size="4"><br>
</font><i><font size="1" face="Verdana">interview by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan
Lybarger</a>, 19 September 2003</font></i></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Many screenwriters toil in anonymity, often
losing the spotlight to the performers who recite their lines or the directors
who film their stories. This is not the case with Mike White. After penning
episodes of the TV series <i>Dawson's Creek</i> and co-writing <i>Dead Man on
Campus</i>, he wrote and starred in <i>Chuck &amp; Buck</i> where he played
Buck, a man who tries to act on his childhood crush on a fellow (Chris Weitz)
who doesn't return his affections.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The microbudgeted film was directed by his
former Wesleyan University classmate Miguel Arteta and won the Independent
Spirit Award for Best Feature under $500,000.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Since then, he's written for the cult TV series
<i>Freaks and Geeks</i> and is developing another with <i>American Pie</i>
directors Paul and Chris Weitz. He also re-teamed with Arteta for <i>The Good
Girl</i>, which starred Jennifer Aniston as a frustrated thirtysomething woman
in a small Texas town who takes up a disastrous affair with a disturbed young
literary wannabe (Jake Gyllenhaal).</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">He also wrote and played a teacher in <i>Orange
County</i>, where Colin Hanks stars as an aspiring writer who blames his
dysfunctional family and especially his drug-abusing brother (Jack Black) for
impeding his ambitions.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">White portrayed another teacher and joins
forces with Black again in his new film <i>School of Rock</i>. Directed by
Richard Linklater (<i>Waking Life</i>), the comedy features Black as Dewey Finn,
a penniless guitarist who poses as a substitute grade school teacher to pay the
rent. Dewey quickly discovers his pupils are talented musicians and secretly
recruits them as his own band.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Contacted by phone from Minneapolis, White
recalled how playing small roles in his films has made a big difference in terms
of recognition.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">Dan Lybarger: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
setup for the film is pretty simple, but you and Mr. Linklater and Mr. Black
were able to milk a lot out of it.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mike White: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">I
think all of us recognized from the get-go that there were sort of formulaic
aspects to this movie in the sense of the setup: &quot;the teacher that comes in
and inspires&quot; and &quot;the fish out of water.&quot; It's subjective. Some
would say we failed, but if we did succeed, we went with the attitude of making
those more obligatory moments into throwaway moments and not necessarily
focusing on that and trying to find the pleasure of the movie in the spontaneous
moments of the movie between Jack and the kids in the classroom and not making
those plot points sort of the hinging points of the pleasure of the movie.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">What
were some of the obligatory things you downplayed?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>MW: </i></b>When you talk about whether
they're going to win the competition, instead those moments with the music
building to a crescendo, you try do it in a way that just sort of feels like OK
this is pleasurable. These kids are funny. I think it's just by not trying to do
it too heavy-handed and trying to find the original moments in something that
could have been more by the book.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Is
there a difference between writing a more mainstream movie like this one or <i><span style="color:black">O</span>range
County</i> and an independent film like <i>The Good Girl</i> or <i>Chuck &amp;
Buck</i>?</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">MW: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yeah
[laughs]. I mean with the independent movies that I've written, I just wrote
them for myself and basically said, &quot;Either you want to make this movie or
don't make it. Make it as it is or don't make it.&quot;</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">You
had said that you were inspired by the attitude from Playwright Lanford Wilson's
<i>Burn This</i>.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">MW: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">It
wasn't the short play exactly, but the idea that he wrote &quot;Burn This&quot;
on the top of everything page because he wanted something that was so sort of
like exposing of himself that would make him uncomfortable. And I just thought
that was a cool way to look at writing.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Obviously, you can't do that every time out.
For me, when I take money from a place like Paramount, it's hard to say,
&quot;Make it as it is or f*ck it.&quot; There is a part of me that wants to
write something they can get their head around, that they can get behind and is
something that they would make. And at the same time do something that I can
hold my head up when it finally comes out.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Your
child characters were distinct. Was it difficult to write? Of course, you could
argue that your character Buck was a bit of a child himself.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">MW: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">[giggles]
To me what I was trying to do with the kids was not make them too
&quot;kid-like.&quot; I remember when I was that age I took myself very
seriously [chuckles]. It always irritated me when people would say
&quot;kid&quot; or &quot;children&quot; or &quot;child&quot; in reference to me,
so I was just trying to write kids who were sophisticated and wise as those kids
can be.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That's a testament to Rick's [Linklater] eye
for that kind of thing. It think he did a good job of finding some sort of fresh
personalities.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
kids look as if they were really playing. I play piano, and the kid at the
keyboard looked right.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">MW: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Rick
Linklater went out of his way to find musicians first and foremost so they
didn't have that <i>Josie and the Pussycats</i> moment at the end when they're
all just air-guitaring to a pre-recorded track. And I think that it sold those
moments. It allowed us to cast kids who weren't that sort of kewpie-doll,
Hollywood-type of brat kids that populates these type of movies.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">I
listened to your audio commentary for <i>The Good Girl</i>.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">MW: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">[Laughs]
Oh, God!</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">It
was a little looser than some I've heard, but one thing that kept striking me is
that Mr. Arteta had to remind you which scenes or patches of dialogue he had
cut, and you didn't seem to mind and wouldn't have noticed if he hadn't
mentioned it. I'd imagine that most writers would be very defensive about their
words.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">MW: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Right.
One of the aspects of being in the movie and being on the set and working in TV
and having the amount of production experience that I've had is that it makes
you understand why things have to get cut for the rhythm of a scene. As a writer
sitting in your room, sometimes you don't know all the variables and all the
things that you're contending with. When you're sitting in the editing room,
sometimes things that seem tight on the page seem loose in the shoot in the way
it runs.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I don't know. As much as I'm a perfectionist or
I aspire to be when I'm sitting in from of the computer, at some point, you're
going to have to let go of it.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">A
conservative Catholic philosophy professor friend of mine loves <i>The Good Girl</i>
because he said he had never seen another movie that put him so far into the
mind of the protagonist.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">MW: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">That's
cool. <i>Chuck &amp; Buck</i> is pretty much the same in terms of subjectivity,
although that's a character that's a little more difficult to access. I love
subjectivity. I think that's my favorite part about writing and movies is being
able to leave yourself and have this sort of empathetic exercise where you're
suddenly living someone else's life and trying to get inside that. It's just my
personal preference.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To me movies that have many characters and are
more sprawling, like a lot of independent movies these days, are about how
something, like a car accident, connects them all. For me it's like I'm suddenly
disconnected from it and too outside. I'm more traditional in terms of form. I
just like subjectivity as the method of storytelling.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">With
the exception of the Colin Hanks character in <i>Orange County</i>, a lot of
your characters tend to be people with artistic ambitions but their skills to
meet those ambitions are missing.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">MW: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">That's
interesting. For me I've noticed that myself and only in retrospect. With each
thing, I like to get at what is behind the artistic impulse. Usually I find out
how happy the movie is has some correlation to how talented the character is
[laughs]. Like in <i>Orange County</i>, the kid turns out to be a more happy
ending. In <i>The Good Girl</i>, the Holden character (played by Jake
Gyllenhaal) writes the same story over and over, and it ends up a tragedy.
Everything has a little bit of autobiographical aspect to it, and for me it
would be hard to write a movie that didn't have some sense of somebody wanting
to express themselves, be creative or write something whether it's music like in
<i>School of Rock</i> or something else.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">You
wrote <i>School of Rock</i> with Jack Black in mind. Is that correct</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">MW: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yeah.
I only had the idea for the movie because I know Jack and was friends with him,
and I just thought I was speculating on how Jack had been sort of underutilized
in a certain way.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">What
makes Mr. Black's character Dewey redeemable? We imagine him like the stoner
slob he plays in <i>Orange County</i>. What were you able to tap into?</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">MW: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's
exactly what you said. I think there's something more appealing about a
character even if he's coarse and an oaf and all those things if he's got an
earnest passion for something and a goal. I think in a lot of those other
movies, he's the sort of a layabout and just lives for partying. There's
something about him in this where he's in the most earnest way passionate about
something that he's pursuing. And so even though, he goes about it in completely
the wrong way—it's kind of self serving—you completely buy his passion.
That's a part of it that makes it sound more heroic in that sort of way.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Was
it different to work with somebody like Mr. Linklater verses somebody like Mr.
Arteta? I just remember from the audio commentary that both men seem really
detail-oriented</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">.&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">MW: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">There's
a lot of similarities. The major difference is that with Miguel, I've known him
for a long time, and I've known him personally and socially before he directed
anything that I did. So there's a real shorthand there I didn't have with Rick
because I only met him a few weeks before we started shooting. When you're
really in the thick of collaboration, you always have to figure out how it's
going to work and the ground rules for that. That would be the big difference.
It was just sort of new ground to work with Rick.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">They're very similar in that if Miguel had
directed <i>School of Rock</i>, he would have a very similar approach in that he
would want a more sort of low-fi authentic take on the material than the more
sort of poppy hitting every moment really hard. I think he would have wanted to
find kids who brought a freshness to it and who could play music. So I think
there was a real attention to deal, and Rick was <i>extremely </i>detail-oriented
when it came to logic things in the script and things I would have thought in
the movie (the character) would just go with that. He would say, &quot;I don't
think he would say that.&quot;</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">On
a more trivial note, how does your taste in music differ from Dewey's?</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">MW: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">[Laughs]
My taste in music is sadly lacking. I grew up in a religious family, and we
weren't really exposed to rock music until MTV infiltrated our house. When I
think of a rock band, sadly the first band I think of is like Duran Duran. And
then by the time I got to the point where I could to where I could take on my
own creative interests, I was much more into movies than I was into rock, so my
taste in music is a little more idiosyncratic and not so rock-heavy.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">You've
told me your taste, but what sort of musical background did you have? Can you
play anything?</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">MW: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">I
played piano growing up. I had a piano teacher, and I played that growing up.
Now, I've completely lost it. In the script it was pretty rudimentary.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Dewey's
taste for heavy metal music also predates that of the kids in the film.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">MW: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">None
of them had ever heard of most of the music in the movie although a lot of their
parents who were sitting around the set could appreciate the references. I
always associated Jack with late seventies and stadium-rock bands.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Your
father is Mel White, an evangelist and gay-rights activist. How has he reacted
to your more recent movies?</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">MW: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">He's
been cool. With my aesthetic, we are so different. I think he's happy that I'm
doing what I want to do. He thought that <i>Orange County </i>was kind of cute
and <i>The Good Girl </i>was…I don't know. It's such a loaded subject when you
ask your parents' opinions on what you're doing. Unless he's really forthcoming
about it, I don't push him too hard.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Your
background does come through in the movies. Growing up in Kansas, I know so many
people like the fanatically religious security guard you played in <i>The Good
Girl</i>.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">MW: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">A
lot of his lines are taken directly from relatives' mouths, not my dad exactly,
but from his extended family of missionaries and ministers.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">For
somebody who has grown up primarily in big cities, I was struck by how vividly
you captured small town life in <i>The Good Girl</i>.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">MW: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">My
dad lived in Texas for a few years, and I spent a few years there. I've had my
share of drudgery jobs. To me it's less about small-town America, really. No
matter where you are, you can sometimes feel you're watching the clock ticking
away and wanting something more to your life. To me in the way that I came to it
was in a much more conceptual landscape than in the verisimilitude of small town
life.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>DL: </i></b>With the exception of <i>Chuck
&amp; Buck¸ </i>you don't write yourself the leading or the showier roles.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">MW: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">I'm
not looking at as a way to get myself starring vehicles. I mean it when I say
that it's a way for me to be part of the movie. It's not that I have a huge bug
for acting or that I want a career as an actor beyond the scripts that I write.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Even
though you haven't directed a film, people still talk about your movies in an
auteurist way.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">MW: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">For
my point of view, I think that people who write and direct should be considered
that way. But I feel like just because I come from a writer's point of view, if
you're creating the story, to me that's the person who's saying something versus
the person who's actually filming it. I know that there are examples of
directors to the contrary who can take found material and make it their own. I
feel that it begins with the writer. I'm surprised that (the writer's
recognition) doesn't happen more.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The reason that it happens with me is more due
to the fact that I'm <i>in</i> the movies. They can put a face to my name and my
name to the movie so that I'm getting more credit as a writer than if I had
written these movies and not had my face associated with it. I think that that
has had more to do with it than it does to any idiosyncrasies that all the
movies share.</font><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
