            wildly-overblown <i>Underworld</i>, Kate Beckinsale plays a
            &quot;death-dealer&quot; for a vampire &quot;coven&quot; in some
            nameless, Europeanish-looking city where it's always night and only
            half of the lights are turned on, and she gets to leap from rooftop
            to balcony and back again wearing either a long black coat slit up
            to 'yar (<i>haute</i>-<i>Matrix</i> couture) or a skin-tight leather
            suit like Emma Peel in <i>The Avengers</i>. Unfortunately, Kate
            Beckinsale is not Diana Rigg, and, after a while, you certainly wish
            she was. Earlier this year, in <i>Laurel Canyon</i>, Beckinsale gave
            a blank, inexpressive performance in the role of a woman who loses
            her inhibitions. Here, she gives a blank, inexpressive performance
            (made even more so, considering that only half of her face is
            visible for most of the movie) playing a vampire warrior woman.
            Somebody ought to check and se if this girl is taking her vitamins.</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The movie, filmed almost entirely
            in blues, grays, and blacks (and the cinematographer is Tony
            Pierce-Roberts, who recently did some great work in the Merchant and
            Ivory film <i>The Golden Bowl</i>), is an example of what ten years
            of video games have done to the movies -- volleys of munitions, and
            constant action, most of it meaningless. Hints are dropped regarding
            such things as &quot;the Awakening&quot; and &quot;the
            Covenant&quot;, which we patiently wait to get an explanation on,
            but then the movie lunges (not &quot;cuts&quot;, not
            &quot;segues&quot;) into the next scene, and we wait, and wait, and
            wait. The movie runs over two hours, and we're still waiting.
            Meanwhile, characters walk around with great self-importance,
            wearing uncomfortable-looking outfits and saying things like,
            &quot;What you will do is summon Kraven.&quot; There are grotesque <b><i>pièces
            de résistance</i></b>, like close-ups of hypodermic needles
            lovingly plunging into flesh, or, in one instance that is sure to
            leave audiences agog, bullets oozing their way out of open wounds.
            (Quick! more popcorn!) The story has to do with a centuries-long war
            between vampires and &quot;lycans&quot;, or werewolves, the reason
            for which is never really elucidated. (Actually, somebody says
            something about &quot;cellular incapability&quot; -- in which case,
            why do they show werewolves feasting on vampires in some scenes? The
            movie breaks its own rules.)<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Beckinsale's vampire gets mixed up
            with a human, played by Scott Speedman, who gets chomped by a
            werewolf -- big trouble. Speedman has a likable persona and, as he
            showed in the police drama <i>Dark Blue</i>, an ability to act. He
            will probably give a really good performance once he gets into a
            better movie, because, here, he's stuck in one of the most thankless
            roles of the year -- he's either shackled to a chair, bound to a
            table, or, near the end, transformed into something which looks like
            a cross between the Incredible Hulk and a piece of padded furniture.
            (Various other &quot;lycans&quot; and vampires are played in the
            film by Michael Sheen, given the Armenian look of the rock group
            System of a Down; Shane Brolly, who looks like he just swallowed a
            bug; and Bill Nighy, giving a pretty good performance under the
            circumstances, as a reawakened vampire elder who initially looks
            like he could do with a makeover from the Fab Five of <i>Queer Eye
            for the Straight Guy</i>.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Which brings us to the other big
            thing about this movie, as I noticed from the trusting souls
            trudging their way out of the theater as the end credits came
            shrieking up -- the movie doesn't entertain us; it works us over. At
            regular intervals, we're smacked in the face by violently
            put-together montages depicting Lord-knows-what, in the same way
            someone gets water thrown in their face to bring them back to
            consciousness before the next piece of torture is administered. It's
            enough to make people forget why they go to the movies in the first
            place.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
