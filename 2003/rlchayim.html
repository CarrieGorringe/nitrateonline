            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>, 7 February 2003</i></font><p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like the swamps on which the 
			Siberian town Birobidzhan was built, Yale Strom's latest documentary
			<i>L'Chayim, Comrade Stalin!</i> is mired in mediocrity. Strom, an 
			accomplished musician and klezmer revivalist, has made better films 
			(particularly <i>Carpati: 50 Miles, 50 Years</i>), but has failed to 
			provide his new outing with much inspiration in telling the story of 
			founding of the first Jewish homeland.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">God Forsaken are the two words that 
			come to mind in describing the harsh, wintry climate where thousands 
			of Russian Jews, and many from elsewhere around the world—including 
			the United States -- immigrated beginning in 1928.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Being Jewish myself and an avid 
			genealogist interested in my own roots, I am fascinated by what 
			should be a truly remarkable story of families dispatched to this 
			far end of the world. Unfortunately the cover director Strom has 
			wrapped around it is gray and threadbare. Wearing my other glove, as 
			a film reviewer, I must admit this is not terribly interesting 
			filmmaking. <i>L'Chayim, Comrade </i>Stalin is a rambling of still 
			photos, old newsreels, documentaries, propaganda films, poorly lit 
			and audibly scratchy reminiscences -- in English, Yiddish, and 
			Russian, nearly all with heavy subtitling -- and street interviews 
			(many with people who appear to be latent anti-Semites). I couldn't 
			focus on whether this was a socialist cant or a self-purging, 
			experimental road movie. Particularly irksome is the constant, and 
			occasionally subliminal visual peppering of a blood-red reminder 
			that we must remember &quot;The Jewish Question.&quot; Once was enough, twice 
			okay, but ten or more such flashings and I was ready to scream.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In a nutshell, Joseph Stalin and 
			his merry Commu-men established the Jewish Autonomous Region (JAR) 
			in the late 1920s, two decades before Palestine became the State of 
			Israel and usurped the homeland title. In March 2000, director Strom 
			retraced the steps of many Jews seven decades earlier, traveling 
			from Moscow east on a seven-day (three days less than his subjects) 
			journey to a 13,900-square-mile region established to serve the 
			socialist leader's battle to ease anti-Semitism, improve relations 
			with the West, and strengthen the borders from possible Chinese or 
			Japanese invasion. The Yiddish culture thrived as 45,000 Jews 
			resettled here, but the communal project came to a crashing halt 
			with Stalin's terrorist, anti-Semitic purges from the late 1940s 
			through the early 1950s. Still, despite their cultural expulsion a 
			half-century ago, some 6,000 Jews still thrive in the area 
			surrounding Birobidzhan, capitol of the J.A.R., as evidenced by the 
			film's extended musical celebrations by the religiously-strong 
			residents.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What could have been a 
			forcefully-framed subject instead meanders around the Siberian 
			countryside for ninety minutes, stuck in ancestral swamplands and 
			unsupported by Ron Perlman's bland narration. Audiences hoping to 
			welcome another film based on Strom's well-respected cinematic 
			bloodline will be bidding <i>L'Chayim Comrade Stalin</i> an 
			unfortunate <b><i>shalom</i></b> (good bye).</font></td>
