			Liar<br>
            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>,
            2 May 2003</i></font><p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The 
			documentary <i>Fellini: I'm a Born Liar</i> is perhaps best enjoyed 
			as a fabulous tale told by an expert and highly adept con man. 
			Damian Pettigrew filmed Federico Fellini speaking, at length, about 
			his life and career in 1992, one year before the director's death, 
			and the results are dazzling and, sometimes, Laocoönian in their 
			twists and turns: a filmmaker who professes never to look at his own 
			films, and, when he does, wonders who other than himself could have 
			made these; who says that, once he starts work on the set, someone 
			else takes control and he must put himself at the service of this 
			&quot;mysterious stranger&quot;; an artist who claims to wanting to be 
			&quot;authentic&quot; in his work, yet finds artificial renditions of places 
			and events hold more meaning to him than the actual things 
			themselves.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Fellini says he strives to have a 
			&quot;harmonious&quot; set that will facilitate inspiration and creative 
			freedom, yet disdains &quot;improvisation&quot; -- even though his filmmaking 
			collaborators say that his whole directoral style is 
			&quot;improvisatory&quot;. The contradictions are sometimes dazzling: Fellini 
			speaks about how he &quot;adores&quot; actors one moment, than in the next 
			refers to them as &quot;puppets&quot; (not the first time we hear this word in 
			the documentary, and not from the same person). This apparently 
			works fine with inexperienced actors such as Hiram Keller and Martin 
			Potter, whom, in behind-the-scenes footage, we see being minutely 
			choreographed, movement by movement, by the &quot;maestro&quot; while filming 
			a scene for <i>Satyricon</i> (1969). Donald Sutherland, on the other 
			hand. describes with complete lucidity how Fellini behaved on the 
			set of <i>Casanova</i> (1976) -- a &quot;martinet&quot;, a &quot;Tartar&quot;, a 
			&quot;dictator&quot;, a &quot;demon&quot; -- and that the first five weeks of shooting 
			were &quot;hell on earth&quot;. (And Sutherland would be stuck working a total 
			of 150 days on the film before it was completed. He was not 
			Fellini's first choice for the role, and -- along with the fact that 
			Fellini was forced to make the film in English, and using direct 
			sound, neither of which he'd done before -- Sutherland suffered 
			because of it). By contrast, Roberto Benigni, who starred in 
			Fellini's last film, <b><i>La Voce della Luna</i></b> (1990), says 
			the director was bounteously supportive and treated him like &quot;a real 
			actor&quot;. Terence Stamp, who appeared in <i>Toby Dammit</i>, the 
			episode Fellini made for <i>Spirits of the Dead</i> (1968), 
			describes how he showed up for the first day of filming -- the scene 
			where Toby arrives at an airport in Rome -- and had to ask Fellini 
			for at least a little direction to get going. Fellini provided it, 
			describing, in detail, a sex-booze-and-drugs fueled party -- or, as 
			Stamp says Fellini called it, a &quot;h'orgy&quot; -- Toby would have 
			participated in back in London the night before. It worked: Stamp 
			gives Toby the exact, perfect look of desiccation needed to set the 
			tone of the film.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Avoiding a didactic approach, 
			Pettigrew layers in the material that he has collected for the 
			documentary -- an approach which allows him to include a comment by 
			author Italo Calvino on how, from a psychological standpoint, lies 
			are often more interesting than the truth -- and which includes 
			interviews with many of Fellini's collaborators, associates, and 
			friends, as well as film showing the director at work on <i>Amarcord</i> 
			(1973), <i>Casanova</i>, directing Marcello Mastroianni in <i>City 
			of Women</i> (1980), Alain Cuny in <b><i>La Dolce Vita</i></b> 
			(1960), Giulietta Masina in <i>Juliet of the Spirits</i> (1965), and 
			Edra Gale, who played the benevolent, voluptuous giantess Saraghina, 
			in <i>8 1/2</i> (1963). Footage from the T.V. special <i>A 
			Director's Notebook</i> (1969) shows one of the gigantic sets built 
			for Fellini's big, unrealized project <i>The Voyage of G. Mastorna</i>, 
			as well as Mastroianni costumed as the title character, a cellist 
			who finds his passenger air flight re-routed to land in a locale 
			that turns out to be increasingly unreal and strange. A sudden, near 
			fatal, medical ailment forced Fellini to cancel making the film, but 
			he continued trying to get it made -- even though, as Sutherland 
			observes, making a film which is essentially a metaphor about death 
			meant that Fellini, had he made it, would have emerged at the end a 
			different person. (Pettigrew follows this with footage from a key 
			scene in <i>Juliet of the Spirits</i>, in which the heroine is given 
			an opportunity to experience new things, but declines, deciding she 
			would rather stay the way she was.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Fellini could recreate the Adriatic 
			in a studio, as production designer Dante Ferretti describes, when, 
			going to see the actual thing, he decides it doesn't look the way he 
			wants it to look in his film; or instruct an actor to pace back and 
			forth before the camera, counting, and then just dub in the dialogue 
			needed later in post-production. (I never really believed this to be 
			true, until Pettigrew produces footage showing actors doing just 
			that for Fellini on both <i>Amarcord</i> and <i>Satyricon</i>.) But, 
			as painter Rinaldo Geleng, who befriended Fellini in Rome during the 
			1940s, tells Pettigrew, by practicing his art, Fellini was revealing 
			himself. Fellini may tell Pettigrew that, in marrying Giuletta 
			Masina, he found a true, companionable and &quot;just&quot; partner. But it is 
			known that Masina, for whatever reason, walked away from her acting 
			career when it was at its height to become Signora Fellini 
			full-time. And, for <i>8 1/2</i>, Fellini cast Anouk Aimée to play 
			the wife of Mastroianni's character Guido, then cropped the actress' 
			hair short and gave her an unflattering pair of horizontal 
			spectacles to wear. In a scene from the film, she's seen cackling 
			and telling Guido that she could never leave him -- not because it 
			would make him look ridiculous, but because he was ridiculous, 
			period.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">However, Fellini's methods could 
			also produce art, even poetry: the scene on the bridge in <i>Toby 
			Dammit</i>; the moment when Claudia Cardinale first appears, 
			smiling, radiant, rushing forward with hands outstretched, palms 
			turned outward, in <i>8 1/2</i>; the motorcyclists who roar through 
			the nighttime streets at the conclusion of <b><i>Roma</i></b> 
			(1972), to name just a few. What continues to make Fellini's best 
			films exciting is the way he can take elements that may seem 
			initially arbitrary and turn them into something that becomes 
			ultimately meaningful to us, often in unexpected ways, such as how 
			the promenade that concludes <i>8 1/2</i> ends on an inexplicable, 
			yet moving, note. Pettigrew does not, fortunately, show us the T.V. 
			commercial work Fellini had to do during some dry spells in the 
			1980s (the Campari ads are, trust me, not very good). While he 
			embraced the counterculture movement of the 'Sixties and early 
			'Seventies, Fellini blamed the rise of &quot;youth culture&quot; as being part 
			of the cause for his career downturn in the Eighties -- <i>City of 
			Women</i> includes a scene showing young, pudgy-faced girls 
			listening to rock music, twitching and moaning, like Regan in <i>The 
			Exorcist</i>. In <b><i>La Voce della Luna</i></b>, Roberto Benigni 
			plays a man who confuses the face of the moon with that of the woman 
			he loves -- eventually, the two become one, up in the sky, forever 
			unattainable. Benigni's character asks to, at least, be told what 
			the secret to happiness on earth is. The woman replies, alright, 
			she'll tell him, but, first, &quot;Publicità!&quot; (And now, a word from our 
			sponsor....)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Pettigrew's documentary is, 
			noticeably, short on the work Fellini did prior to <b><i>La Dolce 
			Vita </i></b>in 1960 -- eight films, including two which made 
			Giuletta Masina an internationally renowned star, as well as working 
			as a co-screenwriter on several films for Roberto Rossellini. This 
			may be due in part to the fact that Fellini doesn't mention them 
			himself during the interviews with Pettigrew -- he mentions only the 
			title of his great 1953 film <b><i>I Vitteloni</i></b> in passing -- 
			and, probably, in part because of the effect &quot;La Dolce Vita&quot; had on 
			both his professional and personal life. The film was hugely 
			successful, both in Italy and abroad, and garnered the first of four 
			Best Director Oscar nominations for Fellini. On the other hand, in 
			the ultra-politicized Italy of the 1960s, it was actively condemned 
			by the Catholic Church, the government, and, most cuttingly, in 
			Fellini's own home town of Rimini.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I often had a natural inclination 
			to invent for myself a relationship to my family, to women, to life. 
			I was always inventing,&quot; Fellini tells Pettigrew. &quot;For me, the 
			things that are most real are the ones I invent....&quot;&nbsp; So, using the 
			&quot;mathematical&quot; precision of an artist who is both a &quot;medium&quot; and a 
			&quot;craftsman&quot;, Fellini recreates his home town in films such as 
			&quot;Amarcord&quot;, and the reconstruction becomes &quot;much more of a part of 
			my life than the real town of Rimini....&quot;&nbsp; That town vanishes, and 
			the phantasmagoria -- the <b><i>autostradas</i></b>, the circus 
			rings, the stadiums filled with women, the sunken airliners sending 
			up &quot;radioactive signals&quot;, the houses of painted plastics filled with 
			distorted memories and grotesque hallucinations -- began to unfurl 
			and take over from there on.</font></td>
