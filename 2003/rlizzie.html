			Movie<br>
            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia Fuchs</a>,
            2 May 2003</i></font>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="5">Better Than One
			</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700">
			<font size="2">In 1999, Jim Fall directed <i>Trick</i>, featuring a 
			dear, campy bit by Tori Spelling. The following year, he directed 
			TV's <i>Grosse Pointe</i>, a campy love letter to Aaron Spelling's 
			primetime soaps. Whether this one-two punch was a coincidence or 
			not, it makes clear that the man has certain predilections, among 
			them, a contagious delight in glorious affectation. </font></span>
			</p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Now, he's 
			directed Lizzie McGuire's transition from her enormously popular 
			Disney TV series to her likely-to-do-just-fine Disney movie. Their 
			pairing is more productive than you might imagine, but mostly, it's 
			vaguely perverse (though not enough that any Lizzie fan or her 
			parents will be troubled). Lizzie (the near-painfully adorable 
			Hilary Duff, who showed up at a premiere with the equally pretty 
			Aaron Carter) is perfectly straight, as stereotypically next-door 
			dreamy as any girl could be, she has a bit of excess about her. In 
			the sitcom, this is made visible in her alter-ego, Animated Lizzie, 
			who says what's on her mind, even as Live Lizzie smiles, bites her 
			lip and scrunches her nose, and smiles some more. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The movie 
			doubles this doubleness. When fifteen-year-old Lizzie goes to Rome 
			on a school trip, she meets a much-adored Italian pop star named 
			Isabella (also played by Duff, with dark wig and Italiana accenta). 
			At first, Isabella appropriately appears only on billboards, as 
			fantasy to be gazed on by Lizzie and her classmates, primarily nice 
			boy Gordo (Adam Lamberg) and mean (or maybe just competitive) girl 
			Kate (Ashlie Brillault). Miranda (Lalaine) apparently couldn't make 
			it for the movie, though Lizzie and Gordo mention her name and 
			status -- as Lizzie's &quot;girl best friend&quot; -- before they board the 
			plane and never look back.</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">On that plane 
			and again in Rome, the kids engage in repeated 
			running-time-expanding montages, in which Lizzie and whoever look up 
			at the sights and smile, little takes of beaming faces accompanied 
			by a pop tune. While these sequences offer a few touristy glimpses 
			of Roman scenery, they helpfully underline the film's </font></span>
			<b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">raison 
			d'être</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">, 
			to showcase Duff's high-voltage appeal and admirable enthusiasm.
			</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">This is made 
			clear as soon as Lizzie steps foot outside the hotel, and is 
			mistaken for Isabella by excited fans. At this moment, Lizzie plays 
			both fan (of a star she's not yet heard sing) and star, an 
			admittedly odd duality she handles with smiley aplomb. She's aided 
			in the fan part when she meets Isabella's singing partner, the 
			so-cute-he-might-break Paolo (Yani Gellman). Struck by the 
			similarity in appearance between Lizzie and his absent collaborator, 
			he convinces her to sneak off from her group to meet him at the 
			Trevi Fountain. Eventually, he lets drop the other shoe: he needs a 
			replacement for Isabella at the International Music Video Awards. 
			His reason is fishy from jump (Isabella's on an island, the company 
			will sue if they don't appear), and continues to mutate over the 
			next few days. Lizzie, an endearingly gullible girl looking for 
			adventure in Rome, believes him. And so, her adventure begins.
			</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The bulk of 
			this flimsy film focuses on 1) Lizzie's pretense of illness in front 
			of chaperone Miss Ungermeyer (Alex Borstein, weirdly channeling 
			Christian Slater); 2) efforts by Lizzie's truly annoying little 
			brother, Matt (Jake Thomas), to thwart her good time, from way back 
			in the States, where he monitors her activities on his iBook; and 3) 
			Lizzie's ecstatic moments with Paolo, as he drives her from monument 
			to outdoor market to fireworks on his motorbike, usually in montage 
			format, with a bouncy beat on the soundtrack (my favorite was 
			Vitamin C's weak cover of &quot;Volare&quot;). Lizzie is relentlessly charming 
			throughout, even as she somehow misses Gordo's obvious misery at her 
			distractedness. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The movie gives 
			her all kinds of reasons to be so distracted. Paolo's suggestion 
			that Lizzie can be a pop star, even for a night, surely accommodates 
			lots of girls' dreams. Tween Queen Duff makes this work because, for 
			all her celebrity as Lizzie, she yet resembles a more or less 
			&quot;regular&quot; girl, incarnating a healthy mix of sincerity and 
			giddiness, fandom and stardom. Lizzie's first appearance in the 
			movie named for her conveys this mix: while Matt surreptitiously 
			videotapes her (so your view of her seems somehow &quot;furtive&quot;), she 
			bounces along in a corny lip-sync performance with her hairbrush s 
			mic, bobbing her head to the beat of &quot;The Tide is High (Get the 
			Feeling).&quot; Charismatic and amateurish as any tweeny girl might be, 
			she's a far cry from a similar scene in <i>Crossroads</i>, where 
			Britney lip-syncs to Madonna (somehow, Britney doesn't look like an 
			amateur, though she tries really, really hard). </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Lizzie's lack 
			of expertise -- her notoriously appealing clumsiness -- makes her 
			efforts to perform like a pop star doubly delightful (at least in 
			the eyes of her fans, the eyes that count). She stumbles, she 
			giggles, she revels in her own ordinariness. Lizzie beams her way 
			through a learning-the-dance-steps montage, as well as a more 
			elaborate dress-up sequence. Here, Lizzie pretends to be Isabella at 
			an outrageously grandiose dress designer's studio. The designer 
			sniffs at her &quot;new&quot; appearance (&quot;She looks like a school girl!&quot;), 
			but goes along, as do the numerous assistants who feed her pastries 
			and juices on silver trays, while poofing her hair and applying 
			makeup to her perfect features. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">And Lizzie/Duff 
			is wonderfully game, teetering down a runway in a series of in an 
			increasingly bizarre series of dresses -- an inflatable igloo 
			number, one that lights up, and another getup where she literally 
			wears a tabloid magazine on her head. After surviving all this, 
			under Taylor Dayne's cover of &quot;Supermodel,&quot; Lizzie emerges suddenly 
			confident. &quot;Goodbye Lizzie McGuire, hello Fabulous!&quot; she exults, as 
			if there's a difference between the two. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">This crazy 
			campy bit is only the precursor for the film's most lunatic moment, 
			when Lizzie, as she must, meets Isabella. Returning from her 
			&quot;island&quot; at film's end, Isabella tossing her ringlets and flaunting 
			her nutty accenta, embraces Lizzie as someone she can trust like her 
			own self (which, of course, she can). The split screen gimmick and 
			the blond-brunette face-off may recall (for the parents of targeted 
			viewers) the wildly campy confrontations between Samantha and Serena 
			in <i>Bewitched</i> or Jeannie and Evil Jeannie in <i>I Dream of 
			Jeannie</i>. But here the close encounter -- Duff meets Duff -- is 
			not about catty fighting or subterfuge. Here it's all about 
			self-love and girl bonding. This results in <i>The Lizzie McGuire 
			Movie</i>'s most plainly delirious and multiple doublemint moment, a 
			poppy romantic duet called &quot;What Dreams Are Made Of.&quot; Who needs 
			Animated Lizzie when you can sing and dance with yourself and, even 
			better, give yourself a hug? </font></span></td>
