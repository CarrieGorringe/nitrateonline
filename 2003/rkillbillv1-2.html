            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>You
            don't know the name of the Bride (Uma Thurman). You do know that
            she's the number one killer in <i>Kill Bill Vol. 1</i>, that she
            used to be called Black Mamba, back in the days when she killed for
            Bill (David Carradine), as part of a crew called the Deadly Viper
            Assassination Squad (DiVAS). You know Bill tried to kill her in
            Texas, that she was pregnant at the time, that it was her wedding
            day. But you don't know her name. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It
            hardly matters. The Bride has awakened from a four-year coma, and
            spends the duration of <i>Kill Bill</i> hunting down and killing her
            enemies. That is the plot and that is her character, distilled and
            intangible, singular and unfathomable. Indeed, the Bride is offered
            as a kind of essence of cinema, the vital baseline of vengeance,
            meticulous brutality, balletic violence, and urgent, endless
            tragedy. Granted, the concept is as abstract and pretentious as any
            Tarantino has conjured, but in practice, Thurman is so utterly
            physical in her every moment on screen that you can't help but feel
            for her. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Just
            what you'll be feeling is up for grabs. The Bride is alternately a
            hard case and vulnerable, cunning and exquisite -- as each of these
            attributes are connected, both in girls' myths and girls'
            experiences. She first appears -- following an epigraph that seems
            cute, but also lays out the film's aesthetic and thematic focus
            (&quot;Revenge is a dish best served cold -- Old Klingon
            proverb&quot;), in a tight black and white close-up, her face
            bruised and welted, slick with sweat and blood. Bill (mostly off
            camera, his hand only visible) leans down to wipe her cheek,
            tenderly. &quot;Do you find me sadistic?&quot; he asks, then
            asserts, &quot;There is nothing sadistic in my actions... This is me
            at my most masochistic.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Cut
            to opening credits: &quot;The Fourth Film by Quentin Tarantino&quot;
            (in case anyone's keeping count). While it invites you to link Bill
            with the maestro QT, to see similarities in their campy
            malevolences, <i>Kill Bill</i> doesn't so much preempt criticism as
            overdetermines it. If Tarantino identifies with his girl
            protagonists (he tells the <i>New York Times</i>' Mim Udovitch,
            &quot;It just hurts more to see two women fighting&quot;), he also
            famously fixates on fundamental genre conventions (spaghetti
            Westerns, blaxploitation, kung fu, grindhouse), as these produce
            expectations and visceral pleasures. This combination of elements --
            sensational women and sensational violence -- results in a loopy
            bricolagey vision that does occasionally hurt. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            its title announces, the new movie is knowingly, gloriously violent,
            a series of fight scenes functioning as dance numbers in a musical
            -- they build as much character as the film will allow. Tarantino
            explains it to <i>Vibe</i>'s Harry Allen: &quot;An action sequence
            well done on film is like listening to a symphony. And when the
            symphony builds up to a certain point, it explodes. That's why you
            go to the symphony&quot; (November 2003). And that's why you go to
            an action movie, to thrill to the art. Even if the rationale sounds
            self-serving, the point is raucously illustrated in <i>Kill Bill</i>,
            which features one &quot;explosion&quot; after another (limbs hacked
            off, blood gushing, heads soaring through the night air); this
            series of climaxes is punctuated by occasional, exceedingly delicate
            pauses in the action, as well as and RZA's perfect, sinuous score. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">While
            her rhythms are surely accelerated, the Bride recalls the Man With
            No Name, in anonymity, reluctance, and relentlessness. At the same
            time, she is fundamentally different, compelled by the loss of her
            baby and gender-specific violations that lead to precisely
            calculated paybacks, haunted by regret even as she exacts her
            justice. And so, when the Bride wakes from her coma in a hospital
            and learns her comatose body has been pimped out by a scuzzy orderly
            (Mike Bowen), apparently for years, retribution is swift and
            horrifically fitting; afterwards, she drives off in his cheesy
            yellow mini-pickup, the Pussy Wagon. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Breaking
            her quest into nonsequential chapters, <i>Vol. 1</i> has the Bride
            visiting vengeance upon two (out of four) Vipers. Her first stop in
            the film (though the second on her list of targets, crossed off with
            colored pens) is Pasadena, home of Vernita Green, formerly
            Copperhead (Vivica A. Fox) and currently mother to a four-year-old.
            Ferociously cut and choreographed, the throwdown is briefly
            interrupted by little Nikki's return from school. Quite literally,
            they're frozen: the yellow school bus pulls up, the child gets off
            and trundles up the walkway, equipped with her animal-shaped
            backpack, framed by the window just behind the women, paused.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            the girl steps inside (&quot;Mommy, I'm home&quot;), the combatants
            hide their shiny knives behind their backs, the camera low behind
            them to underscore the battle's fallout: shattered glass, smashed
            furniture, splattered blood. Vernita sends Nikki upstairs (&quot;Me
            and mommy's friend have grown up talk to talk about&quot;), and the
            women briefly pretend civility before the fight ends, horribly, the
            body left sprawled on the kitchen floor for the child to
            contemplate. Though the Bride insists, &quot;Your mother had it
            coming,&quot; she allows that the costs of killing can be severe:
            &quot;When you grow up, if you still feel raw about it, I'll be
            waiting.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            point is reinforced in the story of another adversary, O-Ren Ishii,
            a.k.a. Cottonmouth, Chinese-Japanese-American head of Tokyo's yakuza
            underworld. Rendered in spectacular anime by Production I.G., this
            chapter shows O-Ren's originary trauma, hiding under her parents'
            bed during their grisly murders, her mother's blood dripping onto
            her face, each red drop sealing her own vengeance trip. When she
            grows up to be Lucy Liu, O-Ren takes on minions, including the
            chilling Sophie Fatale (Julie Dreyfus), the Kato-masked Johnny Mo
            (Gordon Liu), and especially, the schoolgirl GoGo Yubari (Chiaki
            Kuriyama), whose skills with a mace ensure the Bride's excruciating
            pain during a 20-minute showdown at the House of Blue Leaves. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            film's fights are choreographed according to Japanese and Chinese
            forms, by Sonny Chiba (who plays ninjitsu master Hattori Hanzo in
            one chapter) and by the ever-innovative Yuen Woo-Ping, with
            attention to stylistic differences that will only be meaningful to
            those who know. This is surely a crucial part of <i>Kill Bill</i>'s
            kick, its visible display of affection for the hardcore fans who,
            like Tarantino, appreciate (even lust after) such particulars. At
            the same time, it works as the sort of film it emulates, fragments,
            and pieces back together, a genre picture that loves its surfaces. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">And
            in still another way, it works as a breakdown of movies-as-culture,
            especially the bodies that remain integral, even despite animation
            and digital effects. This is a movie about bodies, about what hurts
            them on screen and in viewing spaces. Ripping off and rearranging
            moves, ideas, and codes from seemingly countless sources, <i>Kill
            Bill</i> is a careful film that looks glib, a nuanced film that
            looks shallow. Violence fills up its flamboyant facade, but the
            Bride's pulse beats just below. <o:p>
