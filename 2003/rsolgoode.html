            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Sol (Balthazar Getty) is a guy
            who lives in Los Angeles, can't get steady work as an actor, can't
            get a job to support himself by other means, but is legendary among
            friends and female acquaintances. Exactly how he got that way is a
            little difficult to discern in <i>Sol Goode</i>, even though the
            film is sporadically very funny, more so than a lot of other
            comedies that have come out over the last fourteen months.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">One of the things the film has
            going for it how it shows men frankly competing for attention from
            the opposite sex, and how they can often look incredibly foolish
            while doing so. One of Sol's friends, Cooper (played by the film's
            writer/director, Danny Comden), is obsessed with making sure that
            his hair looks okay -- he's so obsessed with the overall
            &quot;look&quot; he projects that he sometimes fails to notice how
            individual aspects, like a see-through nylon shirt or cribbing by
            using a little eye-liner under his eyes, can glaringly stand out
            over everything else when seen from another person's perspective.
            Justin (Jamie Kennedy), who shares a suburban house with Sol, has
            set his sights upon his commitment to getting married to Brenda
            (Natasha Gregson Wagner), so much so that he's failing to see that
            he's about to become betrothed to a harridan: he doesn't want to
            spoil things by complaining about her controlling behavior, while
            her alternately controlling, then comforting, responses indicate
            that she's gradually learning how to wrap him around her finger.
            (Justin's also getting it on the other end at work, where he toils
            as an assistant to a talent agent, played by Cheri Oteri, who puts
            the fear of God into both her employees and, also, some of her
            clients.) It's the kind of doomed-to-fail relationship that is
            obvious to the outside observer, unless you happen to be <i>in</i>
            the relationship, and Justin's eventual emancipation (and the way
            Kennedy plays it) is one of the most exhilarating things in the
            film.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The subplot involving Justin and
            Brenda turns out to be one of the best things in <i>Sol Goode</i>,
            which, to its credit, tries to expand to accommodate a number of
            plot threads and characters in order to give the film more scope and
            substance. Instead, it tends to diminish the film's overall effect
            and focus. The men may act like mature <i>men</i> rather than
            adolescents (a big difference in U.S. film comedy, nowadays), but
            some of the plotlines peter out badly, such as the one where
            Johnathon Schaech plays a Texas cousin of Sol's who shows up out of
            the blue for a visit, and amazes everyone by confirming reports of
            his Dirk Diggler-like endowment -- although his ability to attract
            women has more to do with the fact that he's sweet-natured and
            attentive. What concerns everyone about Sol is that he's never had a
            long-standing relationship with a woman -- he wants to live life
            scot-free, and he's worked out an elaborate scheme regarding how to
            deal with such things as making sure he's never caught in a
            situation where he's caught having to respond one way or another to
            a girl asking him to call her as she's going out the door. The heart
            of the film's story has to do with Sol's beginning to get the
            nagging feeling that he doesn't want to do this any more, and he
            keeps his romantic life strictly separate from his friendship with
            Chloe, who, the moment she turns up in the personage of actress
            Katharine Towne, you know will prove to be the answer to Sol's
            problems -- he can relax around her and just &quot;talk&quot;, for
            instance. How they'll end up together, though, doesn't hold any
            mystery in the film, it just seems like an inevitability waiting to
            happen.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It might've been less so if
            Balthazar Getty were more convincing as a guy who gets continually
            recognized (and in a good way) by attractive women. Getty is a
            perfectly fine actor, and he tries hard, but while he has a hard
            masculine quality, he doesn't exactly come off like, say, a young
            Warren Beatty (Beatty had a combination of masculinity and
            sensuality, which makes a difference) -- when Getty crooks an
            eyebrow towards a woman, I would think the first thing that would go
            through most women's minds would be to check their pocketbooks. But
            this is more a matter of casting. The picture is worth checking out
            for Katharine Towne, who is just about perfect as Chloe -- she's not
            a pushover, can give as good as she gets, is straightforward, yet
            she has a warm and inviting quality, and she makes the question of
            whether her character will find a true and lasting love by the end
            of the movie a vital one. The picture itself also manages to spring
            at least one really good plot turn by the time it is over -- so that
            <i>Sol Goode</i> emerges, very respectably, as a pretty good try.</font></td>
