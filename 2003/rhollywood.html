            sequence of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Hollywood Homicide</i>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As grizzled
            detective Joe Gavilan, Harrison Ford is instantly recognizable even
            though it's the first time he's actually showed his age in a film.
            Despite the gray hairs, Gavilan still wields a pistol with
            intimidating finesse. Every shot is a direct hit to the appropriate
            parts of the target. There's a hint of authenticity because all the
            cops in this target practice session wear earplugs.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">That sense of
            realism vanishes when we see Joe's partner K.C. Calden (Josh
            Hartnett) take his shots. The neophyte detective misses with every
            shot he fires. Gavilan gets so annoyed that he starts shooting at
            Calden's target almost out of spite.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The sequence is
            mildly amusing, but it leaves viewers with a nagging &quot;yeah,
            right&quot; feeling that lingers throughout the film. A quick call
            to my library and a visit to the LAPD’s official web site
            indicates their cops are tested for a minimum level of competency
            with a pistol. Police cadets without this proficiency probably
            aren’t asked to apply. It’s hard to set an appropriate mood when
            filmmakers go to the trouble of making sure that target practice
            features real ergonomic devices like earplugs but strain credibility
            for the sake of a joke that elicits just a few giggles. If you’re
            going to risk suspension of disbelief, it had better be damn funny.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There’s a
            clever, quirky movie eagerly trying to emerge from <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Hollywood
            Homicide</i>. Co-Writer and Director Ron Shelton’s films often
            focus on aspects of his character’s professions that don’t get
            covered in movies. In <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Bull
            Durham</i>, viewers get to hear baseball players’ inner thoughts
            or get to hear them do surprising but credible things like debate
            the merits of Susan Sontag’s novels. In <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Hollywood
            Homicide</i>, the story spends as much time following the cops on
            their moonlighting gigs as their case. It’s no secret that cops
            receive unfairly paltry salaries. Gavilan tries to make ends meet
            through real estate deals, while Calden teaches yoga. The latter’s
            side gig has an almost magnetic effect on women even though he
            can’t remember their names. This trait bodes poorly for his
            ambitions to be an actor.Gavilan lacks his partner’s female
            adoration, but after a series of disastrous marriages, he’s taken
            up with a radio psychic (Lena Olin).<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The moonlighting
            gags might seem a little silly (Gavilan negotiates home sales in the
            middle of high-speed chases), but co-writer Robert Souza has
            actually served as one of LA’s finest and probably knows things
            that movies often ignore. The most entertaining moments in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Hollywood Homicide</i> occur during these scenes. Calden and his
            witnesses, who also long to be stars, sometimes trade scripts for 8&quot;
            by 10&quot;s, and Ford shows some unexpected comic timing when he
            tries to juggle a home sale with an Internal Affairs investigation<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ford looks like
            he’s actually enjoying the change of pace, so it’s a shame that
            Hartnett seems to be spending the flick trying to catch up with him.
            He isn’t helped by the fact that his character is stuck with a few
            too many cop movie clichés. Yes, Calden’s father was a policeman
            who died in the line of duty, and one of the other characters in
            film later turns out to be responsible.</font><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></i></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hollywood
            Homicide</font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2"> really loses its
            footing when it tries too diligently to be a conventional police
            drama. The two partners’ other jobs have irked Internal Affairs,
            particularly a bitter fellow named Bennie Macko (Bruce Greenwood, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">13
            Days</i>).<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Keeping Macko off
            their cases is enough of a hassle, but the two are also
            investigating a deadly nightclub shooting that may involve a
            prominent record company owner (Isaiah Washington).</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent:0in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            obviousness of this guy’s guilt (he’s clearly modeled after Suge
            Knight) blunts the narrative. There’s no tension to at all.
            Unfortunately, because this is a Harrison Ford movie, there almost
            seems to be a contractual obligation to stick in protracted action
            scenes. It’s a rare flick that gets dull during the car chases. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Hollywood
            Homicide</i> manages because it really doesn’t do anything new<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent:0in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Coming
            out on the heels of the more creative and adrenaline-pumping vehicle
            pursuits in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Matrix
            Reloaded</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Italian
            Job</i> does not help, and having the chase barreling through the
            same Hollywood Boulevard and Highland location of the latter film
            exacerbates the déjà vu.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoBodyTextIndent" style="text-indent:0in"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Shelton
            has a gift for creating off-kilter characters (like Rosie Perez’s
            as the quiz show-obsessed girlfriend in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">White
            Men Can’t Jump</i>), and both he and Ford could have put it to
            much better use. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Hollywood Homicide</i> inadvertently proves that eye candy can be less
            interesting than believable people.</font></td>
