			</font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			Nicholas Schager,
            2 May 2003</i></font><p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Phillip Seymour Hoffman might 
			yet become the Gene Hackman of his generation. The actor certainly 
			has <i>The French Connection</i> star’s versatility, able to exude 
			smug narcissism and blustery arrogance as comfortably as he embodies 
			raging alienation and introverted timidity. But one hopes that on 
			his way to acting greatness, this riveting rotund performer 
			continues to allow himself the freedom to indulge in the wide 
			variety of characters his canon thus far includes – that the same 
			actor could portray an ultra-creepy stalker in Todd Solondz’s <i>
			Happiness</i> and a humane bedside nurse in Paul Thomas Anderson’s
			<i>Magnolia</i> in less than a year’s time speaks to the actor’s 
			elasticity. Hoffman slides easily enough from big-budget films (<i>Red 
			Dragon</i>, <i>Patch Adams</i>) to more edgy independent material, 
			and this delicate balancing act suits the actor like a glove. Yet in
			<i>Happiness</i>, as well as Anderson’s <i>Boogie Nights</i> and 
			last year’s <i>Love Liza</i>, Hoffmann has displayed a willingness 
			(and desire) to supplement his steady stream of mainstream 
			blockbuster fare with films that allow him to play men whose stunted 
			maturity and desperate, frequently repressed longings make them 
			dangerously unstable. He’s an actor who frequently seems most at 
			home not with a smile on his face – although his smile is one of 
			cinema’s most refreshing – but with a disquietingly furrowed brow 
			and tightly pursed lips.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This penchant for sad-sack losers 
			continues with the actor’s latest effort, Richard Kwietniowski’s <i>
			Owning Mahowny</i>. As bland and calculating as the character 
			Hoffman plays, the film recounts the true life saga of Dan Mahowny, 
			a mild-mannered bank executive who, in 1980-1982 Toronto, stole 
			millions of dollars from his place of employment in order to feed an 
			insatiable gambling habit. Mahowny was a numbers whiz, but while one 
			would assume that his professional success would translate well to 
			the games of chance and skill offered by Atlantic City and Las 
			Vegas, the bank superstar – we’re told early on that he’s the 
			youngest executive in the firm’s history – was an awful gambler. 
			Obsessed with taking the action on virtually any sporting activity 
			around (from baseball and basketball to Canadian Football League 
			games), Mahowny bet not for the pleasure of success or the thrill of 
			monetary riches, but out of sheer compulsion. Watching him win (and, 
			more often, lose) thousands of dollars per minute at a craps table, 
			a look of stern, intractable determination glossing over any hint of 
			excitement or disappointment on his face, is to see a man trapped in 
			the throes of addiction.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In Hoffman’s hands, Mahowny is a 
			cipher; while his pretty bank teller girlfriend Belinda refers to 
			her beau as “wild man” early on, one quickly surmises the irony in 
			such a comment. Mahowny is far from rowdy, and his foray into 
			stealing money from large personal accounts in order to clear debts 
			to bookie Frank Perlin (Maury Chaykin) – while clearly irrational 
			and born out of desperation – is nonetheless performed with the 
			inexpressiveness of an automaton. The only time Hoffman allows the 
			character to let loose with some feeling is during frenzied moments 
			in which his wagers have turned sour and his franticly obsessive 
			impulses rise up to the surface. Otherwise, however, it’s Hoffman 
			the Great doing Hoffman the Familiar. No one expresses mundane 
			turmoil the way Hoffman does, and yet one all-too-frequently gets 
			the impression that the actor is on auto pilot throughout <i>Owning 
			Mahowny</i>, capably but unenthusiastically handling a role that he 
			could play in his sleep.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Maurice Chauvet’s screenplay (based 
			on the book <i>Stung</i> by Gary Stephen Ross) takes its time with 
			Mahowny’s story, detailing his dealings with Perlin, his failing 
			romance with Belinda, and his unhealthy relationship with Atlantic 
			City casino owner Victor Foss (John Hurt) – whose eyes light up with 
			dollar signs every time Mahowny walks through his doors – with care 
			and compassion. The film’s sympathy for Mahowny is subtly 
			underscored by a refusal to glorify the man’s dubious 
			accomplishments (which culminate in a theft of mind-boggling size 
			and stupidity). When Mahowny neglects his girlfriend and houseguests 
			to watch a college basketball game he’s placed big money on, the 
			look of deflation that fills him during the contest’s final seconds 
			is shot in close-up without mockery or condescension, but instead 
			with a measure of resigned compassion.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Rather than compassion, however, 
			what the film could really use is a swift kick in the pants. What 
			begins as a small character study soon devolves into the kind of 
			tediously predictable independent film that last year’s <i>Love Liza</i> 
			all too unfortunately typified. One feels as though Kwietniowski (<i>Love 
			and Death on Long Island</i>) has shot the film exactly as it was 
			written, and the material leaps off the screen only to fall flat in 
			the theater’s first aisle – there’s absolutely no momentum to this 
			tale, no sense of surprise that might mislead us into believing that 
			we don’t know how the story will ultimately end. <i>Owning Mahowny</i> 
			might be about one man’s frightening (and true) spiral into the 
			depths of gambling addiction, but his cinematic life story – despite 
			the wily blankness of Phillip Seymour Hoffman’s performance – is 
			likely to make moviegoers feel that they’ve been swindled out of 
			$10.</font></td>
