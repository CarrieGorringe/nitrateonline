			</blockquote>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Devised by Glen 
			Morgan and James Wong, the team responsible for (the good seasons 
			of) <i>The X-Files</i> and <i>Final Destination</i>, the <i>Willard</i> 
			remake is remarkably worthy. In fact, it has some decided advantages 
			over the 1971 original, not least being that Crispin Glover not only 
			plays the title character, but also sings the closing credits 
			version of &quot;Ben.&quot; It's hard to imagine a more sinister, more perfect 
			interpretation of this most uncanny of tunes.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Glover has long 
			been a culty favorite, notorious for his consistently startling 
			turns in <i>River's Edge</i> (with the beetle), <i>Wild at Heart</i> 
			(Cousin Dell, meticulously placing roaches in his briefs), <i>Like 
			Mike</i> (the dreadful orphanage manager) <i>Charlie's Angels</i> 
			(the Thin Man), and of course, the first <i>Back to the Future</i>'s 
			George McFly (who is especially startling if you consider that he 
			somehow produced the relentlessly rational Marty). As well, back in 
			1989, Crispin Glover released a CD called <i>The Big Problem [does 
			not equal] The Solution. The Solution = Let It Be</i>. The entire 
			album is pretty near priceless, but it did boast peculiar 
			highlights, including his cover of &quot;These Boots Are Made for 
			Walking&quot; and his own concoction, &quot;Auto-Manipulator.&quot; Glover 
			regularly stands apart from his fellow oddballs, even when 
			surrounded by weirdos. No one can out-weird him.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">As the titular 
			lifelong loser in <i>Willard</i>, Glover takes up this mantle once 
			again. As many have observed of the Bates house, he is the film's 
			best special effect. (Though, truth be told, he gets considerable 
			help from the always courageous Jackie Burroughs, as Willard's 
			mother, Henrietta.) Frustrated by his lack of intercourse, Willard 
			Stiles is moping about when the bedridden Henrietta announces that 
			she's heard rats in the basement of their operatically dilapidated 
			home. Dutifully he heads downstairs, where, as he teeters on the 
			wooden stairway, the fuse blows when he flips the light switch. 
			Seeking luminescence, he comes on a flashlight, which he shines into 
			the camera, filtered light-effect and high-beam right in your eyes. 
			Hoorah, the film proclaims one of its several <i>X-Files</i>-ish 
			references (another being a cat named Scully). </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Willard's first 
			effort toward solving the problem is to head to the local mega-mart, 
			so fluorescently and muzak-ically horrific that it seems a most 
			fiendishly imagined circle of hell. Standing in the rat-poison 
			aisle, he peruses the labels, landing on the one that looks most 
			effective: <i>Mouse Prufe II</i>. When he goes to pick it off the 
			shelf, however, he discovers that it is sold out. And so he returns 
			home, a bag full of the inferior brand in tow. His defeat is 
			redoubled when his efforts to kill the rats fail, miserably. </font>
			</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">But if his 
			efforts didn't fail, he wouldn't have the chance to meet the white 
			rat he christens Socrates, who leads his fellows to do whatever 
			Willard says (&quot;Tear it up&quot;), shares his bed (&quot;I'll never leave you, 
			ever&quot;), nibbles away at the Numm Nuts Willard offers, and tags along 
			with him to work, where he waits quietly in the desk drawer until 
			it's time to trudge on home, metaphorical tail between his legs.
			</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Work is, in a 
			word, gruesome. At the grim offices of Martin-Stiles Manufacturing, 
			where it's not clear what they manufacture; it's one of those <i>
			Brazil</i>-style workplaces, where the elevator cage is huge and 
			rattly, the hallways are sickly green, and the desks are cluttered 
			with papers, inboxes, and computer monitors. Willard's boss, Frank 
			Martin (R. Lee Ermey), is monstrous: sweaty-faced, loud, and 
			determined to make Willard's life unpleasant. The former partner of 
			Willard's dad (&quot;remembered&quot; here in portraits and photos of the 
			original Willard, Bruce Davison), Martin spends most of his time 
			harassing his employees and cruising the feeblest of internet porn 
			sites. Willard has a special place in his hard heart, embodying 
			whatever might be left of his guilt, for Mr. Stiles' suicide and 
			Mrs.'s terminal frailty. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Much as Ermey 
			livens up the proceedings (and brings to bear his old drill sergeant 
			affect on the cringing Willard), the film runs through its single 
			idea (Willard loves his rats) pretty quickly. Though Willard shares 
			a mutual, strange affection with Cathryn (Laura Elena Harring, whose 
			experience on <i>Mulholland Drive</i> may have primed her to work 
			with fellow Lynch veteran Glover), he probably believes, as he tells 
			Socrates repeatedly, that he has nothing to live for beyond his new 
			furry friend. And, as no intrahuman relationship develops beyond the 
			fleeting, arresting moment -- Cathryn's hand caressing Willard's 
			face, his eyes red-brimming with tears -- the film is rather stuck 
			with its focus on Willard and the rats. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">And there are 
			lots of them -- some 550 live rats, along with CGI and animatronic 
			creatures. The most disquieting is Big Ben (about whom Michael 
			Jackson is singing, as 1972's <i>Ben</i> plays on television as 
			melodically creepazoid counterpoint to an especially nasty 
			rat-stalking and assaulting scene). This mammoth rat, brown and 
			aggressive, nosy and abnormally expressive, is the opposite of the 
			cutesy white-mousey Socrates. What's more, Ben is increasingly 
			jealous of Socrates' special treatment, and begins to take matters 
			into his own teeth. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">At this point 
			it's clear that Willard is afraid of Ben's strength, his 
			relentlessness, his will to survive, and his seeming freedom of 
			movement and appropriation: &quot;You can go anywhere,&quot; he wails. &quot;I have 
			nowhere.&quot; Cowering in the kitchen corner, Willard suddenly sees 
			himself another way: a poor white kid in a decrepit building, 
			underprivileged, afraid, and hopeless. </font></span></td>
