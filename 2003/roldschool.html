            21 February 2003</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The title <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Old
            School</i> doesn’t just refer to its story, which follows the
            antics of three moronic thirty-somethings who decide to start up a
            college fraternity; it also unintentionally highlights the film’s
            considerable derivativeness. From the film’s sexually-charged yuks
            to its perfunctory romance and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Animal
            House</i>-style college conflicts between wild and crazy party
            monsters and stuffy, obnoxious administrators bent on shutting down
            their fun, everything about the film is recycled for your viewing
            pleasure – even director Todd Phillips has mined similar territory
            before with his last film, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Road
            Trip</i>. But if its “us versus the world” plot is groan-inducingly
            unoriginal, the film is blessed with a trio of funnymen, headlined
            by the uproariously scene-stealing Will Ferrell, who seem hell-bent
            on breathing life into this stale and paper-thin premise. It’s not
            <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Crime and Punishment</i> –
            heck, it’s not even on par with the Cliff Notes for
            Dostoyevsky’s classic – but, as long as you don’t think too
            much and allow the laughs to carry you along, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Old
            School</i> is an amusing slice of numbskulled cinematic fluff.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Written by Phillips and Scot
            Armstrong, one can imagine the film’s screenplay being written in
            between bouts of bong hits and beer funnel contests. Mitch (Luke
            Wilson) is a mild-mannered real estate agent who comes home early
            from a business trip to find his live-in girlfriend Heidi (Juliette
            Lewis) hosting a gang bang. Uninterested in signing up for her
            sexually adventurous lifestyle, Mitch moves into a place directly
            next to the local college campus, and his friends – smart-alecky
            Beanie (Vince Vaughn) and recently married Frank (Will Ferrell) –
            promptly throw him a huge bash (featuring a Snoop Dogg performance)
            that’s so popular that the three guys attract the negative
            attention of the school’s Dean Pritchard (Jeremy Piven, in an
            about-face from his <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">PCU</i>
            days). Pritchard rezones Mitch’s house so that it now falls under
            the college’s control, meaning that unless the residence is used
            for social services or student housing, Mitch will have to give up
            his new place. In one of many gleefully nonsensical plot twists,
            Beanie decides that the best way to prevent Mitch from having to
            move is to establish a fraternity based out of the house, and he
            promptly courts a pledge class comprised of a motley crew of
            anonymous students and out-of-place adults that include a
            middle-aged Asian businessman and an eager geezer named Blue
            (Patrick Cranshaw).</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Most of this expository stuff,
            however, serves as a weak excuse for the film’s performers to have
            some fun acting like idiots, and there’s no doubt that <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Old
            School</i> has its fair share of inspired gags, most of them
            revolving around former <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">SNL</i>
            standout Ferrell. Affectionately known as “Frank the Tank” for
            his hard-drinking college reputation, Frank has now settled down
            with his ordinary wife Marissa (Perrey Reeves). Before Mitch’s
            housewarming party, Marissa begs her hubby not to drink, and the
            reason for her request soon becomes painfully clear – one drink
            leads the man down a binge-drinking spiral that culminates with him
            jogging down the town’s quiet suburban center with nothing but his
            birthday suit on. A healthy portion of Ferrell’s shtick has a
            nudity component to it, and viewers will undoubtedly get an acute
            sense of the contours of his derrière by film’s conclusion, but
            his performance’s lunacy derives mainly from the fits of unbridled
            rage that burst forth from his otherwise meek demeanor. It’s hard
            to stifle a smile when Frank, at a serene birthday party for
            Beanie’s son, begins the festivities by screaming at Blue to drop
            and give him twenty push-ups, and finishes off the get-together by
            accidentally shooting himself with an animal tranquilizer and, in a
            drugged stupor, slapping a few children before plummeting to the
            bottom of a swimming pool with the guest of honor’s presents in
            tow.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With Ferrell dominating every scene
            he’s in, Vaughn and Wilson are given less comedic ammunition to
            work with, but each nonetheless manages to fire off a few funny
            rounds. Vaughn’s Beanie has trained his child to cover his ears
            whenever his dad says “earmuffs,” thus providing him with a
            supposedly fool-proof (but, in reality, woefully stupid) method of
            protecting the kid from hearing the adult’s litany of curse words.
            Vaughn (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Swingers</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Made</i>) is quickly making a career out of playing wiseasses, and his
            Beanie is the loudmouthed leader of the group, barking orders at his
            friends with the misguided arrogant assurance that he’s charting a
            proper course of action. Left as the straight man, Wilson’s Mitch
            is relatively bland, forced to whine a lot about his friends’
            misbehavior, although the actor’s lackadaisical disposition is
            occasionally interrupted by flashes of zaniness, including a
            disastrous post-breakup bender at Frank’s wedding reception in
            which he attempts to vent his pent-up rage and frustration during
            his ceremonial toast.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That the film makes almost zero
            sense is besides the point; those worrying about what Frank’s job
            is, how Mitch’s nerdy co-workers find out about the fraternity, or
            why Mitch’s standard-issue love interest Nicole (Ellen Pompeo, who
            looks like a more sandy-haired Renée Zellweger) has any interest in
            the doofus will be flummoxed by the gaping holes in logic and
            narrative cohesion on display. But Phillips and company are only
            after some simple-minded male-centric hilarity (women play a nominal
            role at best) and, thanks to its bumbling triumvirate of charming
            comedians, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Old School</i> is a
            raunchy and raucous, if decidedly inane, fantasy of college glory
            days revisited.</font></td>
