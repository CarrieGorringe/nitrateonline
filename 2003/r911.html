            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>For the film <i>September 11</i>,
            the French producer Alain Brigand invited eleven international
            directors to contribute a short film pertaining to the terrorist
            attacks that occurred in the United States on that date in 2001. The
            only stipulation was that each episode was to last eleven minutes,
            nine seconds and one frame (11/09/01 being the European-style date
            for the day of the attacks). Otherwise, the filmmakers had complete
            latitude in what they wanted to say and how to say it.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Samira Makhmalbaf's episode, which
            opens the film, starts out by showing Iranian villagers making mud
            bricks for a shelter because the United States is going to attack
            Afghanistan and, they think, drop an atomic bomb. The village's
            considerably more cool-headed (female) schoolteacher rounds up the
            kids for class that day, saying that, if they did drop an atomic
            bomb, mud brick shelters aren't going to do much good. (Actually,
            the people we're watching in this episode are Afghan refugees
            settled on the Iranian border---a piece of information mentioned so
            fleetingly you almost miss it.) The teacher tries to get her
            assembled class to observe a minute of silence for those who had
            perished that day in the World Trade Center towers, but the kids are
            squirrely -- &quot;God doesn't only destroy humans. He builds them,
            too,&quot; observes one child in the class -- so the teacher ends up
            taking them outside and, using a tall chimney, impresses on her
            class what it would be like to be a person in a high tower that is
            suddenly attacked. It's a beautifully done segment, and even
            including some moments of infectious charm alongside its understated
            message.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">French director Claude Lelouch
            shows us a couple in New York City who, because they speak to each
            other in sign language, appear to be deaf. Only the woman is,
            though, and the man is breaking off their relationship because she
            is too possessive. After he's left for his job as a tour guide, she
            takes the initiative to write him a farewell letter, while, in the
            other room and out of sight, a television broadcasts the attacks as
            they happen. Two respected film critics walked out of showings of
            &quot;September 11&quot; when it premiered at the Venice and Toronto
            festivals in 2002, and I suspect it may have been because of this
            episode, which appears to be using the attacks to frame the woman's
            banal, self-pitying comments (she writes about whether or not she is
            &quot;just a mute LOST IN A TALKING PICTURE?&quot; [sic]. However,
            the episode ends effectively, saving it from falling completely into
            the realm of questionable taste.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The seventy-seven-year-old Egyptian
            director Youssef Chahine uses the loose, searching, fanciful,
            reflective style of his autobiographical &quot;Alexandria
            trilogy&quot; films to depict a scenario whereby Chahine (played by
            Nour el-Cherif, who played Chahine's alter-ego, &quot;Yehia&quot;,
            in the second &quot;Alexandria&quot; film, <i>An Egyptian Story</i>,
            in 1982) converses with a U.S. Marine, killed in Beirut in 1983, and
            with a young Palestinian suicide bomber -- the latter is somewhat
            more angrier than the former, although we see why. Chahine's episode
            had charges of anti-Americanism leveled at it, but the director is
            explaining, not condoning, what would cause someone like the
            Palestinian bomber to do what he does, and Chahine, fairly, tries to
            give everyone equal say, pro or con. The episode also points out
            that, ideology aside, there is still a considerable distinction
            between dying and living.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Danis Tanovic's episode shows a
            group of women in post-war Bosnia listening to radio reports on the
            terrorist attacks in New York and Washington---the eleventh of each
            month is when they regularly assemble as the &quot;Women of
            Srebrenica&quot;, the town where, during the Yugoslav war, many
            Muslim Yugoslavs sought refuge, only to apprehended and killed by
            Serbian forces, just because they were Muslim. British director Ken
            Loach devotes his episode to a Chilean exile who fled his country
            after the military coup that ousted elected President Salvador
            Allende -- an action backed by the U.S. at the time, because Allende
            was a Communist -- which took place on September 11, 1973; the
            dictatorship which then took power tortured and killed many Chileans
            during the years that followed. Burkina Faso filmmaker Idrissa
            Ouedraogo follows a young boy selling newspapers to try and support
            himself and his ailing mother. One edition of the paper he sells
            announces the huge reward offered for the capture of Osama bin Laden
            -- after which the boy and his friends spot someone who happens to
            look a lot like bin Laden in their own village. The boy and his
            friends methodically go about planning how they can capture him, and
            how they can use the reward money -- the adults would just squander
            it on luxuries, while the boys want to use it to help people -- if
            they can only get the adults to believe that they've found bin
            Laden. (And they certainly give it a good try -- reminding one of
            what Groucho said in <i>Animal Crackers</i>, &quot;This would be a
            better world if the parents were made to eat the spinach.&quot;)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Alejandro Gonzáles Iñárritu, for
            his part, creates an aural soundscape against a black screen --
            moving from what sounds like chanting in an Islamic religious
            school, to the sound of an airliner in flight, followed by media
            broadcasts of the explosions at the Trade Center -- then cuts in
            flashes of news footage showing people falling, or jumping, from the
            floors where the planes struck. Easily the most disturbing (and
            ambitious) of the film's episodes -- replete with a closing
            observation, presented in both Arabic and English, that can't help
            but polarize anyone watching the film. (And Gonzáles Iñárritu
            seems a bit polarized himself, as if realizing that he was trying to
            express the inexpressible.) Israeli director Amos Gitaï goes the
            one-shot-wonder route, following police, emergency workers, then a
            TV news crew as they converge on the site of a bombing -- either in
            Jaffa, Tel Aviv, or Jerusalem (it keeps changing) -- into which news
            of the U.S. attacks on the same day gradually trickles. Sean Penn
            wrote, directed, and dabbles in a bit of &quot;magic realism&quot;
            for his episode, about how the collapse of the towers affects an
            aged man and husband (played, with great tenderness, by Ernest
            Borgnine -- say what you like about Penn, he gets great work from
            actors) who lives in a tiny apartment, and how it does so in
            unexpected ways. (Without taking away anything from Penn's
            contribution, Abel Ferrara was said to have been originally
            approached to film the U.S. episode -- and it would have been
            interesting to see what the director of <i>Bad Lieutenant</i> and <i>King
            of New York</i> would've come up with.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mira Nair's episode is also set in
            New York, and attempts to address the treatment of Americans of Arab
            descent in the days directly after the attacks, dramatizing a true
            story about a Muslim woman whose son goes off to work but fails to
            come home on Sept. 11; meanwhile, she has to contend with
            investigators who automatically assume that he was mixed up in some
            sort of suspicious activity. Nair's approach deliberately avoids
            anything that might be incendiary, but it feels like it could have
            been developed a bit more -- although the moment when the woman
            spots her son, at the last minute, on a commuter train that is just
            pulling away from a platform, and you realize that nobody around her
            is going out of their way to help her because she looks Middle
            Eastern -- creates a bit of a tug. Shohei Imamura's episode,
            however, goes in a completely different direction altogether -- it
            shows a Japanese soldier, returned home at the end of the Second
            World War (the specter of a Third World War, by the way, is alluded
            to in Makhmalbaf's episode), who thinks he's a snake, slithering on
            the ground instead of walking, and at one point biting someone's
            hand. He's finally turned out-of-doors altogether when he consumes a
            rodent (which, of course, is what snakes do). &quot;Does being a man
            disgust you that much?&quot; one character asks him, before Imamura
            delivers the punchline: &quot;There is no such thing as a holy
            war.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">All in all, a fairly respectable
            undertaking: all of the episodes have something worthwhile to look
            at. We, of course, do not yet have the luxury to forget how we felt
            about the September 11 attacks. The film functions as both an
            observance, and as something that gets us to think about what
            happened -- as Peter Rainer has already commented, film, while it
            cannot provide a curative, can at least provide a continuum, so that
            we may move forward, rather than backward, after an event of such
            tragic proportions.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
