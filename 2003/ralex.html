            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>As if the
            thirty inches of rain that has drenched the Washington, D.C., area
            this year hasn't been depressing enough, the new romantic comedy <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Alex
            &amp; Emma</i> drowns any iota of movie-magic romance and uncovers a
            drought of comic talent. For a film about a writer and the creative
            process, it's an inspired wreck from actor-turned-producer/director
            Rob Reiner, who first and last used a story within a story concept
            immensely more successfully in the beloved fantasy <i>The</i> <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Princess
            Bride</i>. And it's not as if the Bronx-born Reiner can't handle the
            genre, because he's succeeded with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Sure Thing</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The American President</i>, and one of the best of them all, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">When
            Harry Met Sally</i>. He stumbled badly in 1999 with the somber,
            deconstructive <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Story of Us</i>,
            just to wait four more years to brings us this poppycock. My, but
            the times they are a-changing, for the worse. Please Rob, make this
            just another hiccup. Yes, we also regret <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">North</i>,
            but your directorial career still places you today at a very
            respectable 6.895 on the IMDB.com rating scale. Heck, if every
            Californian voted the same way as viewers of your movies, you could
            even run for governor! (Is that why there are so many presidential
            jokes in your film?)</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So, what's wrong
            with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Alex &amp; Emma</i> aside
            from its general loveless feel and unfunny core? It feels forced and
            overwrought, particularly with nearly non-stop voiceover narration
            by star Luke Wilson, who plays a stressed-out, Boston-based novelist
            caught between some menacing Cuban loan sharks and a huge case of
            writer's block. As Alex Sheldon, he sporadically, then frantically,
            sputters up over the course of a month his next book, for which his
            ever-confident publisher (Rob Reiner) has promised him enough money,
            but only when the manuscript is delivered. It's not likely to
            surprise any viewer that the author will obviously pay off his debt,
            save his own life, and eventually win the girl. Getting there should
            be a whole lot more charming than watching this brick of a movie
            inch its way through a tiring 100 minutes.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Loosely based on
            an incident behind Fyodor Dostoevsky's compulsive study <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Gambler</i> (in which a gambling-addicted writer must write a book
            in thirty days to clear a debt, hires a stenographer, and ultimately
            falls in love with her), the script by Jeremy Leven (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Legend of Bagger Vance</i>) zigzags between present-day Bean Town
            and an imaginary island (discovered by real life 16th-century
            explorer Jacques Cartier—there's a joke in there somewhere) off
            the coast of Maine back in the golden-drenched summer of 1924. Emma
            Dinsmore (Kate Hudson), is a level-headed, but romantically
            uninvolved stenographer who temps for law firms and somehow finds
            herself romantically bamboozled by Alex to spend four-plus weeks
            with him, mostly on a dare and certainly without any cash,
            converting the tiresome dictation into a boring love story. It's
            what every attractive, single woman dreams of, isn't it?</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Emma, ever the
            opinionated modern muse, prefers to read the last page of any book
            first, just like Jack Nicholson's Warren Schmidt. But screenwriter
            Leven, instead of building on that obsession, wherein the film might
            have succeeded if he used some <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Memento</i>-style
            backwards-forwards stylings, instead just lumps some modern day
            romantic perceptions in a 1920s setting. Emma thus is enmeshed in
            Alex's semi-inspired literate/real world journey on his road to
            commitment, taking the shorthand and embodying the role of a mildly
            implausible and constantly re-written au pair in the pre-Depression
            world of Adam Shipley, Alex's sappy alter ego/protagonist. The only
            chuckle I got out of the film was Hudson's transformation from the
            Swedish Ylva to the red-hot German Elsa, then a Spanish Eldora, and
            finally the &quot;emancipate me!&quot; Philadelphian Anna. These
            women all cater to the children of Polina Delacroix (Sophie
            Marceau), a French divorcée in a financial crunch, yet game to
            entice the talented Mr. Shipley, hired on as the children's English
            tutor. David Paymer has a nonplussed role as a wealthy paramour
            intent on marrying the &quot;ample bosomed&quot; (another flatliner)
            Polina.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Frankly I can't
            see the honest love interest through the trees. It's all just so
            casual, without a real spark and laden with age old clichés that
            are supposedly to elicit laughter. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Alex &amp; Emma</i> is a pretty soggy affair. Emma accidentally drops
            eighteen pages of Alex's novel on a rain-drenched street one night.
            I wish I could have dumped the entire movie the same way. Lord knows
            the weather has been favorably inclined to help.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
