            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by <a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia
            Fuchs</a>, 18 April 2003</i></font><p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="5">Inscrutable
			</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700">
			<font size="2">It's not impossible to guess why producers Terence 
			Chang and John Woo might think Paul Hunter was a good choice to 
			direct <i>Bulletproof Monk</i>. His video for Mariah Carey's &quot;Honey&quot; 
			does include some actionish scenes, after all, and Michael Jackson's 
			&quot;You Rock My World&quot; dishes up a few shady characters. But for the 
			most part, the resulting movie, adapted from the Flypaper Press 
			comic book, doesn't look slick and kind of burnished (like the 
			video), but looks haphazard and silly, like it's been assembled from 
			fragments of other movies, with scant attention to sense. </font>
			</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The action 
			begins with a brief setup in 1943 Tibet. The soon to be nameless 
			Monk (Chow Yun-Fat) is training on one of those rope bridges over 
			yawning abysses that martial arts movies like to feature. A little 
			flipping and corkscrew spinning, a little pole-wielding, and yes, 
			his Master (Roger Yuan) tells him he's ready to take on the great 
			responsibility of guarding the sacred Scroll of the Ultimate (which 
			will grant whoever reads it aloud power over all the world). With 
			that, Master must exit and Monk (who gives up his name in order to 
			indicate his dedication to his task) is on his own. Wise and 
			inscrutable beyond his years, Monk knows how to escape the Nazis who 
			come looking for the scroll, by still more flipping and 
			corkscrew-spinning, so speedy and nimble that he appears to be... 
			bulletproof. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Needless to 
			say, the Head Nazi-In-Charge, the weasel-faced Struker (Karel Roden), 
			is determined to get his paws on that scroll. So, when he misses it 
			this first time, rest assured he'll be back when the film cuts ahead 
			sixty years. This next part takes place in Any City 2003 (shot in 
			Toronto), indicated by the establishing shot on a crowded subway 
			platform, workplace for cocky pickpocket Kar (Buff Stifler, that is, 
			Seann William Scott following several months of training). He and 
			Monk meet cute while running from assorted adversaries (cops in 
			Kar's case, Nazis in Monk's) and pausing to rescue a hapless black 
			child who conveniently falls on the train tracks in time to provide 
			Kar with a test of his moral mettle. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">This subway 
			setting allows for a brief and silly detour to a literally 
			underground enclave, where Kar shows off his skills (learned, he 
			insists, by watching kung fu movies at the Golden Palace movie 
			theater, where he's the projectionist for an owner played by the 
			venerable Mako). Kar's nemeses in this instance are a pack o' thugs, 
			led by the self-loving, hard-abbed, much-inked Mr. Funktastic 
			(Patrick Hagarty) and including Mr. F's lady friend, the 
			kung-fu-fighting and exceedingly lovely Russian mafia princess Jade 
			(Jaime King, Devon Sawa's object of affection in the mostly 
			depressing <i>Slackers</i>). Just why she's in this underground is 
			not so clear, something to do with hating her dad. </font></span>
			</p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Monk (who, by 
			the way, has not aged a mite, because of his special spiritual 
			status as scroll watcher) hides so he can observe Kar, whom he 
			thinks has &quot;potential&quot; (specifically, to be the next scroll 
			watcher). Kar, in turn, gamely fights off the gang, kicking and 
			flipping and pole-wielding. Aha, surmises Monk, nodding wisely and 
			inscrutably to himself, Kar looks like the one. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Their second 
			meeting provides the film's most endearing scene: Monk stops by 
			Kar's abode above the movie theater, where he eats Cocoa Puffs while 
			schooling the youngster, who has the temerity to pronounce, &quot;I'm 
			kickin' your freaky ass back to wherever the hell it came from.&quot; Um, 
			this is Chow Yun-Fat he's talking to. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">So okay, Little 
			Faux Grasshopper has a ways to go en route to what he terms &quot;all 
			that enlightenment stuff.&quot; (And, from <i>Raiders of the Lost Ark </i>
			to <i>Karate Kid</i> to <i>Kung Fu</i>, from <i>Subway</i> to <i>The 
			Matrix</i>, <i>Bulletproof Monk</i> has lots of homages to make.) 
			Monk dutifully takes up the task of teaching Kar to be all he can 
			be, by posing riddles (&quot;Why do hotdogs come in packages of ten, 
			while hotdog buns come in packages of eight?&quot;) or fortune cookie-ish 
			profundities (&quot;You should be asking yourself, who you are: your mind 
			is full of compassion, but your mind is also impure&quot;). 
			Understandably, Kar initially resists. But there's no fighting the 
			East-West buddy formula. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The plot 
			jumbles up a little with the reappearance of Struker (now in a 
			wheelchair and weighted by layers of plastic wrinkles), accompanied 
			by his minions (now in suits rather than uniforms). Aiding in the 
			quest for the scroll is his alarmingly Aryan granddaughter, Nina 
			(Victoria Smurfit); she has devised the brilliant idea to disguise 
			the Nazis' general and apparently profitable nefariousness under the 
			auspices of something called the Human Rights Organization. </font>
			</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">While the boys 
			are busy enlightening one another, Jade stumbles on the Human Rights 
			Organization's museum exhibit, featuring &quot;art&quot; that represents 
			atrocities and abuses, and yes, someone even calls it &quot;man's 
			inhumanity to man.&quot; Don't you think, muses Jade, that all these ugly 
			pictures might give people ideas, like how-tos for murder and 
			mayhem? Nina counters with her own philosophical conundrum: pointing 
			to the photo of a soldier about to shoot a prisoner, she wonders 
			whether this pretty little rich girl would rather be the shooter or 
			the about to be shot. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The movie, in 
			other words, has a couple of ideas rattling around in its head, 
			ideas that are -- or could be -- strangely relevant (or perhaps just 
			eternal): atrocities come variously packaged, some perpetrators 
			understand PR, and privileged folks can use occasional wake-ups 
			(even if they do revert to privileged willful blindness when push 
			comes to shove, which it usually does). But the movie can't quite 
			get these ideas collected into a memorable shape. Eventually, <i>
			Bulletproof Monk</i> resembles a comic book that's missing a few 
			pages. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">By the time 
			Monk reveals that he's written the scroll onto his body à la <i>The 
			Pillow Book</i>, <i>Bulletproof Monk</i> is plainly struggling, 
			caught between those rattling (perverse, somewhat interesting) ideas 
			and its ostensible action-movie imperative. First Nina and then 
			Struker must read him: she checks Monk's nether regions as she 
			&quot;scans&quot; the text off him, granddad prefers to read the characters 
			off his monitor, perhaps less inclined toward the perverse sexual 
			domination, at least until he's made his transition back to Younger 
			Struker, and poking needles in Monk's head serves as his very own 
			Nazi-experimenting-as-sex metaphor. This sort of unexamined 
			allusiveness is, in the end, more tedious than provocative. </font>
