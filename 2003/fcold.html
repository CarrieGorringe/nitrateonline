</font><i><font size="1" face="Verdana">interview by <a href="../kj.html" target="_top">KJ
Doughton</a>, 26 December 2003</font></i></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Cold
Mountain</span></i><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"> has more layers
than a flaky slice of baklava tempting customers from a bakery display case. The
cast is massive, with Old Guard reliables such as Donald Sutherland competing
with newbies like Jude Law for screen time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Meanwhile, there are several interwoven stories sewn into Anthony
Minghella’s ambitious quilt of a movie. Men are blown to smithereens by
exploding gunpowder in the Civil War trenches of Virginia, women and children
struggle to manage family farms, and forest wanderers eat fried goat meat from
the kitchens of grizzled, Yoda-esque mountain women.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Even
so, it’s a safe bet that audiences will remember Charlie Hunnam’s tiny
supporting role. As the villainous Bosie, a restless Home Guard albino itching
to shoot war deserters, Hunnam breaks into a backflip worthy of David Lee Roth,
before noosing the neck of a terrorized farm mother.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>This guy enjoys cruelty the way Hannibal Lector savors human
liver. Meanwhile, his pale eyebrows and stringy, blonde locks bring to mind a
frontier version of Riff Raff, the bleached-white butler from <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Rocky
Horror Picture Show</i>.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Bosie is a very vague character in
Charles Frazier’s book,&quot; explains Hunnam from a Seattle hotel room.
&quot;In fact, there are only a couple of lines that describe him. He’s
depicted as a slight, sickly guy with fair hair. Even during early rehearsals
for the movie, he only appeared in the final scene. Eventually, Anthony put me
into more and more things, and gave me more to do.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Through a creative collaboration with
Minghella, the actor beefed up his under-written role and added a charismatic
angle for Bosie. &quot;Anthony would ask me, ‘What if he is really flashy, not
just shooting someone but also doing a backflip?’ But that prompted questions
of logic. If he’s such an able bodied killer, why isn’t he out fighting in
the war?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">One of the many story threads tackled by <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Cold
Mountain</i> concerns the Civil War Home Guard, a collection of men deemed unfit
for combat and assigned to watch over the families of Confederate soldiers.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Perhaps due to age, illness, or injury, Home Guard members were spared
the trenches. Many became bullying killers as the organization’s duties
shifted from civilian civility to the execution of war deserters.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Where would Hunnam’s re-invented presence fit into all of this?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;There had to be some kind of ailment,
some reason he was resigned to serving on the Home Guard. One day, Anthony asked
me, ‘What if he was an albino?’ He told me to go away and read as much as I
could about albinism. That’s the way Anthony works. He gives his actors a
great deal of responsibility.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I read that the condition was often a
product of incest. Otherwise, there’s a million to one chance, because you
need identical genes to mix. Also, I read that albinos generally have about
60/20 vision, and are susceptible to nosebleeds. Every time Bosie shoots
someone, his body fails him and his nose starts bleeding.&quot; The appearance
of this cadaverous reaper in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Cold Mountain</i>
is made all the more unsettling by the liquid crimson that’s often trickling
down his fare face.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Here’s a guy who has been ostracized
his whole life, with all this rage inside,&quot; says the Newcastle-born actor,
explaining Bosie’s violent demeanor. &quot;Maybe he can fight in the war and
get respect. But he doesn’t get to fight. He’s going to burst at any given
moment.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While Bosie’s angry spirit survives the final
cut of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Cold Mountain</i>, the 23-year old
actor empathizes with viewers who might leave theaters feeling as though the
Home Guard’s transformation, from paternal overseer to remorseless bully
patrol, is underdeveloped.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;The original cut of the film was over
five hours,&quot; he explains. &quot;More than half of it is gone, including a
lot of really snazzy chase sequences. The real thing that’s missing is the
story of the Home Guard, which was kind of a noble role. Their job was to
protect the women and maintain order, a proud responsibility to have. Over the
course of the war, during its third year, the group’s primary role became
tracking down deserters, and deterring other men from deserting. The arc and
change of that is more detailed in the movie’s longer version. Perhaps the DVD
will have that stuff.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">DVD buffs can also find 23-year old Hunnam
playing the lead in Douglas McGrath’s 2002 adaptation of Charles Dickens’ <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Nicholas
Nickleby</i>, even though the actor doesn’t cherish his work in the Victorian
costume drama. &quot;I feel like it was very one-dimensional the way Doug had me
play it,&quot; Hunnam admits, describing creative differences that arose between
he and the director. &quot;I wouldn’t have played it that way. I fought tooth
and nail and lost that one.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">A more
contemporary video store option is the thriller <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Abandon</i>, where Hunnam plays the long-lost, enigmatic boyfriend of
Katie Holmes. Directed by Oscar winner Stephen Gaghan (Best Screenplay recipient
for 2000’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Traffic</i>), the
underachieving film proved a tough marketing challenge for its studio.
&quot;Paramount just kind of dropped it,&quot; says Hunnam, lamenting the
project’s failure to reach a wider audience. &quot;It was a tricky film, a
teen movie that was smarter than that genre of film generally is.&quot;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt">Hunnam
is most enthusiastic about future projects, however, including <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Hooligans</i>,
a film exploring the controversial subculture of British football clubs. Slated
to direct is German newcomer Lexi Alexander, whose 2002 boxing film <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Johnny Flynton</i> snagged an Oscar nomination for Best Short Live
Action Film. &quot;It’s so much more organized than anyone would
imagine,&quot; he reveals of the hooligan subculture. &quot;Every single
football club in Europe has a gang attached to it. They call them firms.
They’re fight clubs, basically, but not a bunch of drunken Neanderthals.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>A very primal thing. All sorts of people get involved,
including doctors, lawyers, and accountants. It’s the ultimate extreme
sport.&quot;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A new infusion of British blood has boosted the
otherwise anemic landscape of Hollywood film, as evidenced by the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Harry Potter</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Lord of the
Rings</i> casts. Even onscreen English veterans like Ians McKellan and Holm are
receiving long-overdue recognition through their affiliation with such popular
franchises. As a more recent addition to this U.K. acting fraternity, Hunnam is
asked which of his peers he most admires.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>&quot;Daniel
Day Lewis a guy whose career I would like to emulate, the way he will just take
time off, with no frantic urgency to stay on top.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Some of these guys can be such chameleons. They stay out of the spotlight
and then suddenly re-appear, allowing you to get excited about them.&quot;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To blow off steam during his down time, Hunnam
hams it up with a rap group called King Luster. But unlike other actors who
moonlight as serious musicians (for instance, the Keanu Reeves/Dogstar
connection), he insists that the band is merely an amusing diversion and nothing
more. &quot;It’s just for fun, but I would never pursue it
professionally,&quot; he chuckles. &quot;My rap group is an Aryan poster boy and
three Jews. Not exactly from the streets.&quot;</font><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
