            This is death's waiting room. These ridiculous tubes. These needles
            swelling my arms. What am I doing in this pre-corpse club? What do I
            have to do with them? I don't know when anything began anymore, or
            when it's going to end.&quot;</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Paul
            Rivers (Sean Penn) lies encased in tape and tubes, the camera
            peering at him through the bars of his hospital bed or hovering,
            ominously. He appears this way in one of the first scenes in
            Alejandro González Iñárritu's <i>21 Grams</i>, though it's not
            precisely one of the first scene's in the chronology. Much like the
            director's first film, 2000's <i>Amores Perros</i>, the new one
            tracks multiple storylines. This time, the fragmentation is more
            pronounced, chaotic to the point of mathematical precision. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            metaphor has to do with Paul's work -- he's a mathematics professor
            -- as well as the film's shape. A series of seeming accidents, story
            fragments, and shattered images interconnect with a precision that
            seems contrived, but also resonates. The nonlinear structure
            eventually brings together three characters: Paul, whose damaged
            heart requires a transplant; Cristina (Naomi Watts), who loses her
            husband Michael (Danny Huston) and two young daughters to a terrible
            car accident; and Jack (Benicio Del Toro), hard-working,
            literal-minded born-again driver of the pickup truck that runs down
            Christina's family. When Michael's heart proves compatible with
            Paul, the survivors' lives are inextricably entwined.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">So
            far, so machinated. Frankly, the heart business, so relentlessly
            resonant as metaphor and myth (see, for example, <i>Return to Me</i>)
            is this film's least effective element. Paul's determination to find
            the donor's widow and their eventual collaboration in tracking his
            accidental murderer (even after Jack has done his time in prison,
            only one of the series of punishments he seeks) make for a
            preposterous plot, especially if it were laid out in chronological
            order. But Guillermo Arriaga's screenplay is fractured enough, and
            Rodrigo Prieto's brilliant cinematography detailed and rough enough,
            that such conjured interconnections occasionally recede into
            irrelevance. And that's when you can see what's at stake, namely,
            the incessant effort to make sense of disorder. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Paul's
            approach is partly reckless (he sneaks cigarettes in his bathroom,
            dragging his IV drip behind him, hiding from his wife Mary
            [Charlotte Gainsbourg]), partly curious, and partly scrupulous.
            Volunteering his understanding of how two people might meet, he
            explains, &quot;There's a number hidden in every act of life, in
            every aspect of the universe. Fractals, matter, there are numbers
            screaming to tell us something.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            &quot;something&quot; provides the demanding substance and the
            strange poetry of <i>21 Grams</i>. A film that benefits from
            re-viewing, such that the overarching heart gimmick can be granted
            and complicated by the incredible details what's on the screen, it
            is already notorious for what the <i>New York Times</i> has called
            its &quot;grim&quot; mood and refusal to pull punches. But as
            Cristina becomes increasingly distraught (to her father's gentle
            attempt to soothe her, she mutters, &quot;That's a lie: life does
            not go on&quot;), the film doesn't so much take you inside her grief
            (though it does that), as it takes you in and out, glancing at means
            of coping and not. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">A
            recovering addict introduced in the film asleep on her white sheets,
            watched over by Paul, naked and smoking, Cristina finds herself
            undone by the accident. Watts again, following <i>Mulholland Drive</i>
            and <i>The Ring</i>, reveals astonishing emotional reserves:
            Cristina is at once steely and broken, determined and utterly
            perplexed. She seeks habit, something that allows her to stop
            feeling. She swims at a public pool with her sister Claudia (Clea
            DuVall), she listens again and again to the last message Michael
            left on her machine, a scant few minutes before he died, her
            children's joyful voices in the background. And then she starts
            using again: her dealer Ana (Catherine Dent) offers her new pills:
            &quot;R2, the shit's all the rage. You take two of these, you go
            straight to heaven.&quot; And this would be the goal, to get off
            earth, somehow, for some brief respite. As much as Paul works to
            keep her clean (&quot;You don't need this stuff&quot;), she's lost
            and angry, fierce (&quot;Don't tell me what I need&quot;). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At
            the same time, and in equally splintered bits, Jack is struggling to
            understand why God has done this to him, and everyone else. Having
            turned his life around following a stint in prison, he's devoted
            himself to Jesus, guided by the patient Reverend John (Eddie
            Marsan). Unable to keep a job (his tattoos upset the golfers at a
            club where he's doing maintenance work), Jack enforces his own faith
            at home. He lacks any sense of proportion, though, punishing minor
            infractions with a fervent righteousness, desperate to ensure that
            his two young kids and students down at the center follow a straight
            and narrow path. To heaven, perhaps.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">His
            piety becomes increasingly unfeasible, however, especially following
            the accident, when, oddly like Cristina, he is unable to move on.
            Agonizing in prison, he confronts Reverend John, asking how God
            could have allowed this to happen. &quot;Jesus didn't come to free
            us from pain,&quot; John explains patiently. &quot;He came to give
            us the strength to bear it.&quot; It's a tidy, no fault formulation,
            and Jack can't bear it. He's out of strength. Even as his own
            longsuffering and alarmingly realistic wife Marianne (the terrific
            Melissa Leo) urges him to &quot;go on,&quot; he sobs, unable to
            forget the damage or forgive himself. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            <i>21 Grams</i> has it, the most difficult aspect of &quot;going
            on&quot; is the lie that must propel it. The only way to survive
            catastrophe is by pretending you're all right, going through motions
            repeatedly until they become routine again, even though the very
            notion of routine has been ripped loose from your conceptual
            framework. The most common form of routine is institutional faith,
            or maybe addiction: both involve work and dedication, giving
            yourself over to a greater power, believing it is a greater power,
            whether it's god, desire, or death. &quot;How many lives do we live?
            How many times do we die?&quot; wonders Paul, tubed up during
            another of his hospital snippet-scenes. Can it matter, the number?
            And to whom? As Paul notes, his breath labored, 21 grams is the
            reported weight a person loses at the moment of dying, &quot;the
            weight of a hummingbird,&quot; he muses, or a &quot;chocolate
            bar.&quot; What sort of loss is this, the number? And for whom? <o:p>
