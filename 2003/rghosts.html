            25 April 2003</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>There’s some beautiful scenery
            in Matt Dillon’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">City of
            Ghosts</i>, a lackadaisical &quot;thriller&quot; about a con man’s
            journey into the heart of Cambodia to find the mentor who abandoned
            him. Photographed with a nearly somnambulistic lushness by Jim
            Denault (the film is the first since 1964’s adaptation of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Lord
            Jim</i> to be shot on location in Cambodia), Dillon’s maiden
            directorial voyage shares some of the dazzling visual unruliness of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Apocalypse
            Now</i>, with the country’s spiraling vines and dirt roads,
            dilapidated lodges and sun-drenched city streets sparkling as though
            they reflected the mysteries of nature itself. The film entrances us
            with images of the untamed jungle and rustic, old world town
            squares, transporting us through the seductive spell cast by its
            locale.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Were the film merely a documentary
            travelogue, such an effect would be more than enough to sustain
            one’s interest. Alas, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">City
            of Ghosts</i> has a story, and one so meager that it appears on
            screen seemingly as an afterthought to the cinematographic splendor.
            Jimmy (Dillon) sells phony disaster insurance for his mysterious
            partner Marvin (James Caan), but when a hurricane decimates a town
            covered by the firm’s policies, the Feds come calling and Jimmy
            takes a surreptitious trip to Cambodia, where Marvin is rumored to
            be hiding out. Jimmy is a man with a blank face and no purpose in
            life – he wants to find Marvin, but it’s clear from his only
            nominally perturbed demeanor that his is not a quest for revenge or
            retribution. In Bangkok, he meets up with Casper (Stellan Skarsgård),
            one of Marvin’s untrustworthy business partners, who leads him
            into Phnom Penh, where he takes up residence at a ramshackle hotel
            owned by the wild Frenchman Emile (Gérard Depardieu).<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jimmy soon discovers Phnom Penh to
            be a city of duplicitous charm, with the magnificent natural wonders
            concealing an underbelly populated by shady businessmen and
            conniving thieves – not only is the traveler’s passport stolen
            by a barroom stranger, but his sunglasses are hoisted by a sneaky
            monkey that’s made a habit out of terrorizing the hotel’s
            patrons. With Casper’s help, Jimmy eventually finds Marvin, who is
            now in league with a corrupt former army general (Chalee Sankhavesa)
            to build a lavish casino in the heart of the wild jungle. Marvin is
            a notorious con man and wants Jimmy to join him in this supposedly
            lucrative venture, and the power Marvin wields in the country is
            enough to make Jimmy question whether the proposition isn’t a
            surefire lucrative opportunity. But after meeting a sultry
            archaeologist named Sophie (Natascha McElhone), our wayward
            protagonist begins to wonder if he can’t break free from
            Marvin’s influence and embark on a more fulfilling, safe, and
            legal life with his newfound paramour.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This dilemma is played out in
            countless scenes of almost absolute stasis – trying to figure out
            the motivation for Jimmy’s actions and behavior is a tedious
            chore, as Dillon’s inexpressiveness lends an overall torpor to the
            film’s narrative. We’re meant to understand that Jimmy is
            undergoing a sort of spiritual crisis, but the script (by Dillon and
            Barry Gifford) seems to take for granted that we’ll remain
            invested in characters who’ve been drawn in outline form only;
            even when one senses some depth of motivation or purpose, the film
            never allows us the proximity necessary to feel engaged in their
            predicament. Caan tosses his smirk around the jungle, and McElhone
            – with her perfect chestnut hair and coy smile – looks
            beguilingly appealing, but it doesn’t take long to recognize that
            their characters’ inner lives will remain closed off to us. The
            story’s aimlessness does lend an anarchic spirit to the
            “enveloped by the jungle” atmosphere, and the jocular chemistry
            between Dillon’s Jimmy and his cyclo driver sidekick Sok (newcomer
            Kem Sereyvuth) has a playful authenticity that sometimes distracts
            us from the pointlessness of Jimmy’s quest. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">City
            of Ghosts</i> ends in a series of double-crosses and revelations,
            but one feels as though the entire film is a mirage, producing a
            beginning, middle and end without ever really offering us anything
            of substance save for some gorgeous backdrops.</font></td>
