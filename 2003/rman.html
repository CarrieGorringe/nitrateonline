            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			Nicholas Schager, 9 May 2003</i></font><p><b>
			<font face="Verdana" size="2">Patrice Leconte aims his sights low 
			with <i>Man on the Train (L’Homme du Train)</i>, a trifling drama 
			that combines humor and resignation without ever rising above its 
			overtly modest designs. The director, whose body of work lurches 
			between inspired passion and wit (<i>The Girl on the Bridge</i>) and 
			ponderous moralizing (<i>The Widow of Saint Pierre</i>), takes the 
			middle route with his latest, the story of two strangers whose 
			chance encounter offers each man a fleeting glance at a more 
			desirable life. It’s a “the grass is always greener on the other 
			side” fable about opportunities missed, directed with stately 
			competence and featuring two fine lead performances by Jean 
			Rochefort and early-1960s French rock star Johnny Hallyday as the 
			men who discover that they crave what the other possesses. It is 
			also, more often than not, so static and predictably schematic as to 
			lull viewers into a comfortable slumber.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Milan (Hallyday) is a grizzled old 
			thief who has come to a sleepy provincial town with his sights set 
			on robbing the local bank. When, upon his arrival, he buys soluble 
			aspirin from a pharmacy, a cheerful gentleman named Manesquier 
			(Rochefort) offers to provide him with a glass of water at his 
			house. The two retire to Manesquier’s home, a mansion the former 
			poetry teacher inherited from his mother that is maintained like a 
			museum, and one soon understands that Manesquier is one of its 
			trinkets on display, a man whose comfortable, banal life has left 
			him nearly fossilized. Manesquier is buoyant and talkative around 
			his guest, seemingly awakened from his lifelong slumber by the 
			arrival of this enigmatic traveler, whose muteness hints at mystery, 
			his black leather jacket with fringe suggesting danger and 
			excitement. After twenty years eating in the same restaurant, thirty 
			years teaching in the same school, and a lifetime living in the same 
			house, Manesquier sees in Milan the adventurer he always dreamed of 
			becoming, and begins fantasizing about aiding in the robbery instead 
			of undergoing the heart surgery he has scheduled for that very same 
			morning.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The retired schoolteacher’s lavish, 
			financially secure domesticity appeals mightily to the sullen bank 
			robber, whose leathery skin and steely-eyed gravity conveys the 
			hardships of his nomadic life. Milan fantasizes of lounging amongst 
			the luxurious accoutrements of Manesquier’s abode, free to wile away 
			the day doing nothing more than playing the piano and smoking a 
			pipe. Both men recognize what they represent for one another, and 
			it’s not long before Manesquier is introducing Milan to the joys of 
			wearing slippers, while Milan is teaching Manesquier how to fire a 
			pistol. Yet it seems likely that, come Saturday, Milan will have to 
			go through with the hold-up &nbsp;-- &nbsp;although he momentarily bails on 
			his criminal partners, his lack of money and tangible alternatives 
			make his participation in the crime inevitable &nbsp;-- &nbsp;and Manesquier 
			will, like the responsible adult that he is, go under the knife.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With the estimable Rochefort and 
			brooding Hallyday as its leading men, <i>Man on the Train</i> pulls 
			off a formidable feat: as a result of its fine central performances, 
			the film engages us for much longer than its hopelessly sappy and 
			sluggish plot should. With his trademark moustache here symbolizing 
			an inability to break free from routine, Rochefort handles his role 
			like an old pro, channeling Manesquier’s timidity and unhappiness 
			through the character’s excitable reaction to Milan’s arrival &nbsp;-- 
			&nbsp;it is through Manesquier’s newfound energetic moments that we feel 
			the weight of his oppressively dull day-to-day life. Hallyday is 
			given the more reserved assignment, conveying hopeless yearning 
			through studied stillness and inexpressiveness. His Milan is a man 
			whose clothing and cigarettes say as much about who he is as 
			anything coming out of his mouth, and Hallyday &nbsp;-- &nbsp;a man who looks 
			like he’s carried his fair share of burdens &nbsp;-- &nbsp;effortlessly slides 
			into the character’s skin. As the film crawls toward its overly 
			convenient conclusion, it’s refreshing to find that Rochefort and 
			Hallyday’s complementary performances seduce us, somewhat against 
			our will, into caring about these unlikely friends.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Leconte interrupts the story’s 
			monotony with occasional attempts at humor, and a couple of them &nbsp;-- 
			&nbsp;Manesquier’s childlike impersonation of Wyatt Earp in the mirror 
			while wearing Milan’s leather jacket, and his surprising demands 
			during a trip to the barber &nbsp;-- &nbsp;are effective enough to hint at the 
			better film lurking just beneath this one’s turgid veneer. More 
			often than not, however, this paper-thin film plods along in an 
			inoffensive but unimpressive daze, wistfully showing us the price 
			one pays not chasing his or her dreams. I can’t disagree with such 
			an irrefutable sentiment, but when it comes to Manesquier and Milan 
			&nbsp;-- &nbsp;two losers who never had the mettle to truly take a chance in 
			life &nbsp;-- &nbsp;I can’t shake the feeling that these cowardly fools wind 
			up getting what they deserve.</font></td>
