			</font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>,
            25 April 2003</i></font><p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The opening shot of Josée 
			Dayan's film, <i>Cet Amour-là</i>, shows the young Yann Andréa, in 
			summer whites, rising from behind and walking over the top of a sea 
			wall -- appropriate, since sea walls figured the early works of the 
			writer Marguerite Duras. Andréa was twenty-eight when he first met 
			Duras (played by Jeanne Moreau in Dayan's film) in Trouville, on 
			France's Normandy coast, at a time when she was in a fallow period 
			as a novelist and writing commentary for the newspaper &quot;Libération&quot;. 
			During the next sixteen years, Duras would enter a prolific period, 
			during which she worked not only as a novelist but also as a 
			filmmaker, and during which she would write her 1984 novel, <i>The 
			Lover</i>, which became an international success. Andréa would 
			become Duras' companion, lover, and, oft-times, typist and 
			secretary, and occasional object of abuse -- Duras was a genuine 
			French <i>sacré monstre</i>, a gifted artist who was not all that 
			great on other people. It is something of an accomplishment that 
			Andréa stayed with her for sixteen years, until her death in 1986, 
			and that Dayan's film does not turn into a shallow or one-sided 
			treatment of their relationship, even though, by acknowledging both 
			the finer and harsher aspects, it emerges as something believable 
			and involving but also sad, a love story that has a pall cast at the 
			end made up of emotions and experience that cannot easily be 
			equivocated or erased.</b></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What did they want from each other? 
			Duras was sixty-five-years-old when she and Yann meet. Yann had 
			become infatuated with Duras after reading her works; she was 
			looking for a &quot;voice&quot; to put to the words in his letters to her 
			(they had corresponded extensively before meeting in-person). As 
			Yann, the young actor Aymeric Demarigny has a supple body and a face 
			which recalls the looks of the young John Lennon. He also has a bit 
			of an unformed quality to him, and at first it looks as if his 
			performance may be a little soft and unformed, too, even mealy. That 
			does not prove to be the case. His Yann feigns charmingly with Duras 
			at first, indicating that he would like something more from her but 
			not wanting to push it, wanting it to be spontaneous and mutual. 
			She, not surprisingly, does not want to get mixed up with another 
			acolyte who'll take what they want from her and then go. Duras has 
			been living alone, and you can see how she does not want to let out 
			emotions within her that are powerful and have the capacity to 
			become hurtful. Which perhaps explains the many instances, during 
			their first meeting, when she stands back and scrutinizes him: when 
			she asks him to open a bottle of red wine that they'll sit down and 
			share together, she looks at him with what seems like pitiless 
			scrutiny, looking for any telltale indications that might reveal 
			greater flaws in his character as he goes about uncorking the 
			bottle.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">During the time when Yann and Duras 
			live together, first in Trouville, later in a house outside of 
			Paris, he suffers her moods, such as when she says she wants him out 
			because she does not know him (in the film, she doesn't ask all that 
			much), that he drives her to drink (her choice); she tosses his 
			suitcase out the window, and says, &quot;Voila, ce fait.&quot; They laugh and 
			listen to what amount to silly love songs -- &quot;La Vie en Rose&quot;, 
			&quot;Capri, c'est Fini&quot; -- and a combustion of strong emotion will 
			suddenly well up inside of Duras, and we see her react -- oh, no, 
			not this again -- to what's happening in her. Duras is shown saying 
			cutting things about Yann to his face, to other people. She talks a 
			great deal about herself. When he's had enough and tries to leave, 
			she smiles a wicked smile and says, what's the point, 'cause he'll 
			be back. (He is.) She wants him to stay by her side, do nothing (or, 
			at least, not pursue his own interests outside of their 
			relationship); he responds by saying that being with her is not all 
			that easy all of the time.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">However, artists are often 
			self-obsessed -- the act of creating something can be arduous -- and 
			the film gives us this sense of how hard it is for Duras to continue 
			to work and what effect that has on her as a person. What's more, we 
			get some idea of how Yann senses this, and how he develops the 
			strength to stay with her -- not some penny-melodrama, 
			self-sacrificing thing, but he makes his choice because he knows 
			what will happen to her if he does leave her flat, and that the 
			results could be terrible. It's this that balances the film during 
			those moments such as when Duras tells Yann that he's a &quot;big zero&quot; 
			(or, in French, <b><i>zero double</i></b>), because he's mostly 
			there for her, even if it's by his choice.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And Aymeric Demarigny brings great 
			tenderness to his scenes with Jeanne Moreau's Duras. The film 
			conveys that Duras truly needed someone like Yann in her life at 
			that time, and that Yann needed her -- he is certainly a sturdier 
			person at the end than he was at the start -- even if it would 
			ultimately leave him scorched in ways that would not be easily 
			expunged or (to use a phrase Duras employs in the film) &quot;exonerated&quot; 
			by writing (Yann Andréa would write two books about Duras; Duras, 
			for her part, also wrote her own <b><i>roman-à-clef</i></b> about 
			Yann, as well), and would last him the rest of his life.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jeanne Moreau has previously acted 
			in one of the films Marguerite Duras directed, &quot;Nathalie Granger&quot;, 
			in 1973, as well as delivering the narration for Jean-Jacques 
			Annaud's 1992 film version of <i>The Lover</i>. Moreau gives us a 
			Duras who is vulnerable, flawed, charming, excoriating, sometimes 
			achingly sympathetic, and who looks straight at the world---straight 
			at death, love, at being an egotist, at being a writer, at being a 
			mote on the earth. It is a full-fledged, spirited performance, and a 
			fairly brave one -- Duras had trouble with delirium at the end, 
			caused by her drinking and an excessive intake of aspirin, so that 
			she would wake Yann up in the middle of the night to root out 
			&quot;lamias&quot; that were in her room. (And, yes, there is such a creature 
			as a &quot;lamia&quot;.) As much as it is a joy to see Moreau on the screen, 
			again, she gets credit for playing a character who can infuriatingly 
			treat the men in her life with such bruskness as, &quot;I gotta get 
			myself another <b><i>mec</i></b>, and fast!&quot; Pleasantness all the 
			time on the screen can be pretty boring, as well, but turning 
			unpleasantness into art that is rewarding is something that is rare 
			and most deserving of our attention.</font></td>
