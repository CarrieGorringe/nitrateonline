			<font size="2">Benicio Del Toro looks appropriately haunted in <i>
			The Hunted</i>. As Aaron Hallam, a hyper-trained military assassin 
			who loses his bearing when he slices open one too many gullets, De 
			Toro is burdened with the film's emotional and moral significance. 
			And, given that Aaron is by definition a &quot;killing machine,&quot; he has a 
			hard time expressing himself. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Unfortunately, 
			Aaron's dilemma is exacerbated by its position in a film that 
			becomes increasingly incoherent. It might be argued that this 
			turmoil reflects the poor guy's internal roilings, but William 
			Friedkin's movie never makes that commitment. In fact, it cuts 
			around three ways, among Aaron and two other characters, super-sober 
			teacher of assassins L.T. Bonham (Tommy Lee Jones, survivor of 
			Friedkin's <i>Rules of Engagement</i>) and mostly-by-the-book FBI 
			agent Abby Durrell (Connie Nielsen, about to be a survivor of John 
			McTiernan's <i>Basic</i>). But while this might allow for an 
			intriguing ambiguity of moral ground, the film rather lapses into a 
			soupy lack of perspective. None of the characters is particularly 
			compelling or committed, and so, you end up not caring much what 
			happens to any of them. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">This rampant 
			confusion may have to do with the film's reported rush to 
			production, due to the infamous actors' strike that wasn't, followed 
			by a lengthy period on the shelf (consider that most of those 
			non-strike fallout moves were released last year). Or it may have to 
			do with the fact that it is a designated &quot;prequel&quot; to a film that 
			has not yet been shot, also to be directed by Friedkin and star 
			Jones, tentatively called <i>Shooter</i> and based on Stephen 
			Hunter's novel, <i>Point of Impact</i>. With the original project 
			yet unmade, the disjointedness of the second (or rather, now the 
			first), scripted by David and Peter Griffiths (who wrote <i>
			Collateral Damage</i>) might make sense. Such conjecturing is mildly 
			intriguing, but it only leads back to the film now released. And <i>
			The Hunted</i> is a mess, no matter how it got that way. </font>
			</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">It begins in a 
			rage, with those ominous, painfully self-important lines from Bob 
			Dylan's &quot;Highway 61 Revisited,&quot; recited by Johnny Cash Himself 
			(currently in brilliant resurrection in his single-and-video, a 
			cover of Trent Reznor's &quot;Hurt&quot;). &quot;Oh God said to Abraham, 'Kill me a 
			son,'&quot; Cash intones, his gravel voice lending the proceedings a 
			weight that will be wholly unwarranted in about ten minutes. 
			&quot;'Well,' Abe says, 'Where do you want this killing done?' God says, 
			'Out on Highway 61!'&quot; </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">As if this 
			stroll down memory lane isn't daunting enough, the first visuals are 
			equally momentous, subtitled &quot;Dakovica, Kosovo, 1996.&quot; This recent 
			interventionist disaster appears as a hellfire of explosions and 
			gunfire reigns over the screen, intercut with shots of Aaron's eyes, 
			sunk into his camouflage face paint, darting and worrying. When one 
			of his fellow officers helpfully notes, &quot;This isn't a war! It's a 
			massacre!&quot; you get the idea that the Serbs aren't fighting by 
			whatever rules war is supposed to have. Instead, the commander 
			hisses, &quot;They f*cked our mothers, so we will f*ck theirs,&quot; gazes 
			reverently on a poster of Milosevic, then orders the murder of all 
			villagers, just because he can. The sheer malevolence of this target 
			makes it look like Aaron is doing a right thing. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Still, the 
			sequence ends badly, as Aaron jumps on the commander, like Willard 
			on Kurtz, all bloody ceremonial gutting and slashing. This 
			viciousness, for which he has been so carefully trained, explains, 
			sort of, just why Aaron steps off once he's Stateside. By 2003, he's 
			hunting deer hunters in the Oregon woods, taking them out with 
			lethal precision, using only his gift for camouflage and serrated 
			knife. Perturbed that they're pursuing their gentle prey with 
			high-powered weapons, Aaron whispers at them, hoarsely, as if from 
			nowhere (an exceedingly banal effect). &quot;When you kill with your 
			hands, there is a reverence. There is no reverence in what you do.&quot; 
			Oooohkay... </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Whatever he 
			thinks he means, it's clear that Aaron has formidable issues. He 
			takes these soon-whimpering orange-vested guys with a few 
			ritualistic swipes of his knife; and for a second, you might feel 
			inclined to believe him when he insists that they're actually sent 
			to hunt him, no the deer scampering through the trees. That notion 
			is soon put to rest, however, when L.T. comes on the scene, 
			reluctantly, of course, because heroes in such situations must 
			always be reluctant. Retired to the snowy nether-regions of British 
			Columbia -- where he saves a stunning white wolf, wounded by a snare 
			-- L.T. is only convinced to &quot;come back&quot; when he learns that the 
			shooter is likely (oh, dear) &quot;my boy.&quot; </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Thus rather 
			tediously transformed into Colonel Trautman to Aaron's Rambo (a 
			relationship underscored by the Abraham reference), L.T. has to hold 
			up under an onslaught of flashbacks detailing the training he laid 
			on his &quot;boy.&quot; He feels all kinds of guilt and distress, especially 
			as he's never had to kill anyone, himself, only train squads of kids 
			to do it, then send them forth into their own personal moral 
			purgatories. He does recall, when pressed by Abby, that this 
			particular boy had a remarkable lack of remorse (good for the U.S. 
			military, bad for the general public). This despite the fact that he 
			sent multiple letters to L.T., requesting help dealing with his 
			&quot;nightmares&quot;: &quot;How come you didn't answer my letters?&quot; he moans 
			during one outstandingly silly encounter. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">As if to 
			stretch your patience to the absolute limit, the film includes a 
			plot that may (or may not) have been more cogent in an earlier 
			version of the script, wherein Aaron looks up an old girlfriend, 
			Irene (Leslie Stefanson), with an accent designed to make her sound 
			earnest and earthy (&quot;I said I ain't seen 'im in months!&quot;), or maybe 
			just uninformed, so she could have been his girlfriend in the first 
			place. The primary reason for Aaron's visit with Irene appears to be 
			so he can talk about squirrels and kitties and &quot;natural&quot; hunting 
			with her cute little girl Loretta (Jenna Boyd), and so remind you 
			that his expertise -- as hunter and hunted -- is a weird kind of 
			fate, or maybe just bad luck. Or perhaps it's the government's 
			fault: certainly, the Aryan-looking military specialists who come 
			after him appear to deserve their own grisly ends. </font></span>
			</p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">This pile-on of 
			motives and angst is increasingly bulky. Even worse is the series of 
			stunts and images lifted from <i>The Fugitive</i>. While <i>The 
			Hunted</i> is missing that special moment when Aaron might turn to 
			his hunter and whine, &quot;I didn't kill my wife!&quot; there are plenty of 
			other reminders of Jones' famous role (reprised, lamely, in <i>U.S. 
			Marshals</i>), including about six waterfalls of varying sizes and 
			shapes, urban (in a park in Portland) and the boonie mountainside 
			(where the film ends, grandly and <i>Rambo</i>-like). </font></span>
			</p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">In fact, the 
			urban chase business might have been more interesting, more like <i>
			Predator 2</i> (if you're going to rip off, do so from the most 
			bizarre): one early screenplay reportedly had Aaron camouflaging 
			himself in downtown Portland, so expertly that he could stand 
			against a building wall and seem invisible. Unfortunately, this 
			extravagance sounds almost sane compared to what ends up on screen 
			in <i>The Hunted</i>, which is rife with impossible changes in 
			physical location (like, L.T. is in one place, then suddenly in 
			another, with no accounting for time spent on the road or in the 
			air) and noticeably muddled editing. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Amid all this 
			father-son business, Abby has precious little to do, but hang out 
			with the other minority types -- her boss, Van Zandt (Ron Canada, 
			here stuck playing the standard-issue black chief who sits behind 
			his desk and blusters) and her partner, Bobby (José Zúñiga, playing 
			an equally annoying stereotype, however admirably). But then, how 
			could she possibly compete with the pandemonium of the masculine 
			psyche, spread out, as it is here, across so vast a literal and 
			ethical landscape? These unfortunate sons assume all the blame and 
			brutality of the military mission, until it becomes unbearable. As 
			corny and confused as the film is, it never loses sight of that 
			tragedy. </font></span></td>
