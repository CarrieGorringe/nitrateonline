            <p align="left"><font face="Verdana" size="6">Piglet's Big Movie<br>
            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 21 March 2003</i></font><p>
			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">There's an innate charm to the 
			residents of A. A. Milne's Hundred Acre Wood that makes even the 
			most uninspired adaptations of his work tolerable. Winnie the Pooh 
			and his cohorts are still cute and loveable, but the movies have a 
			mere fraction of the appeal that runs through Milne's original 
			stories. <i>Piglet's Big Movie</i>, which focuses on Pooh's 
			diminutive porcine pal, even repeats some of Milne's original tales 
			plot point-for-plot point. If only the movie could also emulate the 
			wit and affection in the books. In Milne's hands, the pessimistic 
			donkey Eeyore (&quot;Good morning, if it is a good morning, which I 
			doubt.&quot;), the self-important Owl and the maternal Kanga became both 
			endearing and often riotously funny. </font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The quips and presentation in <i>
			Piglet's Big Movie</i> thankfully have the warmth but not much of 
			the humor in the books. As a kid, I was drawn to Milne's world not 
			because it was age-appropriate but because it was hilarious. 
			Eeyore's dour outlook and Pooh's spectacular appetite and 
			misjudgments (he knocks at the door of his own house waiting for the 
			owner to answer it) left me in stitches. Seeing the new film is like 
			listening to a teacher reciting Shakespeare's <i>Richard III</i> 
			after you've seen Ian McKellen take on the role. The beauty of the 
			language is there, but the soul and the magic are gone.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Most of <i>Piglet's Big Movie</i> 
			is devoted to a honey heist that goes bad. Pooh, Tigger (both voiced 
			by Jim Cummings), Eeyore (Peter Cullen) and Rabbit (Ken Sansom) 
			reduce Piglet (John Fielder) to a mere observer because he is too 
			small. The fact that Piglet is smarter than the rest of the bunch 
			combined isn't entered into the equation.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When the bees get upset about 
			losing their handiwork to the thieves, the rest of the crew gets 
			separated from Piglet. Fearing the worst, they try to track down 
			their buddy by following clues that he's left in his scrapbook. The 
			document recalls their adventure -- like the quest for the North 
			Pole and the discovery that Kanga and Roo weren't hostile --from 
			Piglet's point of view. Pooh and the rest soon realize that Piglet 
			has played a much more important role in their lives than they 
			imagined.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Milne is thankfully credited for 
			some of the direct copying (the North Pole campaign and some other 
			incidents are from his stories), and the animation -- which Disney 
			outsourced to a Japanese studio -- is far better than the TV 
			episodes. Nonetheless, there is still a sense of indifference that 
			Pooh and his friends simply don't deserve. The message that physical 
			size has nothing to do with an individual's worth is certainly one 
			that children should hear, but it would have seemed less fulsome if 
			the story had been a little more fun.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Carly Simon's tunes aren't vintage 
			offerings, but her enthusiasm for the enterprise is obvious and 
			welcome. She even shows up in person at the end to serenade the 
			audience. If the rest of the film had her devotion, its flaws could 
			easily be overlooked.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After the movie finished, I 
			overheard a mother tell her kids that the movie has been taken from 
			books by a man named A.A. Milne and that Christopher Robin was his 
			little boy. I quickly got the sense that she was shortly going to 
			read the children the stories. <i>Piglet's Big Movie</i> is an 
			agreeable, if fitfully entertaining, introduction to Milne's 
			characters. But it's no substitute for going by the book.</font></td>
