            most welcome surprise of the festival was the arrival of Lars von
            Trier, in two films, both as director and actor, and both in top
            form. Von Trier’s much-anticipated <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Dogville</i>
            is, despite its 177-minute running length and its horrifying subject
            matter -- the progressive dehumanization of one Grace Margaret
            Mulligan (Nicole Kidman), a young woman on the run from gangsters in
            1930’s America -- well worth the effort of slogging through to a
            very satisfying coda. Once Grace arrives in town, the people of
            Dogville appear to accept her need for help, especially Tom (Paul
            Bettany), a failed writer who seems trapped by the town’s stifling
            boredom, its corruption, isolation and hypocrisy, as he sees it.
            It’s obvious that Grace is in serious trouble; no sooner is she
            hiding in the town’s abandoned mine, then a large car pulls up on
            Elm Street, a hand proffers a business card to Tom, and a mysterious
            voice implores him to call with any information concerning her
            whereabouts. After the visit, the people of Dogville offer her
            refuge for a two-week trial period. In exchange, the grateful Grace
            volunteers to do chores for them. Soon, she has a very busy schedule
            and has won their affection: most appropriately, at a Fourth-of-July
            picnic, they offer her permanent residence. <o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">Dogville
            is, however, a small town, with its share of unspoken, petty
            rivalries and hidden lusts, and it isn’t long before Grace, with
            her beauty and intelligence, innocently manages to run afoul of
            every one of them. She is gradually turned into a slave, forced by
            verbal and physical abuse to follow everyone’s wishes to the
            letter. Desperate, she attempts escape, but is betrayed, and returns
            to Dogville, where she is forced to endure the ultimate indignity:
            chained to her bed with a heavy steel collar around her neck, she
            becomes the town whore. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">Embarrassed
            by what her and their actions have inadvertently revealed to the
            people of Dogville about themselves, they conspire to get rid of
            her, and they think they know how to do it very cleanly and
            conveniently. However, Grace has a few surprises in store for
            them…<o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-ansi-language: EN-US">In
            lesser hands, this torturous unfolding of
            Peyton-Place-meets-the-Gulag would be all but intolerable, and at
            times it seems as if von Trier is laying things on a little too
            thickly; the minimalist <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Our
            Town</i> sets, in which all of the actors are reduced to running
            around on little more than a painted outline on a soundstage, do
            tend to overstate the pettiness of Dogville itself, to the point
            where one wants to pull out one’s hair at the overbearing
            obviousness of it all (or maybe it’s the gameboard-like symbolism
            of the sets, with all of the actors as pawns in von Trier’s
            sadistic psychological game). What saves <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Dogville
            </i>the film from becoming like its dreary fictional counterpart is
            the spirit that the actors bring to the project. Kidman and Bettany
            play their roles like cool poker players, each never revealing their
            intentions until the final moments of the film, adding to the
            tension of the piece. Von Trier also deftly supplies them with
            excellent supporting actors such as Chloe Sevigny and Patricia
            Clarkson. Throwing in a few veterans such as Ben Gazzara and Lauren
            Bacall only adds to the richness of the psychological mix. But it is
            the strength of the ending which reveals the deceptive simplicity of
            all that von Trier has presented beforehand. Both Grace and Tom have
            hidden surprises for each other and their final showdown has
            consequences for everyone in Dogville. It is to von Trier’s credit
            that, in having saved up, as it were, all of the film’s energy for
            one slam-bang ending, he has left no inconsistencies or
            contradictions in its wake.<o:p>

            <font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family: Times New Roman; mso-ansi-language: EN-US; mso-fareast-language: EN-US; mso-bidi-language: AR-SA">According
            to some reports, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Dogville</i> is supposed to be the beginning of a planned trilogy which
            von Trier intends to make as an &quot;indictment of America&quot;
            (just in case the director’s attitude isn’t clear, the final
            credits consist of David Bowie singing &quot;Young American&quot;
            over WPA photos from the Depression). Not to take anything away from
            von Trier’s achievements, but this sort of exclusion and
            persecution is not an exclusively American phenomenon, as the course
            of history makes depressingly evident. This is not the sort of
            so-called selfish individualism that tends to make those of
            anti-American sentiments sit up and start ranting, unless one wants
            to think of Dogville in the aggregate as a group acting in sinister,
            conformist lockstep, and it’s a valid argument. Still, von Trier
            might want to immerse himself more profoundly in American culture
            before attempting number two.</span></font>
