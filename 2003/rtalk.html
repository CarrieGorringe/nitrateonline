            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Spanish writer-director Pedro
            Almodóvar makes movies that warm the cockles of your heart while
            putting a knot in your stomach. His <i>Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!</i>
            features Antonio Banderas as the most sympathetic stalker-home
            invader in screen history. Almodóvar is about the only filmmaker
            who'd make an elaborate series of gags built around a rape -- and
            come close to getting away with it. His latest movie, <i>Talk to Her</i>,
            offers more of the same. Fortunately, Almodóvar also includes a
            tighter and more sophisticated narrative and some genuine surprises.
            He toys with audience expectations, confirming suspicions at some
            points and demolishing them at others.</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film's opening is a perfect
            example. He cuts between a morose-looking ballet sequence and two
            men watching from the audience. At first glance, the two appear to
            be lovers, albeit mismatched ones. The portly, boyish-looking
            Benigno (Javier Cámara, <i>Sex and Lucia</i>) is paying only polite
            attention, whereas the tall, lean and bald Marco (Darío Grandinetti)
            is moved to tears by the bizarre dance. We quickly discover that the
            two are actually strangers who just happened to be seated next to
            each other. Benigno works as a male nurse, and his only patient is
            Alicia (Leonor Watling), a former dance student who has been
            comatose for four years. The nurse looks after her as if she were
            his own daughter, describing his latest happenings with her as if
            she could hear him and respond.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Argentinean Marco winds up
            getting to know Benigno when as similar tragedy happens to someone
            close to him. Working as a journalist and travel writer in Madrid,
            he comes across a potential story about a bullfighter named Lydia
            (Rosario Flores, <i>Danzón</i>), who usually gets more publicity
            for her romantic issues than for her obvious skill in the ring.
            After giving her a ride and ridding her house of a snake, Marco
            winds up landing both her story and her heart. But the match may not
            have been meant to be because a bull literally knocks the life out
            of her and sends her to a hospital room next to Alicia.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Because of the gaudy colors and the
            almost dreamlike fluency of Javier Aguirresarobe's camerawork, this
            prolonged double-date between two men and their unconscious
            paramours is both outlandish and weirdly credible. It works because
            the two men also wind up exorcising their demons in the process.
            Because of his job and his longing eyes, nobody seems to be able to
            tell what Benigno's sexuality is. Alicia's father takes comfort in a
            stranger caressing his daughter because he thinks Benigno is gay.
            But having lived almost all of his adult life caring for his mother,
            Benigno says he's never had sex with anyone one and talks about
            Alicia as if the two were in an active relationship.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Marco retreats to his dreams where
            he and Lydia are still whole, but he's still haunted by the fact
            that his final afternoon with Lydia consisted almost entirely of his
            own chatter. Even though he's more settled in the head than Benigno,
            Marco is as paralyzed inside as Lydia is physically. Apparently
            ballets aren't the only things that make him burst into tears. From
            here, Almodóvar sets up another perverse jolt. <i>Talk to Her</i>
            has already made an impact in its native country. Spain refused to
            submit the film for Oscar consideration because of this development.
            His greatest offense might be that he manages to make this
            subversive thinking compelling.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Almodóvar pulls his viewers into
            the same mindset as his protagonists. When Lydia puts on her
            bullfighting costume, the camera follows her body and the florid
            costume in loving detail, making her look both feminine and
            androgynously tough. The outfit is so tight that she needs a male
            assistant to help her into it, making the simple act of dressing
            look oddly and engrossingly kinky. Similarly, he also makes the
            hospital scenes look both tender and steamy. In contrast to the
            sterile walls, Benigno and Alicia's time together has a warmth and
            intimacy that stands out in the environment. Almodóvar also scores
            some wonderful bits of satire. With marvelous precision, he skewers
            celebrity journalists who pretend to be friendly with their subjects
            while prying them for embarrassing details (Has he seen any Barbara
            Walters specials?).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>He
            also pokes fun at occupational euphemisms. In Almodóvar's Spain,
            prisoners are called &quot;interns.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For all of his clever visual and
            verbal touches, the potentially sordid material wouldn't work if the
            cast wasn't universally solid. With little relative screen time,
            Flores and Watling both leave vivid impressions. The cherub-faced Cámara
            projects an innocuous sweetness that could make one forgive him for
            mass murder. There's also a welcome supporting turn from Geraldine
            Chaplin as Alicia's dance teacher. Thanks to his fertile imagination
            and talented support, Almodóvar will continue to make potentially
            offensive ideas engrossingly, even if he's overdue for some serious
            counseling.<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
