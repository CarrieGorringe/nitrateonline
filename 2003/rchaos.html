            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by <a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias
            Savada</a>, 17 January 2003</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In director-writer Coline
            Serreau's digital feature <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Chaos</i>,
            French men are cinematic pond scum. No, it's not a Gallic-specific
            concept, per se, just happenstance that the filmmaker practices her
            craft on that part of the planet, where she gave birth in 1985 to
            the original <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Three Men and a
            Cradle</i> (for which a sequel, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">18
            Years Later</i>, is in production under her direction). As it turns
            out, men as a universal group are considerably worse off by the
            final reel. Women, a heretofore subservient gender in the Islamic
            and bourgeois worlds as depicted in this subtly humorous melodrama,
            are fully inclined to drain the stagnant, phallic waters from their
            lives, put the sting of a Dixie Chick or two back in their lives,
            and bask in their own gloriously feminist spotlight. You won't hear
            Helen Reddy pontificating on the soundtrack, but here is one film
            where women invincibly roar.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The utterly middle class life of
            businessman Paul Vidal (Vincent Lindon) and his compliant wife Hélène
            (Catherine Frot) becomes unraveled in the streets of Paris one
            weekend when an already badly beaten woman, begging for her life, is
            rebuffed by the callous husband and his seemingly indifferent
            spouse. He instinctively locks the car doors rather than give aid.
            After viewing the bloody assault by three fleet-footed thugs, Paul
            asks for a tissue, exits his vehicle and tends to his
            blood-spattered windshield, a glass that could have provided safety
            to the battered victim laying nearby. The couple and their apathy
            flee the scene as the police approach, Paul opting for a fresh car
            washing rather than heeding Hélène's plea to telephone for an
            ambulance.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In their frantic
            professional/personal world, the Vidals have no place for such
            unwanted accidents. He has his business to run, she's an obedient
            worker, wife, and mother to their ne'er-do-well son Fabrice (Aurélien
            Wiik). When Paul's mother (Line Renaud) arrives for her annual
            visit, Paul has no time for her either, rebuffing her with lies. Of
            course, Hélène endures the same evasive treatment from her son and
            his two-timing lifestyle.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Such is the unsporting &quot;like
            father, like son&quot; thread that Serreau drives into her audience
            with all the wry, satirical subtlety of a sledgehammer. Without
            reason, Hélène finds her conscience and tracks down the injured
            woman, who we learn through her well-scripted but excessively
            voiced-over back story, is a serious-minded, financial-savvy,
            high-priced call girl who has suffered years of torture and rape,
            kicked a smack habit, scammed a rich, old Swiss geezer and, briefly,
            her sadistic pimps, of hundreds of millions of dollars. Full circle,
            she ends up fleeing in fear for her life and being nearly run down
            by a car in Paris. This middle portion is the weakest part of the
            film, that perhaps would have been better served by repeating
            certain elements from a different point of view, as done in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Run,
            Lola, Run</i> or Doug Liman's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Go</i>.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While Hélène plays guardian angel
            to the comatose and then recovering victim, she ward offs annoying
            trivialities tossed at her by Paul and Fabrice. She plays vigilante
            for the immobile hooker, fighting back against the men threatening
            the 22-year-old prostitute. Further details reveal that six years
            earlier she escaped from an Algerian family of brutish brothers and
            a horrid, abusive father intent on pimping, er shipping, her back to
            Algeria as a child bride for 20,000 francs.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The last third of the film picks up
            with a greed-induced sting that finds a frazzled father and drop-out
            son in love with the same girl, the bad guys getting a proper
            comeuppance, a shipside rescue, and Hélène finding the better side
            of her mother-in-law.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The multiple story lines revolve
            around the dissolution between husband-wife, mother-son (over two
            generations), son-girlfriends, and father-daughter. It's quite a
            scorecard, and balancing atop the scale is the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Thelma
            and Louise</i> bond that grows between odd couple Hélène and
            Malika Tarek (or Noémie Totka as she now is known), and the
            strained relationship of the latter with her estranged younger
            sister Zora (Hajar Nouma). The comic repercussions track the Vidal
            relationships breaking down, with Hélène spending more time with
            her new friend and unplugging herself from the emotionally-vacant
            men in her life. Particularly amusing are the heartless lordships'
            escalating inabilities to cope with even the most mundane domestic
            responsibilities (finding a cheese grater, getting a suit ironed,
            unblocking the dishwasher, cleaning the sink, etc.) or doling out
            bad lonelyhearts advice(&quot;Love only exists in magazines.&quot;).<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Serreau grabs the audience into the
            lively action with a constantly observing, hand-held camera and
            close-up action. You never feel more than a step or two away from
            the characters, particularly Frot, who imbues her role with a
            lovely, almost laissez-faire, confidence, and athlete-turned-actress
            Rachida Brakni giving a standout role as Noémie/Malika (which
            earned her a César award, the French equivalent of the Oscar, for
            Most Promising Actress). She has a very strong, expressive face and
            huge eyes that reflect the agony that has shaped her character. The
            film also received well-deserved nominations for Frot (Best
            Actress), Line Renaud (Supporting Actress), and two for Serreau
            (Best Film and Best Writing). The deft editing by Catherine Renault
            and intriguing score crafted by Ludovic Navarre excites you as more
            of the plotlines are revealed. There are many, many short scenes,
            all pushing the film along and either battering down the lame male
            characters (only the police get a fair shake) or showing off the
            feminine characters' intelligence. As for Lindon and Wiik's flaky,
            black sheep portrayals, only one word comes to mind: Disinheritance.<o:p>
