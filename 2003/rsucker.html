			</font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>, 24 January 2003</i></font><p>
			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">For better and for worse, <i>Super 
			Sucker</i> doesn’t quite live up to its title. Actor Jeff Daniels’ 
			second film as a writer-director has some of the tastelessness one 
			would associate with his former supervisors the Farrelly Brothers, 
			who directed him in <i>Dumb and Dumber</i>.&nbsp; <i>Super Sucker </i>has 
			some guilt inducing laughs and pointed barbs at the eerier aspects 
			of sales culture and its unnatural emphasis on positive thinking. 
			What <i>Super Sucker</i> lacks is a consistent outrageousness and 
			the kind of rampant creativity the Farrellys use to counteract their 
			vulgarity. As a writer, Daniels comes up with about forty-five 
			minutes of inspired silliness, but, eventually,&nbsp; <i>Super Sucker </i>
			winds up being a one-joke film.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Admittedly, that joke is often 
			funnier than it should be. Daniels stars as Fred Barlow, a 
			door-to-door vacuum cleaner salesman whose enthusiasm for his 
			product results in a creepy sort of emotional attachment -- and 
			we’re not talking about the gizmos he includes with the Super Sucker 
			home cleaning systems. Barlow’s devotion is unnerving because his 
			tears at his mother’s funeral are probably due to the fact that her 
			Super Sucker is being buried with her. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Despite his love for his product, 
			he may have to find another line of work. He’s about to be run out 
			of business by a more well-heeled competitor named Winslow 
			Schnaebelt (Harve Presnell, from <i>Fargo</i> and Daniels’ previous 
			directorial project <i>Escanaba in Da Moonlight</i>). Fred's rivals 
			can organize a parade at the drop of a hat and have no qualms about 
			encroaching on Fred's own territory. Heading home in disgust after 
			yet another futile pitch, Fred discovers why his wife was upset when 
			someone described a Super Sucker as being merely a &quot;vacuum.&quot; A long 
			forgotten attachment called a &quot;Homemaker's Little Helper,&quot; winds up 
			having unintended benefits. While some people might object to 
			finding their spouses having more than an emotional tie to a 
			household appliance, Fred sees a potential goldmine. Gathering up 
			thousands of the now antiquated attachments, he finds customers who 
			are now willing to pay cash to own the entire machines. Of course, 
			not only does Fred have to keep ahead of Schnaebelt, he has to watch 
			out for a mysterious regulatory agency that doesn't take kindly to 
			his brand of creativity. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As corny and wince-inducing as this 
			sounds, Daniels and his able cast of Michigan-based actors actually 
			get some mileage out of this premise. The shots of satisfied 
			customers are quick and distant. It's Fred's optimism, not the 
			machines, that's being played for laughs. This is where the film 
			seriously flirts with success. Daniels and the others also nail the 
			language and mannerisms of the sales trade. Having a father in real 
			estate, I can tell you all the pet phrases are captured in this 
			movie. There's an inherent optimism that's crucial for sales that, 
			in some people, can border on delusion. In the early scenes where 
			Fred and his associates run through their pep talks even though 
			their giddy fervor won't solve their problems with Schnaebelt.
			</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After a while, the momentum winds 
			down and doesn't pick up again until the finale when Fred briefly 
			rallies thousands of satisfied customers in the middle of a downtown 
			traffic jam. There are some fitfully amusing nods to <i>Gilligan's 
			Island</i> (that series' star Dawn Wells has a cameo), but for the 
			most part it feels like Daniels is stretching his aphrodisiac 
			vacuums father than their extension chords reach.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Interestingly, <i>Super Sucker</i> 
			has opened in over 100 theaters in the Midwest and may expand 
			depending on its performance. While it's nice to see a locally made 
			film find an audience outside of the Hollywood system, one wishes a 
			more fully equipped comedy had benefited from this pitch.</font></p>
