            demonstrated conclusively that she's a whole lotta woman in <i>Goldmember</i>
            (not to mention the many iterations of &quot;Crazy in Love,&quot;
            the summer's runaway single, that she performed everywhere and
            always with lavish energy), Beyoncé Knowles now shows another side.
            Sort of. In <i>The Fighting Temptations</i>, the splendiferous
            Beyoncé plays a spunky single mother in small town Georgia, singing
            in smoky clubs to support her adorable child. Gloriously talented
            and supermodel-beautiful even when she's made up to seem to wear no
            makeup, Lilly keeps her own peace by avoiding contact with her
            neighbors. <o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">This
            tentative tranquility is disturbed by the arrival of Darrin (Cuba
            Gooding, Jr.), a onetime homeboy who long ago moved away with his
            mother (Faith Evans in flashbacks), who, like Lilly, was kicked out
            of church (and barred from church singing) because she wasn't pious
            enough for the ladies. <o:p>

            lady in particular has the power to do all this snubbing, the
            reverend's sister Paulina (LaTanya Richardson). When she sees
            Darrin, her hackles come up, but little does she know how strained
            her life is about to turn. Darrin, you know even before he arrives
            in town, is in his own peck of trouble, with a backstory that blames
            mom. Apparently, he's learned to be a good liar from his dear
            departed and ever-struggling mama (and thank goodness she's dead, or
            Faith would be playing mama in old-person's makeup to Gooding: not a
            pretty idea), and so, the film's logic has it, now in some difficult
            financial straits credit card debt and newly fired from a New York
            City ad agency. <o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Darrin
            has returned to Monte Carlo, Georgia for his favorite, recently
            deceased aunt's (Ann Nesby) funeral, whereupon he meets with his old
            buddy Lucius (Mike Epps, on hand for broad comic diversions and
            wisecracks about local &quot;booty&quot;) and learns that he's in
            line for a considerable inheritance from auntie, if he directs the
            Beulah Baptist Church choir all the way to the Gospel Explosion. If
            they win, he gets $150,000. That is, enough to pay off his debts.
            His efforts to achieve this goal entail gathering together all the
            nearby talent he can find, beginning, of course, with Lilly. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Darrin
            catches up with her in the smoky club, where she's singing
            &quot;Fever,&quot; and yes, she gets him all heated up. Though she
            puts him off, thinking he's a slick city feller, he's determined to
            win the prize, and eventually, to win her over. And herein lies the
            principal trouble for <i>The Fighting Temptations</i>: Lilly is
            right. Darrin is a slick city feller, and even when he gets back in
            touch with his basically decent Southern boy's morality (or rather,
            discovers it for the first time, because it's unclear that he ever
            showed generosity or sweetness even as a child). While Darrin is
            plainly supposed to follow in the footsteps of other citified folks
            who go home again (Reese Witherspoon in <i>Sweet Home Alabama</i>,
            Michael J. Fox in <i>Doc Hollywood</i>), there's not a minute where
            Gooding's performance convinces you this is possible. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">In
            part, this is a function of Gooding's baggage: has any performer
            made so many crushingly bad choices in a row (beginning with that
            on-stage dance when he won a Supporting Actor Oscar for <i>Jerry
            Maguire</i>, but more notably, movies like <i>Snow Dogs</i>, <i>Rat
            Race</i>, and <i>Boat Trip</i>)? Here, Gooding's infamous Energizer
            buzziness tends to overwhelm the moment -- any moment -- underlining
            Darrin's displacement tensions and overstating his lack of focus. As
            practical-minded and painfully honest as Lilly is declared to be,
            it's not a little farfetched that she would fall for this pretender.
            (Even when Knowles looks off her beat in a scene, she consistently
            outclasses Gooding.) <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">For
            all the preposterousness of the premise and the outcome, <i>The
            Fighting Temptations</i> lumbers through the motions, beginning with
            the &quot;hilarious&quot; bad auditions montage, and including the
            barbeque, the Pepsi placements, and the rehearsals. That the choir
            ends up with some prodigious talents involved is the film's saving
            grace. A prisoner from a nearby institution, Johnson (Montell
            Jordan), works his falsetto magic while wearing orange jumpsuit and
            handcuffs, alongside a couple of hiphoppers (T-Bone and Lil Zane),
            who turn &quot;Down By The Riverside&quot; into &quot;Take It Down
            To The River.&quot; Darrin also secures the services of local
            R&amp;B singers Alma (Angie Stone), Bessie (Melba Moore), and jeez!,
            the O'Jays, working as barbers down the street and launching into
            &quot;Loves Me Like a Rock&quot; at the drop of a hat. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">With
            all this going on, it's no wonder that the film sags during the
            dialogue and plot points, and soars during the rousing production
            numbers (soundtrack courtesy of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis), which
            are generally presented in their entirety. (This is save for the
            final competition, when the Blind Boys of Alabama and Mary Mary
            perform on stage for brief seconds, each inexplicably cut off so the
            camera can get back to some backstage shenanigans and inane plot
            sortings.) If only the rest of <i>The Fighting Temptations</i> would
            ease up on the cornball formula and ride with the
            &quot;feeling&quot; its characters are instructed not to
            &quot;fight.&quot; And if only, if only, Miss Lilly had more
            options. <o:p>
