            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Gregory Avery</a>, 24 January 2003</i></font><p>
			<b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Words survive. Plato, Aristotle, 
			St. Matthew, Shakespeare, John Donne, Lady Julian of Norwich -- 
			their words continue to speak to readers today no matter how many 
			centuries may intervene.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Motion pictures, which have only 
			been around for just over one hundred years, now, have not been so 
			lucky. We don't currently have <i>The Greatest Thing in Life</i>, 
			D.W. Griffith's 1919 anti-war and anti-racism drama. Nor <i>
			Remodeling Her Husband</i>, another 1919 film, in which Dorothy Gish 
			was directed, for the first and only time behind the camera, by her 
			sister Lillian. Nor <i>The Shaft of Buried Ideas</i>, a 1927 Czech 
			film whose title cards included passages written by the poet Petr 
			Bezruc. Nor <i>The Merry Monarch</i>, the last English-language film 
			appearance by Emil Jannings, playing a king who had 365 wives, one 
			for each day of the year. It is now estimated that, of the films 
			made before 1950, fifty percent have vanished, either because they 
			were made on unstable nitrate film stock or were just discarded; of 
			the films made between 1893 and 1930, which were made almost 
			entirely on nitrate stock, eighty to ninety percent have vanished. 
			(And the losses haven't all been relegated to the distant past. A 
			recent attempt to re-release the 1973 film, <i>Lemora</i>, resulted 
			in new theatrical film prints being struck from a video master: none 
			of the original film prints, or film elements, could be located.)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">So we are fortunate to have the 
			1915 comedy short which features a newcomer named Buster Keaton and 
			marks the first and only time the great comedian ever laughed on 
			film. Chaplin knew enough to keep all the films he made, including 
			the negatives, outtakes, and footage of uncompleted film projects, 
			under climate-controlled storage conditions. And it is worth noting 
			that, after it was re-released in the early 1980s, after spending 
			decades out of circulation, that Hitchcock's <i>Vertigo </i>suddenly 
			leapt onto many people's lists of the greatest films ever made. 
			Recent editions of American Movie Classic's Film Preservation 
			Festival featured such long-unseen but thoroughly remarkable films 
			such as John Ford's 1933 <i>Pilgrimage </i>-- with a performance by 
			Henrietta Crosman that made you wonder why it wasn't more widely 
			well-known and celebrated -- and Lois Weber's 1915 <i>Hypocrites</i>. 
			These are films which give you something back in exchange for your 
			time and attention, whether it's simple entertainment or something 
			more, such as insight</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>The Garden of Eden</i>, a 1928 
			silent comedy that has recently been given a pristine release on DVD 
			by Flicker Alley, is one of those films which had the ill luck of 
			languishing out-of-sight. It is what the vernacular used to refer to 
			as a &quot;sophisticated comedy.&quot; It takes place at a time when people 
			dressed for dinner, and there were still such things as civility, 
			deftness, and tact. The repartee is witty (and funny), the 
			characters well-mannered (but funny), and the story is capricious 
			and clever (yet funny). It features two stars who may not have 
			attained the enduring fame of Gable and Garbo, but that's nothing to 
			hold against them and they're no less for that in the film than if 
			they had.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Under a Vienna moon -- and over a 
			Vienna bakery.&quot; Toni Lebrun (Corrine Griffith) slips out one night 
			after leaving her slumbering aunt and uncle a note, in which she 
			confesses that she sees no future for herself &quot;making pretzels.&quot; 
			She's studied to be an opera singer, and, degree in hand, takes the 
			train to Budapest, where she has already received a job offer to 
			perform at the Palais de Paris. The Palais, though, turns out to be 
			not much more than a high-priced girlie show (run by a rather butch 
			proprietor, played by Maude George), where the upper-class men can 
			come and openly ogle the girls. After she refuses to wear one 
			costume (mostly consisting of a sequined micro-skirt) onstage, she's 
			tricked into wearing the &quot;Puritan&quot; outfit -- which, when the 
			lighting is just so, becomes transparent. Then, Toni is maneuvered 
			into meeting, in a private room, Henri d'Avril (played by the suave 
			actor and director Lowell Sherman), who, after pouring some 
			champagne into her, expects her to fall right over. That hardly 
			proves to be the case: the lights go out, and the furniture flies. 
			Toni, in protecting herself, loses her job, but has made friends 
			with the backstage seamstress, Rosa (Louise Dresser). Rosa is going 
			on vacation the very next day -- to Monte Carlo, where she has made 
			reservations at one of the ritziest places, the Hotel Eden. Here, 
			for a few weeks every year, Rosa says, .&quot;..I LIVE -- in pre-war 
			style!&quot; Would Toni like to go along with her? After some hemming and 
			hawing, Toni, seeing that Rosa is sincere in her good intentions, 
			agrees.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Cut to one of those spacious, fancy 
			hotels that made moviegoers at the time go to see films like this 
			one. There, Toni catches the eye of a fairly handsome young man 
			(Charles Ray) who doesn't mind her looking at him a bit. He turns 
			out to be Richard Dupont, one of the accepted and established 
			members of the hoi polloi frequenting the hotel, and he and Toni 
			court and spark successfully. However, Toni has also caught the eye 
			of Richard's uncle, a retired colonel (Edward Martindel), and the 
			two men make a deal: Richard will get a chance to propose to Toni 
			first, but if that doesn't work.... Plus, there's the fact that 
			Richard has another uncle -- as the film's advertisements put it, a 
			&quot;Snake with his best Broadway manners!&quot;</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Many people have spoken about, and 
			you may have even heard of, the &quot;Lubitsch touch,&quot; that evanescent 
			quality that so many directors have tried to emulate, particularly 
			Billy Wilder (who went a little bonkers when he tried to do so in 
			1948's <i>The Emperor Waltz</i>). <i>The Garden of Eden</i> is a 
			film which has something like the &quot;Lubitsch touch&quot; without having 
			been directed by Ernst Lubitsch (who, at the time, was busy over at 
			Paramount, where he would later turn out a string of great films 
			featuring the likes of Maurice Chevalier, Jeanette MacDonald, Miriam 
			Hopkins and Margaret Sullivan). The screenplay for <i>The Garden of 
			Eden </i>was written by Hans (also known as &quot;Hanns&quot;) Kräly, the 
			German-born screenwriter who had worked with Lubitsch in Europe, 
			including writing Lubitsch's &quot;breakout&quot; film, <i>Madame DuBarry</i>, 
			in 1919, before following the director to the U.S. Directing<i> 
			Garden of Eden</i> was Lewis Milestone, who had just picked up an 
			award, for &quot;Best Comedy Direction,&quot; for the film <i>Two Arabian 
			Knights</i> from a nascent annual awards ceremony started by the 
			newly-formed Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences. (Milestone 
			was directing Kräly's script for <i>Garden of Eden</i> at United 
			Artists, while Lubitsch was filming Kräly's script for <i>The 
			Patriot</i> over at Paramount.) There's a wonderful scene where Toni 
			and Richard, whose hotel room windows face each other from a 
			distance across a courtyard, signal to each other by turning their 
			room lights on and off. It takes Rosa to point out the potential 
			drawback in this -- looking further out the window of her room, Toni 
			sees that everyone is turning the lights on and off in their rooms, 
			doubtlessly creating havoc with the hotel electrical system.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The press book for the film 
			(excerpts of which are included on the DVD release) note how Corrine 
			Griffith originated from the town of Texarkana, Texas, as well as 
			&quot;Charley&quot; Ray's love for outdoor activities and sports. (&quot;Ray goes 
			in for strenuous tennis, with occasional golf exercises.&quot;) The two 
			stars made this film at crucial points in their careers. Corrine 
			Griffith was known as the &quot;Orchid Lady&quot; of the screen, a paragon of 
			beauty in the 1920s similar to what Hedy Lamarr achieved after she 
			made her first, indelible appearance on American screens in <i>
			Algiers</i> in 1938. The emphasis on her beauty makes one expect 
			that it was made at the expense of her acting skills, and her 
			performance, here, initially seems a little affected -- she steals 
			glances, purses her lips into a <b><i>moué</i></b>, and seems to be 
			flirting with the camera -- but her character turns out to be a lot 
			stronger. As already mentioned at the Palais de Paris, she stands up 
			for herself and doesn't let herself be exploited or made &quot;cheap.&quot; 
			She enjoys being pursued by Richard, but doesn't make herself an 
			easy conquest. When she feels that Richard should know about her 
			possibly having a &quot;past,&quot; she decides to make the facts known and to 
			tell him, so there'll be no misunderstanding later on, and she's 
			fully up to living with the consequences if they go badly. When 
			Richard's relatives express disapproval, she divests herself of all 
			of his &quot;gifts&quot; to her -- right down to the dress she wearing -- even 
			if that means walking-off in her shanty-scanties. (The plot throws 
			you for a bit a loop towards the end -- the figurative antagonist 
			turns out not to be &quot;Uncle Henri,&quot; but Richard's relatives, who 
			behave haughtily while actually acting under mercenary motives.) 
			Corrine Griffith gives Toni a delicate beauty, but she also gives 
			Toni a mind of her own in this picture, and what's more, you get the 
			impression that Richard wouldn't want her any other way. This is in 
			contrast to many other romantic screen stories of the day, where a 
			man would have a woman on his own terms, and her happiness was 
			dependent on his approval and his needs. The romance in <i>Garden of 
			Eden</i> doesn't feel dated because it's between two people on equal 
			footing. (A <i>Photoplay</i> article made some interesting 
			observations on a further source for Griffith's popularity at the 
			time, in describing her as &quot;an amazing contradiction...the face of 
			an early Italian angel and the hands of a twentieth-century business 
			woman. Her hands are large and thin and sturdy.... They prove that 
			beauty was not the only reason for her present fame and fortune. 
			These are working hands.&quot;)</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Charles Ray had started his film 
			career in what were called &quot;rural melodramas,&quot; stories where the 
			lead character, spawned in the country, goes to the city only to 
			become wise to the slick and shady way of doing things, there. (The 
			genre was delivered its death blow by the famous 1935 <i>Variety</i> 
			headline, &quot;Hix Nix Stix Flix.&quot;) In 1923, Ray, feeling typecast, put 
			all his money into an elaborate historical drama that he would 
			produce and star in: <i>The Courtship of Miles Standish</i>, based 
			on the Longfellow poem. The movie became a spectacular flop and Ray 
			lost all of his money in it, finding himself wiped-out at age 
			thirty-two. Here, Ray plays Richard with an innate gentleness along 
			with a debonair, sartorial quality -- an unusual combination, but it 
			works, and it at times brings to mind the easy, casual elegance Gary 
			Cooper displayed opposite Marlene Dietrich in <i>Desire</i>, only 
			Ray also brings an element of breeziness and ingenuousness to his 
			performance that sets him apart.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The picture itself is light in step 
			all the way, and there are several fine individual moments: an 
			elaborately staged roundelay in a hotel room where Richard tries to 
			sneak, unnoticed, past Rosa while Toni distracts her; the scene 
			where Richard tries to propose to Toni, complicated by, of all 
			things, draughts of &quot;sleeping powder&quot;; a climatic scene where the 
			electric lights are doused and a flurry of hand-held matches are lit 
			and held aloft by the attendant crowd. When Richard and Toni stroll 
			into the hotel's garden by night, the scene fades out -- only to 
			fade back from black to show that the two have fallen in love with 
			each other, and two swans, one white and the other black, glide past 
			them on a stream, side by side.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When Toni earlier boards the train 
			out of Vienna, she has a dream of what her life would be like after 
			she has become successful and renowned. This scene was cooked up in 
			part by production designer William Cameron Menzies, who had worked 
			on Douglas Fairbanks' <i>The Thief of Bagdad</i> and would later 
			work on another film, <i>Gone With the Wind</i>, and it was filmed 
			in two-color Technicolor, a shimmering early color process that can 
			be seen, on the <i>Garden of Eden</i> DVD, in a short subject 
			entitled <i>The Toy Shop</i>, as well in the surviving feature films
			<i>Mystery of the Wax Museum</i> (1933) and <i>Doctor X</i> (1932). 
			The color sequence was individually cut into each black-and-white 
			print of <i>Garden of Eden</i>, and does not currently survive 
			(although production photos on the DVD, plus text excerpts from the 
			film's original promotional press book, convey some idea of what it 
			was like). </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>The Garden of Eden</i> 
			premiered, on March 18, 1928, at the recently-opened Paramount 
			theater, on New York's Times Square, at a time when movie palaces 
			were really movie palaces -- the lobby for the Paramount was modeled 
			on the one for the Paris Opera -- and the audience were given a show 
			for their money (along with the picture, there was a stage show with 
			live performers, &quot;de rigueur&quot; at the time in order to compete with 
			the ones presented regularly at S.L. Rothafel's Roxy theaters.) When 
			it opened, one could look on the entertainment page of the <i>New 
			York Times</i> and, in one sweep, see large ads for Gloria Swanson 
			in <i>Sadie Thompson</i>, Emil Jannings in <i>The Last Command</i>, 
			and the World-War-One aerial drama, <i>Wings</i>, along with a 
			slightly smaller ad for <i>The Jazz Singer</i> with Al Jolson.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Richard Quirk, editor of <i>
			Photoplay</i> magazine, judged Corrine Griffith to be one of the 
			silent screen stars who would easily make the transition to sound 
			pictures. (Others deemed to make the same transition included Marion 
			Davies, Colleen Moore, and Clara Bow, who, according to David 
			Stenn's biography of her, actually developed a phobia over sound 
			equipment that would end up crippling her ability to perform.) In 
			1929, Griffith would appear in <i>The Divine Lady</i>, singing and 
			playing the harp onscreen, although the dialogue in the picture was 
			conveyed by title cards. Although <i>Photoplay</i> would later 
			tattle that both the singing and harp-playing was doubled, Griffith 
			would receive an Academy Award nomination for her performance in the 
			film. (She, and some considerable competition, would be trounced, 
			though, when the award went to Mary Pickford, for her hell-bent 
			attempt to play a modern-day Southern belle in <i>Coquette</i>) 
			Griffith would retire from screen acting shortly afterwards, but she 
			would make one more contribution, writing the book, <i>Papa's 
			Delicate Condition</i>, which would be made into a still-popular 
			motion picture, starring Jackie Gleason, in 1963.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Charles Ray could not have known, 
			in 1928, that the peak years of his career were already behind him. 
			He would continue in character roles into the 1930s, before his 
			death in 1943. One would like to have seen how he would have done 
			playing Dick Diver, F. Scott Fitzgerald's eponymous hero, in a movie 
			version of <i>Tender is the Night</i>.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Lewis Milestone would go on to 
			direct one of the best films I've ever seen -- <i>All Quiet on the 
			Western Front</i>, the great 1930 anti-war film -- and one of the 
			worst -- <i>The North Star</i>, a woefully misbegotten piece of 
			anti-Fascist tin-rattling set in an idyllic Russian village on a 
			Hollywood soundstage and released in 1943 -- along with the original 
			version of <i>Ocean's 11</i> and another war film, <i>Those Who Dare</i>, 
			whose ending was ripped-off and used as the ending for <i>The Dirty 
			Dozen</i> (and the two films couldn't be more dissimilar). Milestone 
			became more and more associated with heavy drama during the thirty 
			years following <i>The Garden of Eden</i>, moving away from his 
			earlier achievements in comedy -- here, in one of the last that he 
			would direct, the performers and a whole bygone age seem to have 
			been captured for our approval, not under glass or in amber, but in 
			the animate incandescence of the motion picture medium.</font></td>
