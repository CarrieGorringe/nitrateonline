            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by <a href="../kj.html" target="_top">KJ
            Doughton</a>, 26 December 2003</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Cold
            Mountain</i> is the story of one man’s return to a woman that he
            loves but hardly knows. Losing grasp of his humanity through the
            gory trenches of the Civil War, this broken soldier is also plagued
            with doubt. Will the love of his life accept him, now that brutality
            and loss have hardened his soul?<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>Is their love even genuine, or was it merely a shallow, naive
            flirtation?</b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As Inman, Jude Law anchors Anthony
            Minghella’s rousing, colossal <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Cold
            Mountain</i> with an intense star presence. Meanwhile, moments of
            greatness crackle around the lead actor like artillery spraying from
            a Gatling gun. We’re thrown into the warm winds of exploding
            gunpowder stockpiles, shackled to a chain of captured Confederate
            deserters, and sheltered on farms tended to by women whose enlisted
            husbands and sons have taken on the Yankees.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Cold
            Mountain</i> opens during a white-knuckle scrimmage between Northern
            and Confederate troops at St. Petersburg, Virginia. It’s 1864, in
            the heat of July.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Defending
            a massive, walled fortress with assorted young men decked out in
            caps, boots, and suspenders, Inman survives a flaming hell of blood,
            mud, tattered flags, and bayoneted bellies.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Minghella shows us the simultaneous division and diversity
            that defined the Civil War, in a striking scene where enemy Cherokee
            and African American soldiers stand off, each stopping for a minute
            to acknowledge the other’s unique ethnicity in this field of white
            skin, before resuming their violence unto one another.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Later, we watch a barely teenage
            serviceman dying in a fly-infested infirmary, begging a fiddler to "play
            something sweet – like a girl that’s waiting for me."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Observing such misery, Inman can relate. In the quiet North
            Carolina homestead called Cold Mountain, a prewar sweetheart named
            Ada (Nicole Kidman) is awaiting his return.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>"If you are fighting," she pleads in a letter, "stop
            fighting. If you are marching, stop marching. Come back to me is my
            request."<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ada isn’t kidding around. With
            winter setting in and her minister father suddenly passing away,
            this privileged Southern Belle could use some help around the family
            farm that is quickly slipping out of her soft, inexperienced hands.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Meanwhile, a menacing band of Home Guard outcasts led by
            Teague (Ray Winstone) are muscling in to take over Cold Mountain.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ada’s fortunes improve
            considerably when a plucky, practical tomboy named Ruby (Renee
            Zelwegger) moves in. "Ain’t no man better than me," this energetic
            firecracker proclaims. After snapping the neck of a bullying rooster
            and dumping the foul fowl into a pot, Ruby uses her earthy common
            sense to engineer the farm back to a productive state. Meanwhile,
            she teaches the more refined Ada how to live off the land. "This is
            the first thing I’ve done that might produce an actual result,"
            admits Kidman’s pampered priss as the two women mend a fence.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As taxing as Ruby Boot Camp proves
            to be, it’s nowhere near as gut-wrenching as the odyssey that
            Inman endures after deserting his troops to reunite with Ada.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>The terror of nursing a sick infant whose father will not
            return from battle is conveyed by Natalie Portman, playing a lonely
            widow offering room and board to Law’s fatigued wanderer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Inman’s loyalty to Ada is also tested as he takes sanctuary
            in a house of hard-up women. "Ride me all the way to China," urges a
            naked temptress as she bends over the cabin dinner table.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As he did with <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            English Patient</i>, director Minghella performs a miraculous
            juggling act, balancing his epic, sweeping story with the subtleties
            of character and detail that make <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Cold
            Mountain</i> breathe.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
            feel the unsettled tension seething inside of Inman, as he ponders
            whether Ada will even recognize his weathered skin, let alone accept
            him as her soul mate.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Comedy
            relief is embodied by Philip Seymour Hoffman as a disgraced, lusty
            clergyman, and a similar lightness shines forth courtesy Brendan
            Gleeson as Ruby’s cheerful, fiddle-toting father. Even minor
            supporting roles such as Charlie Hunnam as a villainous, acrobatic
            albino flavor this cinematic potion with added vitality and depth.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Like Martin Scorsese’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Gangs
            of New York</i>, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Cold Mountain
            </i>unveils a particularly violent chapter in U.S. history, and
            finds a million passionate stories inked out across its muddy,
            blood-soaked pages. Unlike, say, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Pearl
            Harbor</i>, a two-hour commercial posing as a film, Minghella’s
            movie brings its huge army of characters to life and prioritizes
            their plights over action spectacle.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>We feel for Inman and Ada, making the explosions and gunfire
            that surround these two lovers even more jolting.</font></p>
