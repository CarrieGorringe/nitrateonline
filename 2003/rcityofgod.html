            <p><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>The latest
            dazzling achievement to emerge from Latin American, <i>City of God</i>
            (<i>Cidade de Deus</i>) spans three decades of gang warfare in the <i>favelas
            </i>outside Rio de Janiero, telling its story with such ferocious
            energy it’s hard to look a Hollywood film in the eye for a long
            time afterwards. Like the Mexican <i>Amores Perros</i> before it, <i>City
            of God </i>fills its epic time-scale with the impassioned drama and
            dynamic fast-paced visuals that have become the trademark of the
            so-called Latin American renaissance and has drawn various
            comparisons with auteurs such as Tarantino and Scorsese. Still,
            taking Paolo Lins’ source novel about real life in the <i>favelas</i>,
            director Fernando Meirelles brilliantly renders both the harsh
            reality of the social situation and the vibrant imagery it affords
            in his own distinct style.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For a decade
            beginning in 1986, writer Lins documented the violent drug trade
            that was continuing to boom within the City of God and turned this
            potent source material into a bestselling novel. Meirelles’
            elliptical film begins close to the end of the story, when its
            narrator Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues) is caught in the midst of a
            shot-out between the city’s drug-dealing gangs and the police.
            Flashback to the sixties, where Rocket is eleven years old and
            living amongst groups of small-time crooks in the <b><i>favelas</i></b>,
            friends with many of the city’s children who will later become
            embroiled in the drugs war that engulfs the <b><i>favela</i></b>.
            One amateur gang carries out a blundered robbery at a brothel and
            later disbands, having to go on the run after one of their members
            is killed. A decade later and Li’l Ze (formerly Li’l Dice, a
            member of that gang) makes moves to take over most of the drug
            dealing in the City of God, and in a grisly flashback we discover
            his brutal role in the brothel robbery when he was just a child.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s an
            understatement to say that Li’l Ze (Leandro Firmino da Hora) has
            aggression issues but, armed as he is with a plethora of weapons and
            minions willing to obey him, it’s hard to argue. Only his close
            friend and less psychopathic hood Bene (Phellipe Haagensen) is able
            to reason with him. Meanwhile, as the narrative loops and weaves
            around itself, as Rocket comes of age he becomes a photographer for
            a local newspaper, bringing them graphic images from inside the <b><i>favelas
            </i></b>that were formerly no-go areas for their reporters. Just as
            his first set of photographs are published in the newspaper, Rocket
            fears for his safety in the <b><i>favela,</i></b> only to be hired
            as a virtual celebrity photographer by Li’l Ze, desperate for
            notoriety and the prestige of making the cover of the newspaper. And
            so it’s partly through Rocket’s lens that the film’s climatic,
            violent scenes, come to a head. But as the films simultaneously
            funny yet terrifying conclusion suggests, this is by no means the
            end of the circle of violence in the City of God.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Having already
            generated a reputation for violence, it’s surprising to see how <i>City
            of God</i> deals with the grisly minutiae of its killings in quite
            an oblique way. There’s an undeniably horrific scene of
            infanticide, but this made so largely because of the distress on
            screen, likewise for a brutal rape scene later on where we can only
            hear what’s going on, which is equally as disturbing. Unlike the
            excess viscera of the violence in Scorsese’s <i>Goodfellas</i> or
            Tarantino’s <i>Pulp Fiction</i>, to which his work has bore
            comparison, Meirelles spares the gore for some keys scenes and gives
            the rest a dose of bravura; one shoot-out is memorably stylised as
            it takes place under the strobe lights of a packed nightclub,
            jerking, jolting and dying to the beat of the music. Equally, the
            violence is tempered with humour and by the humane performances of
            the largely non-professionals cast: two hundred local kids who were
            auditioned and trained on site.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span lang="EN-GB"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Electrifying as
            it is to watch, <i>City of God</i> still has its links to the real
            situation facing the disenfranchised members of the Brazilian
            underclass. Their anger and desperation to define themselves is what
            pushes the film forward with such force and raw energy, and what
            makes it simultaneously as frightening as it is entertaining. Part
            social commentary, part coming-of-age tale and part flashy
            filmmaking, <i>City of God</i> has all the hallmarks of top notch
            filmmaking. And Meirelles has the skill and insight to surpass
            comparisons with great auteurs and become one himself.</font></span></td>
