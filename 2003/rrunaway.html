            by John Grishamish plot twisties, the actors in Gary Fleder's <i>Runaway
            Jury</i> do their best to fashion an emotional coherence. This, as
            the characters turn conniving or ornery (or, in the case of the
            girl, bruised and beaten), as they are tossed about by unconvincing
            conveniences and case-making speeches. That is, Brian Koppelman and
            David Levien's adaptation leaves intact the author's familiar and
            popular ethical gusto, though it shifts the 1996 novel's target from
            the tobacco industry to gun manufacturers. Still, the bad guys are
            seething, the good guys are stalwart, and those clever few who
            negotiate in between reveal their moral mettle by the finale. <o:p>

            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Set
            in New Orleans, <i>Runaway Jury</i> introduces its own anti-gunnist
            inclinations with a big, not particularly original, bang. A nice
            young father (Dylan McDermott) comes to work at his brokerage firm
            (where he knows the receptionist's name), and is immediately caught
            in a rampage by the proverbial &quot;disgruntled former
            employee.&quot; Two years later, the legal plot kicks in, as the
            nice young widow, Celeste (Joanna Going) sues the gun maker,
            essentially for looking the other way when &quot;everyone&quot; knew
            the company's semi-automatic Tech-9s with hollow tip rounds were
            being sold by baleful dealers underground. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            guilt, in other words, is clearly assigned, and the complication is
            that the gun lobby has hired not only an oily lawyer named Durwood
            Cable (Bruce Davison), but also an extremely expensive, crafty, and
            increasingly loud jury consultant named Rankin Fitch (Gene Hackman,
            who played a more pathetic version of this character in <i>The Firm</i>
            [1993]). Not to be outdone in the inflated names department, the
            widow's lawyer is Wendell Rohr (Dustin Hoffman), who also has a
            consultant, Green (Jeremy Piven). The film allows a moment when
            Green looks sneaky, as he offers his services to Rohr just because
            he believes in the &quot;cause,&quot; but it's soon clear that he's
            really here because, as always, Piven gets a part in his buddy John
            Cusack's movie (this is usually a bonus, but here he has painfully
            little to do). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Fitch
            and Rohr's eventual legal-moral showdown in the men's room appears
            to be this film's <b>raison d'être</b>: Fitch snarls, &quot;I'm in
            it to win! Everything else is colored bubbles!&quot; And Rohr comes
            back, &quot;You can't carry around so much contempt without it
            becoming malignant!&quot; But for a long time before that, they look
            to be competing for Most Curious Performance. Rohr is as artfully
            folksy as Fitch is artfully belligerent. Such artfulness -- scheming
            and self-righteous -- is where the action's at in this film, as
            everyone in it presumes the fault of the jury system, that is,
            putting average (put-upon, badly educated, willful, cantankerous)
            citizens in charge of other citizens' lives and deaths. In Grisham's
            world, everyone with a stake in any of it manipulates and cajoles,
            and the ones who do it for the correct reasons are the ones with
            whom the audience is aligned. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Here,
            Wendell is introduced selecting a tie that doesn't quite match his
            jacket, because, as he puts it (in a nasal drawl that sounds
            suspiciously like Tootsie), &quot;Jurors don't trust a lawyer who's
            too nattily turned out.&quot; By the same token, the very natty
            Fitch first appears entering the warehouse that's been
            super-equipped for his surveillance and info-gathering operations --
            a dark and cavernous place that says everything you need to know
            about him. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            third term in the mix (Durwood Cable being pretty much the
            non-entity <i>his</i> name implies) is a juror, Nicholas Easter
            (this is the John Cusack part). Ostensibly a videogame vendor
            (Fitch's outfit figures he might be useful because he's into shooter
            games, but also troublesome because he &quot;likes to entertain
            people,&quot; and so he's categorically untrustworthy), Nick
            conspires to sway the jury to a certain verdict. And, following a
            strange exchange in a local curio shop, concerning votive candles,
            his relationship with his girlfriend Marlee (Rachel Weisz) is
            revealed. She gets to do the dirty work on the outside -- taunting
            Fitch and Rohr, instructing them on amounts of money (millions and
            millions, to be deposited in a Cayman Islands account, as always
            happens in these machinatey movies). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            bulk of the movie is given over to the major players, with teeny
            little moments among the twelve jurors interlocking, so as to create
            a veneer of cleverness. (The judge, played by Bruce McGill, has no
            notion of what's going on, in keeping with the movie's premise that
            the justice system is a consensual hallucination.) What's most
            striking here is how many excellent actors are gathered together to
            sketch characters in five or six lines: these include Cliff Curtis
            as the ex-Marine; Jennifer Beals as the &quot;tall glass of ice
            tea&quot;; Gerry Bamman as the blind man incarnating the joke of
            &quot;blind&quot; justice; Nora Dunn as the alcoholic; Bill Nunn as
            the guy with a conscience; and Guy Torry as the jittery guy hiding a
            deep secret. Too many types, not enough time.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;&nbsp;

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">So,
            you're supposed to be wondering who will give up the cash to buy the
            jury, but really, there's little question, given Fitch's pomposity
            and Rohr's essential rectitude (not to mention their names). Still,
            the film lays out a series of predictable maneuverings and
            doublecrosses, several leading to ludicrous action scenes -- as when
            Nick finds one of Fitch's professional lunkheads in his apartment
            and gives chase, or when Marlee, of all people, beats down another.
            (As crazy as this last sounds, it's even crazier in execution -- she
            notices him hiding in the shadows because he's left a half-eaten
            sandwich that has attracted roaches, as if he's brought his own
            supply.) <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><i><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Runaway
            Jury’s</span></font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">
            combinatory affect -- cynicism about the legal system meets
            moralistic melodrama -- doesn’t hold together. And, as fast and
            furious as the plot turns keep coming, the fact that they're
            premised on a series of logical holes that niggles at you even while
            you're trying (really hard!) to worry about Nick's safety, Fitch's
            depravity, or Marlee's remarkable ability to stand up to either
            Fitch or Rohr, both of whom look like they want to eat her for
            breakfast (&quot;Do you know who you're messing with here!?&quot;).
            Just so, the individual performances, scene to scene, stand out
            (even for Hackman's scene chewing), but the niggling saps your
            energy and interest until you just don't care who wins. </span></font><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
