            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">On
            the morning of 28 February 1997, the LAPD had no idea what they were
            in for. Still, according to <i>44 Minutes: The North Hollywood
            Shootout</i>, FX's newest original movie, the cops were ready for
            the conflagration that was visited upon them. This even though they
            were wholly outgunned by two bank robbers, such that, for 44 minutes
            on that sunny Friday morning, the LAPD appeared on live television
            in dire straits, trying to figure out how to save the customers and
            employees trapped inside. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Written
            by Tim Metcalfe and directed by Yves Simoneau, the movie begins with
            brief, seemingly intimate introductions to the designated major
            players. The cops prepare for their day: following a sleepless night
            owing to a loud, smoky party next door, based-on-a-true-guy
            Detective Frank McGregor (Michael Madsen) kisses his pregnant wife
            goodbye; S.W.A.T. officer Donnie Anderson (Ron Livingston) cleans
            his gun and remembers his honorable cop dad; and upright,
            compassionate uniform Henry Dee (Mario Van Peebles) prays for
            guidance (&quot;Lord, help me to do the right thing out
            there&quot;). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            Frank observes, his work in the Robbery Homicide Division means he's
            working with the &quot;best of the best.&quot; &quot;When you're a
            cop,&quot; he notes, &quot;You have to make split second decisions.
            It's kind of like being on trial every day.&quot;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>And oh yes, contrary to popular supposition, cops' lives
            aren't much like the movies: unlike the detectives in <i>Heat</i>, <i>L.A.
            Confidential</i>, and <i>Dragnet</i>, they're juggling &quot;75
            cases all at once.&quot; Police work is dangerous but rewarding, you
            don't do it for the money, but for some personal and social good. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">By
            contrast, the robbers have no good in mind. At all. As the film sets
            up these eminently well-intentioned cops, it intercuts shots of the
            villains, also preparing for their day. They watch cartoons. They
            load up their weapons -- AK-47s, semiautomatic, a few smoke
            grenades, and other explosives. They don Kevlar vests, pants, and
            headgear (worn under black ski masks), and bring along over 2,600
            rounds of ammunition, as will be counted up by crime scene
            investigators after the fact. Frank fills in some of the details on
            these guys as they sweat and huff-and-puff in their apartment: they
            come to this event with something of a reputation. Nicknamed the
            High Incident Bandits, they were previously known for their
            &quot;takeover style&quot; -- they'd walk into a bank heavily armed,
            grab up the money, and escape quickly. According to Frank, they'd
            already stolen some $2 million by the time they hit the Van Nuys
            Bank of America. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Also
            according to Frank, &quot;These guys were media junkies. They'd be
            robbing banks in the morning and watching themselves on TV in the
            afternoon.&quot; This seems important to know, though none of the
            cops are inclined to discuss details of the perpetrators' history or
            likely behaviors once the shooting starts (Frank does mention to one
            cop on the scene that &quot;They're gonna come out heavy&quot;).
            Instead, they scramble, mostly in slow motion, in order to showcase
            the photogenic mayhem.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Indeed,
            apart from Frank's occasional commentary, <i>44 Minutes</i> spends
            precious little time contemplating the robbers' backgrounds or
            motives. They appear here as evil embodied -- hulking, sweating,
            bellowing at one another. Based on the real life robbers -- Larry
            Eugene Phillips Jr. and Emil Matasareanu -- these fictionalized
            monsters are abject, nameless objects (though they are played with
            some gusto by Andrew Bryniarski and Oleg Taktarov). Fully armed,
            they sit in their car in the bank's parking lot, waiting for the
            armored truck that is their original target (the truck never shows
            up, so they change plans, seemingly on a whim: &quot;Do the
            bank!&quot;). As they wait, sweating in the sun, the Larry character
            teases the Emil character about his Romanian background, to which
            the Emil character responds, vehemently, &quot;I'm an American. I
            like the Corvettes and the Mexican girls.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            this gruntish exchange suggests, the robbers look cruder and meaner
            by the second. By the time they emerge from the car and enter the
            bank, they are wholly monstrified. And the film leaves them this
            way, dreadful, bulky cutouts, and focuses instead on the cops' as
            they attempt to deal with the assault. This approach omits details
            and ambiguities related to the origins or ramifications of this
            calamitous morning. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still,
            some of the facts emerge in the fiction: where the villains are
            vastly over-prepared, the cops come sorely under-prepared, despite
            their numbers (some 200 arrive at the scene). They come without
            enough firepower, without knowledge of how many bandits are in the
            bank, without enough guns. The legal and cultural fallout of the
            crime had to do with just how much firepower the cops should be
            carrying, if outlaws find it so easy to purchase AK-47s at gun
            shows. The cops do send a couple of uniforms go to a nearby gun
            store to purchase extra firepower, but arrive back on the scene too
            late, as the purchase is authorized quite late during the course of
            events. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            media trucks and choppers were on the scene almost immediately, such
            that the siege appeared on live TV almost in its entirety. This in
            itself is something of an issue -- as the robbers start shooting at
            one news helicopter and as the cops appear unable to contain
            onlookers (some hit by the robbers' gunfire, though the day ends
            with only the robbers dying) or, more interestingly, reporters.
            Indeed, journalists start raising questions on the spot, by
            wondering how the cops could come so ill-equipped and comparing the
            shootout to the excessive explosiveness of <i>Heat</i>, the very
            film to which Frank has preemptively referred in his opening
            comments. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            point appears to be that the &quot;real&quot; thing is much less
            readable and much less predictable than the Hollywood version.
            Except that this film is caught between; it's part emulating
            big-budget cop movies, and part emulating the grimmest sort of
            &quot;reality TV.&quot; Michael Mann's film offered legible slow
            motion, grandly choreographed chaos. The events of 28 February 1997
            were brutal and barely comprehensible in the unnerving footage from
            that day. Simoneau and director of photography David Franco conjure
            a middling representation: bullets fly windows burst into a million
            shards; bank employees and customers' reaction shots emphasize their
            sense of terror; traffic backs up; a neighbor steps onto his balcony
            to videotape the events; and cops dash about, set up a temporary HQ
            in a nearby store, and bark orders over their radios. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
            bedlam seems appropriate, but the film neatens it up with narrative,
            as it must. To this end, it offers &quot;characters&quot; (or
            rather, figures you see more than once) with whom you might
            identify: the dog-walking girl who calls in the robbery on her cell
            phone appears on camera several times before she does so; Henry (who
            has earlier tried to save a gang-leaning kid by showing him crime
            scene photos and buying him a burrito) is badly wounded and bleeding
            nearly to death in the parking lot, as his female partner holds back
            tears and tells him to &quot;Hold on!&quot;; Frank calls wifey to
            tell her he's all right, then dashes into the fray to commandeer a
            cop car and pick up Henry. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            cops are heroic (and no doubt, they were at the time). As Frank
            offers by way of resolution: &quot;In 44 minutes of sheer terror,
            not a single officer ran away. I think that means something.&quot;
            The movie gives you a little nudge as to what that meaning might be:
            this was an incident that, after the Rodney King and OJ trials,
            restored some public trust in the LAPD. A coda shows grateful women
            bringing cookies to their local station and children holding up
            &quot;We [HEART] LAPD&quot; banners. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As
            nice as this outcome seems, it leaves out some (brief) controversy
            concerning the shootout, not only over the outgunning, but also over
            the fact that, after Phillips shot himself, the cops shot down and
            left Matasareanu to bleed to death over some 30 minutes, not calling
            an ambulance because (depending on whom you read) their focus was on
            civilians who were less severely wounded, and they were unsure that
            the gunman wasn't booby-trapped. This led to a lawsuit filed on
            behalf of his children. However you feel about this turn of events,
            leaving it out completely is only one of many instances where <i>44
            Minutes</i> simplifies rather than complicates the horrors of that
            day in North Hollywood. <o:p>
