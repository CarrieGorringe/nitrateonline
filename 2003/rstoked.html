            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Mark &quot;Gator&quot; Rogowski
            sat on the &quot;vertical skating&quot; throne for much of the
            eighties, riding the same wave of extreme skateboarding popularized
            by Tony Hawk and Christian Hosoi. However, like a stale television
            series or trendy music genre, the sport soon lost its commercial
            appeal, leaving such skating icons to waste away in the dust of
            obscurity.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Stoked
            – The Rise and Fall of Gator</font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">
            is a cautionary tale exploring the disastrous consequences of sudden
            fame followed by faltering fortune. Its hero – once a symbol of
            alternative culture’s rebel voice – eventually sells out
            big-time, then caps off his descent by raping and murdering a female
            acquaintance. This diabolical act is made all the more repellent after
            we’ve gotten to know Rogowski. Like news of a flawed friend
            landing in jail for lawless misdeeds, we grimace even as we question
            whether such a fate was inevitable.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Director Helen Stickler launches
            her sports saga in 1982, establishing Rogowski as an aggressive hero
            of &quot;vert&quot; skating, in which practitioners use ramps and
            empty swimming pools for radical, four-wheeled jumps and flips.
            &quot;Fear is a mindkiller,&quot; Gator exclaims before flying
            across the periphery like a drunken, airborne insect, demonstrating
            the board acrobatics that he’s known for.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meanwhile, Stickler fills the audio
            with crackly telephone messages from Gator, as newspaper headlines
            and overhead prison shots crowd the screen. The ominous combination
            of sound and images make it clear that the skate star is narrating
            his history from a confined cell (California laws prohibited
            Stickler from filming her subject in prison), and that something
            awful has occurred. Skate fans will already know the story. For the
            rest of us, Stickler slowly exposes the subculture that Rogowski
            helped create, before re-approaching his crime for a devastating
            finale.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We’re introduced to the dawn of
            Southern California skatedom, informed of the different styles and
            methods that defined skaters from Venice, Oceanside, and other
            active boarding communities. A board-bum explains that initially,
            skaters never expected to make money or see their sport go pro.
            &quot;We made $50 a month if we were lucky,&quot; he shrugs.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Inevitably, vertical skating became
            a viable commercial industry, as skate parks opened, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Thrasher</i>
            magazine emerged as the genre’s information Bible, and companies
            like Vision marketed skateboard accessories and clothing. &quot;Mark
            became an icon for the company,&quot; boasts Vision’s founder, who
            marketed his poster child in dozens of promotional videos.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Played in skate stores across the
            country, such VHS tapes portrayed Gator as a rebel rock star,
            escaping the clutches of a nagging mom as he hits the streets in
            search of board action. Meanwhile, the increasingly visible skating
            presence was seen donning Vision’s sizeable array of shirts,
            pants, and watches. &quot;We had a concept of big logos that
            distinguished wearers as part of the skateboarding subculture,&quot;
            explains a Vision spokesman.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Eventually, Rogowski was pulling in
            over $20,000 per month through such lucrative endorsement deals,
            buying real estate, and enjoying such excessive celebrity perks as
            willing women (the subculture’s groupies are known as &quot;Skate
            Bettys&quot;) and free-flowing booze. It wasn’t long before the
            successful icon’s dark side began taking over. During a skate
            tournament, Rogowski punched a police officer. &quot;The moment Mark
            punched that cop,&quot; confirms a fellow skater, &quot;it cemented
            his legend.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Stickler is clearly fascinated by
            the image of skating as a vicarious form of acting out aggression,
            and how its participants sometimes have difficulty knowing where to
            draw the line. &quot;There's always been this crux of skateboarding
            and rebelliousness,&quot; acknowledges Stacy Peralta, &quot;and
            it’s because everywhere you go to skateboard, or everywhere you
            used to go to skateboard, you were kicked out and told not to do
            it.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Other members of the subculture
            agree. &quot;In a lot of places,&quot; says John Hogan,
            &quot;skateboarding was outlawed. I mean, just putting your board
            down on the ground was considered illegal.&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;It’s a very thin line
            between presenting yourself as a true skater and hardcore,&quot;
            observes Lance Mountain, &quot;and not being destructive.&quot;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With this in mind, it’s
            understandable that Gator’s public persona comes into question
            during the late eighties, as he’s caught on film decked out in
            puffy pants, schmoozing with Cindy Crawford and INXS, and hamming it
            up on Club MTV with Downtown Julie Brown. Meanwhile, Rogowski
            inexplicably changes his name to &quot;Mark Anthony&quot; during
            this foray into megalomania, forever losing his hardcore street
            cred. &quot;The skaters became pawns,&quot; Ken Park notes of
            Gator’s commercial days, &quot;and overnight, the market said,
            'You sold out.’&quot;</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">By the dawn of the nineties,
            vertical skating had been replaced by a more gravity-friendly
            &quot;street style.&quot; Skateboard parks closed down, and Gator
            found himself a has-been at age twenty-four. &quot;It was probably
            one of the roughest times to be a professional skateboarder,&quot;
            says Mike Vallely, &quot;and just to be in the industry. It was kind
            of bleak, it was kind of dark, and you know, it was obvious the
            gravy days were over.&quot; It’s painful to watch the reclusive,
            disenfranchised Rogowski severing social ties as he strums a guitar
            in a sprawling house, surrounded by avocado groves.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Compounded by an as-yet-undiagnosed
            bipolar disorder, Gator’s desperation is acted out in a series of
            negative career moves. On a 1989 skateboarding tour, Rogowski
            punched an autograph seeker. In 1990, he fell from a piece of
            construction equipment, allegedly while inebriated, and sustained
            serious injuries. Eventually, the falling star took up with a
            Christian skating group in Carlsbad, and converted to Christianity.
            However, his being jilted by a long-time girlfriend becomes the
            straw that breaks the camel’s back, culminating in his heinous
            crime.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Stoked – the Rise and Fall
            of Gator&quot; is a mesmerizing documentary that shows the
            vulnerability – and brutality – that emerge when one is showered
            in recognition, only to have such fame pulled out from under him.
            Shot in 11 different cities and boasting dozens of interviews with
            other celebrated skate buffs, Stickler’s comprehensive study takes
            its familiar &quot;fall from grace&quot; theme and injects the same
            twists and turns that Gator might choose with his skateboard. It’s
            a vertical, high-flying rush of a movie.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"></o:p>
