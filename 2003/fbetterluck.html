Cynthia Fuchs</a>, 25 May 2003</font></i></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700">
<font size="2">Justin Lin sits at the head of a conference table. He's game to 
laugh, and obviously getting used to this interview business, telling the same 
stories he's told elsewhere, and talks like he's in a hurry. He's been in a 
hurry since his first feature, <i>Better Luck Tomorrow</i>, ignited a 
&quot;controversy&quot; at this year's Sundance Film Festival. The film concerns a group 
of Asian American high school students -- including Ben (Parry Shen), Virgil 
(Jason J. Tobin), Han (Sung Kang), and Daric (Steve Cho) -- who give up their 
&quot;mode&quot; behavior for more exciting and less predictable behavior: cheating, 
drugs, and gang violence. </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">A 
disgruntled screening attendee complained that the film offered &quot;negative&quot; 
images of Asian American kids, and Roger Ebert Himself stood up to defend the 
film. The stir caught the attention of several distributors, and the 
thirty-one-year-old Lin suddenly found himself the prize in a bidding war: &quot;As 
soon as we got into Sundance, the phone was ringing off the hook, and it hasn't 
stopped ringing. And these are the same people that would not even return a call 
before.&quot; When he went with MTV, he also received cash enough to tweak his 
$250,000 movie, made, as he says, &quot;by credit cards.&quot; He tightened up the editing 
added new scenes, and &quot;toned down&quot; the ending that, apparently, some viewers 
thought &quot;too cynical.&quot; </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">But 
it's not all about accommodating expectations. Lin, a UCLA School of Film and 
Television grad, has learned a lot about the business in these few short months. 
And he feels mostly equipped to handle himself: he's turned down a $20 million 
film he found &quot;offensive as an Asian American,&quot; in order to take up projects 
where he's working with Spike Lee and Christine Vachon, among others. And he 
remains committed to projects that will challenge assumptions and complicate 
judgments. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
Cynthia Fuchs:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
It appears that Sundance changed your life. </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
Justin Lin:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
We had fun, but it was so overwhelming when I was there. It was all about trying 
to find a good home for the film, which was nerve-wracking. When the Ebert thing 
happened, it was actually kind of nice, because while I was there, I almost lost 
track of why we made it. And we made it because I wanted to deal with youth, and 
these issues, from a specific perspective. That was one of the Festival's 
genuine moments. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> And 
that moment raised the question of the &quot;model minority.&quot; </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
JL:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> My 
thinking on that hasn't changed. We have to redefine a couple terms. First, what 
&quot;positive&quot; means: it doesn't mean you see only perfect people on screen, and 
that leads back into the model minority myth anyway. Being positive is to have 
characters with flaws, however big or small, fully developed. Cinema is behind 
the times, because when you see a person of color on screen, they're there just 
for that reason. If they're Native American, the movie needs some &quot;spiritual&quot; 
thing; if they're Asian American, it needs a tourist. That needs to change. For 
me, it's only negative if the characters are one-dimensional. But there are 
expectations: the guy who stood up at Sundance wasn't Asian American, but 
there's judgment coming from inside too. But that's okay. We knew we were trying 
to start discourse. This is not a feel-good </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">And 
the second term is &quot;Asian American.&quot; When people hear that, &quot;Asian American 
film,&quot; they think it'll be preachy or educational, or academic. We can redefine 
that, there are other portrayals that can be three-dimensional, whether they're 
kids in high school or doctors and lawyers. I didn't start here because I had an 
agenda; I started here because I was already working with the youth and I wanted 
to explore it. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> And 
&quot;youth films&quot; brings up another issue. It's an experience that most filmmakers 
forget by the time they have the wherewithal to make a film, and so they 
romanticize and follow formulas. </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
JL:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> I 
was concerned about that. And I caught myself by the second draft, in that my 
politics and even the romanticizing were overtaking me. I wanted to be truer to 
the characters, and not write a &quot;movie youth&quot; film, but one that was realistic. 
The wordings and gestures, I had to let it all out, let them breathe, before I 
could move on.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> When 
you say you want to be &quot;true to the characters,&quot; what does that mean? </font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
JL:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> I 
wanted to really develop the characters and understand them. I would do passes 
through scenes, where I'd just work on one character at a time. Once I 
understood the background, the relationships with the parents, his anxieties, 
whatever, then I could write. That took a lot of time. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> I 
imagine, as you have so many characters in play. </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
JL:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> That 
became the fun part, to complicate the role of Stephanie [Karin Anna Cheung], 
who could have just been the Pretty Girl. I had just done a documentary on 
Korean adoptees from Minnesota, and I thought, &quot;That's an interesting identity 
that I want to explore.&quot; </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> <i>
BLT</i> challenges some prevailing stereotypes, for instance, the asexual &quot;Asian 
American male.&quot; </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
JL:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
Yeah, it is bothersome, and obvious, especially growing up as an Asian American 
male. Working with the youth, I see that it affects them and why they want to be 
gangsta, to overcome that stereotype by carrying a gun. This film is not a 
counter-comment on those stereotypes. It's three-dimensional, not opposite.
</font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> Did 
you work with the actors to shape the characters? </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
JL:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
Yeah, I did. These are the pros and cons of not having money. The negative is 
that you're struggling; the positive is that people come on for the right 
reason. Some are working actors, but others, like Karin, this is her first role. 
I got to spend the time to learn their tendencies and rhythms, and it became a 
collaboration. I had five weeks to work with them, which I'm finding out now is 
a luxury! To me, rehearsal wasn't about learning your lines. </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">One of 
the things we worked on was creating their relationships with their parents, 
even though you never see them on screen. You could feel, at a certain point, it 
just clicks. This relationship between them and the characters is so powerful. 
And we earned each other's trust. I was very open with them and they weren't 
afraid to speak up. Certain scenes, I thought, just go for it, and they came up 
with some great material that I couldn't write. It was a journey of trust.
</font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> Why 
did you decide not to show the parents? </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
JL:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> I 
want their presence to be felt, but wanted the focus on the kids. Even the 
framing would suggest the parents, but you wouldn't have to see them. Some of 
the kids' decisions are based on anticipating their parents' reactions. And on 
the narrative level, we wanted to play beyond what you'd expect. So you're 
wondering, when the credits are rolling, &quot;What's gonna happen to these kids?&quot; We 
wanted to give the audience credit, and spark questions. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> And 
how were you thinking about structure? </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
JL:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
Well, I'm a film-school geek, and the filmmakers who inspire me really use 
cinematic elements. And I wanted to make a film that would accommodate the style 
of &quot;today's youth.&quot; In a way, I wanted to make an &quot;MTV film,&quot; but I didn't want 
it to be empty in the way that that suggests. I didn't want it to be cool just 
because it's jump-cutting or we're changing speeds. I wanted to have reason 
behind those decisions. Even the lens choices, I put a lot of thought into that, 
to incorporate the style but be clear about meaning behind it. In a way, that's 
my guilty pleasure. Writing is the most painful thing. But for style, I get to 
be the geek and play around. </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">And 
I'm so lucky, because usually when you see low budget films, like <i>Clerks</i>, 
it's out of necessity that they use a wide-angle lens because they only have one 
depth of field and one shot. I was lucky. I met this guy [Patrice Lucien 
Cochet], who makes a lot of money doing commercials because he's a great 
focus-puller. The first day we were shooting, it was the hotel scene, and the 
depth of field is only like an inch and a half. And he was doing it by eye. And 
I was so scared, that, even though we didn't have any money, I said, &quot;Let's just 
use another credit card and print this, so I can see what we did.&quot; We went to 
the lab, and he was hitting the eyeball the whole time. It liberated me, because 
I realized, I can use the lenses I want, the camera moves where I want.</font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> And 
you chose the vocabulary words for thematic as well as stylistic purposes?
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
JL:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
Definitely. I wanted to bookmark each segment. And I remembered, when I was in 
school, I was horrible at SATs. My math was fine, but studying the vocabulary 
drove me nuts. I had to do it all visually, to see the words. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> And 
the decathlon? What a stressful experience. </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
JL:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
(laughs) I hung out with different groups when I was growing up. And the honors 
kids were so bottled up. The jocks could let loose when they partied, but the 
smarter kids had to have an excuse to go out, a community activity. When they 
let go, they just go crazy. The decathlon gave them a perfect excuse. </font>
</span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
Speaking of letting loose, there's a striking sequence toward the end that cuts 
between some brutal violence and what seem Ben's fantasies of Stephanie, so it's 
not so much a standard mix of sex and violence, but more a collision of 
different sorts of romance. </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
JL:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> Ben 
has grown up, as many of us do, with some images that we strive for. Looking 
back, I don't know why I was driven by certain images. And here, the film's 
overriding theme is that, if you're not careful and don't let your identity 
develop as itself, and adopt some identity, it can overtake you. Because you 
have no understanding of why you're where you are. That's what troubles Ben: he 
has goals, but he doesn't know why. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
Stephanie asks, &quot;You know how you make decisions, but you don't know why?&quot; But 
she has a handle on the &quot;whys&quot; that Ben doesn't. </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
JL:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
Yeah, and the basketball is about that too, for Ben. It kind of played off when 
I was in high school: my brother and I were the only Asian-American kids 
playing. And I was the hustler kid. I dove for the ball, threw my body, did 
whatever it took. And I remember someone was talking to my assistant coach, and 
said, &quot;Those Lin brothers, they really hustle.&quot; And he said, &quot;Oh yeah, that's 
because they're Chinese.&quot; Like it was in my genes. Ben's like that: even when 
he's doing the best he can, he's still getting boxed in. I wanted to look at the 
affirmative action thing in high school, which is more a microcosm than the 
world. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> But 
the system is easy to manipulate. </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
JL:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
Exactly. When I was in high school, people were scamming so much, it was so 
easy. I was positive the teachers knew about it. It's interesting that the 
structure doesn't really change, even though everyone knows that it's not 
working. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> And 
then there's a moral judgment cast on kids who cheat, even though the system is 
designed so they can and sometimes they feel they have to. And that leads to 
this: how were you thinking about the class distinctions among the kids? </font>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
JL:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> We 
wanted to play with cliques and class, even within the power dynamics of the 
group. Han is the working-class kid, and Steve is definitely way above that. And 
while race is the most obvious thing to talk about, but class, so much of the 
conflict comes from class. And no one talks about it, because we're so 
preoccupied with race. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> I 
was struck by the way that his sense of privilege grants Steve a sense of 
possession, even over Stephanie. That one shot when they're at the party, and he 
has his arm over her in a proprietary way...</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
JL:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> That 
was the scariest shot to do: it was a four-minute shot and I didn't cover it. It 
had to all happen there, and was all contingent on their performances. </font>
</span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
You're fond of editing. </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
JL:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> I'm 
used to going from conception to the final cut: in film school, you do 
everything. It's a bad habit to cut in your head as you're shooting, but we had 
to do some shortcuts like that in this film. I had to establish a style early 
on. Hollywood films are typically shot with so much coverage, because it's the 
safest thing for the studios: the editors can take over and remake the film.
</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Making 
films is such a schizophrenic process: I'm in my room, writing, then I'm working 
with actors, where you try to be as organic as possible, then when it's all 
over, you're in this small room again, playing with these pictures. The great 
thing is that I did have certain ideas going in, and by the time I got to 
editing, these ideas had matured. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> Are 
you imagining that with the larger projects, you won't have this same sort of 
control? </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
JL:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> I'm 
lucky because I found a good agent [CAA] and lawyer [John Sloss], but I'd be 
lying if I said I knew exactly what I was doing, but I'm learning. I did find a 
few projects that I like. One is an adaptation of this book [Brad Meltzer's 
novel, <i>The Tenth Justice</i>, about a conspiracy involving the Supreme 
Court], which I'm really happy with. The whole process is brand new to me: 
you're basically an employee. </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The 
other project, with [Spike Lee's] 40 Acres and HBO, gives me a little more 
freedom. And then, I'm working with Christine Vachon on a totally independent 
film. Every week, it seems like one of them will take the lead. I'm glad to be 
working on that level where you can actually pay people. But I know with that 
comes new agendas and new headaches, and people doing it for different reasons 
now. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> And 
how did you come to know that you wanted to make films? </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
JL:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> I 
actually didn't know until late. I grew up in Orange County, and all they played 
there was <i>Commando</i> and <i>Commando II</i>, so I wasn't really that 
interested in it. I was convinced I was going to play in the NBA. I was pretty 
good, but obviously I stopped growing. And then I saw Coppola's <i>Tucker</i> 
[1988], and it blew me away. [Vittorio] Storaro shot it, and it had enough style 
that a kid could watch it and see that he was telling the story just a little 
differently, like when he moved the camera through the walls. It intrigued me. 
So, when I went to college, blindly, I applied to film school, which starts 
junior year. </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">And 
then, it was great. In our second year, when we got to make a thesis film, I 
became an addict. It was like basketball, but to the next level. You're like the 
point guard, dealing with all these egos. You have to make sure everyone is 
running the play and everything's in line so you can achieve the vision. That's 
what excites me. I barely know anything, and I just want to get better. But it's 
so expensive: even the lowest budget is more money than I've ever seen. I want 
to respect the process. If I can, that's what drives me. </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">In a 
way, my old Orange County sensibility is still part of me. I saw <i>Jackass </i>
for the first time a couple of weeks ago in a hotel. I thought it was going to 
be just lame, but I actually enjoyed it, because it wasn't trying to be what it 
wasn't. When they were laughing offscreen, they were enjoying themselves. 
There's so much truth to that. I'd like to experiment, to try different genre 
films. </font></span></p>
<hr size="1">
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
CF:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> On 
that tip, what kind of experiment is it for <i>BLT</i> to feature Asian American 
characters? </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><b><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">
JL:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
Well, there are a few ways to think about that. One, I remember when I was a 
kid, in the '80s, and Denzel was just starting to come up, and &quot;studios&quot; were 
nervous because they thought audiences wouldn't relate to an African-American 
lead. And now, every other weekend, you see African-American films opening. Two, 
if it's &quot;universal,&quot; it doesn't mean it's not Asian American. This film has to 
be Asian-American, upper-middle-class, and honor-roll, teen males. But there are 
certain concerns that everyone can relate to, like I can relate to <i>Goodfellas</i>. 
If it's marketed as &quot;universal,&quot; people are seeing the characters as human 
beings. I didn't want the characters to have to explain why they exist. I don't 
feel like I have to do that. </font></span></p>

There's also a repeated pressure for the &quot;breakthrough&quot; film. Wasn't <i>Joy Luck 
Club</i> the &quot;breakthrough&quot; a few years ago? </font></span></p>

JL:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> It 
was very successful, and now they make a <i>Joy Luck Club</i> every couple of 
years. Again, it goes back to why do I want to make this film? Not to bust it 
open, but because these are the issues and perspectives that I want to explore.

you feel you can take advantage of a range of venues to get your work seen?

JL:</font></span></i></b><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> It's 
still a business, no matter the festivals or the cable outlets. You have to make 
a profit to be able to make your next film. That's the tricky thing. There have 
been low budget Asian films made in recent years, ranging from like $10,000 to 
$1.7 million. None of these films have made money; that's bad because the people 
who invested in those films won't invest in another Asian American movie. The 
reality is that the studios own 99% of the screens. It is good to support films 
at festivals, but you have to support them at the box office. I know there are 
some Asian-American films that they tried to four-wall, but it's not a realistic 
model for making a profit. </font></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">That's 
the struggle for anyone who's trying to make movies outside the studios: you 
have to go through the studios, in the end. It's daunting. The structure is set 
up for you to fail, as an independent film. That's the hypocrisy of the system: 
less money is put into marketing an independent film, but they expect you to do 
so much more, because you're on fewer screens. As a cinema, there hasn't even 
been an Asian American film made for over $2 million. And low budgets are 
usually considered $5 million! This film doesn't have to make that much money 
because it was made for so little. But I'm confident that more projects will be 
greenlit now. </font></span></p>

you're representing in the end, no matter what you do. </font></span></p>

That's true. That's why ethnic politics and ethnic cinema cause clutter for 
filmmakers. As a community, we have to grow, and not be afraid what people 
think. We need enough -- in numbers and variety -- so that we can <i>have</i> a 
cinema. </font></span></p>
