            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>A Special Jury
            Award &quot;for artistic merit and emotional truth&quot; at the 2003
            Sundance Film Festival and an Official Selection at this year's

            last roles) stars Tony-winning actress Judith Ivey as a hard
            shouldered, warm hearted floozie.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Before we get to
            Ivey's character, we meet Alice Cahill (newcomer Emily Grace), a naïve
            young thing heading from Milford, New Hampshire to Florida to visit
            her increasingly presumptuous college friend Julie. Self-emancipated
            from her career in fast food and dreaming of a perhaps unrealistic
            future in marine biology, she packs her hopes in a plastic bag, and
            tosses them in her rusting out Ford. Alas, the stupid kid leaves
            cash in her open car at a rest stop.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Wherein the
            overly friendly, aging Southern belle Sandra Evans (Ivey) and her
            seeming saint of a husband Bill (Bill Raymond) help the girl to a
            ride in their RV after her car has reportedly been vandalized by
            some redneck (perhaps the pea-brained one who flaunted his tongue at
            her on the highway; she flashed her finger back). Yeah, maybe it's a
            ruse. Maybe not. Let's not spoil it for you. But the Evans, retired
            and roaming the countryside, wash the bad luck off Alice's roadside
            distraction, while she spins them Cinderella tales of a fabricated
            idyllic past.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">A few six-packs
            later, an inquisitive highway cop and some dropped pants ultimately
            get Alice's thinking rattled. There's more than one person with
            confused signals, and Alice grows up a whole lot before the morning
            sun rises.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Director-writer
            Bell fitfully fills in Alice's reasons for leaving her New England
            wonderland, popping memories at us as Alice recalls them. Her best
            friend's gone; her divorced mom has a put down for every expectation
            she's ever had; her sleazy boss likes to pat her rump; an invisible
            dad has abandoned his family; Alice's blue-collar, gun-toting
            boyfriends are bums. The list goes on. Food coupons don't help her
            build self esteem, but Alice's makeover, courtesy of her new
            friends, sure does.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Bell came up with
            the idea for <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">What Alice Found</i> in the late 1980s, after having read a news item
            about a highway couple conning a young woman. The script was
            finished in 1995, financing set in 2000, and then 9/11 brought the
            project tumbling back to square one. Perhaps a good thing, as the
            modest budget for shooting digital video might have been better
            funded by the longer-than-expected wait for the production schedule
            to gel. The feature can't and shouldn't be compared to the
            mega-million studio films opening on thousands of screens. It's much
            more personal and intimate. Adds Bell, &quot;We felt the tough,
            pragmatic, low resolution look of DV complemented the themes and
            accurately captured the film's road trip narrative.&quot; I felt the
            pacing could have been tightened and some of the dialogue
            overlapped, but it doesn't detract from the story. In working with
            his cast in a video verité style, the director isn't reluctant to
            show his actors in full frontal, and they're not hesitant to reveal
            themselves.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Emily Grace's
            turn as an ugly duckling turned smart-looking cookie is a sly
            performance that grows on you. Her Alice is strictly of proletarian
            origin, yet she eventually gets herself street savvy to the
            goings-on for which Sandra is primping her. The low-cut dress, the
            new coif, the gussying up. With each new layer of makeup, Alice's
            curiosity quotient is raised. She hardens, too. &quot;Your (grown)
            daughter know…what you do?&quot; is slung at her chaperone more as
            a derogatory statement than a question.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As for
            &quot;mom&quot; and &quot;pop,&quot; these are some highly unusual
            job descriptions for fifty-somethings (my contemporaries, good
            grief): whore and pimp. Ivey's slant on her character is that God
            gave her (i.e., woman) the physical goods to please man (more than
            one in this case), and she's happy as a clam to talk about money,
            sex, marriage. I just love the way she unceremoniously dresses the
            part. All she expects from Alice is something in return. (Something
            more than a simple thank you.) Despite Sandra's unorthodox
            occupation, she's more than happy to casually and bluntly discuss
            the trade's trials and tribulations with Alice over a game of
            miniature golf. You're inclined to forget what she's doing is
            illegal. Still, the penniless Alice is intrigued by the hourly rates
            and the nomenclature used to describe the various service offerings.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">What
            Alice Found</font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2"> redefines the
            term recreational vehicle. As Susan says in her sly Southern drawl,
            &quot;I could tell you some stories,&quot; you think, yes indeed.
            Here is a humorous, matter-of-fact, how-to, road trip film for the
            unwanted. Ivey is totally believable as the earth-mother/teacher.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><a name="OLE_LINK3" target="_top"><font face="Verdana" size="2">There's
            something fresh and honest here. </font></a><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yeah,
            repugnant and progressively grotesque, too. Alice's makeup changes
            her so much that a convenience store clerk can't recognize her when
            proofing (for an antacid?) from her driver's license. This is not a
            vocation every teenage girl should happen into, even if such
            roadside attractions as Bill and Sandra come across as God's honest
            children. Still, anyone who espouses safe sex with such Southern
            charm and frankness should at least have a movie made about them and
            their honey bunny wagon.</font></p>
            <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">For Alice and
            what she found, the road to Miami is paved with confusion, and built
            somewhere between a rock and a hard place. Epitaph: Don't
            necessarily judge people by what they do, but by who they are.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
