            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">KJ Doughton</a>, 18 April 2003</i></font><p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Say what you will about 
			singer-cum-director Rob Zombie, but one thing is indisputable. This 
			hairy, dread-locked, cartoon-scribbling metalmeister, a favorite 
			with bikers, headbangers, and goths, definitely knows his horror 
			movies. For <i>House of 1,000 Corpses</i>, Zombie pays homage to 
			those beloved seventies drive-in shockers that peaked with <i>Texas 
			Chainsaw Massacre</i> before they were later recycled, lampooned, 
			and repackaged with slick marketing as <i>Scream, Blair Witch 
			Project,</i> and other pretenders to the throne of gut-bucket, low 
			brow horror.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A pet project that Zombie nurtured 
			like a paternal overseer until its production wrapped in 2001 (it 
			was then hurled between reluctant studios like a hot potato until 
			Lion’s Gate Films released it), <i>House of 1,000 Corpses</i> is 
			like one of the human skin-suits glimpsed in <i>Silence of the Lambs</i>. 
			Taking an eyeball from this film, and a severed arm from that one, 
			this all-too-familiar cinematic carcass is lovingly sewn from bits 
			and pieces of nearly every grade-B gore classic ever to splatter the 
			screen.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For instance, the movie opens as 
			bubbly friends Jerry, Denise, Bill, and Mary pull into a seedy gas 
			station helmed by Captain Spalding (Sid Haig). A grotesque, roadside 
			carny, he decorates his macabre filling stop with mounted animal 
			heads, freaks of nature (the fish-man, anyone?), and musty, 
			dust-coated skeletons. Decked out in garish pancake makeup and a 
			red, white, and blue vaudeville suit, Spalding looks like a 
			political campaigner gone frighteningly round the bend. Oh – and did 
			I mention that this clown-faced, pot-bellied Okie also markets a 
			special blend of fried chicken? Right away, images of <i>Motel Hell, 
			Psycho, Rocky Horror Picture Show, and Funhouse</i> come to mind.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Later, when the four doomed 
			travelers are abducted by a leering family of rotten-toothed, 
			white-trash scuzzballs, things veer into serious <i>Texas Chainsaw…
			</i>territory. Or is this <i>Deliverance</i>? Or perhaps <i>Mother’s 
			Day</i>? Uh, <i>Last House on the Left</i>?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What comes next is a nonstop 
			smorgasbord of unpleasant torment and disturbing, decaying imagery. 
			Zombie’s film is in a different world from the humor-heavy, 
			effects-laden energies spurting from the minds of directors Stuart 
			Gordon <i>(Re-Animator, From Beyond</i>), Sam Raimi (<i>Evil Dead</i>- 
			and later, <i>Spider Man</i>) and Peter Jackson (whose pre-<i>Lord 
			of the Rings</i> horror classics included <i>Dead Alive</i> and <i>
			Bad Taste</i>). <i>House of 1,000 Corpses</i> has its bloody scenes, 
			but the imagery is more doomy than graphic. In this sense, its 
			aesthetic is more in line with the early works of Wes Craven (<i>Last 
			House on the Left</i>) and Tobe Hooper, whose <i>Texas Chainsaw…</i> 
			set the standard. Looking back, Hooper’s milestone had very little 
			blood. Its power was conjured forth by quick-cuts to a clucking 
			chicken, a dilating pupil, or a demented old man trying to clutch a 
			sledgehammer. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meanwhile, the <i>…Corpses</i> cast 
			is a casket-full of seventies icons. Karen Black, the busty, 
			cross-eyed star of <i>Capricorn One</i> and <i>In Praise of Older 
			Women</i>, appears as a slutty matriarch named Mother Firefly. In 
			need of some serious dental work, you can almost smell the halitosis 
			emanating from her vile mouth. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>House of 1,000 Corpses</i> is 
			one of those genre films that seem impervious to reviews. If you’re 
			into the particular types of dingy, dank depths that Zombie prefers 
			to inhabit, this unashamed genre flick will probably satiate such 
			cravings. If you’re of more delicate sensibilities – well, the title 
			alone will probably be enough to scare you off. </font></td>
