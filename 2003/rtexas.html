            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            images are indelible: a monster wears a mask made of human faces; an
            old man sucks blood from a screaming girl's finger; a girl runs in
            circles around the very house she's trying to escape. And of course,
            the chainsaw -- roaring, raised high, cutting through limbs, torsos,
            doors. In 1974, the release of <i>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i>
            changed the ways viewers thought about horror. Shot for $140,000
            with a manifestly amateurish cast, Tobe Hooper's first feature went
            on to make over $30 million in the U.S. alone. A favorite of
            academics -- who see in it critiques of the Vietnam War, patriarchy,
            frontier myths, and consumer capitalism -- <i>Texas Chainsaw
            Massacre</i> has inspired frequent homages, descendants, copies,
            sequels, and remakes. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            latest of the last is, like the first, set in sweltering August
            1973. It begins, again, with John Larroquette's voiceover attesting
            to the film's basis in a &quot;true story&quot; (as well as the
            first film, as he also narrated that one). Under this solemn
            narration runs &quot;confirmation&quot; of the truth claim, in the
            form of a police &quot;crime scene&quot; film (a seeming nod to <i>The
            Blair Witch Project</i>). A deputy points out the scratch marks and
            blood stains on the stairwell leading to the dank and drippy
            basement of the &quot;Hewitt house,&quot; offered up in scritchy
            sepia footage, handheld and too close. All bad. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            dated footage gives way to the moment it apparently documents --
            circa-'70s blondish color (the new movie is shot, beautifully, by
            original <i>TCM</i> cinematographer Daniel Pearl): five kids in a
            van, headed from Mexico to Dallas by way of Nowhere, Texas. The
            group consists of straight-ahead thinker Andy (Mike Vogel), his
            recent lovechild pickup Pepper (Erica Leerhsen), annoying Morgan
            (Jonathan Tucker), baseball-capped driver Kemper (Eric Balfour), and
            his girlfriend Erin (Jessica Biel who, with this role, can consider
            her much-publicized campaign to beat down her goody-girl <i>Seventh
            Heaven</i> typecasting done.) <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">As
            before, the kids are smoking dope, sweating, and making out,
            ostensibly dooming them, morally, until they meet the Hewitts, that
            is, Leatherface (Andrew Bryniarski) and family, who set any standard
            morality on its ear. This meeting is orchestrated slightly
            differently this time, as the van kids pick up not Leatherface's
            whacked-out brother, but a delirious escaped victim (Laura German).
            On seeing that the van is headed back in the direction she came
            from, the girl promptly shoots herself (granting the film its most
            sensationally crowd-pleasing image). Unsure how to handle the body
            and trusting the locals -- including the predictably sadistic
            Sheriff Hoyt (R. Lee Ermey) -- the vansters are slowly sucked into
            one disastrous encounter after another. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            most dreadful of these, of course, involve Leatherface, notoriously
            produced by inbreeding and born into a family of cannibals (the
            slaughterhouse reappears, all dark corners and lockers and sides of
            beef). The ghastly cretin is incapable of speech and wholly
            relentless in his pursuit of fleshly collectibles. His home -- shot
            here so that it stands tall and stark, against shadows and clouds --
            is the ultimate Terrible Place, adorned with human bones, peepholes,
            chickens and pigs, and doll parts. This time, the threat of a next
            generation (and a next after that) looms, in the form of the feral
            child Jedidiah (David Dorfman): if only he can come to sympathy,
            instead of self-satiation. If only he can come to see the victims as
            images of himself. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">One
            by one, the kids wander inside the Terrible Place, and all but one
            can't escape. Last Girl Erin becomes, like Sally (the excruciating
            and amazing Marilyn Burns) before her, a mirror image of the brutal,
            canny fiend she battles throughout. Though she must also endure a
            couple of overwrought, big-music moments (such as a superfluous
            mercy killing, only underlining what you already know her, that she
            is capable of great violence and great courage), Erin is more
            overtly tough than Sally, even borrowing a moment from <i>TCM2</i>'s
            more tomboyish Stretch (Caroline Williams).<o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            first feature by music video director Marcus Nispel (George Michael,
            Lil' Kim [the fabulous &quot;No Time&quot;], Bryan Adams), the new <i>Texas
            Chainsaw Massacre</i> venerates the first film and its fans (going
            so far as to include a victim cameo by Harry Knowles), but also,
            disturbingly and appropriately, accommodates its own moment. This
            even as it's plainly cashing in on a brand name, crassly putting its
            $13 million budget (courtesy of Michael Bay producing) onscreen in
            makeup and digital effects, and blatantly borrowing from any number
            of more inventive films. <o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Hooper's
            movie famously reflected frustrations and fears of the early 1970s,
            in its low-budget severity and visual chaos. Scholar Robin Wood has
            argued that Hooper's movie took on &quot;the authentic quality of a
            nightmare,&quot; such that it represented a sense of endless loss
            and disorder, inevitable political and moral calamity (<i>Hollywood
            From Vietnam to Reagan</i> [1986]). This relation to context made
            the movie resonate, linked it to other films doing similar work (Wes
            Craven's <i>Last House on the Left</i> [1972] and even earlier,
            George Romero's <i>Night of the Living Dead</i> [1969]), and viewers
            looking to be creeped out gave it legs, for years. <o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">With
            most all expectations set against it, 2003's <i>Texas Chainsaw
            Massacre</i>, also speaks to its moment. Yes, it's part of a
            resurgence of the genre -- gross-out horror inflicted on young,
            mostly unknown bodies, less snappily ironic than the <i>Scream</i>
            movies, but no less deft in its dark comedy. Worse, and more
            difficult to know now, it also points out its own context, the
            torrents of horrors that take place daily around the world and on
            television. It is its own nightmare -- recycling the past in a
            frightful present.</span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"></o:p>
