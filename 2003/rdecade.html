			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">A Decade Under the Influence<span style="font-style:normal">, 
			Richard LaGravenese and the late Ted Demme’s loving ode to ‘70s 
			filmmaking, transports us back to a time when American films were 
			defined by more than their clever marketing strategies, fast food 
			tie -- ins, and opening weekend grosses. A spry, reverential look at 
			the decade that momentarily turned Hollywood on its ear, the film 
			takes a straightforward approach to the material, interspersing 
			passages from some of the period’s most important films (</span>The 
			Godfather<span style="font-style:normal">, </span>Dog Day Afternoon<span style="font-style:
normal">, </span>Taxi Driver<span style="font-style:normal">, </span>M*A*S*H<span style="font-style:normal">,
			</span>The Last Picture Show<span style="font-style:
normal">, etc) with talking -- head commentary from the men and women who 
			changed the industry. While it offers little that hasn’t been 
			covered ad nauseum at some point during the past thirty years (much 
			of it was recently documented in Peter Biskind’s controversial
			</span>Easy Riders, Raging Bulls<span style="font-style:normal">, 
			itself the source material for a recent documentary on the Trio 
			network), </span>Influence<span style="font-style:normal"> 
			nonetheless succeeds as a joyous piece of lightweight nostalgia.</span></font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="font-style:normal">A 
			veritable who’s who of Hollywood greats&nbsp; &nbsp;-- &nbsp;including Francis Ford 
			Coppola, William Friedkin, Robert Altman, Polly Platt, Martin 
			Scorsese, Sidney Lumet, Peter Bogdanovich, Robert Towne, Paul 
			Schrader, Julie Christie, Ellen Burstyn, and Bruce Dern &nbsp;-- &nbsp;guide 
			us through this festival of film clips, and most are surprisingly 
			even -- handed in recounting how a bloated Hollywood system built on 
			God -- like stars and elaborate spectacles fell out of favor with 
			the counterculture that had gained prominence in the ‘60s. The civil 
			rights, women’s rights, and anti -- Vietnam movements, coupled with 
			the influence of the French and Italian New Wave cinema of the ‘60s, 
			created a group of filmmakers, as well as an audience, that craved 
			gritty, realistic films built around disenchanted, anti -- 
			establishment protagonists; in other words, the exact opposite of 
			traditional Hollywood entertainment. </span>Influence<span style="font-style:normal"> 
			opens with newsreel footage of the world premiere of 1969’s Barbara 
			Streisand’s musical </span>Hello Dolly<span style="font-style:normal">, 
			and the directors insert comical narration over the scene as a means 
			of gently mocking the opulence of the era. Anyone who’s watched
			</span>E!<span style="font-style:normal"> knows that the dream of 
			forever doing away with such pageantry never truly materialized &nbsp;-- 
			&nbsp;stars continue to promote their shallow summer movie extravaganzas 
			by staging lavish premieres for a celebrity-hungry public &nbsp;-- &nbsp;but 
			the point is effectively made that, for a short time in the ‘70s, it 
			seemed as though a handful of young directors just might usher in a 
			New Hollywood characterized by daring, unconventional, and highly 
			personal films.</span></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="font-style:normal">Yet 
			as the filmmakers willingly acknowledge before the end credits, for 
			all the great films and filmmakers included in this documentary, 
			there are just as many conspicuously missing from its supposedly 
			wide-ranging retrospective (</span>American Graffiti<span style="font-style:
normal">, </span>Serpico<span style="font-style:normal">, </span>Apocalypse Now<span style="font-style:normal">). 
			In some regards, this failure at comprehensiveness is a blessing, 
			since at an hour and fifty minutes, </span>Influence<span style="font-style:normal"> 
			is long enough. Most everything is covered in some fashion, from 
			obvious blockbusters like </span>The Godfather<span style="font-style:normal"> 
			and </span>The Exorcist<span style="font-style:normal"> to more 
			obscure (at least in terms of general public knowledge) classics 
			like John Cassavetes’ gritty </span>Faces<span style="font-style:normal"> 
			and Hal Ashby’s hilariously profane </span>The Last Detail<span style="font-style:normal">. 
			Half the pleasure of the film is simply sitting back and watching 
			all-too-brief scenes from some favorite films &nbsp;-- &nbsp;at the screening 
			I attended, the famous Marshall McLuhan scene from Woody Allen’s
			</span>Annie Hall<span style="font-style:normal"> had no trouble 
			eliciting boisterous laughs &nbsp;-- &nbsp;in pristine condition up on the big 
			screen.</span></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This being a loving tribute to the 
			past, the film’s account of how these brash young mavericks (led by 
			Coppola, who seemed to be the Napoleon of the ‘70s American 
			filmmaking renaissance) stormed the gates of struggling studios such 
			as Paramount Pictures is brazenly subjective. Even when an 
			intelligent critical remark appears &nbsp;-- &nbsp;more often than not 
			courtesy of Julie Christie, who wisely opines that the decade was 
			defined by exuberant male energy, leaving most women with a limited 
			role in this revolution &nbsp;-- &nbsp;there’s no doubt that the exploits of 
			these now-legendary figures are meant to leave us in awe. While I 
			have no qualms with the film’s decision to avoid the mud slinging 
			and gossiping that characterized much of Biskind’s book, there’s a 
			general sense of LaGravenese and Demme treating their material with 
			kid gloves. It’s a film made by film lovers and for film lovers, 
			shamelessly preaching to the choir at every turn.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Such an approach would be fine if 
			not for the fact that the end of this era &nbsp;-- &nbsp;caused by directors 
			like Coppola, Scorsese, and Bogdanovich (among others) allowing 
			success to go to their heads, the result of which was bloated vanity 
			projects that bombed with audiences &nbsp;-- &nbsp;wasn’t treated so 
			perfunctorily. Even more casually discussed is the enormous paradigm 
			shift in how studios approached the business in the wake of <i>Jaws</i> 
			and <i>Star Wars</i>. Even though the widespread claim that Lucas 
			and Spielberg single-handedly destroyed this pioneering movement &nbsp;-- 
			&nbsp;a claim not overtly repeated in this documentary &nbsp;-- &nbsp;has always 
			struck me as simplistic and vindictive, the failure to substantially 
			address Spielberg and Lucas’ impact leaves one with the impression 
			that the duo behind this documentary find these two heralded 
			directors unworthy of inclusion in the ‘70s filmmaking pantheon.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">These shortcomings, however, 
			ultimately seem both unavoidable (including everyone’s favorite 
			films, anecdotes, and viewpoints would probably result in an 
			unwieldy ten-hour documentary) and only moderately important. For 
			the most part, <i>A Decade Under the Influence</i> is an 
			intoxicating trip back in time.</font></td>
