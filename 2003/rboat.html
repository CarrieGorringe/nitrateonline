            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan Lybarger</a>,
            14 March 2003</i></font><p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">A lot of 
			movies aim for the lowest common denominator. <i>Boat Trip</i> is 
			merely low. There's no common denominator here. This flick is simply 
			beneath its viewers.</font></b></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Co-writer Mort 
			Nathan once had a hand in the script for the Farrelly Brothers' <i>
			Kingpin</i>, but he has no recollection of what made the pervious 
			film as amusing as it was tasteless. <i>Boat Trip </i>exudes 
			tackiness, and there's even a semen gag like the one in <i>There's 
			Something about Mary</i>. On his own, though, Nathan's not funny. 
			He's merely gross.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">His first of a 
			multitude of blunders is trying to make the audience care about two 
			of the dumbest bipeds in screen history. Ostriches have an edge over 
			Jerry (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) and Nick (Horatio Sanz, a.k.a the loud 
			obnoxious fellow you hire when Jack Black is too expensive or doing 
			better things). The former is breaking his heart over a spoiled rich 
			girl (a sadly misused Vivica A. Fox) who has dumped him months 
			before, and Nick is so dim and annoying that he'll never have to 
			resort to artificial birth control. Nick is so slight-of-brain that 
			he accidentally insults his own mother while trading putdowns with 
			rude strangers.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">When Nick 
			discovers that cruise ships offer even dolts like Jerry and himself 
			the chance to meet available women, the two head for the travel 
			office. They make the mistake of upsetting a travel agent (an 
			unbilled Will Farrell, who's one of the film's few bright spots), 
			and the bitter fellow sends the two would-be swingers on a gay 
			cruise without telling them.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Much of the 
			reason that <i>Boat Trip </i>is so dreary is that we as the audience 
			figures out the setup long before these Rhodes Scholars get a clue. 
			When two fellows in bondage outfits and a slew of drag queens pass 
			by, Jerry and Nick's obliviousness seems insulting to both them and 
			the viewers. Couldn't these guys at least notice there are no 
			biological female passengers?</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">One of the guilty 
			charms of <i>Kingpin</i> is that the characters were reasonably 
			intelligent (Harrelson knows that bowling isn't the most practical 
			way to make a buck), but fate still had a way of making fools of 
			them. The scenario in <i>Boat Trip</i> inspires a &quot;serves you right&quot; 
			contempt for the Nick and Jerry that never lets up. On board, Jerry 
			falls for the only woman on the vessel, a dance instructor (Roselyn 
			Sanchez, from <i>Rush Hour 2</i>) who prefers the company of gay 
			men. Meanwhile Nick plays poker with some gay card sharks and 
			discovers they aren't so bad. No kidding?</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Jerry's situation 
			was kind of amusing when it happened in the Rock Hudson comedy <i>
			Pillow Talk</i>. The idea's even funnier now because we now know 
			that Hudson was a gay actor playing a straight character trying to 
			convince a potential girlfriend he's gay (&quot;I don't know how long I 
			can keep this up,&quot; he says in a voiceover). Gooding's performance, 
			of course has no such subtext or even substance. The Oscar winner 
			stumbles through a drag show and does more mugging than a coffee 
			shop. Having demonstrated a finesse in both drama (<i>Boyz N the 
			Hood</i>) and comedy (<i>Jerry McGuire</i>), it's a shame this guy 
			has continually squandered his formidable talent on undeserving junk 
			like <i>Chill Factor</i>, <i>Instinct</i> and <i>Pearl Harbor</i>. 
			Next time, Cuba, try reading the script before you sign the 
			contract. </font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Many gay viewers 
			will quickly tire of the stereotypes, and women get degraded as 
			well. There's an irritating subplot involving a Swedish sunbathing 
			team rescued by the cruise ship. One member is even played by 
			Playboy video regular Victoria Silvstedt. Their arrival is so 
			contrived that the site of scantily clad visitors quickly looses its 
			ogle factor. As can only happen in a film like this, Silvstedt falls 
			for Nick.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">About the only 
			think remarkably interesting about <i>Boat Trip</i> is that it 
			features the first and only known pairing of movie icons James Bond 
			and John Shaft. Roger Moore and Richard Roundtree both appear in <i>
			Boat Trip</i> but share no screen time and should probably consider 
			erasing it from their résumés. At least Moore seems to enjoy playing 
			a hedonistic cruise passenger, which is more than can be said for 
			the rest of the cast.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">As the movie 
			progressed, I longed to hear Celine Dion warble about her heart 
			going on, not because I like the sappy tune but because it would be 
			an indication that this dreary boat would sink.</font></td>
