            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>My four-year-old nephew can
            write his own name. This puts him several steps above the folks who
            wrote the screenplay for <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Kangaroo
            Jack</i>.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Some of the dialogue in this latest
            entry from high-concept mastermind Jerry Bruckheimer (who
            occasionally slips up and produces watchable movies like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Black
            Hawk Down</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Remember the
            Titans</i>) really does sound like the kind of bizarre non-sequiturs
            that kids frequently utter. During one allegedly emotionally charged
            scene in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Kangaroo Jack</i>,
            Anthony Anderson bellows, "If you’re in the ocean, call Free
            Willy. Free Willy will set you free." English isn’t the only
            language that gets mangled. Director David McNally handles cinematic
            syntax with the same eloquence that George W. Bush demonstrates in
            unprepared remarks. Even my nephew knows better than to mix mob
            movie clichés, teen sex comedy groaners, and offensive Australian
            stereotypes into an unappetizing concoction that’s allegedly for
            kids. Flatulence gags will take you only so far<br>
            As <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Kangaroo Jack</i>
            progresses, it’s hard to tell where the film went wrong because
            almost nothing goes right. Jerry O’Connell stars as Charlie, a New
            York hairdresser who’s under the thumb of his mobster stepfather
            (an understandably indifferent Christopher Walken). Casting
            O’Connell in anything role is a major mistake from the beginning.
            He was likable as a tubby little kid in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Stand
            by Me</i>. But now that he’s a slimmed down, buff adult, he has no
            discernable personality. Like Ricki Lake before him, he lost what
            ever made him interesting when he shed the pounds. As for his taste
            in roles (the critical and box office duds <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tomcats</i>
            and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Buying the Cow</i>), the trend continues.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The older man has put up money for
            Charlie’s shop and would probably rather whack the lad instead of
            claim him. If Charlie’s family life is unfortunate, his taste in
            friends is appalling and potentially fatal. Louis (Anthony Anderson,
            at his loudest and most irritating) once saved Charlie’s life and
            now drags the schlub along with him on several dubious "business"
            opportunities. One in particular leads to a high-speed chase that
            attracts the cops to Charlie’s stepfather. This might have been
            fun if McNally knew how to stage action scenes like Bruckheimer
            regular director Tony Scott does. Instead, all we get is quick
            cutting and Anderson’ loud shrieking. In real life, Charlie and
            Louis would be dead instantly because of their offense, putting us
            out of their misery. Sadly, this is Hollywood, so the lads are sent
            to rural Australia on an improbable mission to deliver a mysterious
            package to a "Mr. Smith." Being that Charlie and Louis are the
            dumbest creatures on two legs, they open the parcel to discover
            $50,000 (I suppose wiseguys have never heard of Federal Express).
            You can tell a movie is falling apart when the logic problems start
            leaping out at you like a stampede of feisty kangaroos. Speaking of
            the marsupials, the boys lose the money on the way to the drop point
            when Charlie hits a kangaroo and Louis places his jacket, containing
            the package, on the roo. The beast hops off, leaving the Louis and
            Charlie in a rugged land where all the men drink like Nicolas Cage
            in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Leaving Las Vegas</i> and
            dress like Crocodile Dundee.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Kangaroo
            Jack</i> was shot entirely Down Under (even the cheesy "New York"
            scenes), McNally and screenwriters Steve Bing and Scott Rosenberg
            make little effort to capitalize on the locale. We don’t learn
            anything about the country that we haven’t seen on <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Crocodile
            Hunter</i>. At times, the only way we get to know the film is really
            set in Australia is from the musical cues (yep, you get to hear that
            Men at Work song one more time).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>Many of the animal scenes look as if they’d been taken from
            outtakes of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Mutual of
            Omaha’s Wild Kingdom</i>. You’d think a producer with
            Bruckheimer’s vast resources could find stock footage that
            didn’t look so worn. When Charlie and Louis find themselves
            surrounded by dingoes, we never almost see the guys or the wild dogs
            in the same shot. It’s almost like watching the 60’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Tarzan</i>
            TV-series where real African footage was clumsily grafted into the
            Hollywood-shot story.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Maybe sensing that the narrative
            and the setting were unclear, the filmmakers added an expatriate
            American naturalist played by Estella Warren from <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Driven</i>.
            If O’Connell and Anderson have all the comic instincts of Leopold
            and Loeb, Warren adds a factor that makes <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Kangaroo
            Jack</i> questionable fare for children. It’s easy to see why she
            was cast. She has a face that resembles a statue of a Greek goddess.
            It’s too bad that her visage is almost as expressive. Since acting
            isn’t Warren’s strong suit, the filmmakers make her the butt of
            a couple of demeaning sequences: one where O’Connell gropes her
            bosom and another where she, wearing a flimsy halter-top, showers
            under a waterfall.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As for the computer-generated
            kangaroo who dominates the trailers for <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Kangaroo
            Jack</i>, he’s smarter and more entertaining than any of the
            humans in front of or behind the camera. While he might not be
            consistently convincing as a roo (his resemblance to Joe Camel is
            uncanny), he at least appears biological (unlike the cast) and gets
            a few intentional laughs. The rapping sequence in the previews is
            sadly just a dream sequence. But at the end, he complains that he
            wasn’t given enough screen time. He’s right.<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:
