            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory
            Avery</a>, 8 August 2003</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In one of the opening scenes of <i>The
            Chess Player</i>, a group of Polish Lithuanians secretly gather at a
            house outside of the town of Vilnius, where, at the stroke of
            midnight, they sing their country's national anthem, something which
            has been strictly forbidden: it is the year 1776, and that part of
            Poland has become occupied by troops of the Russian empress
            Catharine II, troops that patrol every road and byway every night.
            At one point, someone signals the approach of soldiers on horseback,
            and the singers grow silent as they wait for the patrol to pass.
            What makes this scene remarkable is that &quot;The Chess
            Player&quot; is a silent film, made in France in 1927, before the
            advent of sound, but when you recall the sequence afterwards you
            remember it as if you heard the sound of the horses' hoofbeats on
            the road outside.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To see a French silent film today
            is one thing; to see it presented with its original music (and
            conducted by Carl Davis) is something else. (The 1923 film <b><i>L'Inhumaine</i></b>
            survives, but its original score, by the composer Darius Milhaud, is
            lost.) <i>The Chess Player</i> -- which is premiering on U.S. video
            in a splendidly restored print -- starts out as a somewhat
            conventional, if colorful, historical melodrama. There's Boleslas
            (Pierre Blanchar, who would later go on to play Raskolnikov opposite
            Harry Baur's Inspector Porfiry in the 1935 version of <i>Crime and
            Punishment</i>) and Sophie (Edith Jehanne, who has a genuinely
            stellar beauty before the camera), who have been raised as
            brother-and-sister by the mysterious Baron von Kempelen (Charles
            Dullin). Sophie falls for a Russian, Serge (Camille Bert), while
            Boleslas, an officer in a joint &quot;Russo-Polish regiment&quot;
            stationed in Vilnius, ends up leading an uprising against the
            occupiers. Defeated, he ends up being sheltered by von Kempelen,
            while the Russians put a price on his head.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">And then von Kempelen gets an idea
            -- which is where the film turns very unusual indeed. Inspired by
            Boleslas' natural genius at chess, von Kempelen creates an automaton
            chess player, which is capable at besting any challenger -- able to
            analyze moves and make decisions, it functions as a sort of
            18th-century computer. The device --topped by a huge turban, and
            with a long curving mustache and big eyebrows that raise
            sardonically -- amazes everyone wherever it is shown, allowing for
            von Kempelen to travel with it closer and closer to the Polish
            border, where Boleslas could escape to safety. The automaton device
            is a carapace within which Boleslas is able to elude capture and
            detection, but he must hide in it for long, long periods of time --
            one of the most peculiarly masochistic feats since Lon Chaney got
            both of his arms cut off to please Joan Crawford in <i>The Unknown</i>
            (1927).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Aside from the story, the film has
            a number of other accomplishments. It makes effective use of
            montage, a year after Eisenstein first employed it in <i>Potemkin</i>.
            Parts of a battle scene are filmed with almost abstract visuals,
            with the combatants racing past the camera so that they are turned
            into semi-transparent blurs, and some of the other action and fight
            scenes look like they were filmed, in part, using a hand-held
            camera. A climatic scene where one character is surrounded by
            automatons advancing on all sides, wielding swords, recalls the
            climax to Karel Capek's play, <i>R.U.R</i>., which first coined the
            term &quot;robot&quot; and had just premiered on the stage in 1920.</font></p>
            <p><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Chess Player</font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">
            concludes with one of those classic, harrowing twists-of-fate story
            turns in which von Kempelen is asked, i.e. commanded, to present his
            fantastic automaton, with Boleslas inside it, at the court of
            Catherine II (Marcelle Charles-Dullin, who makes a splendid empress)
            -- it turns out that she considers herself to be an expert chess
            player, as well as ruler of All the Russias. Stranger still is that
            the film's story turns out to be based on fact: there really was a
            chess-playing machine, named &quot;the Turk&quot;, which fascinated
            Europe during the eighteenth and nineteenth century, in part because
            nobody could really figure out how it worked. The name of the
            inventor of such a machine? One Baron Wolfgang von Kempelen.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
