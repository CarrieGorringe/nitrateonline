            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Writer John Sayles' detractors
            sometimes dismiss his self-directed films as civics lessons. When
            he's making his own films, Sayles is often more worried about
            cultural clashes and other social issues than he is with figuring
            how to make things blow up. But to his credit, Sayles can also tap
            into the factors that prevent easy resolutions to issues like cross
            border immigration, and he's also careful to make his characters
            seem more like people than personifications.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">That's frequently the case with his
            latest inexpensively made and dialogue-heavy film, <i>Casa de Los
            Babys</i>. In addition to examining the strains in cross-border
            relations between the United States and its neighbors to the south,
            Sayles also examines even broader topics like love and motherhood.
            He might be examining quirks in legal and political systems, but
            he's still capable of making seemingly arcane subject matter
            engrossing and occasionally moving.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">His protagonists are a group of six
            women who are all but stranded in an unnamed Latin American country.
            Each is waiting to adopt a child, but all are required to
            temporarily live in the country before they can take the tots home
            with them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Their hosts
            are ambivalent, to say the least, about the would-be mothers. The
            frustrated hotel owner Sra. Muñoz (Rita Moreno) has had enough of
            one particularly fussy customer (Marcia Gay Harden) but needs the
            group's money to stay in business.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The rest of Sra. Muñoz's guests
            might be a little more agreeable, but each brings her own baggage.
            Skipper (Daryl Hannah) alienates the rest of the group because she's
            so preoccupied with fitness, and Leslie's (Lili Taylor) disregard
            for men makes the other suspect she's a closeted lesbian. Jennifer's
            (Maggie Gyllenhaal) relationship with her husband is at a shaky
            point, Gayle (Mary Steenburgen) is a recovering alcoholic and Eileen
            (Susan Lynch) is an Irish lass who seems just a little too nice.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sayles keeps track of all the
            would-be mothers and keeps their personalities distinct. He also
            gives most of them enough shading to keep them from becoming
            stereotypes or ideological mouthpieces. Harden's Nan might have some
            irritatingly racist views, but Sayles later reveals that these
            aren't the worst of her problems. For a lifelong bachelor who's
            never had kids, it's remarkable that Sayles is able to tap into his
            protagonists' desires so convincingly.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">He also has a good eye for the
            region as well. It certainly doesn't hurt that he taught himself
            Spanish to write his novel <i>Los Guzanos</i>, and that he's filmed
            in Mexico before (<i>Men with Guns</i>). The local residents range
            from a wannabe revolutionary who, with some truth, claims the <b><i>gringas</i></b>
            are stealing his country's young to a maid who hopes that Eileen
            will become the mother of a child she's had to abandon.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sayles doesn't whitewash how
            difficult it is for children in these nations, but he's also quick
            to point out that some of the adoptees might be better off as
            urchins in the street (one shutters at the thought of Nan raising a
            kid).</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sayles' pacing drags at times, but
            he easily atones for it by penning some moving soliloquies and some
            choice zingers. When Leslie finds out her hosts are stuck with
            television offerings that are worse than in her native New York, she
            declares, &quot;Stupidity. It's the universal language.&quot;</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If <i>Casa de Los Babys</i> is a
            civics lesson, it's thankfully delivered by a teacher who’s far
            more insightful and witty than many of the ones I had in school.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"></o:p>
