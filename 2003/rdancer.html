			</blockquote>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">An old pickup 
			truck bumps along a dark road. In the cab, the radio plays a Nina 
			Simone performance, &quot;Who Knows Where the Time Goes?&quot; beginning with 
			her talky introduction. She's tried, she says, her weary voice 
			vacillating in the night wind, to &quot;give people what they wanted,&quot; 
			but this makes her exhausted; they &quot;use up everything.&quot; The truck 
			bumps some more, and when a roadside officer tries to flag it down, 
			it runs him down and speeds away, a telltale blood splat on the 
			bumper. One of the passengers grows impatient with Simone: &quot;Why does 
			she talk?&quot; The answer is mater of fact and not at all impatient: 
			&quot;She's preparing to sing.&quot;&nbsp; </font></span></p>
			<p><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The Dancer 
			Upstairs</font></span></i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
			is about preparation. More interested in the process leading to an 
			act than the act, it is smart, absorbing, and meticulous. And it is 
			never impatient. Based on Nicholas Shakespeare's 1995 novel of the 
			same name, it takes on the general shape of a political thriller, as 
			well as an investigation and romance. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Set in an 
			unnamed &quot;Latin American&quot; country on the verge of revolution or 
			collapse, it takes place sometime in &quot;the recent past,&quot; that is, 
			several years following the opening scene. The truck, it turns out, 
			was carrying the eventual leader of a terrorist group, a Maoist 
			professor called Ezequiel, as he's headed to his destiny. When the 
			film picks up again, the guerilla group (based on Peru's Shining 
			Path and its leader, Abimael Guzmán) is assassinating officials and 
			recruiting young children as suicide bombers. The people are 
			frightened, the police are stumped. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">One of the 
			investigators is Agustin Rejas (Javier Bardem). He's increasingly 
			uninterested in his bourgeois wife Sylvina (Alexandra Lencastre), 
			barely listening as she reads him her book club speech, but plainly 
			in love with his young daughter Laura (Marie-Anne Berganza). The 
			domestic scenes are small and telling: he does household chores, he 
			takes Laura to ballet class and cooks.&nbsp; Mostly, he works long hours 
			on the job, where he faces occasional and subtle racism (he's part 
			Indian, raised in the same village as some of Ezequiel's current 
			followers), as well as digs at his quiet demeanor and seeming 
			patience.</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">When his 
			captain, Merino (Oliver Cotton), challenges him to define his 
			position -- &quot;Do you have a feeling about [the case] or are you the 
			Gary Cooper type?&quot; -- Rejas resists such categories in themselves. 
			He can be silent and have feelings, self-possessed and passionate. 
			This rich combination of characteristics is most evident in his 
			evolving relationship with Yolanda (Laura Morante), Laura's 
			beautiful, vulnerable, mysteriously distressed ballet teacher.&nbsp;
			</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">As the 
			investigation and the mostly chaste romance become increasingly and 
			strangely entangled, the film allows for brief tangents that comment 
			on the central action and themes. It appears, for instance, that one 
			of the terrorists is a famous cover model, a plot point drawing 
			parallels between commercial mandates for beauty and political 
			managements of the population. Or again, Ezequiel's guerillas commit 
			one particularly brutal assassination by performing as a theatrical 
			group, slashing the targets' throats even as the victims believe, 
			briefly, that they're participating in some &quot;radical&quot; interplay of 
			audience and actors. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">As Rejas and 
			his team examine crime scenes, the connections between art and 
			politics -- as spectacles and as audience projections -- become 
			increasingly obvious, but also increasingly ambiguous. He observes, 
			&quot;It appears a revolution may be going on, but a revolution that has 
			yet to declare itself in that orientation.&quot; What such lack of 
			declaration might mean -- for the revolutionaries, for the 
			administration that is all too eager to call in the military and 
			crack down on all &quot;artistic&quot; activities, or for the good-hearted 
			detectives who want to keep (or invent) the peace between these 
			sides -- remains uncertain. Without a name, without a face to 
			identify and arrest, Ezequiel can function as an idea, filtering 
			through the citizenry that may or may not trust its government.
			</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Both Ezequiel's 
			group and the administration, ironically, invest in a paradoxical 
			faith -- in the power of seeing and remaining unseen (&quot;A thousand 
			eyes are on you,&quot; reads one spooky poster carried by a boy in the 
			darkened street). And so, the terrorists commit god-awful violence 
			against innocents as well as authorities, while the government 
			commits violence as well, in increments, in any number of classist 
			and racist oppressions. The official line is an effort to maintain 
			order. But the order benefits those already in power before anyone 
			else. </font></span></p>
			<p><i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The Dancer 
			Upstairs</font></span></i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">, 
			like its painstakingly self-reflective protagonist (flawlessly 
			portrayed by the amazing Bardem), refuses to pull its many threads 
			all together, to name its outcome or claim explicit triumph. Rejas 
			is instead haunted, by his past and his present, aware that he is 
			unable to save the world, except a little bit. Watching young 
			Laura's dainty ballet performance, his sad eyes reveal all and not 
			enough. He's still preparing, endlessly patient because he has to 
			be.</font></span></td>
