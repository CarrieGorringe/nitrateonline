            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../kj.html" target="_top">KJ Doughton</a>, 18 April 2003</i></font>
            <p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Perhaps <i>my</i> head was 
			buried in an isolated burrow when children first embraced Louis 
			Sachar’s best-selling book, &quot;Holes,&quot; in 1998. Five years later, 
			surrounded by anxious, pre-teen theater goers squirming restlessly 
			in their seats, I acknowledge the informed banter of children that 
			know far more about the story than I do.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I wonder when we’ll see Mr. Sir,&quot; 
			squealed a grade schooler from one row back. &quot;I hope they do a good 
			job with the yellow lizards,&quot; asserted another small fry scrunched 
			three seats down on my left. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Eavesdropping on such discussions, 
			an obsessive thought kept running through my mind. <i>Am I the only 
			one here not familiar with Sachar’s beloved tale of troubled kids 
			banished to a dusty work camp, where they dig blister-inducing holes 
			to &quot;build character?&quot; </i></font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">No matter. Early into its first 
			enchanting reel, Andrew Davis’ adaptation had already won over a 
			previously uninitiated sap like me. <i>Holes</i> is a spirited, 
			unique story of children uniting to overcome both persistent curses 
			of the past and troubling hardships of the present. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">All chaos breaks loose when a pair 
			of sneakers falls from the sky and into the world of Stanley Yelnats 
			(Shia LaBeouf). Before you can say Reebok, a patrol car screeches 
			forth and picks up Stanley, who is unjustly accused of stealing the 
			shoes. Meanwhile, we’re introduced to the youth’s sad-sack family, 
			including his father, a hard-luck inventor (played by Henry &quot;The 
			Fonz&quot; Winkler, going against the grain of his too-cool &quot;Happy Days&quot; 
			persona) whose quest for the ultimate shoe deodorizer is a dismal 
			stinker.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To pay penance for his alleged 
			crime, Stanley is shipped to Camp Green Lake, where a corrupt Warden 
			(Sigourney Weaver) and her redneck yes-man, Mr. Sir (Jon Voight, 
			whose leathery grimaces, and macho stances bring to mind a John 
			Wayne wannabe with serious insecurity issues), rule the roost.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With the unforgiving sun beating 
			down on them from dawn ‘til dusk, Stanley and a handful of other 
			teens don orange prison suits, brandish shovels, and stagger into 
			the lunar landscape of a Texas desert. Despite the camp’s name, 
			Green Lake has long since dried up, with the only liquid in sight 
			handed out in sparse supply by stingy Mr. Sir.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As he earns the respect of his 
			peers, Stanley teaches a quiet, curly-haired prisoner named Zero (Khleo 
			Thomas) how to read. Meanwhile, he suspects that the warden, a 
			temperamental witch who scratches her foes with poison-slathered 
			fingernails, has a hidden agenda behind the relentless digging.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After this original setup has been 
			established, director Andrew Davis strategically heaps on flashbacks 
			that connect Stanley’s distant family past to the present. A 
			hex-casting gypsy (Eartha Kitt), several dozen deadly yellow 
			lizards, two jars of severely outdated peaches, and a doomed love 
			affair between a schoolteacher (Patricia Arquette) and a handyman (Dule 
			Hill) are but a few of the links that provide Stanley’s salvation.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Holes</i> is one of the few 
			films in recent memory that serves up a juvenile hero who feels 
			real, decent, and genuinely likeable. LaBeouf plays Stanley as an 
			honest, unassuming fellow whose assertiveness blossoms before out 
			eyes. Even as he is bullied by the veteran tough kids and belittled 
			by the warden’s uncaring crew, Stanley always tries to do the right 
			thing. There’s no hip, callous cynicism anywhere in sight. 
			Hopefully, LaBeouf will continue to create root-worthy characters, 
			and not feel obligated to &quot;grow up&quot; by playing a psychopath, a 
			junkie, or a gigolo his next time out.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Out of the adult performances, Jon 
			Voight’s Mr. Sir is destined for the time capsule. Hunching forward 
			like a cowboy poised for a shootout, Voight’s crusty, weathered 
			overseer looks like some chronically constipated crab. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Adding a tasty dimension to <i>
			Holes</i>’ barren landscapes is a soundtrack of rock and country 
			folk by artists as diverse as Shaggy, Moby, the Eels, and Pepe 
			Deluxe. Whenever the digging becomes too redundant, and Davis’ film 
			threatens to evaporate under the oppressive heat, a soulful voice 
			breaks out of the mirage to liven things up. </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With <i>Holes</i>, Andrew Davis 
			resurrects his reputation as a top-notch craftsman of the cinema. 
			Having fashioned career-best projects for actions icons Chuck Norris 
			(<i>Code of Silence</i>), Steven Seagal (<i>Under Siege</i>), and 
			Harrison Ford (<i>The Fugitive</i>), the director has tackled 
			children’s fables and emerged with a picture as unique and appealing 
			as <i>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory</i>. He’s a filmmaker 
			who’s full of surprises.</font></td>
