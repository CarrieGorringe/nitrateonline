            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by <a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia
            Fuchs</a>, 12 September 2003</i></font>
            <p><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><font face="Verdana" size="5">Truly
            unbelievable <o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b>He
            glowers seductively, lingers in shadows, and clangs a little when he
            walks (this owing to the silver epaulets on his trousers). He's the
            legendary Guitar Fighter, returning once more to reap vengeance,
            save Mexico, and complete Robert Rodriguez's increasingly complex
            and well-financed Mariachi trilogy. If not exactly long-awaited, <i>Once
            Upon a Time in Mexico</i> arrives in theaters thanks in part to
            Quentin Tarantino: according to the film's own lore, Rodriguez was
            encouraged to this completion by his good friend, who likens the
            series to Sergio Leone's Man-With-No-Name Westerns. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            comparison may not be so farfetched as it sounds, even if it is
            premature. The Mariachi series begins with <i>El Mariachi</i> (1992,
            newly released in a handsome Special Edition DVD), which Rodriguez
            infamously made for just $7,000 (see his charming book on the
            subject, <i>Rebel Without a Crew: Or How a 23-Year-Old Filmmaker
            With $7,000 Became a Hollywood Player</i>), and which starred Carlos
            Gallardo. Wise beyond his years, the reluctant and shockingly
            super-skilled killer became a centerpiece for Rodriguez's only
            partly ironic homage to the construction of legends, cultures, and
            nations, a witty riff on how heroes accommodate their moments. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            next installment, 1995's <i>Desperado</i>, cost a lot more money to
            make, introduced Antonio Banderas as the charismatically gloomy hero
            (explained as the dead first version's vengeance-seeking brother),
            not so much providing a sequel as reprising the tale on a bigger,
            more colorful canvas. Reprising the role here, Banderas brings a
            combination of swaggery action and grim humor to the man called
            &quot;El (as in 'the').&quot; As in the first two films, <i>Once
            Upon a Time</i> begins with some storytelling, enhanced by the
            sweatily low-key stylings of Belini (Cheech Marin, who heard the
            story last time from Steve Buscemi) as much as by Rodriguez'
            spectacularly composed images (shot on agile high definition video).
            And in case there's any doubt, the film credits announce that <i>Once
            Upon a Time</i> is &quot;shot, chopped, and scored,&quot; as well as
            written and directed by the man himself; Mr. <i>Spy Kids</i> is
            showing off his accumulated knowledge of his business. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">As
            before, the storyteller speaks in a dimly lit, red-walled Mexican
            bar, for a skeptical listener, here CIA Agent Sands (Johnny Depp, in
            yet another weirdly nimble, exquisite performance -- even as a shady
            CIA guy who's trying to maneuver all ends against each other, he's
            utterly endearing). After hearing all about how the Mariachi won't
            tolerate roguish behavior, how he shot up a joint with implacable
            grace, and how he was perfectly matched with the stunning and lethal
            Carolina (Salma Hayek, who appears with precious little dialogue,
            only in flashbacks -- flawlessly lit and framed, of course). At the
            tale's end, Sands leans back and mutters in an odd little voice,
            &quot;Welllll, that is truly unbelievable,&quot; neatly articulating
            the movie's primary theme -- the interconnectedness between what is
            true and what is unbelievable. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Sands
            pays off Belini with a &quot;Clash of the Titans&quot; lunchbox full
            of money (in other words, not much), in exchange for info on where
            to find the Mariachi, whom he wants to hire, he says, to kill El's
            very own arch-enemy, the preternaturally vicious General Marquez
            (Gerardo Vigil), who happens to be responsible for Carolina's death
            (and yes, that episode appears in poetic, slow-motion flashback, in
            order to motivate his cataclysmic violence). Sands has his wheels in
            motion, and here's no stopping them or him: when he instructs Cucuy
            (Danny Trejo) to fetch the Mariachi and Cucuy hesitates, Sands
            gathers up his small frame and huffs a bit to look imposing:
            &quot;Are you a Mexican,&quot; he hisses, or a Mexi-cant!?&quot;
            With that kind of challenge, you know the mission will be
            accomplished.</span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            film is chucky full of motley stereotypical characters, some more
            interesting than others, all oversized in their ways: the drug
            kingpin Barillo (Willem Dafoe) is attended by the exiled-to-Mexico
            Billy (Mickey Rourke in still another offbeat cameo, wearing a
            scrunched-up cowboy hat much like the one he had in <i>Spun</i> and
            carrying a Chihuahua whose reaction shots are more emotive than
            almost anyone else in the film); the AFN agents, including Sands'
            cynical bedmate, Special Agent Ajedrez (Eva Mendes); the ineffectual
            Presidente (Pedro Armendáriz Jr.) and his by-definition disloyal
            lackey Omar (Rodolfo De Alexandre); and an ex-FBI agent, Jorge (Rubén
            Blades), languishing in Mexico after never capturing Barillo, who
            tortured his partner for two weeks, a fact with which Sands goads
            him out of retirement (&quot;Doesn't that tug on your old short
            curlies?&quot; he grins). To Sands, everyone is always just another
            piece on the CIA's giant chessboard. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            gorgeous Mariachi is surely the film's dynamic soul, as he endeavors
            to stay a step ahead of those who would exploit his pain and
            loyalties, alternately brooding, planning jobs with his homeboy
            mariachis and &quot;sons of Mexico&quot; (Lorenzo [Enrique Iglesias,
            who does fine] and Fideo [Marco Leonardi]), and leaping into action.
            Still, every time he turns around, there is the American who would
            ruin Mexico, double-crossing everyone and every ostensible ideal in
            sight: indeed, during one oddball scene, Sands pops up in El's
            church, playing father-confessor as Marlon Brando (his much-admired
            buddy from <i>Don Juan DeMarco</i> [1995]), as he half-whines,
            half-whispers, &quot;There's plenty of dough floating around,&quot;
            his version of enticement. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">As
            adroitly as it is delivered, it remains enticement that can't
            possibly work with this mark. But Sands is cocky, presuming he's in
            control until he learns that he can't possibly be, and even then he
            holds his own, transformed into a cunning mythic figure in his own
            right. Whenever the film feels like it has too much going on, which
            it does frequently, or, near its end, strains to tie its many plots
            together, Sands (and really, Depp) returns it to a semblance of
            coherence, as if by sheer will alone. &quot;Just walkin' my beat,
            friend,&quot; he reports into his cell phone during one of his many
            cell phone machinations, &quot;Mexico's my beat, and I'm walkin'
            it.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">This
            moment too makes thematic and political points, in ways that extend
            beyond the grand legend of the lonely Mariachi. Fighting to sustain
            his nation against the cartels, the U.S., and the persistently
            corrupt military, El and his many adversaries confront one another
            (or someone, somewhere) during a huge Day of the Day showdown. The
            elaborate skull costumes, floats, and puppets grant cover for the
            street battles, and it can be hard to know who's shooting whom, like
            in most any battle for a national and communal identity. Justly
            punished for his interference, arrogance, and insistent
            &quot;vision,&quot; Sands can no longer see what's going on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
