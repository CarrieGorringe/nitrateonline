            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><b>The
            <i>Terminator</i> franchise is a brawny business. With a legend
            built on a mysterious combination of Jim Cameron's vision and
            Arnold's body, the films have earned industry respect as well as
            raving acolytes. The design hasn't shape-shifted with each
            incarnation (like the remarkable <i>Alien</i> films). The <i>Terminator</i>
            movies repeat by definition -- they're all about time loops, after
            all. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Yet
            the series retains a combination of surprise and self-consciousness,
            owing in part to heady SF-ish conundrums (most famously, John Connor
            sends his comrade Reese [Michael Biehn] back in time to become his
            father), but also startling visual and conceptual innovations
            (Arnold as villain, Arnold as hero, Sarah Connor's biceps). This
            even though the basic <i>Terminator</i> tale is one of Cameron's
            favorites, in which a reluctant but sturdy girl is beset by fate and
            aided by a good-looking boy. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">All
            this means that Jonathan (<i>U-571</i>) Mostow's gutsy endeavor to
            crash the franchise, <i>T3: Rise of the Machines</i>, can't possibly
            meet expectations. And still, it comes hard. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">And
            it does okay. A noisier, burlier version of <i>T2</i>, overlaid with
            a soberer vision of the future, <i>T3</i> is compelling almost in
            spite of itself. Though officially distanced from Cameron (who's
            otherwise engaged these days), John Brancato and Michael Ferris'
            screenplay mostly amplifies what's been done already: more
            explosions, more car crashes, more burning and shredding of the now
            wholly outdated T-101 (Arnold Schwarzenegger, whose
            fifty-five-year-old body remains its own spectacular effect), and
            more penetrations of and by the slippery-silvery Terminator, here,
            the T-X (Kristanna Loken). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">During
            these elaborate, fast-cut stunts, <i>T3</i> is a noisy battering ram
            of a movie. But other moments reveal an unexpected range of tone,
            from cleverly affecting to darkly funny to downright apocalyptic.
            John Connor (Nick Stahl) is now a twenty-two-year-old loner,
            self-medicating (Budweiser and downers) when he's not zooming around
            on his motorcycle. In voiceover, he explains that he's trying to
            &quot;live off the grid&quot; (no phone, no address), so he can't be
            found. This even though he wants to believe that, ten years ago, he
            and his mom (Sarah/Linda Hamilton, now dead of leukemia and fondly
            remembered) stopped Skynet's annihilation of the planet, a.k.a.
            &quot;Judgment Day.&quot; Still, he's given to repeating his mom's
            mantra (actually, his own, passed on by Reese in 1984) that
            &quot;The future has not been written.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            poor kid is definitely his mother's son. His nightmare visions look
            a lot like hers, featuring the familiar metallic and red-eyed
            Terminators marching over human skulls, while also envisioning his
            eventual triumph. This time, that image has John standing on a pile
            of urban rubble, a tattered U.S. flag behind him. And then he wakes
            up, and his nation is as dirty and mean as ever, defined by its
            heedless nationalism, all-purpose capitalism, and rapacious
            military. So, while sober generals and eager techs wrestle with a
            global computer virus that apparently needs Skynet turned on to stop
            it (uh-oh), restive savior-to-be JC is on the run from monsters in
            his head. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">And
            so, <i>T3</i> follows its predecessors in using John to explore the
            tension between destiny and free will. The obligatory romance
            involves John's former high school classmate, Kate (Claire Danes).
            Presently a veterinarian (recall Sarah's affection for her iguana),
            Kate is not a little hesitant to be a next-generation &quot;mother
            of the future.&quot; She brings added consequence, in that her dad
            Robert (David Andrews) is the head supersecret weapons designer in
            charge of Skynet. Apparently, Miles Dyson (Joe Morton) died for
            nothing, but Robert suffers as well, condemned to utter the
            atrocious line: &quot;I've opened Pandora's Box!&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Kate's
            first moments on screen set her up for a bruising fall: shopping for
            her upcoming marriage to Scott (Mark Famiglietti), Kate's dad
            cancels a scheduled dinner. But even as Scott happily picks out
            china patterns, she's looking bored and fretful. Within minutes,
            he'll be splattered all over their bedroom, freeing Kate up to hook
            up with John (whom she remembers as a &quot;delinquent&quot;:
            &quot;Look at you, sitting there like the bad-boy thing still
            works!&quot;). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">As
            sweet and smart as Danes plays Kate, this sort of heartfelt
            relationship stuff is, as always, only a means to get to the
            machines. And if it's impossible to forget the particular evil
            connoted by Robert Patrick's ears, <i>T3</i>'s girl Terminator, clad
            in red leather, holds her own. Somewhere between thrilling and
            overkilling, the film deftly cuts between scenes showing her arrival
            and that of the T-101. The T-X first shows up inside a Beverly Hills
            boutique window, which means that she copies a mannequin's form --
            lithe with a perfectly glassy face. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Much
            updated, this model sticks her digital finger directly into a cell
            phone to locate targets (a long way from the T-101's use of a phone
            book or even the T-1000's cop-car interface), and includes a
            built-in DNA reader, initiated when she licks blood (nasty). She
            also slams into action with an unnerving iciness, and with precious
            little dialogue. Drawing from the feline movements of the T-1000,
            she's even more resilient; after the T-101 lists her many
            improvements, John observes, &quot;So, she's the anti-Terminator
            Terminator?&quot; 'Bout sums it up. Her only moments of nano-teched
            pleasure -- tight little half-smiles -- are visible when she's
            slamming the Terminator into buildings, roads, walls, cars, and,
            during one brutally lengthy throw-down, a series of urinals. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Indeed,
            the now woefully obsolete T-101 understands his own limits, as well
            as their context -- namely, the restrictions of human imagination.
            This might be the best way to describe the film's failings, its
            inability to break out of the framework laid out in Cameron's first
            and second versions of the loop. For all the dazzling effects and
            showy crash-and-burns (and every vehicle the T-X comes near explodes
            sooner or later), it's a family drama, with erring parents and
            rebellious kids. The survival of the species is backdrop.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">While
            the T-101 remains circumspect about the dire future awaiting John
            and Kate, he's determined to complete his mission, to protect them,
            to be the best, most committed, and most confounding daddy that
            either of them will ever have. (John repeats this observation for
            you, in case you've forgotten that Sarah said it last time out.)
            Making this machine the best dad (and another machine the absolutely
            worst mom, I suppose), <i>T3</i> follows through on <i>T2</i>'s
            schizzy take on human messiness and technical efficiency. Being as
            it's a sequel, and everything must be bigger, here the consequences
            for the conflict are worse, the machines' failings even more
            unavoidable. As decent and paternal as the T-101 wants to be, it's
            stuck. A machine, it can only do what it's programmed to do. You
            know, like a lot of dads. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">En
            route to his predictably sensational end, the machine is by turns
            witty masochist (when Kate shoots him in the face, he literally
            chews the bullet and admonishes her: &quot;Don't do dat&quot;) and
            blithely amoral sadist (as the couple to be reminisce, he notes,
            &quot;Your levity is good, it relieves tension and de fear of
            death&quot;). Even as it makes apposite use of Stan Winston's
            gory-face makeup and the still excellent evil-Terminator liquid
            metal effects (digital artists for the <i>X-Men</i> and <i>Hulk</i>
            series, take note), the film is still snarky. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">This
            is the detail that makes the series feel fresh despite its many
            repetitions. It has always had a clear sense of humor about the
            Terminator, an extreme incarnation of blockbuster violence if ever
            there was one. Mostow's film is rife with jokes, destructive and
            deconstructive. Of course, it refers to the first films' famous
            lines (&quot;She's back,&quot; &quot;Get in if you want to
            live&quot;), but it also makes shrewd comedy of the ever-refined
            Arnoldian Self. Schwarzenegger is especially good at this, sternly
            amiable about his iconic status (such self-deprecation will likely
            help in his political future), maintaining his straight face no
            matter how much goo and metal and fried skin it has hanging from it.
            <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            T-101 enters this film out in a tumbleweedy desert, with the usual
            electrical zapping and thunder cracking. Making his way to a
            honky-tonk bar (it worked so well in <i>T2</i>), he marches in stark
            naked, the Ladies' Night patrons giving the point of view camera the
            once-over as he scans the room for the appropriate costume. He
            zeroes in on the leather-clad gay dancer, demanding, &quot;Take off
            your clothes.&quot; Gyrating to &quot;Macho Man,&quot; the dancer
            hisses back, &quot;Talk to the hand!&quot; The Big T obliges,
            leaning into the guy's palm and growling, &quot;Now.&quot; And
            that's enough of that scene. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Cut
            to Arnold emerging from the bar, wearing the dancer's gear, complete
            with Bootsy Collins-style star-shaped sunglasses. As this moment
            suggests, the film loves itself too much. But it also understands
            why.<o:p>
