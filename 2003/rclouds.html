            Kaurismäki. Three exceptional Finnish exports of particular
            interest. Americans are most familiar with the first two. The third
            is an acquired taste -- a celebrated European filmmaker who most
            unaccustomed American audiences would undoubtedly, and
            unfortunately, find too brilliantly austere, darkly humorous, and
            almost tragically optimistic, for their action-packed desires and
            low-brow mentality. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Drifting
            Clouds (Kauas pilvet karkaavat)</i> was made several films before <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Man Without a Past</i>, Kaurismäki's most recent exploration of life's
            dispossessed denizens which was nominated for an Oscar as best
            foreign-language feature (losing to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Nowhere
            in Africa</i>), and is just now breaking into broader release in the
            United States. I first caught Kaurismäki's 1996 effort at that
            year's San Sebastian International Film Festival, where it was shown
            out of competition in the Zabaltegi (Open Zone) section. This was my
            initial dose of a director who has become one of Scandinavia's
            cinematic gods, with a fan base that continues to grown. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Drifting
            Clouds</i>, which unfortunately never found a U.S. distributor, has
            been retrieved from festival and museum obscurity (it premiered in
            this country as part of a salute to Finnish cinema at New York
            City's MoMA in April 1998) for a one-week Memorial Day week run at
            The American Film Institute's new Silver Spring (Maryland) triplex.
            The print may look a little battered and lacking an occasion English
            subtitle (causing some minor, brief confusion for the non-Finnish
            literate amongst us), but it's still a quirky, stylized production
            gracing, ever so briefly, the Washington, DC, area.<o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film, made at a time when the
            unemployment situation in Finland was excessively gloomy (the film
            suggests a 40% unemployment rate among restaurant workers), concerns
            the economic crunch felt by Ilona Koponen (<span style="color:black">Kati
            Outinen</span>) and her husband Lauri (<span style="color:black">Kari
            Väänänen)</span>, a couple who suffer double mid-life disasters
            when both loose their jobs and fall into a series of desperate, dour
            circumstances that include mental depression, widespread alcoholism
            among their fellow sufferers (an extended-family motif that
            buoyantly resurfaces in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Man
            Without a Past</i>, which stars Outinen and Markku Peltola, featured
            here as a knife-wielding cook), and weighty bouts of job-seeking
            degradation.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><span style="color:black"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kaurismäki
            tells his story through his now standard trademarks: a cast whose
            facial expressions border on stoneface -- seemingly devoid of any
            emotion (and dialogue) -- as deadpan as a convention of Buster
            Keaton impersonators, with his Spartan, bargain basement sets
            smothered in garishly painted and florescently lit colors,
            especially blue. This flavoring adds an oddly neo-realistic ironic
            tone to a film about such a difficult subject. Half comedy, half
            drama, half empty, half full. According to one interview with the
            director-writer, &quot;When I started writing the script for this
            film, I placed the task of Frank Capra's emotional rescue story <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">It's
            a Wonderful Life</i> in one extreme corner and Vittorio De Sica's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Bicycle
            Thief</i> in the other, and the Finnish reality in between.&quot;
            Yeah, I can see that, a wry, social commentary on the family of
            everyman.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            <o:p>

            <p><span style="color:black"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Another
            technique favored by Kaurismäki, and one that can be quite
            annoying, is his extensive use of reaction shots, at the expense of
            showing the actual action. We don't see the drunken cook stabbing
            the restaurant porter (where Ilona is headwaiter), or her slapping
            the cook to bring him back to his senses. Instead we hear the
            scuffle or the smack, and see the other actors' more important -- in
            Kaurismäki's eyes -- feedback.<o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color:black">There's
            also some weird stuff about eight or numbers ending with that digit.
            The Dubrovnik, the old-fashioned, near-comatose restaurant owned by
            Mrs. Sjöholm (Elina Salo) and overseen by </span>thirty-eight-year-old
            <span style="color:black">Ilona, has that number of employees before
            new owners end its thirty-eight-year subdued existence. It's also
            the total number of employees, before a pick-a-card consolidation
            halves it, of the town's tram service that forces Lauri from his
            seemingly stable occupation as a streetcar driver. When they both
            are forced onto the unemployment rolls, their frugally (by current
            American standards) overextended life brings repossession of those
            few things that adorn their apartment -- the new Sony Trinitron, the
            book shelves, and the purple couch.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><span style="color:black"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Eventually the sadness appears to
            lift, as Lauri is hired as a charter bus driver for trips to St.
            Petersburg, but the triumphant cigar smoke turns stale when he
            flunks his physical. Then Ilona withdraws her entire savings to
            secure a dead end job working in a dreary bar/diner as the sole, but
            not soulless, hostess/cook. &quot;It's a lousy hole,&quot; she
            reflects. Things turn darker when Forsström (Matti Onnismaa), her
            boss, absconds with the tax payments he should have been disbursing
            to the authorities.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Life drags along during most of the
            film's dire ninety-six minutes, buttressed by desperate dreams that
            bear down further on a family's financial straits. Thankfully, hope
            springs eternal as the dessert blooms and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Drifting
            Clouds</i> blossoms.</font></td>
