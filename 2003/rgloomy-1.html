            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>A half-century has lapsed since
            prominent German industrialist Hans-Eberhard Weick (Rolf Becker) has
            promised his wife a visit to Budapest, which holds some distant yet
            obviously memorable connection to his past. In celebrating his 80th
            birthday there at a luxuriously elegant restaurant, in the company
            of an ambassador and other friends, the stately gentleman recalls
            bygone days while dining on elegant china. He assuredly places a
            banknote in the pocket of an aging violinist and makes a request,
            &quot;Please play the song. You know, the famous one.&quot; Perhaps
            unfortunately, perhaps not, Hans's birthday celebration is cut short
            as the melancholy Hungarian &quot;suicide&quot; song (which bears
            the film's title and is best remembered in a 1941 Billie Holiday
            rendition) ends. Moments after he has focused on an old photograph
            atop the accompanist's piano, his half-smile turns shamefully
            downward, his body trembles and collapses to the floor, and he dies.
            The restaurant owner blames the song, a cursed piece written for
            love, for the woman in the photograph, sixty years earlier.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is definitely fate, but a
            totally different variety, that has caused Weick's demise. The core
            of the film hastens back to the late 1930s, and it is there where
            you'll have to amble through <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Gloomy Sunday</i>'s less than remarkable, albeit haunting, first half,
            commencing with Jewish restaurateur Laszlo Szabo (Joachim Król)
            opening a new, swank restaurant bearing his name. With the help of
            girlfriend/hostess Ilona Varnai (Erika Marozsán), they set out and
            quickly succeed in building up a stellar reputation among the
            well-to-do. While auditioning pianists, Ilona's eyes are drawn to
            Andras Aradi (Stefano Dionisi) and his sadly determined demeanor.
            Laszlo notices the intoxicating spell Ilona casts on men who cross
            her path (especially if she's wearing low-cut dresses), but is
            reluctantly game for the civilized <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Jules
            &amp; Jim</i> relationship that follows. The aforementioned
            blond-haired Wieck (now played by Ben Becker, Rolf's son) is a
            salesman visiting from Berlin so romantically overwrought when Ilona
            rejects his half-drunken marriage proposal that he becomes the first
            (attempted) suicide shortly after hearing <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Gloomy
            Sunday</i>, Andras' birthday gift to Ilona. The ever-optimistic
            Laszlo rescues Hans after a late night dive into the Danube.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ilona drifts between her lovers,
            happy one moment, unbearably forlorn the next. (These mood shifts
            reflect the film's problem balancing its various tones—romantic
            one minute, seriously dramatic the next, with occasional comic
            relief.) Lazslo, ever the businessman and consummate restaurateur,
            uneasily realizes that even having a part of her is better than
            none. They share love, life, and good food. Laszlo even manages to
            make a record deal for the pianist, while Weick writes from Berlin
            of the re-energized German economy as it &quot;expands&quot; its
            horizons. As any publicist can tell you, even bad news can be good
            news, and that is just the case as the song sparks worldwide
            suicides, making for grisly newsreel footage and booming business,
            for the restaurant and the musician. And it doesn't even have the
            lyrics written yet!<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Three years pass. Hans returns a
            Colonel in the SS, married, a father, and determined to advance the
            Nazi cause, yet also driven by a more sinister urge. Despite the
            dreary conditions and scarcity of food, the restaurant remains open
            and profitable. And Andras has composed his lyrics. But the trio's
            happiness ticks lower as World War II wrecks a deadly toll on them.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Thus starts the more enlightening
            final half of the film, which redeems itself with some harrowingly
            typical Nazi tit-for-tat, particularly the penchant of Weick for a
            local meat delicacy, a fetching woman, a poignant tune, and hardball
            tactics with members of the local Jewish community to steal their
            assets in exchange for freedom to Switzerland. Direct <span style="color:black">Rolf
            Schübel's film begins to entrance</span> when these four lives
            become part of a biographical sketch of the mournful ballad and a
            love-hate relationship that makes for a very unstable rectangle. The
            film's final 30 minutes create a dour mood for the three Hungarians,
            but swells up to a fitting bookend and zinger of a finish.<o:p>

            Sunday (Ein Lied von Leibe und Tod)</font></i><font face="Verdana" size="2">,
            a 1999 German feature that has won have a dozen awards, is now being
            released theatrically in the United States by Menemsha Films (three
            years after it was offered on a Region 2:Germany DVD), which has
            been distributing the German Jewish refugee documentary <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Shanghai Ghetto</i>. Originally to have been handled here by Arrow
            Releasing (which considered changing the title to <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Piano Player</i>), Menemsha picked up rights when a New Zealand
            distributor of the film mentioned it had been playing at the Arts
            Centre Cinema in Christchurch for more than two years. In the
            congested arthouse market it may have earnest intentions and curious
            grosses, but I fear it will have rough sledding -- Indeed, it
            disappeared after a brief week or two at Washington's Avalon
            Theater.<b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><o:p>
