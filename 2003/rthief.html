			The South of France has rarely looked so grim and inviting as it 
			does in Neil Jordan's new film, <i>The Good Thief</i>. As such, it 
			reflects the sorry state of Bob Montagnet (Nick Nolte), an American 
			expatriate, heroin addict, and sometime gambler who, as the film 
			opens, is feeling especially sad and wasted. But, just as he appears 
			to have given himself over to illusion and destitution, he's jolted 
			by the appearance of the stunning, seventeen-year-old Anne (Nutsa 
			Kukhianidze). </span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">A newcomer to 
			the Riviera, she's making her way on the street as a prostitute, 
			canny enough to know this isn't what she wants to do, but broke and 
			dazzled enough to think it's what she needs to do. She spots Bob 
			shooting up in the bathroom and judges, &quot;You're too old to do that.&quot; 
			He peers up through his bloodshot eyes, sees her black eye, and 
			decides not only that she's &quot;too young&quot; to be doing what she's 
			doing, but also that he will save her, thus giving himself a mission 
			and a route to some sort of movieish redemption. </span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">In order to 
			manage her rescue, Bob needs to clean himself up (this granting a 
			slightly less than conventional detox scene, where he's tied his bed 
			and providing a hallucinatory perspective on his room). He most 
			admires Picasso, he says, because that cat was &quot;the best thief who 
			ever lived.&quot; Bob, by contrast, is a &quot;good thief,&quot; in more ways than 
			one. When Anne offers him sex, thinking that his effort on her 
			behalf means he wants something specific in return, Bob, to his 
			credit (and the film's) says no thank you. His interests are more 
			complicated and more astute; and <i>The Good Thief</i> is less 
			concerned with standard caper movie dynamics (where the primary guy 
			gets with the girl), and more with a fanciful mosaic of illusion, 
			loyalty, and thievery. </span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Based on 
			Jean-Pierre Melville's <i>Bob Le Flambeur</i> (1955), Jordan's film 
			doubles all stakes of the original, and more elaborately, of the 
			remaking process (this includes the satisfyingly confusing 
			appearance of two guards, played by U.S. filmmakers Mark and Michael 
			Polish). As is usual in such reluctant hero setups (for example, <i>
			Casablanca</i> or, more recently, <i>The Transporter</i>), Bob's 
			loyalest supporter is a local cop, Roger (Tchéky Karyo), who 
			observes not only Bob's repeated bad choices, but also his 
			occasional moral merits. Though they respect one another, they also 
			realize (and more or less accept) that they'll never fully 
			understand one another. The puzzling is enough. </span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Mostly 
			eluding Roger's watchful eye, Bob puts together a crack team -- 
			including Raoul (Gérard Darmon), resourceful scammer Paulo (Saïd 
			Taghmaoui), and security systems expert Vladimir (Bosnian director 
			Emir Kusturica) -- in order to rob a casino, but not in any obvious 
			way; the intricacies of the plot, and the diverse crew might recall 
			the smug antics of, say, <i>Ocean's Eleven</i>, but Jordan's film is 
			less enamored of itself and more willing to take risks, with its 
			characters' faltering as well as their wholly entertaining cunning.
			</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Bob takes up 
			an elaborate scheme, which involves pretending to steal fake 
			paintings while really stealing real ones, all the while leaving 
			much of the scheme to luck, as a gambler must, of course. This 
			capacity for giving over control is what most endears Bob, to all 
			those who watch him -- Roger, Anne, his compatriots and his enemies, 
			and of course, the rest of us. The watching is made exceedingly 
			pleasurable by Chris Menges' brilliant cinematography, 
			simultaneously fresh, gritty, and resplendent, hardly an easy 
			combination. </span></p>
			<p><span style="font-size: 10pt; font-family: Verdana">Most 
			intriguing is the subtle relationship between Bob and Anne. For all 
			its many deceptions and illusions, <i>The Good Thief</i> allows this 
			to develop as if in a real world, where genuine affection and 
			appreciation grant generosity rather than competition or arrogance. 
			Bob sees in Anne a younger version of himself -- ambitious, vital, 
			thrilled by surfaces. This &quot;vision&quot; indicates Bob's self-knowledge, 
			his consciousness of own limits and considerable gifts. He can see 
			that, as seductive and glorious as the surfaces (art, casinos, 
			pretty little street scenes) may be, his salvation lies in himself, 
			in another form. And the film's smartest conceit, its most exciting 
			insight, lies exactly here -- that Bob and Anne can infatuate and 
			delight one another as self-aware self-reflections. </span></p>
