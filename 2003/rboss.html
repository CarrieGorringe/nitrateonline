            an idea, courtesy of Ben Affleck: high profile artists involved in
            waste-of-time movies should, on their releases, perform public acts
            of contrition. See how well it worked for Ben: even following the
            supposed strip club incident and the supposed wedding's supposed
            endangerment, he did the good-sport (and dedicated executive
            producer) thing, and went round to plug the new Project Greenlight
            film by making fun of <i>Gigli</i> and his recent overexposure. A
            clever gambit: even viewers who swore they couldn't take another
            half-second of Bennifer news found themselves hating him just a
            little less.<o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Call
            it inverse promotion. Rather than sending Ashton Kutcher round to
            the talk shows last week, before <i>My Boss's Daughter</i> hit
            theaters, send him out the week after it opens, so that he can admit
            to its terribleness, look cute and/or witty doing it, and salvage
            some of his dignity. (We'll stipulate that costar Tara Reid -- whose
            most recent projects were looking lost in <i>Van Wilder</i> and
            breaking poor Carson Daly's heart, at least according to his friends
            -- has none to salvage at this point.) <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kutcher
            might even manage this ploy. For one thing, he's quite boyishly
            charming and even articulate on the talk show couch, and seems able
            to talk around this movie as well as anyone who's had a lot more
            practice with such a maneuver. For another, he might not even
            remember <i>My Boss's Daughter</i>, which has been shelved for two
            years by someone looking out for him, whether intentionally or not
            (that he's listed as executive producer doesn't speak well of his
            choice in career-furthering projects). But now that Ashton's a hot
            ticket, what with the punk'ng and the Demi Dating, any impulse to
            look out for him is over. Bring on the vile humor and mindless
            embarrassment. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">To
            say that this film, written by David Dorfman (also responsible for
            the dismal comedy <i>Anger Management</i>), has a plot would
            overstate the case. It's more like a disjointed series of mishaps
            and gross-outs, <i>Jackass</i> piled on top of <i>Down To Me</i>.
            Kutcher plays Tom, repeatedly described as the &quot;nicest guy in
            the world,&quot; also known as the fellow everyone walks all over.
            Tom works at a publishing house run by the deeply tanned Jack
            (Terence Stamp), and has a crush on the boss's deeply tanned
            daughter Lisa (Reid). Tom is pasty white, which means nothing except
            that he looks like he's from a planet different from that inhabited
            by the rich folks. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still,
            Tom doesn't take much notice of the ostensible class distinction,
            mainly because he takes little notice of everything. He believes he
            can get a promotion to the creative department, and that he can win
            Lisa's heart, or whatever it is she has beating in her tanned chest,
            if only he can spend some quality time with her. He's so adorably
            clueless that when she asks him to housesit for her so she can go to
            a party with her beau Hans (Kenan Thompson), reportedly the type of
            fellow her dad prefers (business-minded, nerdy, and -- go figure --
            black), Tom believes she's asking him for a date. &quot;Oh thanks,
            I'll love you forever!&quot; she squeals as he grins, thinking he's
            scored.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hijinks
            begin in earnest once Jack leaves Tom in charge of his home and his
            owl (named O.J., not after the murderer, as Tom surmises, but the
            football player, as Jack insists). Tom proceeds to lose track of the
            bird, engage with assorted troublemakers, including Jack's estranged
            drug-dealing son Red (Andy Richter, wholly out of control in this
            universe) and his drug-dealing associate T.J. (Michael Madsen),
            Jack's just-fired secretary Audrey (Molly Shannon) and her
            beer-guzzling buddies, Speed (David Koechner), Darryl (Ron Selmour),
            and Tina (Carmen Electra, reprising her slo-mo wet t-shirt bit from <i>Scary
            Movie</i>). <o:p>

            </font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Tom's
            encounters with each of these morons seem geared to make him more
            sympathetic -- by the time T.J. decides to dominate the room by
            literally peeing all over it, and Tom, the film's bad behavior
            quotient is pretty much filled. Still, there's more: a male neighbor
            (Joseph Patrick Cranshaw) offers to sell Tom a piece of a white
            human ear in a baggie, insisting that it's Evander Holyfield's, and
            only &quot;changed color&quot; since it's been detached (suffice it
            to say that the movie's race politics are exceedingly strange); and
            a girl neighbor (Ever Carradine), spends some genuinely unpleasant
            screen time detailing for Tom her melancholy since her
            &quot;accident,&quot; all the while bouncing off walls and leaving
            globs of blood from her badly bandaged head wound on the furniture. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">You
            can say this for Tom: he's dogged, in all senses. Even as he fumbles
            his way through these sundry encounters, he keeps his eyes on the
            seeming prize, a few moments with Lisa. Just how he has come to this
            evaluation is unclear, as she only seems selfish and whiny whenever
            she's on screen -- particularly strange is her decision to treat him
            to a striptease and lap dance because she believes him to be
            &quot;gay.&quot; When he assures her that he's not, she's horrified
            and angry for about eighteen seconds, then declares he's okay even
            if he is straight. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            case might be made that Kutcher is here perfecting his anti-leading
            man status, that affable stoner sort he plays in <i>Dude, Where's My
            Car</i> and <i>That '70s Show</i>. He actually appears sharp in
            interviews; during his good-sport late night tour to pitch <i>My
            Boss's Daughter</i>, he's said precious little about the film,
            focusing instead on how terrific it is to be him these days, that
            is, two years after he finished making it. Avoidance isn't a bad
            strategy, but it's not so striking as Ben's mea culpa approach.<o:p>
