			<a href="../kj.html" target="_top">KJ Doughton</a>, 
			14 February 2003</i></font><p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meet 
			Charles Kaufman (Nicholas Cage), whose picture might appear next to
			<i>Insecure</i> in the Webster’s New World Dictionary.&nbsp; He’s a 
			middle-aged, balding scruff who fixates on the fact that he’s a 
			middle-aged, balding scruff.&nbsp; He can’t sleep at night.&nbsp; Sweating 
			profusely, then working himself into a hysterical lather when 
			excited, Charles is shy and awkward around the agents and executives 
			he must interact with at power lunches and snooty parties.&nbsp; How does 
			Charles make a living? Why, he’s a Hollywood screenwriter, of 
			course.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Charles is the hero of <i>
			Adaptation</i>, a fictional film, but he’s also a very <i>real </i>
			Tinseltown talent.&nbsp; He penned the script for 1999’s quirky <i>Being 
			John Malkovich</i>, and he’s written this equally daring story. For
			<i>Adaptation</i>, however, the penmeister has written <i>himself</i> 
			into the mix. Basically, Charles has scribed a screenplay about the 
			genuinely real accomplishments that he’s already chalked up (the <i>
			Malkovich</i> film is referred to several times), with some inspired 
			chunks of completely make-believe storytelling stirred in to flavor 
			the potion.&nbsp; </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Still with me?&nbsp; Did I mention that 
			the “real” Charles has also fabricated a twin brother named Donald 
			for his film, who lives with him and idolizes the neurotic genius?&nbsp; 
			Or that <i>Adaptation</i> uses fast-frame scenes like those old 
			high-school science movies that showed seeds sprouting from the 
			earth and blooming into majestic flowers? Or that it jumps 
			frantically back and forth through time, from the very Dawn of 
			Existence to Charles’ contemporary struggle with writer’s block, as 
			he attempts a screenplay based on the surreal adventures of an 
			earthy, swamp-inhabiting orchid thief?</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Involving the discovery of a portal 
			into the famous actor’s pulsating gray matter, the fresh energy of
			<i>Being John Malkovich</i> was praised by most critics. However, a 
			disgruntled minority perceived the movie as too eccentric for its 
			own good. With a go-for-broke, anything goes aesthetic, that flings 
			you onto the desk of Charles Darwin one minute, then into the 
			gator-infested swamps of Florida the next, <i>Adaptation</i> will no 
			doubt alienate similar viewers that resist its formula-smashing 
			approach.&nbsp; However, those who succumb to its distinctive mania will 
			relish Kaufmann’s hailstorm of ideas, which rains down like candy 
			spraying from an exploding piñata.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Adaptation</i> begins with 
			Charles tackling a film script based on <i>The Orchid Thief</i>.&nbsp; 
			Chronicling the adventures of John Laroche (Chris Cooper), a savvy 
			swamp rat who harvests endangered plants from a Florida game 
			preserve for dubious purposes, the book is written by an unhappy New 
			York author named Susan Orlean (Meryl Streep).&nbsp; Even though Laroche 
			is a toothless, mullet-sporting recluse who peddles pornography over 
			the Internet and fails to prioritize personal hygiene, Orlean is 
			envious of the shabby botanist’s passionate pursuit of his flowering 
			quarry.&nbsp; “I wanted to want something as much as people want these 
			plants,” explains Orlean, revealing why she was drawn to his story.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">After boarding a plane bound for 
			Florida to interview Laroche for the book, Orlean finds herself 
			enchanted with his renegade approach to life.&nbsp; During one of many 
			fascinating conversations between the unlikely pair, Laroche reveals 
			that orchids have not been his only interest in life.&nbsp; He used to 
			fixate on a collection of tropical fish, Laroche explains, and 
			filled his home with tanks and aquariums teeming with finny 
			inhabitants.&nbsp; “Then,” he explains matter-of-factly, “I renounced 
			fishing. I’ve never stuck a toe in the ocean since. I was done with 
			fish.”</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Living her life as one who thinks 
			such abrupt change – or adaptation – is a shameful process, “like 
			running away,” the author is fascinated by her subject’s ability to 
			drop one frenzied pursuit and take up another in the blink of an 
			eye.&nbsp; Despite his rough edges, she has become smitten with the man. 
			“His finishes were absolute,” Orlean admiringly observes of Laroche. 
			“He just moved on.”&nbsp; </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Adaptation</i> jumps rails 
			several times, focusing on the developing relationship between 
			Laroche and Orlean then zeroing in on Charles’ frustrating attempts 
			to adapt their story to the screen.&nbsp; Playing both Charles and 
			Donald, Nicholas Cage does a brilliant job of conveying the twins’ 
			clashing personalities – even though they appear identical, there’s 
			never a question of which one is which.&nbsp; We feel for the twitchy, 
			fearful Charles as he conjures forth every ounce of his courage to 
			ask out a perky waitress – only to be ridiculed as an inappropriate 
			geek.&nbsp; Meanwhile we observe the uninhibited ease with which Donald 
			picks up a cute makeup girl on a movie set, and grudgingly marvel at 
			the sibling’s casual way with others.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Kaufman’s insightful script also 
			characterizes the differences between these two brothers by 
			contrasting their approaches to screenwriting.&nbsp; Charles is an 
			elitist snob always striving to push the envelope of originality, 
			while wannabe Donald, inspired by his brother’s talent at the 
			typewriter, assembles a sensationalized serial killer script and 
			attends screenwriter’s conferences.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ultimately, the siblings team up to 
			finish Charles’ script, finding themselves caught up in considerable 
			intrigue along the way.&nbsp; After the rich tapestry of interwoven 
			characters that has come before, Kaufman’s script ties up its loose 
			ends in a more conventional third act. The lives of Charles and 
			Donald eventually become tangled up in those of Laroche and Orlean, 
			but <i>Adaptation</i> is most interesting and alive as the 
			screenwriters study their subjects from afar.&nbsp; As Orlean laments her 
			upper-crust existence with a boring husband, yearning for Laroche’s 
			focus and enthusiasm, Charles harbors romantic longings for the 
			author while reading her inspired book.&nbsp; When all these characters 
			finally come together, their union takes the fizz out of <i>
			Adaptation</i>’s central theme of unrequited longing.&nbsp; </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Adaptation</i> rolls out an 
			impressive carpet of supporting characters as it juggles these 
			central stories.&nbsp; Brian Cox, so convincing as a macho pederast in 
			2001’s <i>L.I.E.</i>, shines as a facilitator of screenwriting 
			workshops (“God help you if you ever use voice-overs in your 
			script,” he screams at students from a podium, before one of <i>Cage</i>’s 
			voice-overs chimes in to hilarious effect).&nbsp; Tilda Swinton lights up 
			her few scenes as a poised Hollywood bigwig, while Katherine Keener 
			and John Malkovich also tag along for <i>Adaptation</i>’s wild ride.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Although his vision sputters a bit 
			towards the end, <i>Adaptation</i> confirms that Kaufman is one of 
			Hollywood’s few screenwriters that isn’t afraid to think on his own 
			terms. His ideas don’t seem manufactured and phony. Rather, they 
			fire like the frantic synapses of an unmedicated manic-depressive, 
			bursting at the seams with fragments of genius, but not sure how to 
			organize each inspired bit of insight.&nbsp; </font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The movie’s primary concept, voiced 
			by a key character early on, is that “passion whittles the world 
			down to a more manageable size.”&nbsp; It’s an inspired thought, and one 
			that could have been applied to <i>Adaptation</i>.&nbsp; By focusing on 
			fewer ideas, and resisting the urge to bit off more than he can 
			chew, perhaps Kaufman can shape his next vision into a more focused 
			work.&nbsp; In the meantime, let’s rejoice that he’s here.</font></td>
