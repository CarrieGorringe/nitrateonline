            Mr. Anderson?&quot; asks Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), for what seems
            the umpteenth time. &quot;Why get up?&quot; Why, indeed? Repeatedly
            battered and penetrated and tossed about, Neo (Keanu Reeves) always
            gets up. And his tenacity -- so coolly trenchcoated and
            martial-artsed -- surely frustrates the self-multiplying program
            Smith. And now, in <i>Matrix Revolutions</i>, which the Wachowski
            brothers promise is the last movie (if not the last video game or
            dvd-full-of-extras), you're reminded just why he does get up, time
            after time. He does it, says the messiah, because it's his choice. <o:p>

            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ah
            yes. Choice -- whether a function of illusion, faith, or actual free
            will -- is the philosophical maguffin that runs throughout the
            franchise. You choose to purchase the Matrix continuing spew of
            merchandise, just as you choose to appreciate <i>Revolutions</i>'
            effects in lieu of character development or novelty. And you choose
            to recall, no doubt, that the previous half-film, <i>Reloaded</i>,
            left loose ends that the current film is supposed to resolve. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">That
            irresolution took a particular form -- Neo's human body on a gurney,
            his other self shot out into a limbo space somewhere between the
            slickster haven Matrix and the sweaty-body-filled Zion. This
            installment begins by visualizing that limbo as a white-on-white
            subway station, titled &quot;Mobil Ave.&quot; Discovered by a family
            of programs headed by Rama (Bernard White), who last time out sold
            the Oracle's termination codes to the French-accented Merovingian
            (Lambert Wilson), in order to save his endearingly optimistic
            program-daughter, Sati (Tanveer Atwal). The way out involves a
            train, run by the Trainman (still sprightly and bad-toothed Bruce
            Spence, looking much as he did in the <i>Road Warrior</i> films, and
            as good as reason as any to sit through <i>Revolutions</i>, even if
            he's only on screen for about five minutes total). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">All
            this is to say that <i>Revolutions</i> is not efficient and
            surprising like <i>The Matrix</i>, but rather clunky and convoluted
            like <i>Reloaded</i>. The uncleverly circular plot -- reportedly
            informed by ETM (the <i>Enter the Matrix</i> game) plot turns and
            speeches -- takes Neo, Trinity (Carrie-Anne Moss), and Morpheus
            (Laurence Fishburne) through the same motions as before. They visit
            the Merovingian's writhing-punks-in-Hel Club, providing one more
            glimpse of Persephone's (Monica Bellucci) stunning breasts; Zion's
            Council (again featuring Anthony Zerbe, Cornell West, and Harry
            Lennix's clench-jawed Commander Lock); and, with the help of
            enigmatic Seraph (Collin Chou), the Oracle's kitchen (where she's
            baking cookies as well as smoking a few more cigarettes). Only now
            the Oracle is transformed from Gloria Foster, who died during
            production, to Mary Alice, whose gracious performance is much
            welcome, especially alongside her costars' general woodenness. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Their
            dispassion might seem apt, given <i>Revolutions</i>' incessant
            repetition of ideas and dialogue: &quot;I see you're filled with
            doubt,&quot; she observes of Morpheus, &quot;clouded with
            uncertainty,&quot; just before she tells him that he needs to make
            up his own damn mind, that is, he needs to make a choice. The
            question, as always, is whether that choice is his, or whether all
            he thinks or does is the effect of a greater system. That Morpheus
            is the most fervent Neo-disciple (Lock accuses him of believing in
            &quot;miracles&quot;), following wherever he's led, doing whatever
            he's bid.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">While
            Morpheus' earnest piety invites jokes (the Merovingian remains the
            most entertaining program, delighting in his adversary's impulse to
            &quot;get straight to business&quot;), he's almost balanced by
            sinewy Niobe (Jada Pinkett Smith), who finally shows up some 45
            minutes into the action. Angry and skeptical, she trusts in her own
            skills above all, and, as most everyone tells her, she's a
            &quot;hell of a pilot.&quot; &quot;Come on, keep up!&quot; Niobe
            yells at Morpheus. &quot;I'm trying,&quot; he wails. She steers her
            ship back to Zion through the impossible to navigate
            &quot;mechanical line&quot; just in time to restart yet another
            battle of the titan machines. The film includes frequent and ongoing
            videogamey battles, all loud and fiery, mostly boring, the
            almost-climactic one taking up many many minutes, a super-duper
            display of CGI extravagance with precious little interest in
            character. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Pinkett
            Smith's Luke Skywalkery performance thus serves two purposes,
            neither especially helpful for the film per se: her Niobe is so
            gritty that other characters pale by comparison, and Niobe's ascent
            to piloting greatness underlines how much <i>Revolutions</i> borrows
            from previous (and upcoming) like-minded sagas, where the right
            choice is the only choice and vice versa. No one is going to turn
            and run in such a-hero-is-called flicks. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            fact that she is Jada and not feather-haired Mark Hamill rehearses
            the <i>Matrix</i> industry's most progressive sociopolitical agenda,
            namely, Zion's primary actors are of color, save for Trinity and
            sometimes Neo, when viewers forget Keanu's race-mix. The third film
            has it a few ways, granting sober Captain Mifune (Nathaniel Lees),
            buzzcut Charra (Rachel Blackman), and relentless Zee (Nona Gaye)
            some brief superhuman moments during the assault on Zion, then
            granting next-generation status to &quot;The Kid&quot; (Clayton
            Watson), as banal and white-boyish as can be. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Surely,
            the series has worked hard to rethink racism and race relations,
            within and without a slavery framework. Here, the most remarkable
            moment comes when Smith visits Oracle, accompanied by several of his
            multiple other/same selves. When he begins running on about what she
            knows and doesn't know, whether his violence is preordained or his
            own choice, she smokes, quietly. &quot;You are a bastard,&quot; she
            says. Comes the retort: &quot;You would know, mom.&quot; It's the
            nastiest, most unresolved bit of dialogue in the film. And that's
            it. From there, he's off to fight with his &quot;opposite&quot; Neo,
            and she's left to think up more ways to upset the
            &quot;balance&quot; that her &quot;opposite,&quot; the Architect
            (Helmut Bakaitis), endeavors to maintain. Just how this is a choice
            is hard to say. <o:p>
