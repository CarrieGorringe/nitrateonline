            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In <i>Elf</i>, Will Ferrell is
            cast in the role he was born to play -- that of Buddy, who, as a
            baby, toddled into Santa's toy bag one Christmas Eve and ended up at
            the North Pole, where he was raised by the toymaking elves (played
            by, fortunately, adult actors who have been size-reduced by visual
            FX). As an adult, Buddy does not entirely fit in with the elf
            community, so he is told where he can find his human father -- a
            book editor who, worst of all, is listed on the official North Pole
            books under the &quot;Naughty&quot; list. To Buddy, this is
            disparaging, to say the least.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The father, Walter Hobbs (James
            Caan, who sometimes has the long-suffering look of W.C. Fields
            contending with a family problem), who already has a wife (Mary
            Steenburgen, still lookin' gorgeous) and young son (Daniel Tay),
            edits children's books and doesn't want to be bothered with fixing a
            shipment that has left two pages of a story out. He also works in
            New York City across the street from Gimbel's, which works out
            because, not knowing what to make of him, Walter has Buddy thrown
            out onto the street and Buddy ends up working for a mite in Gimbel's
            Santa Claus display, where he meets Jovie (Zooey Deschanel) -- she's
            not too sure what to make of him, either. But her guardedness makes
            a perfect compliment with his ingenuousness.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When Ferrell appeared in <i>Old
            School</i>, David Denby wrote that he had a &quot;frighteningly
            infantile&quot; quality -- a quality of nature that seems untouched
            and unaffected by adulthood. This is exactly the type of thing
            needed to make the character of Buddy work, and Ferrell plays him
            with both good comic sense and absolute earnestness -- Buddy never
            becomes cutesy, or overweening, or a character that the film
            condescends to. The picture never uses Buddy's naivete to make crude
            or cheap jokes at his expense. (About the worst thing Buddy does is
            let out a well-orchestrated belch after downing a liter of cola.)
            Buddy's cheerfulness, his industriousness, always telling the truth,
            and never doing anything unkind (Tennessee Williams said that the
            worst sin of all was the intentional infliction of cruelty), comes
            across as believable and winning, and Ferrell, in a display of great
            comedic and character acumen, gives a remarkably well-calibrated
            performance in the part (especially since he spends almost the
            entire movie wearing a green coat, yellow tights, pointy shoes and a
            pointy hat -- including the scenes filmed in downtown New York).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Buddy's reason for being is to be
            upbeat and pure, and the message of the film is -- well, if they had
            one to begin with, it doesn't turn up at the end. The film, which
            Jon Favreau (who wrote and acted in <i>Swingers</i> a while back)
            directed from an original screenplay by David Berenbaum, comes apart
            badly in its final act and winds up in a trammeled-up ending that's
            like a car pileup -- Buddy's human dad has second thoughts about
            rejecting him, Santa's sleigh needs an emergency fix, there's a
            parody of T.V. on-the-spot news coverage, a Christmas song
            singalong, an attempt to resolve the plot thread involving Buddy and
            Jovie, and some mounted policemen who look like they just galloped
            out of the last <i>Lord of the Rings</i> installment. The picture,
            consciously, evokes and borrows elements from other Christmas flicks
            like <i>Miracle on 34th Street</i> and <i>It's a Wonderful Life</i>
            (there might even be something from Terence Young's <i>The Christmas
            Tree</i> in there if you look hard enough), and there is brilliant
            rendition of the North Pole scenes as something out of a Rankin-Bass
            holiday special, replete with a Burl Ives-like snowman. Playing the
            bachelor elf who was placed in charge of raising the infant Buddy,
            Bob Newhart brings his unflappable, pleasantly nattering persona to
            the part, and turns out to be unexpectedly delightful (you wish
            there were a bit more of him in the film than there is).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The picture is first and foremost
            an entertainment, and while the film is considerably flawed
            (although I can't get mad at any picture that has the good sense to
            use Ella Fitzgerald's recording of <i>Winter Wonderland</i>),
            Ferrell's performance is enjoyable to watch. If he doesn't squander
            his time in too many inferior films -- something that happened to
            some very fine and talented comedians back in the Eighties -- he
            might end up giving us some great screen work.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"></o:p>
