            a title like <i>Wrong Turn</i>, there's not really a right way for
            this slasher joint to go. And yet it persists, sending lithe young
            beauties to their gory fates, pretending as though there might be a
            surprise around the next corner, an event that might not be fully
            anticipated from every last soul in the audience. To be fair,
            slasher films don't typically attract viewers looking to be
            surprised. Consumers come with expectations -- bad behavior, bared
            bodies, buckets of blood -- and the more tortured the bodies and
            more ghoulish the kills, the more inventive the film. Or so it
            seems. <o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
            Rob Schmidt's movie, though, the formula is looking especially
            creaky. The turn in question occurs on a dirt road, late in the day,
            far from a phone or cell service, in the mountains of West Virginia
            (whose Tourism Board should be up in arms over this rendering).
            Chris Finn (Desmond Harrington) first appears barreling along in his
            battered Mustang. A med-school graduate (a personal note he lets
            drop at an appropriate moment), he's trying to make an interview
            that is, predictably, a long ways away. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Lost
            and distracted (he's playing a loud rock CD and so, woe unto him),
            Chris slams his car into the back of a car stopped in the middle of
            this particular dirt road. Seems this car has hit some razor wire,
            carefully string across the thoroughfare. Now, neither vehicle is
            usable. Now, Chris and the kids in the car -- perky Carly
            (Emmanuelle Chriqui) and her Xander-ish fiancé Scott (Jeremy
            Sisto), slightly wild Franny (Lindy Booth) and her pot-smoking pal
            Evan (Kevin Zegers), and, tough chick Jessie (Eliza Dushku, a.k.a.
            Faith) -- must set off on foot in search of assistance. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Little
            do they know what you know, from the film's opening scene, that just
            a short time before, two prettily anonymous rock climbers have been
            grabbed up and savaged by a raucous unseen force. This scene is
            mightily unsettling in the way that such scenes are in such films.
            That is, it establishes that there are monsters in them hills, and
            no one who looks good in a spandex shorts and a sports bra should be
            headed that way. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            unseen force soon makes itself seen, in a squad of gnarly, growly, <i>Deliverance</i>-inspired,
            Stan Winston-designed inbreds, thusly named in the credits:
            Three-Finger (Julian Richings), Saw-Tooth (Garry Robbins), and
            One-Eye (Ted Clark). This cheery threesome look the mutant products
            of variously recombinant genetic pools: Leatherface meets <i>The
            X-Files</i>' Peacock brothers meets <i>The Hills Have Eyes'</i>
            Jupiter meets Troma's toxic-wasted critters. They bark and howl,
            they carry torches at night and prefer their meat raw. In a word,
            these fellows are nasty. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Chris
            and company get this clue eventually, though first they have to
            split up and wander through the backwoods some, kissing, dawdling,
            and scaring each other in fun, all so you can squirm in your seat --
            though hardly on the edge of it -- as you await the inevitable. And
            so: little Franny and Evan stay behind with the cars, smoke a little
            dope, then find themselves thrashed into pieces. Guess what happens
            when he wanders into the woods to pee and she follows him in,
            trilling, &quot;Evan!?&quot; Evan?&quot; The camera takes its
            requisite position near her quivery face or just behind her, so you
            keep expecting the monster to pop up and git her, and, by gum, it
            does. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Once
            these two deadmeat characters are dispatched, the gore begins in
            earnest, when the other four come upon a tin-roofed shack where they
            think -- for no discernable reason -- they'll find a phone inside.
            This is the Terrible Place that shows up in so many slasher films,
            and the spooky images (and occasional joke) are drawn from cleverer
            precursors like <i>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i>, as they traipse
            through the Terrible Place, coming across music boxes, jars of body
            parts and teeth, doll heads, and oh yes, razor wire. Gee, you think
            it might be time to get the heck out of there, but no, these kids
            have to wait until those dang inbreds come careening down the rocky
            driveway, towing the kids' car and hauling Franny's carcass like
            venison. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Eek.
            Now the kiddies have to hide under beds and in closets while the
            cretins hack away at Franny's leg and shuffle about with their large
            weapons exposed, until at last the kids can sneak out and make a run
            for it when they're spotted. Yee-ha. The inbreds like to whoop and
            holler as they chase their prey, a sound that echoes through the
            night -- because day does turn into night, of course -- so maybe
            you're feeling unnerved or discomfited, but more likely, you're
            feeling restless, like, get on with it already. The kids steal the
            brutes' pickup truck. The mutants come a-whooping with bows and
            arrows. One of the group's noble self-sacrifice leads to terrible
            loss of innocence. These chase-in-the-woods scenes are roaringly
            annoying: too incoherent to build tension and too gruesome to
            forget. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Cue
            Carly's whimpering: &quot;I can't! I can't!&quot; Girl, I know how
            you feel. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            if scaredy girl loses control (&quot;They're coming to get you,
            Barbara!&quot;) Faith holds her own. (On this point, Dusku opines,
            &quot;If you're going to say I'm being typecast as a woman who only
            plays strong roles, I can think of many other things it would be
            worse to be typecast as. I don't have a problem with it.&quot;)
            Jessie is a balls-out fighter, game even when she's got to jump out
            of a flaming watchtower, or gets dragged, smacked, tied to a bed,
            and threatened with a blade to the throat. She and Chris fight back
            with some ingenuity, at one point clambering around on tree limbs in
            order to get one of the killers (Three-Finger? could be) in position
            to whomp him off with a let-er-rip branch (it's weirdly reminiscent
            of the fabled bamboo scene in <i>Crouching Tiger</i>, this
            clambering, but with axes and grunts and not a whiff of poetry). The
            maneuver enrages the remaining brothers, or boyfriends, or fathers,
            whoever they are, and so the rest of the violence is even more
            brutal than what's come before. It appears that even cretins have a
            vengeance gene. </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><o:p>
