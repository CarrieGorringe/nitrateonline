            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by <a href="../cynthia.html" target="_top">Cynthia
            Fuchs</a>, 7 February 2003</i></font>
            <p>

			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700">
			<font size="2">Eva (Gabrielle Union) first appears in <i>Deliver Us 
			From Eva</i> looking fierce. The camera pans across faces in a 
			church pew, folks attending a funeral, and then pauses on hers: 
			forbidding and focused. At this moment, narrator Ray (LL Cool J) 
			explains who she is: the woman who caused his death. </font></span>
			</p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Before you get 
			to feeling too sorry for poor LL, consider that this is the first 
			scene in a romantic comedy co-written and directed by Gary Hardwick 
			(the man who made <i>The Brothers</i>). This means that the rumor of 
			Ray's death will be exaggerated, and that this fierce and 
			intimidating girl will be tamed (as in &quot;shrew&quot;). <i>Deliver Us From 
			Eva</i>, in other words, is predictable in the way that, say, <i>How 
			to Lose a Guy in 10 Days</i>, also opening this weekend, is 
			predictable. The journey to hetero-coupledom will be slightly rocky, 
			but it will be completed; the coupled members will feel better for 
			it and so will you. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">This journey 
			begins with an introduction to Eva Dandridge. Beautiful, demanding, 
			and self-confident, she inspires women (in particular, her three 
			sisters) and terrifies men. Apparently, she's so intimidating that 
			the three men involved with the Dandridge sisters -- Kareenah 
			(Essence Atkins), Bethany (Robinne Lee), and Jacqui (Meagan Good) -- 
			decide they must resort to extreme measures to contain her. </font>
			</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Eva has her 
			reasons, initially hinted at, then recalled at film's end as a kind 
			of she's-not-so-bad-after-all rationale for her dominance. Following 
			a car accident that killed their parents, eighteen-year-old Eva 
			looked after her three younger sisters: this made her hard-eyed, 
			ball-busting, and practical-minded; it also added to what appears to 
			be an already very low tolerance for error or fooling around. After 
			completing school and some waitressing gigs, she found her calling: 
			health inspector. Principled. Uncompromising. Scary. When Eva walks 
			into a kitchen and snaps on her white rubber gloves, everyone 
			quakes. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Such diligence 
			and dedication would be fine except that Eva's tendency to dictate 
			doesn't stop there. The sisters' men -- Mike (Duane Martin), Tim 
			(Mel Jackson), and Darrell (Dartanyan Edmonds) -- are watching the 
			NFL playoffs on a big screen TV. Oh no, it's Book Club Night, and 
			the girls have raw vegetables and need to talk about <i>Beloved</i>. 
			And after discussing the book, Eva informs the men, they need to 
			watch the video. So the men, for all their feeble protesting and 
			even one attempt to put a foot down, are sent off to the nearest bar 
			with a big screen, where they're too short to get a good view of the 
			game. Truly, a bad situation. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">After much 
			agonizing over the ways she takes up her sisters' time and energy, 
			instructs them in their romantic affairs, and passes judgments on 
			their men, said men decide to call in a big gun: Ray. A 
			much-experienced and much-respected player who fully believes in the 
			lothario's credo (&quot;Players first, women second&quot;), he's also broke 
			enough that he's willing to date Eva for money (this owing not to 
			his lack of ambition or talent, but to the fact that he never wants 
			to stay with any job for more than a year: something to do with 
			spreading his love). </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">When the guys 
			approach Ray, he's wary. They whip out a photo, Eva glowering: 
			&quot;She's cute,&quot; he offers, &quot;But why's she scowling?&quot; That, says Mike, 
			is her &quot;sexy smirk.&quot; Oh no doubt, they all agree, this girl is 
			something else. Ray only takes the deal when, during one of his 
			temporary jobs -- delivering meat -- he spots her on the job. This 
			scene stages the film's general dynamic, that is, Ray watches Eva 
			through stacks of meat and carts, and she performs. Her routine is 
			dramatic, the restaurant owner begs for a little leeway. No way. 
			&quot;Mama says,&quot; she bellows at the end of her tirade, &quot;Clean it up!&quot; 
			Ray smiles, hidden behind the meat. He's in. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">In these 
			she's-such-a-bitch scenes -- which include a flashback to a former 
			boyfriend-wannabe in total meltdown -- Gabrielle Union reveals a 
			completely wonderful comic timing, delivering lengthy putdown 
			barrages with deadly aim. And she's fearless in her 
			self-presentation: when she leads the church choir, she gyrates and 
			grimaces with a winning aplomb. Luckily, Union's jazz is matched by 
			LL Cool J's torso. And, he can act too, always helpful. </font>
			</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">When Ray asks 
			Eva why she doesn't have a man, she answers with a challenge: 
			&quot;Because I know the one thing that scares men to death. I know the 
			truth.&quot; And that is: men are afraid to be sincere and respectful of 
			women who know what they want. (Guess he'll have to show her.) When 
			they go on a first (disastrous) date, riding in his meat truck, they 
			share an adorable moment singing along with &quot;Sweet Thing&quot; on the 
			meat truck radio. This alone suggests that they will eventually come 
			together. That this resolution will involve compromise on both sides 
			makes it that much sweeter.&nbsp; </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The film's 
			mechanics are undeniably creaky: the supporting characters do their 
			aggravating duty, including the requisite gay hairdresser and 
			boisterous you-go girlfriend (Kim Whitley) down at the hair salon 
			where Beth works. The others serve only to boost the principals: the 
			sisters are forgettable and the men are so flexible they make Ray, 
			also pretty flexible himself, look relatively macho (Tim wants a 
			baby, Darrell just likes to &quot;cuddle,&quot; and Mike, the only one not 
			married to his girl, wants to move in, but meditating Beth feels 
			they aren't yet &quot;spiritually&quot; in tune).&nbsp; </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">And the script, 
			by James Iver Mattson, B.E. Brauner, and Hardwick, hits the usual 
			turns, with little in the way of innovation: there's a horseback 
			riding scene (Eva's test of her man), a dress-up for a major 
			function scene, a restaurant scene (the twist being that Eva won't 
			eat there for fear of being poisoned), the inevitable confession 
			scene, and the makeup scene where the couple is applauded by a crowd 
			of anonymous onlookers, on a sidewalk, no less. (Can someone please 
			make a romantic comedy that doesn't end with this scene?)</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">But while such 
			conventions are generally draggy, they also identify something 
			specific about this movie. Like <i>Brown Sugar</i>, <i>Deliver Us 
			From Eva</i> uses these conventions to reorient them to another 
			cultural moment and set of interests. Where previously, such general 
			dragginess has been owned by the white romantic comedy, now, black 
			characters can behave in equally culturally overdetermined ways. 
			And, LL Cool J changes his life to win his woman, also always 
			helpful.&nbsp; </font></span></td>
