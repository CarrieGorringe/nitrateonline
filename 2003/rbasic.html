            its title suggests, John McTiernan's new action-thriller, <i>Basic</i>
            is not very new. Written by James Vanderbilt (responsible for the
            equally poorly plotted <i>Darkness Falls</i>), the film offers up a
            standard cat-and-mouse intrigue, wherein an investigator endeavors
            to solve a crime, and in the process uncovers a web of corruption so
            profound that it shakes her worldview. The investigator here, Lt.
            Julia Osborne (Connie Nielsen), must find her way through multiple
            stories unfolding in separate flashbacks, intersecting and
            diverging, until you've either figured out exactly who the bad guys
            are or dozed off. </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">&nbsp;<o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Osborne
            is introduced via her Southernish voiceover, as she narrates a brief
            history of the Panama Canal, near where she's currently (1999)
            stationed at Fort Clayton. Noting the relationships among France's
            initial efforts to build it, the devastating effects of malaria on
            these efforts, the U.S. purchase of French rights and properties in
            1904, and the money made off treatment of malaria, she concludes,
            &quot;This place has always had a special way of dealing with both
            profit and death.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">So,
            okay. Be on the lookout for dishonesty, loss of life, and greed in
            what follows. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Then
            comes the rain, and with it, the dramatic first appearance of
            hard-drinking DEA agent Tom Hardy (John Travolta), banging around in
            his tropical hotel room, apparently depressed and off the wagon,
            presently suspended after being accused of accepting a bribe. Just
            when things look their bleakest (rain, booze, etc.), Hardy's old
            buddy Styles (Timothy Daly), who now commands the U.S. base in
            Panama, calls him in for a job that <i>only</i> he can do. This
            would be the interrogation of a Ranger named Dunbar (Brian Van Holt)
            concerning a training exercise gone terribly wrong. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Dunbar
            has emerged from this apparent disaster in the Panamanian jungle
            carrying fellow Ranger Kendall (Giovanni Ribisi) on his shoulder.
            Now, the wounded Kendall lies unconscious in a hospital bed and
            Dunbar refuses to talk. All other members of their team appear to be
            missing, including the notoriously ferocious Sgt. West (yet another
            over-the-top performance by Samuel L. Jackson). As Hardy reveals to
            Dunbar, he was once trained by West, before he left the military,
            and so he sympathizes with any rage he might feel: West, all agree,
            is (or was) a terrible person, a fact demonstrated across a series
            of ostensibly competing flashbacks: in every one, he mercilessly
            abuses Pike (Taye Diggs). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Even
            if he does have this bit of military background, civilian Hardy's
            &quot;completely unorthodox&quot; arrival ruffles Osborne's
            by-the-book feathers, because she's supposed to be in charge of the
            interrogation. Styles says, essentially, too bad, he needs his man,
            because, he insists, &quot;There's nobody better in a room.&quot;
            (Read this as you will.) His reputation thus preceding him, Hardy
            wastes no time messing with Osborne, getting her to admit right off
            that she's feeling &quot;hostile and uncooperative.&quot; As if to
            give her a good reason to feel that way, he leans in close and,
            claiming he's still a little drunk, declares that he prefers to
            &quot;skip over the witty banter and move straight into coming on to
            you.&quot; To Osborne's credit, she looks somewhat repulsed by this
            idea. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            movie proceeds to line up an assortment of possibilities: Pike
            fragged the Sarge, or Kendall did, or maybe Dunbar, or jeez, Nuñez
            (Roselyn Sanchez) looks angry too, as do durable Mueller (Dash Mihok)
            and dour Castro (Cristián de la Feunte). During flashbacks narrated
            by Dunbar and then Kendall (who usefully regains consciousness, and
            not a little attitude), thunder crashes, lightning flashes, and
            characters loom in their frames, their faces wet and shiny, their
            ponchos dark and slick, their gear silhouetted so they look like
            scary monsters. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            team regroups, seeking shelter from the hurricane that's taken down
            their helicopter, at a shack on the training ground, where they
            confront one another, cast aspersions, and take sides. They tell
            each other stories, which lead to flashbacks within the flashbacks.
            None of the stories jibes exactly -- West was hit with a grenade, or
            he was shot and then grenaded. Or then again, maybe he showed up
            back at the shack, and took out his betrayers. Pike was tied up, or
            he wasn't. Mueller went crazy, or he didn't. Someone was trading
            drugs, or he wasn't. Nuñez took off her jacket, or she didn't.
            Everyone was killed, or they weren't. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">As
            these many twists and turns suggest, Osborne and Hardy are rather up
            against a nest of deception. Throughout their investigation, they're
            confronted with the idea that, as monumentally self-pitying Kendall
            puts it, there are &quot;degrees of truth.&quot; And it's up to the
            investigators to ferret out which degree is more useful than
            another. Not more truthful, just more useful. And in this dancing
            about, McTiernan reveals his continuing appreciation of the fun and
            nuance of big movie lies, much as he did back when he made the
            genre-jolters <i>Predator</i> (1987) and <i>Die Hard</i> (1988). But
            the pace is slowed here, and the commentary more mundane (the U.S.
            government is run by liars, the military is gung-ho, and oh yes,
            also full of liars, but their cause is just). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">And
            poor Osborne. The exemplary outsider, even as she's trying to figure
            out how to read the Rangers' stories, she's also dealing with her
            on-again, off-again lover, Pete (Harry Connick Jr., quite evidently
            in <i>Copycat</i> mode, as opposed to <i>Will &amp; Grace</i> mode),
            a doctor down at the hospital where they interview Kendall.
            Eventually, <i>Basic</i> breaks down into obviously and odiously
            gendered and raced &quot;sides,&quot; never a good sign for a movie
            purporting to examine ambiguity. By the time she's running through a
            Day of the Dead Festival to track her final suspect, you know, even
            if she doesn't, that she's in the wrong movie altogether. (How many
            times have you seen this signifier for the exotic otherness of the
            drug-trading underworld?) <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Osborne's
            degrees of truths are, at first glance, less ambiguous than those of
            the men, perhaps because she is a woman trying to survive in a world
            where men make all the rules, again and again. She's clearly
            finished with Pete's shenanigans. She doesn't appreciate getting
            jerked around by Hardy. And she definitely resents Styles' tedious
            disrespect. Still, the film's ostensible surprises -- end runs
            around seeming plot setups or characterizations -- are cheats more
            than they're asking you to rethink your reading abilities, or your
            understanding of how narrative works. <i>Basic</i> is as generic as
            they come. <o:p>
