            <p><i><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The League of Extraordinary
            Gentlemen</font></b></i><b><font face="Verdana" size="2"> is a
            chaotic mess, but it starts out oh, so elegantly and oh, so
            promisingly. An aged Allan Quatermain (Sean Connery), the explorer
            hero of several Conan Doyle adventures, is lured (or blown, as in
            &quot;explosive&quot;) out of retirement in Kenya, goes to London,
            and is led into a secret chamber (with a Freemason symbol on the
            door) to help avert a possible world war in the year 1899 by meeting
            with an intelligence operative chief who introduces himself as
            &quot;M&quot; (and is played by Richard Roxburgh).</font></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Quatermain's mission, should he
            choose to accept it, is to become part of a special team that is a
            sort of Victorian Justice League- -- Captain Nemo (Naseeruddin
            Shah), in East Indian attire and with the &quot;Nautilus&quot;
            parked outside (the submarine's the best thing in the film -- a
            gigantic silver prow, with an interior done in ivory and white and
            designed like a maharajah's palace); a &quot;gentleman thief&quot;
            (Tony Curran) who stole the formula from H.G. Wells' Invisible Man
            and is now invisible himself; Dorian Gray (Stuart Townsend, who hits
            just the right sultry note of a true sensualist), recruited for his
            ability at immortality and for how he drapes himself over the
            furniture; Mina Harker (Peta Wilson, who's the other best thing in
            the picture -- she is a wow), wife of Jonathan Harker and herself an
            accomplished chemist (her special abilities will remain a secret in
            this review, though); and an American Secret Service agent (Shane
            West) who's a crack shot and is named Tom Sawyer. They stop in
            Paris, so the film can make a reference to a famous Edgar Allan Poe
            story, and to pick up Henry Jekyll and Edward Hyde, both of whom are
            supposed to be played by Jason Flemyng, although the latter looks
            more like a cross between the Hulk and a very angry Gary Busey.
            Then, it's off to go up against a nemesis named the Fantom -- a
            one-eyed silver mask hides his scarred face -- who's planning on
            unleashing prototype military tanks and machine guns on the nations
            of the world. There's a betrayal (not hard to figure out by whom), a
            summit meeting in Venice during the annual carnival, and a trip to a
            snowy castle that's been converted into a munitions plant and looks
            like a nightmare version of an Industrial Age gas works.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">But as soon as the first action
            scene hit, I wondered: why did they hired Stephen Norrington to
            direct? Norrington did <i>Blade</i>, which, after the first seven
            minutes, I found to be unwatchable, for the same reasons as here:
            Norrington puts the camera very close to the flivver and flurry, and
            then throws what he gets all together onto the screen and sees what
            sticks. After a while, a resigned feeling sets in as you give up on
            trying to figure out what you're supposed to be following or even
            looking at. The movie loses track of one of its main characters for
            a long stretch of time, and it can't keep its multiple plotlines
            straight when it reaches the home stretch, reducing everything to
            complete incoherence. The movie's ending also has the distinction of
            being the worst I can recall seeing since the awful tacked-on one --
            done without Clive Barker's approval or participation -- to the 1990
            film, <i>Nightbreed</i>.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This picture is said to have had a
            troubled production, which may account for why it alternates between
            some beautifully-written scenes and crass ones with trite Shane
            Blackisms like when Connery looks at a British flag fluttering down
            over a guy he just walloped and says, &quot;Rule Britannia&quot;.
            (Actually, not all that different from what he was given to say when
            he was playing James Bond.) There are a lot of excuses to create
            fights and to blow things up, and a lot of plot turns that don't
            make sense well after you've left the theater. A lot of people have
            been expressing disappointment over movies nowadays, and this film
            is not exception: for all the trouble its makers have gone to, it
            should have been smarter, more pleasing, more easy to look at, and
            instead it ends up like a failed scrimmage, albeit an extravagant
            one, and albeit an ultimately dismissable one.</font><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
