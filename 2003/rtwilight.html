            might have worked best as a satire, maybe in the style of the old
            radio and T.V. daytime dramas: &quot;And now...<i>The Twilight Girls</i>.&quot;
            (upswell of music, something like &quot;Love is a Many Splendored
            Thing&quot;) &quot;The continuing story of those girls who are too
            old to be children, but too young to be adults...&quot; (Or, as the

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;Girls! Girls! Have you
            heard?&quot; says Monica (Christine Carère), running up to her
            teenage schoolchums at the exclusive French boarding school Les
            Vallons. &quot;There's a new girl enrolling, and you'll all get to
            meet her!&quot; Catharine (Marie-Hélène Arnaud) is told by the
            school headmistress (Gaby Morlay) that she must trade in her city
            duds (by Dior) for a conventional school uniform (long-sleeve
            blouse, cravat, and pleated skirt), and that she'll have to get a
            more sensible hairstyling, as well. Catherine is moody and
            mysterious, a loner, occasionally casting a wistful glance at the
            other girls, and there are secrets about her hidden past. A hidden
            past! Those wistful glances...could it be, could it be, that she is
            maybe that dark bride of Sappho come to, according to the
            stereotype, drive all the girls mad with desire and turn the place
            into a hotbed of repressed sexuality? And what actually happened to
            her father, and why is she enrolling in the school so late in the
            academic year? Did she get into some trouble, and was she kicked out
            of some august institution? And that little girl who peeks at
            Catherine's clothes and perfume and pretends to sleepwalk at night
            so she can raid the pantry for strawberry jam, is that...CATHERINE
            DENEUVE????</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">La Deneuve did make her film debut,
            at age thirteen and under the name of &quot;Cathy Dorléac&quot;, in
            this film, originally made in France as <b><i>Les Collégiennes</i></b>
            (<i>The Schoolgirls</i>) by director André Hunebelle in 1957. She
            appears in two scenes, set in the school cafeteria, as one of the
            girls who sits at the end of the table where the main characters are
            assigned to eat. She has one line -- &quot;Marlon Brando!&quot;
            However, the eyes, the features, the profile are clearly present and
            unmistakable (even if you have to hit the &quot;pause&quot; button
            to confirm). The part of Adelaide, who boards with the
            &quot;little&quot; girls at the school and whose scenes were
            initially cut out of the picture when it was released in the U.S.,
            is played by &quot;Sylvie Dorléac&quot;, who is...Sylvie Dorléac,
            sister of Catherine and Françoise Dorléac. When Françoise decided
            to enter the acting profession, Catherine took their mother's
            surname, Deneuve, while Françoise appeared under their father's
            name, Dorléac. (and was embarked upon a potentially illustrious
            career when she perished in a car accident, at age twenty-five, in
            1967.) Sylvie Dorléac went on to appear in one more film, <b><i>Les
            Petites Chats</i></b>, in 1965, and allegedly dubbed Janina Faye's
            part in the French-language version of the Hammer film <i>Horror of
            Dracula</i> (1958).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b><i>Les Collégiennes</i></b>
            tells the story of how Monica's crush on Catherine at first helps
            facilitate Catherine's romance with Dean (Henri Guisol), a young
            composer who wears tennis whites and is writing a concerto (which
            sounds like the &quot;Cornish Rhapsody&quot; Margaret Lockwood
            pounded out on the concert grand in the 1944 <i>Love Story</i>).
            When the school authorities find out that Catherine and Dean intend
            to elope, they take her out of the &quot;big&quot; girls' dormitory
            and, for her own good, lock her in a room in the teachers' quarters
            at night (I hope they left her with a chamber pot). Monica then
            turns so possessive that she withholds letters that Dean has been
            writing to Catherine, even after Catherine falls down a flight of
            stairs and winds up in the infirmary, wasting away, thinking that
            Dean doesn't love her anymore. (And, no, she can't call him on the
            phone -- this is a 1950s girls' school, where they can't use the
            phone -- so the letters are the only lines of communication.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">When Radley Metzger got ahold of
            the picture for U.S. release, he had something different in mind
            (including changing the title). Spicing things up a bit, he filmed
            new footage which was shot and staged so that it could be cut into
            Hunebelle's movie in such a way that you almost can't tell the
            difference. After lights-out, in the &quot;big&quot; girls'
            dormitory, Simone says she's too hot and takes off her pajama top,
            explaining that she sleeps better that way -- and, judging by how
            top-heavy Simone is, no wonder she gets warm at night. This turns
            into a running subplot, replete with sirens and bells to alert the
            audience as to the next forthcoming unveiling (&quot;Now, I want you
            ALL to keep your pajama tops on!&quot;), and the girl who sleeps
            next to Simone, a comely lass named Danielle, is encouraged to doff
            her top in bed, as well -- she'll like it. Funny thing is, Simone
            and Danielle never appear in any of the other scenes with the other
            actresses. (And Danielle is supposed to be played by Georgina
            Spelvin, who would later appear in a famous Seventies adult film, <i>The
            Devil in Miss Jones</i>. I can't attest to this, so we'll have to
            take their word on it.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Metzger's other additional footage
            landed him and the film in the New York State Supreme Court. In <b><i>Les
            Collégiennes</i></b>, Monica holds-hands at night with Marthe
            (Estella Blain), who sleeps in the bed beside her's. Metzger added
            another pair of girls who actually hop into bed together: they
            exchange a smooch, then cuddle-up. The scene does have a frankly
            sexual tone to it -- this was not the type of thing you saw at the
            movies on Friday night in the 1950s --even though nothing explicit
            happens. It was enough to cause the film to be held up for
            distribution in New York State for several years. The New York City
            Regents Board, which issued the licensing needed for films to be
            shown in local theaters, turned down <i>The Twilight Girls</i> on
            the basis of, according to their decision, material that had been
            &quot;inserted&quot; for &quot;prurient reasons&quot;. Even though a
            higher court would later issue a ruling ordering that the film be
            licensed, the Regents Board continued to stand by their initial
            decision. Metzger's company, Audubon Films, took the case all the
            way to the New York State Appeals Court, who, in February, 1965,
            reversed the Regents Board decision and declared that the film was
            &quot;not obscene&quot;, after which it was shown, without cuts,
            right at about the time when the beginnings of the new &quot;freedom
            of the screen&quot; were starting to manifest themselves. (In June,
            1965, another Appeals Court ruling would declare the New York State
            censorship laws unconstitutional and &quot;null and void&quot;;
            Maryland's state censorship laws would also be overturned by the
            U.S. Supreme Court that same year.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As for <i>The Twilight Girls</i>?
            Well, the robotic English-language dubbing takes some getting used
            to. (And the dialogue: &quot;You remind me of someone I never
            knew.&quot; &quot;I'm so happy now---I want to go around kissing
            everyone!&quot;) The restored footage with Sylvie Dorléac is
            charming, and is presented in its original French-language form,
            with subtitling. Agnes Laurent, who gets top billing, actually
            appears in a secondary role (she's the schoolchum introduces Dean to
            Catharine). Christine Carère was actually the girl of the hour when
            this was made: she had landed the female lead in a big Hollywood
            adaptation of Françoise Sagan's novel, <i>A Certain Smile</i>,
            which would come out in 1958, a year after <i>Les Collégiennes</i>.
            (And the glacéed film version Jean Negulesco made of it tanked big
            time. Carère returned to film acting in France. Agnes Laurent, the
            &quot;fabulous love kitten&quot; being positioned as a rival to
            Brigitte Bardot, would leave show business altogether, embarking on
            a successful second career as a French politician.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As for the hot stuff -- well, the
            exhibitionistic Simone aside, the smooch and the cuddle are about as
            hot as things get, here. If you're looking for something hotter,
            you'd have to wait until Metzger released <i>I, a Woman</i> (oh,
            those fabulous Swedes!) in the U.S. in 1967. What <i>The Twilight
            Girls</i> does is evoke a time not that long ago when a &quot;frank
            and daring experience&quot; at the movies could still be had. In the
            preview trailer for another Agnes Laurent import, <i>Soft Skin on
            Black Silk</i>, a voice tells us, &quot;In case you think she has
            nothing left to show you, wait until you see this film. She really
            gets down to business.&quot; By the end of the 1960s, Catherine
            Deneuve (whose recollections of making &quot;Les Collégiennes&quot;
            is succinct: &quot;I performed in a school uniform, and it was where
            I learned how to tie a cravat.&quot;) would appear in <i>Belle du
            Jour</i>, the psycho-sexual thriller <i>Repulsion</i>, and Marco
            Ferreri's <i>Liza</i>, where her character is made to be leashed and
            act like a dog. The Motion Picture Ratings System would be
            introduced, and for a few years it was fashionable to take in adult
            movies -- <i>Devil in Miss Jones</i> (which was reviewed in <i>Time </i>magazine),
            Marilyn Chambers in <i>Behind the Green Door</i>, Linda Lovelace
            consulting with &quot;doctor&quot; Harry Reams in <i>Deep Throat</i>.
            Radley Metzger himself would direct another, <i>Misty Beethoven</i>,
            which came to be highly regarded in some quarters.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What effect has this had on the
            current state of our society and culture? Some of the truly depraved
            films -- Jörg Buttgereit's siren-song paeans for self-destruction,
            Larry Clark's peep-show fetishizations of underage bodies -- which
            have developed cult followings probably would've gotten made anyhow,
            anyway. In 1980, United Artists had to abandon their attempts to
            make a film out of Gay Talese's best-seller <i>Thy Neighbor's Wife</i>
            because they couldn't figure out how to do it without getting an X
            rating, which would've kept people AWAY from the film at that time.
            Now, if the bobbing nincompoops in the <i>Girls Gone Wild</i> videos
            are to be believed, everyone wants to expose themselves in front of
            everybody. <i>The Twilight Girls</i> looks cozy and quaint. Unless
            someone wants to do <i>The Twilight Girls Gone Wild</i>....<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"></o:p>
