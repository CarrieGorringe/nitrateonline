            (Dwayne Johnson) is en route to a job: he's assigned to extract debt
            payment from a celebrity football player, at that moment hunkered
            down with his &quot;entire offensive line&quot; in a dance club. The
            music throbs as he approaches the entrance, beautiful girls drape
            themselves in the hallway, but Beck is all business, his face set in
            grim determination, when he passes another well-dressed patron
            exiting the club. &quot;Have fun,&quot; says the stranger, who is no
            stranger at all, but Arnold Schwarzenegger, tidily passing the
            action-heroic torch to his most obvious and extraordinary heir, The
            Rock. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            fact that the Rock plays Beck, a &quot;retrieval expert,&quot; in <i>The
            Rundown</i> is fine, but not crucial to understanding his career,
            past, present, or future. Beck is pleasant and ambitious, seeking to
            get out of the muscle-for-hire business and open his own restaurant,
            nothing fancy, just twelve tables or so. He's also extremely gifted
            and focused when the moment calls for it; though he considers
            himself a product of his hard case childhood, responding to his
            environment, he's the ideal rundown guy -- tracking, capturing, and
            transferring his assignments with style and as little aggression as
            possible. Always aiming to complete his mission without weapons
            (&quot;I don't like guns&quot;), Beck ritually offers his targets
            two &quot;options,&quot; A or B: the first being to hand over
            whatever is owed, and the second, to have Beck take it, by the means
            he deems necessary. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">He
            demonstrates his prowess during the first dance club scene, when he
            convinces the football player to give up his expensive ring as
            &quot;collateral,&quot; by slamming and banging the several members
            of that offensive line into unconsciousness. All to the beat of
            Missy Elliot's bumping remix of &quot;Get Ur Freak On.&quot; It's a
            remarkable entrance, even if you've seen too many over-caffeinated
            action adventures, showing off director Peter Berg's dark humor and
            penchant for stylized brutality (see also, his <i>Very Bad Things</i>
            [1998]). The Rock is perfect for such bizarre shenanigans, because
            he's so darn decent (&quot;The People's Champion,&quot; after all).
            As he demonstrated in his first two films (for four minutes in <i>The
            Mummy Returns</i> [2001] and for the duration of <i>The Scorpion
            King</i> [2002]), the Rock is a bonafide movie star, all charisma
            and powerhouse affect. So, even as he's delivering the most
            devastating and elaborate of beatdowns, he's sympathetic, even
            (strangely) sensitive-seeming. He doesn't want to hurt 'em, but he
            just can't help it. <o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Beck's
            current assignment, following the football player, is a rather
            personal one for his employer, the invidious Walker (William
            Lucking). He tells Beck that if he retrieves his wayward son, Travis
            (Seann &quot;Face Like A Weasel&quot; William Scott), that it can be
            his &quot;last job&quot; (this being the convention in any such
            movie, ensuring the hero's reluctance and desperation). Beck agrees
            to the terms because he has no choice, acts all submissive to Walker
            but plainly hates being under whatever debt he owes (just how he got
            into this position is not explained; suffice it to say that Beck is
            too nice to be laboring for such a cretin). <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Beck's
            pursuit of Travis takes him to the Brazilian jungles, with the help
            of the wild bush pilot Declan (Ewen Bremner). Here Travis, a
            graduate student (or dropout, depending on whom you ask) is looking
            for the Gato del Diablo, a precious artifact (to the tune of
            multi-millions of dollars). This quest (and Beck's effort to cut it
            short) will be complicated by the fact that this Gato is also sought
            by a ferocious capitalist named Hatcher (Christopher Walken). The
            film's most outrageous villain, Hatcher maintains a gold mine with
            slave labor (he pays his workers some sixty-five cents a day) -- the
            impressively humungo expanse of the mine and the many bodies
            involved in its working are rendered with a mix of digital effects
            and craning cameras. There's no question this guy is a monster, as
            his minions wield whips to discipline sweaty, downtrodden workers,
            and as he -- in an exceedingly weird moment -- refers to his labor
            force as workers &quot;oompa loompas&quot; (let's just say that
            Walken is ensuring his rep as a magnetic oddball player).<span style="mso-spacerun:

            </o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">That
            the film includes this subplot -- racing, classing, and
            nationalizing it so specifically -- sets it slightly apart from the
            usual buddy bonding movie. This even though Beck and Travis (he of a
            smarmily privileged background that leaves him needing lessons in
            class systems) withstand standard homosocial exploits (raucous
            fights, hardass wisecracks, outrageous stunts) and some not so
            standard (a herd of lusty monkeys find them attractive, and assault
            them repeatedly). They work through these episodes with sometimes
            smart repartee (screenplay by R.J. Stewart and James Vanderbilt),
            brilliant acrobatics (fight choreography by Andy Cheng), and frankly
            thrilling editing (by Richard Pearson). But mostly they get by on
            their well-known charms -- the Rock meets Stifler.<o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Also
            as per the buddy formula, they do meet a girl, to straighten out the
            relationship. Mariana (Rosario Dawson) is not the usual buddy-movie
            girl, being a guerilla leader with her own agenda and a big gun. She
            schools Beck on global identities (when he remarks on the Brazil
            nuts in the bar she runs, she observes, &quot;We're in Brazil. We
            just call them nuts&quot;). And she rescues them from a high-speed,
            elaborately wire-worked smackdown with the maniacally muscled Manito
            (Ernie Reyes Jr.), then instructs them in the politics they're so
            used to ignoring. In other words, Mariana's presence secures not
            only the boys' gendered and sexual identities (though this remains
            fluid enough to be intriguing, as Scott seems fairly omnivorous),
            but she also provides <i>The Rundown</i> with a point about virtuous
            international relations -- isolationism is bad policy and ethically
            reprehensible. All this in an action flick. As the Rock has revealed
            throughout his career as a wrestler and celebrity, progressive
            politics may be most effective when you don't expect them. </span></font><span style="font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;
