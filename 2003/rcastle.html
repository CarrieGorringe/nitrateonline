            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by <a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias
            Savada</a>, 22 August 2003</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>This quirky, mildly charming
            British romantic drama with comedy is pulled from the same mind
            (Dodie Smith) that brought us the funnier, fantastical <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">101
            Dalmatians</i>, but it is decidedly closer in tone and style to the
            late John Schlesinger's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Cold
            Comfort Farm</i> (1995), wherein a close-knit 1930s family perhaps
            is a little too crazy for their wealthier, and presumably saner,
            neighbors. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Farm</i> (which
            originated as a 1932 novel by Stella Gibbons), coined the phrase
            &quot;There's something nasty in the woodshed,&quot; whereas <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Castle</i>'s
            unspoken secrets lay upstairs with a recalcitrant father/author in
            the locked turret of a derelict fort that he and his family care
            take of. Each film each features a stunningly beautiful actress that
            bear a passing resemblance to one other: Kate Beckinsale and Tara
            Fitzgerald.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Beyond the obvious comparisons,
            both films are immensely watchable. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">I
            Capture the Castle</i> is filled with some genuine golden moments
            from director Tim Fywell (a television director for the last dozen
            years now making his theatrical feature debut), writer Heidi Thomas
            (also making her inaugural switch from TV) and producer David
            Parfitt (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Shakespeare in Love</i>),
            but unfortunately, this small nugget has gone overlooked during this
            summer of cinematic discontent. The horrific <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Gigli</i>
            made nearly <u>twice</u> as much money on its opening day as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">I
            Capture the Castle</i> has grossed during its ongoing U.S. run. Of
            course, if the film is only playing in a handful of theaters, it
            boils down to how well funded the marketing campaign is to alert
            potential patrons there are choices such as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Castle</i>
            in the marketplace. The promotional budget for <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Gigli</i> alone (negative costs were $54 million) dwarfs the entire cost
            of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Castle</i>. It's just so
            disheartening. This Samuel Goldwyn Films release played too briefly
            in the Washington, DC, market (where it opened in mid-July), but it
            is playing off in various regional markets (check at <a href="http://www.capturethecastlemovie.com/" target="_top">http://www.capturethecastlemovie.com/</a>
            if it's in your neighborhood).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Romola Garai, fresh from her
            performance as <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Nicholas
            Nickleby</i>'s sister in last year's surprisingly stimulating
            adaptation, takes center stage as the seventeen-year-old Cassandra
            Mortmain, who narrates the back story of her family's eager,
            momentarily enchanting, move into a Suffolk castle (although filmed
            on the Isle of Man) a decade earlier, as caretakers, and their
            eventual decline as father (Bill Nighy), a successful novelist,
            suffers through an extended, twelve-year case of writer's block.
            Cassie, plain in appearance, drab in dress, but noble in spirit and
            possessed of passion, tries to maintain the financially-challenged
            family, whose fortune now borders on destitution. She, her older,
            irresponsible sister Rose (a flaming redhead played by Australian
            beauty Rose Byrne), a younger brother Thomas (Joe Sowerbutts, but
            looking more like Harry Potter), and Topaz, their ditsy Bohemian
            stepmother (Tara Fitzgerald, who cuts her own impressive figure) are
            forced to react to the &quot;unmitigated gloom&quot; of the
            situation, as so described by Cassie in her journals. Stephen (Henry
            Cavill), a handsome handy boy aware of the family's dwindling
            resources, stays around as unpaid help to silently dote after
            Cassie.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Fate, naturally, comes after the
            death of Sir William, who owns the estate on which the castle is
            located, and the storm-drenched arrival of his two American
            grandsons: taciturn, educated Simon Cotton (Henry Thomas) and his
            younger, cowboyesque brother Neil (Marc Blucas), accompanying their
            now wealthy mother (Sinead Cusack). Two young, rich, eligible men.
            Two sweet young women anxious for mingling with them and an escape
            from their impoverished state. Love, rightly and wrongly, beckons as
            the foursome try to sort out their hormones and partners. Add in
            several additional layers of emotional, intellectual, and sexual
            foreplay involving more of the cast and all the parents (save the
            girls' mother, who was killed at her husband's hand and covered in
            flashback), and the film becomes a landscape of shifting,
            susceptible, and sensitive liaisons, not all of them for the best.</font></p>

            and (Heidi) Thomas, who worked together previously on a BBC
            production of Flaubert's <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Madame
            Bovary</i>, effectively capture the eccentric wit of Smith's 1948
            book, and tint it with the agony of human frailties, the discipline
            of appealing drama, and a perceptive interplay among the ensemble
            cast. The acting soars with the women and is just slightly less so
            with the men, more out the manner in which the roles were written.
            The production benefits immensely from Oscar-nominated (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Shakespeare in Love</i>) talents of hair and makeup designer Lisa
            Wescott and cinematographer Richard Greatex, in addition to costumes
            created by Charlotte Walter. <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">I
            Capture the Castle</i> moves smoothly in capturing a coming-of-age
            story and the changing romantic and economic relationships between
            family, friends, and paramours. It's a diamond in the rough.</span></font></td>
