            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Thaddeus O’Sullivan’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
            Heart of Me</i>, the story of a romantic triangle that consumes, and
            nearly destroys, three upper crust British family members before and
            after WWII, is cast in the Merchant/Ivory mold. Mr. O’Sullivan’s
            film, adapted from a Rosamond Lehmann novel by Lucinda Coxon,
            attempts to mimic the stately grace and pent-up emotional desire of
            predecessors <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The Remains of
            the Day</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Howard’s End</i>,
            utilizing measured camera work and deliberate performances to convey
            a world in which societal convention trumps free will, and personal
            desire is confined to the dank, dusty basement of the heart. It is
            an imitation infused with little inspiration, but if its portrait of
            adulterous machinations is as familiar as the sight of Helena Bonham
            Carter in a period drama, the film nonetheless benefits from
            performances perfectly calibrated for repressed torment.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Rickie (Paul Bettany) and
            Madeleine’s (Olivia Williams) marriage comes under stress when
            Madeleine’s free-spirited sister Dinah (Helena Bonham Carter),
            after years of traveling, reappears to attend their father’s
            funeral. Madeleine, a prissy and obnoxious socialite, attempts to
            play condescending matchmaker for her sister, but when she finds a
            willing and able suitor, it is Rickie who orders Dinah to break the
            engagement off. The two siblings-in-law, enflamed by reckless
            passion, begin a clandestine affair under Madeleine’s nose, but
            the truth eventually comes out, sparking a battle of wills between
            Madeleine and Dinah for the affection of Rickie, a docile pawn
            manipulated as the women in his life see fit. As the affair
            transforms from playful reverie into destructive force, our
            sympathies are splintered – while we are supposed to be caught up
            in Rickie and Dinah’s happiness, we are also repeatedly reminded
            of Madeleine’s victim status – and this delicate balancing act
            suggests the complexities of a love affair in which all parties
            retain some measure of guilt.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">O’Sullivan abandons typical
            period frippery in favor of an austere visual palette and set design
            that reflects the character’s misery, and this unwillingness to
            replicate every one of the genre’s tropes is a worthy ambition.
            His direction, however, is placidly elegant – the constant use of
            close-ups and zooms alternate between sophistication and
            self-consciousness – and this competent but dreary guidance
            frequently steers the story into a torpor. The film is built upon a
            foundation of unspoken truths and concealed emotions, but
            O’Sullivan isn’t dexterous enough to navigate through this
            murky, amorphous territory, and thus resorts to clunky maneuvers –
            such as using bomb-decimated London as a symbolic reflection of
            their despair – to flesh out his characters’ chaotic frames of
            mind.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">What allows the film to rise above
            its awkward construction is a pair of fine performances from Helena
            Bonham Carter and Olivia Williams, and a truly superb turn courtesy
            of Paul Bettany. Carter, playing the stereotypically stubborn
            iconoclast whose interests include nude paintings and smoking, wraps
            insolence around her frame like a fur coat, embodying Dinah with an
            alluring petulance. She’s ably matched by Williams, who has the
            thankless task of eliciting both our contempt and sympathy as the
            scorned Madeleine, a conniving, cold woman driven to duplicitous
            lengths to retain her beloved husband. Yet the film’s moderate
            success can be traced to Bettany, whose Rickie is a roiling bundle
            of unwanted responsibilities and unattainable yearnings. Desperate
            to enjoy bliss with Dinah but never bold enough to fully abandon his
            family and the society that would shun him for such a decision,
            he’s a man tenuously straddling two worlds. That the film’s pat
            conclusion absolves him of such a momentous decision is merely one
            of its shortcomings, but Mr. Bettany, his strikingly supple and open
            face revealing a naked timidity awash in self-doubt and
            self-loathing, is certainly worth the price of admission</font></td>
