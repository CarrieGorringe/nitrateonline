<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>While former Kansas Citian Andy Harbeck is
often credited as a lead animator, a texture artist, a digital painter or a
digital compositor, he's in many ways more of a magician. Working with other
computer artists, he makes an invaluable, if sometimes unheralded, contribution
to movies by causing the impossible look real or even commonplace.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Harbeck graduated from the Kansas City Art
Institute in 1997. During his time in Cowtown, he directed and contributed to a
series of short independent films and eventually landed gigs on Hollywood movies
as diverse as the children's flick <i>Richie Rich</i>, and the shark thriller <i>Deep
Blue Sea</i>. He was a lead, texture, shading and model artist on the
all-digital science fiction adventure <i>Final Fantasy: The Spirits</i> <i>Within</i>.
Currently associated with the Berkeley, California-based Tippett Studio, he's
contributed to <i>Blade II</i>, <i>The One</i>, <i>The Ring </i>and <i>Matrix:
Revolutions</i>.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Harbeck was back in his old stomping grounds
for the Seventh Annual Kansas City Filmmakers Jubilee. He's a past winner at the
festival, and this time he returned with an impressive set of film clips. In the
scene from <i>Blade II</i>, a digital Wesley Snipes leaps through a surreal
digital series of tunnels and hallways. We also got to see trailers for <i>The
Matrix: Reloaded</i> and <i>The Final Flight of the Osiris</i>.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The latter is part of a series of short animated films called <i>The
Animatrix</i>, which are individual cartoons all themed around the original <i>Matrix</i>
films. The script for <i>Osiris</i> was written by <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Matrix</i><span style="mso-bidi-font-style:italic"> creators Andy</span>
and Larry Wachowski and directed by Andy Jones. It will be part of the <i>Animatrix</i>
DVD and accompanied <i>Dreamcatcher</i> during that film's brief theatrical run</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Harbeck even demonstrated an eerily lifelike
character he created named Acuna. Curiously, the most impressive effect he
presented for the crowd wasn't otherworldly at all. In a brief scene from Gore
Verbinski's <i>The Ring</i>, we watch Naomi Watts scream as a horse leaps nearly
forty feat from the deck of a ferry. It looks like an animal rights activist's
worst nightmare, but the falling and very real looking beast was
computer-generated.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Afterwards, I cornered him in a coffee shop,
and he talked about how he and his collaborators used computers to make these
images possible.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">Dan Lybarger: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">How
did you go from making short films here in Kansas City to working with Hollywood
studios and what was your involvement with them?</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">Andy Harbeck:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span></font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">A lot of the short films
that I started doing at the Art Institute were ones that I worked on as an
assistant or ones that I directed and kind of put together. We did one based on
a short story by Garbiel Garcia-Marquez called <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">There
Are No Thieves in This Town</i>. We kind of combined that with the exteriors and
interiors of Kansas City. We shot in my basement, with these really old stone,
brick walls and things like that.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A lot of the films were projects that I was
working on, but others were ones that I was hoping would be assisting friends
and stuff like that. One of the bigger films was called <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">For
My Sister</i>, which was a twenty-minute film. I think we did it in ’97 with a
company called Fearless Eye. They do some 3D things. We did story about a girl
and her sister, but what that allowed us to do was create these visual effects
like the girl hanging off the wall. We made it look like she was hanging off the
building. We made this gun. We brought this (computer generated) gun out of the
wall and stuff like that.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">We did a lot of fun things that we weren’t
doing yet (professionally) but we wanted to do.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Other short films were all CG. It’s about
these cartoon spiders and their fight over the light and simple things like
that. It was fun to do simple, short all CG projects.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">How
did these help you land Hollywood gigs?</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">AH: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Very
gradually. Being able to do some of the work was a way to prove we could do some
of the work. For me, the biggest move for me was moving to San Jose to work with
this company where the first project they did there was <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Richie
Rich</i>. We did about 500 shots in like five weeks and with only like six
people, so we worked quite a bit, and we worked around the clock, but it was a
lot of fun. It was such a small team and everybody became close. It was a way to
get a springboard for other work. I was gradually doing some things I wanted to
do.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">When
you think of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Richie Rich</i>, you don’t really think that there are a lot of
CGI’s.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">AH: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s
not the first thing you think of, but it was an extreme amount of shots. We did
a lot of snow shots, like putting snow into things that they shot in LA so that
it would look like wintertime. We did the standard green-screen things where
Richie gets to fly and stuff like that.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">You’ve
Got Mail</i> features some autumn colored leaves that were actually digitally
alter from their spring colors. A lot of people condemn CGI but yet it’s so
omnipresent that you don’t even know when it’s being used.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">AH:<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span></font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">A lot of times now it is
becoming more subtle, and it is, I think, able to blend into what the story is
about. In <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Deep Blue Sea</i>, we created
some extra water. They shot it on a stage, and we just continued it. Most people
wouldn’t know it was on a stage, and the water was made to look like it was
out on the ocean.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
horse stunt from <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Ring</i> is really astonishing. You really think a horse is falling
off the ship.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">AH: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">It
helped them to show what they needed to show visually without upsetting a lot of
people or hurting any animals. You’d never be able to do it with a real horse.
You’d have to somehow be able to fake it with only having it jump a little bit
and then cut to something else. So in a way you’re able to see a lot more than
you would have before.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Erin
Brockovich</i> has a car wreck that was helped by a digital combination of two
separate shots that gives the illusion of a single shot of a car slamming into
the vehicle with Julia Roberts in it.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">AH: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">It’s
a lot more shocking then, too, when you see it, and you’re not expecting it at
that moment. Whereas a lot of times before, you’d see it, and then it would
cut to a new shot and “it” would happen, so it was a lot more expected. You
were a lot more able to &quot;read&quot; the standard. Now it kind of frees you
to be more surprising.<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Certainly
in the clips you showed us from <i>Blade II</i>, you have this long shot where
the camera follows a digital Wesley Snipes as he leaps and summersaults through
these M.C. Escher-like hallways and passages. I’d love to find a crane that
could replicate that.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">AH: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">It
would be very difficult. Part of the thing the director (Guillermo del Toro)
wanted to do was come up with a new style of camera being able to and kind of
swing around the action. He wanted to start very close to the action, swing
around, follow Blade spinning in the air and come all the way around to another
shot in front of him. In some of the other shots where he jumps off the wall,
the camera is completely following him all the way to see the sword go all the
way through the vampire guy. A couple of the other shots where he runs out of
the building, and you see him floating, flying in the air with his cape
slashing. He lands, turns, spins around. It’s another dimension where it’s
allowed the director to free up the camera.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Its also creates the need for us to create the
whole set digitally. They’ll take just a bunch of photos, and we’ll recreate
the whole set digitally so we can put the camera anywhere on the set and do
anything.</font></p>

</i>When you were working on <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Final
Fantasy: The Spirits Within</i>, as a texture artist one of your challenges was
to make the characters actually look like living humans.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">AH:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>On <i>Final Fantasy</i>, my department wasn't working on the characters. On
other films I was working on the characters {i.e., The One), but on this film
our department was responsible for every set and prop except for the characters
and FX.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A lot of the stuff that we did and even within
the department that I was in as a lead artist, our department worked on every
shot in the entire film, which was creating anything a lot of stuff in the real
world in live action that you get for free.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">[He points to a nearby wall with framed photos
hanging from it] You get this reflection here for free. You don’t have to
create a separate reflection map or render for that. That bolt on the wall has
to be painted. You also have think about where the dirt’s going to go around
the bolt. Normally, even if you’re a set designer, you put the bolts in and
you have the surfaces already. If you want the surfaces to look like metal, you
put metal up there. In our case, you’ve to start with something gray. You’ve
got to figure out what this has got to look like.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Is it supposed to be metallic? Is it supposed
to be hard? Is it supposed to be soft? Is it supposed to be a rock? And then you
have to come up with how the thing is weathered. Just creating a wall that
matches the overall color of the real wall is going to make a flat blue wall.
Whereas in the real world, there’s nothing flat about any wall.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>Like with this wall, some of the plaster is cracked.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">AH:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>Exactly. That’s the kind of detail that takes a long time. You’ve got to
figure out &quot;What’s that wall been used for?&quot; There’s going to be
plaster that’s coming off of it. If one of the pictures [hanging from the
wall] is missing, you’re going to have a little shadow from where that picture
was.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>When you mentioned what you had done with the water in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Deep
Blue Sea</i>, I was reminded that Hayao Miyazaki’s Studio Ghibli has people
who specialize in water effects.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">AH:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>We do, too. It depends on what studio you’re at, but there’s often a
whole department for the effects side just for creating atmospheres in the room,
creating smoke, anything that’s being illuminated. Water that’s
particle-based needs a lot of simulation and things like that. It all has to be
developed mathematically or artistically to simulate the physical world. Trying
to imagine animating every water droplet in water takes you a long time.
There’s a lot of work with how the water moves and how these particles
generation systems work Some of that’s starting to be built into some of these
programs. It makes things a lot easier now.</font></p>

1.0pt;padding-top:1.0pt;mso-padding-top-alt:0in"><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>I was reading Roger Ebert's review of <i>Spider-Man</i>, where he said the
swinging effects didn't show any gravity. When I saw the horse in <i>The Ring</i>,
that's gravity in spades. You see certain parts of the horse getting more of a
pull than others.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">AH:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>A lot of the animators have really good eyes. There was no reference for
that shot. We as texture artists look at a lot of different things as well as
the animators for things that reference to that. So maybe you would look at
something else that would be falling that would have some similarities. If we
are doing explosions, we would be looking at different kinds of explosions and
trying to apply that something that's not completely similar but might react in
the same way.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>I could even see wind resistance on the digital horse.</font></p>

<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>When CGI is ineffective, the image is perfect. Things that you take for
granted in the real world aren't there. You think, &quot;Wait a second.&quot;
When the actors are in a windy environment, and this object somehow remains
smooth and untarnished.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">AH:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>That's the difficulty of everybody's job, from layout, from the beginning to
the final compositing is actually distorting and changing the cleanliness of
what is happening. If we have a texture, even it looks a little clean, we've
still got dirt on it. Even something clean has something like a fingerprint
within the break of the surface.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>One striking aspect of the <i>Matrix</i> movies is that several special
effects companies worked on them. Is that coordination tricky?</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">AH:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>
</i>It can be. At least, when we were on <i>Blade II</i>, there were other
companies that were working on [it]. There was even one shot in <i>Blade II</i>
where it starts out as our shot and then they blend back into the plate and back
into our shot and into the plate and out into a completely different CGI shot
dome by another company. Even in a single shot there can be more than one
company working on it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It seems to go relatively well especially when
we get information as far as what it's supposed to look like visually. The
supervisors are usually pretty good about passing on that information. When we
start on it, we know we're going to have to do something like that. At least
with the plate, there's a common ground.</font></p>

a lot of different effects, like the characters breaking apart into hundreds of
pieces. We worked quite a bit to fast-forward the process as far as like put in
research and thought on how we were going to do it, and we just started to work
on the shot then.</font></p>

</i>I hear it's kind of two-sided. With some people it's like they saw it and
liked it a lot, and other people visually they liked how it was, but they didn't
connect with it, maybe. We always hear within the industry that it was received
pretty well. It does seem unfortunate that a lot more people didn't see it when
it was out. Maybe, as people remember, they'll come back to it and buy it on

does the light do when it hits my face, and how does it change the color?&quot;
In certain light, there's different texture that will reveal different things,
different wavelengths of light.<br>

make sure that we get what we need to make the shot work. When they get back
from that, they know what we need. Most of the time, they're pretty good about
getting what we would need to do a shot.</font></p>

</i>We look for people who have experience in general, but a lot times companies
don't give you the experience that you want. We look for more or less artists
that are capable of doing some of the work. Maybe they haven't done a lot of the
work in the past.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">For instance, maybe they have a good portfolio:
lots of nice drawings, paintings and stuff like that, some work that they've
done on their in 3D or 2D. But they haven't worked on any films or anything like
that. A lot of times we can see what kind of art was there.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>

<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If they do have some of those basic skill sets,
they're kind of able to quickly learn one of the 3D things. You do rely a lot on
texture painting, but you also work with a model on how it’s shaded, how the
light is interacting on the surfaces and things like that. A lot of those skills
come from a strong artistic background.<o:p>

</i>That one's been a lot of fun because the surface is so kind of translucent
and dead-skinnish with a little wetness to it. Sometimes the reaction I get with
it when people see it is [laughs] is they don't want to look at it because it's
almost gross. In a way that's almost satisfactory because people are reacting to
it instead of visually seeing something and saying, &quot;Oh it's
computer-generated.&quot;</font><b style="mso-bidi-font-weight:normal"><i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal"><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"></o:p>
