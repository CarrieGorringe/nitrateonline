            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			Nicholas Schager, 28 February 2003</i></font><p>
			<p><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">If Claire Denis’ masterfully 
			gruesome vampire tale <i>Trouble Every Day</i> detailed the most 
			violent expressions of love, then <i>Friday Night</i>, the French 
			director’s latest examination of amorous desire, is a sumptuous 
			evocation of the liberating exhilaration of unexpected romance. The 
			story of a one-night stand between two strangers, it’s a film so 
			beautifully attuned to the rhythms of passion that it sweeps one up 
			in blissful reverie, and marks yet another triumph for one of 
			cinema’s most dynamic directorial voices.</font></b></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Working once again with longtime 
			cinematographer Agnes Godard, Denis cradles the film’s lovers in a 
			velvety cloak of darkness punctuated by the glittering light cast 
			from Paris’ street lamps, apartment windows, and car headlights – 
			the city is a shadowy wonderland that provides endless possibilities 
			for both warmth and cold, cruelty and joy. Denis has always placed 
			primary emphasis on visual filmmaking over expository narrative 
			development, and, in <i>Friday Night</i>, she reaches a mesmerizing 
			apex of silent storytelling, allowing the camera’s movements and 
			Nelly Quettier’s editing to convey the characters’ innermost 
			thoughts and emotions. The opening shots of the Parisian landscape 
			show us the city moving from daylight to dusk to night, and an image 
			of the Eiffel Tower’s swirling searchlight seems to suggest a 
			plaintive call, an S.O.S. that the film’s protagonist subconsciously 
			wants to articulate.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Laure (French comedienne Valérie 
			Lemercier, in a superb performance of understated eloquence) is 
			moving out of her apartment and into her boyfriend’s place. Once her 
			former home has been vacated, she plans on having dinner with 
			friends, but her trip is delayed by a citywide public transport 
			strike that’s paralyzed traffic. Laure sits trapped in her car, as 
			isolated and confined in her compact vehicle as the throngs of 
			commuters she watches from behind her windshield. Like their lost 
			and miserable countenances suggest, Laure is alone, and she seeks 
			comfort in the warmth of her car’s heater, using it to dry her still 
			wet hair and envelop her in its soft, womb-like embrace. When a 
			passerby knocks on her window, she instinctively locks the door and 
			drives away, frightened by the attempted intrusion of an outsider 
			into her safe private sphere. She’s simultaneously desperate for and 
			wary of companionship, her eyes scanning the crowds of cars in a 
			feeble attempt at human connection, even as she shies away from 
			personal interaction.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The radio advises drivers to offer 
			rides to those people walking the streets and, with the shame of her 
			prior refusal weighing upon her, she opens her door to a confident, 
			striking gentleman named Jean (the smoldering Vincent Lindon). Upon 
			closing the door he remarks “It’s warm in here” and, shortly 
			thereafter, lights a cigarette, the wafts of smoke funneling out of 
			Jean’s nose and mouth and cascading over the clearly ecstatic 
			(reformed smoker) Laure – here, as throughout the film, heat and 
			Jean become synonymous with one another, two elemental forces 
			seeking to rejuvenate this delicate woman. A shot of Jean entering 
			the car, followed by Laure stretching her legs and then running her 
			hands through her hair silently reveals, in almost subliminal 
			fashion, the immediate attraction between the two, as Denis’ camera 
			sticks closely to its characters. The film, which contains virtually 
			no establishing, long, or two shots, crowds in on Laure and Jean in 
			extreme close-ups of their faces, their hands, and their craning 
			necks, striving to tell the story not as a disinterested outside 
			observer, but from the inside out.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Hopeful flights of the imagination 
			compel Laure to cancel her dinner plans, and the two engage in a 
			supple dance (or, one might say, game of hide and seek) around the 
			city streets: Laure, attempting to return to the car after making a 
			phone call, is unable to locate it or Jean; once she does, she’s 
			frightened by Jean’s aggressively fast driving (mirroring her own 
			fear of the accelerated pace of her feelings for him) and kicks him 
			out, only to find him later at a brasserie; the two wander onto the 
			streets, culminating in a revelatory kiss that leads to a sexual 
			tryst lasting into the wee hours of the morning. Denis, through 
			probing shots of casual physical movement – Jean’s hand on the back 
			of Laure’s neck, Laure sniffing her palm after she’s touched the 
			steering wheel Jean’s hands were on, their fingers gently grazing 
			one another while a girl pounds away on a pinball machine – gives 
			the escalating affair a voluptuous tactility. The film is 
			preoccupied with the sensory experience of the couple’s mysterious, 
			entrancing liaison.</font></p>
			<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Denis and co-screenwriter 
			Emmanuelle Bernheim (working from Bernheim’s novel of the same name) 
			sprinkle the film with small doses of devilish humor, such as a slow 
			panning shot of a condom machine that begins with the contraption’s 
			coin slot and ends with a button and the instruction: “Push all the 
			way in.”&nbsp; Given the director’s supreme command of the filmic medium, 
			however, it’s no surprise that her tale of adventurous amour – an 
			odyssey both frightening and thrilling – gracefully segues between 
			the serious, the impassioned, and the droll. <i>Friday Night</i> is 
			a magnificent example of film’s unmatched ability to express the 
			unspoken, and confirmation of Denis’ status as one of the medium’s 
			most exciting and virtuosa risk-takers. </font><b>
