            was no gladness when I was born.&quot; <i>Whale Rider</i> begins
            with tragedy. Noisy tragedy. A woman gives birth to two children,
            one stillborn. As her husband, Porourangi (Cliff Curtis), watches
            helplessly, she dies in the process, leaving him bereft, angry, and
            confronted by his own father, Koro (Rawiri Paratene), ready to blame
            the surviving child, a daughter, for the death of the male child.
            Porourangi storms off, leaving the baby to the care of his mother,
            Nanny Flowers (Vicky Haughton). Fortunately, she knows how to handle
            her husband in ways that even he doesn't imagine. <o:p>

            this happens in a couple of minutes, and the rest of the film takes
            place some eleven years later, when Pai (the astonishing Keisha
            Castle-Hughes) has grown into an inquisitive, courageous, and
            self-sufficient girl. She's living with her grandparents in a
            Whangara community on the eastern coast of New Zealand. Named for a
            demi-god ancestor, Paikea, who arrived in New Zealand on the back of
            a whale, Pai is not the first-born son who has the chance to be the
            next Whangara chieftain. According to tradition, no girl can even
            aspire to such a fate. Pai will prove that such thinking is
            hopelessly backwards, as she is, indeed and in spite of her
            self-doubts shaped by her grandfather's prejudice, the future
            chieftain.<o:p>

            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Based
            on the novel by Maori author Witi Ihimaera and adapted by director
            Niki Caro, <i>Whale Rider</i> is part saga and part fairy tale, part
            kids' adventure tale and part poignant coming-of-age story, part,
            part girl power drama and part adult life lesson. It's all these
            things, as well as a rousing good time -- with beautiful beachscapes
            and stunning whales a-swimming imagery by cinematographer Leon
            Narbey, and yet maintains an elegant, simple-seeming narrative
            structure. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Pai
            comes into her own by learning her lessons at school (she must write
            a speech about her ancestors) as well as learning the skills of a
            Maori warrior. In this she is the conventional good and gallant
            girl, but also something of a bad girl, in the sense that boys get
            to be bad as they seek their heroic fates. She undertakes her
            education on the sly, because Koro teaches the skills class -- for
            boys only. Still, she is gifted and eager, ensuring that it's only a
            matter of time before traditional expectations will be overturned. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            film works by developing relationships between characters -- which
            means between generations and between individuals, across cultures
            and over oceans of bad feelings. Porourangi returns from Europe,
            where he's been selling and showing his art, making a living off his
            translations of his traditional culture. (Koro passes predictable
            judgment: &quot;You call it work, but it's not work. It's
            souvenirs.&quot;) Perhaps out of his own resentment, Porourangi lets
            slip that he has a white, pregnant girlfriend. Furious, Koro cruelly
            turns his anger at the nearest, easiest, most vulnerable target,
            Pai, who overhears his pointless derision from the next room. The
            ensuing crisis involves a touching reunion between father and
            daughter, during which both parties assume her maturity beyond her
            years. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">&quot;I
            can't be what he wants,&quot; sighs Porourangi. &quot;Me
            neither,&quot; Pai astutely adds, huddled under a blanket her father
            has brought outside to soothe her chill as they look out on the sea.
            This conversation leads to a (quickly reversed) decision that Pai
            should return to Europe with her father, but it is more important
            for the frank and persistent respect it pays to Pai as a character,
            and to her childish intelligence and intuition more generally. She's
            not so much charismatic or adorable (though you might call her
            either), as she is resilient, exquisite, and worthy. During the
            scenes where she secretly studies the warriors' skills -- and begins
            to outstrip her boy peers, in fighting and swimming -- she surely
            makes a spirited and heartening figure. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">But
            while the film engenders enthusiasm for her mythic abilities and her
            imminent fate, it also makes her rather like an ordinary girl. And
            that's her great strength and significance. Pai is thoughtful and
            serious, but attuned to a kind of vibrant rhythm (imaged here in her
            affiliation with the whales, but also having to do with the sea, and
            more abstractly, life cycles, breathing, and blood flow) that kids
            tend to feel better than adults. Think of all the images of girls in
            U.S. pop movies -- so halter-topped, so perfectly coiffed and
            appointed, so self-consciously cute, so Mary-Kate-and-Ashleyed. Pai
            is none of that but much more. She is wholly engaging and elegant,
            on her own terms. <o:p>
