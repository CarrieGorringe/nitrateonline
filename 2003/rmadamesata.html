Instead the portrait Ainouz paints is so one-dimensional as to render Francisco nothing more than an enigmatic and only intermittently interesting lunatic with an extravagant penchant for sex and sequins.">

            </span>stands João Francisco dos Santos (Lázaro Ramos), a pimp,
            prostitute, thief, killer, homosexual, cross-dresser, and cabaret
            performer all rolled into one volatile package – even for someone
            living in Rio de Janeiro’s seedy Lapa district, where whores and
            artists can be found on virtually every trash-strewn street corner,
            his was quite a reputation. Mr. Ainouz’s film jumps full throttle
            into João Francisco’s life, beginning with his early days doing
            make-up for a cabaret singer and then hurtling through the ensuing
            decade, in which the charismatic Brazilian swindled unwitting
            lovers, avoided the law, and attempted to create a name for himself
            as a stage performer while living with his prostitute “wife”
            Laurita (Marcélia Cartaxo), her baby daughter, and his girlish
            homosexual partner-in-crime Taboo (Flávio Bauraqui). A man of
            innumerable contradictions – one minute a nurturing father figure,
            the next a raging maniac – João Francisco eventually wound up
            garnering the acclaim he had so desperately craved, finding fame
            with his most outrageous cabaret character of them all: Madame Sat</font></b><span style="color:black"><b><font face="Verdana" size="2">ã.</font></b><font face="Arial"><o:p>

            Madame </span>Sat<span style="color:black">ã, the persona that
            turned </span>João Francisco into a local legend? Ainouz’s film
            is completely uninterested in such details – the Sat<span style="color:black">ã</span>
            character appears only during the film’s final credits, after
            we’ve learned about the tumultuous, unconventional life that led
            to his/her creation. Shot through what looks like a layer of chic
            grime, the film has an enticingly decrepit visual scheme that
            complements its protagonist’s violent underworld flamboyance.
            Amidst the decaying apartments and squalid nightclubs is João
            Francisco, an imposing six-foot tiger of a man, glistening black
            skin and eyes lit by fire and fury. He was many people at once,
            alternating between petty crook, barroom brawler (using a
            high-kicking fighting style known as “capoeira”), and devoted
            paternal figure – at one point, he and Laurita, dressed in their
            Sunday best, take her daughter for a peaceful stroll along the water
            in a wishful attempt at domestic normalcy – with the explosiveness
            of a man not fully in control of his life.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">As the film portrays him, João
            Francisco’s schizophrenic personality was caused by a collision
            between his dreams – of stardom, of quiet family life – and his
            reality as a cross-dressing homosexual spurned by Brazilian society,
            and newcomer Lázaro Ramos brings him to life with an intimidating
            ferociousness. Yet writer/director Ainouz paints a disappointingly
            one-dimensional portrait of this outlandish madman, choosing to
            focus on his love affairs and crimes, as well as the lively locale
            he called home, without ever convincing us that we should respect or
            empathize with such a self-destructive psychotic. There’s little
            doubt that João Francisco’s grandiosity eventually made him some
            sort of icon, but <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">Madame Sat<span style="color:black">ã</span></i><span style="color:
black"> is primarily concerned with his numerous homosexual affairs and bloody
            scuffles, both of which seem fueled by a mysterious inner rage he
            couldn’t subdue. The camera lingers longingly on Ramos’ sweaty
            torso and sculpted jaw during these fierce episodes, as if this
            close proximity will reveal the essence of this untamed firebrand.
            What’s ultimately exposed, however, is the film’s inability to
            move past its frank depiction of homosexual intimacy toward an
            insightful revelation about its subject. <o:p>

            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="color:black">One gets
            the impression that Ainouz sees </span>João Francisco – who
            endured prison stints both small (a few months) and large (ten
            years) – as a passionate counterculture artist determined to
            destroy established prejudices and long-held notions of propriety.
            The problem with such a viewpoint is that the film never convinces
            us that João Francisco was anything more than an incendiary
            troublemaker with a gift for over-the-top song-and-dance routines
            – the unimpressive performance he idolizes, and his subsequent
            routines portraying a panoply of wicked characters, all revolve
            around the familiar tale of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Arabian Nights</i>. Many may find João Francisco a spiritual (if
            not direct) ancestor of cross-dressing stars such as Divine and
            RuPaul. But the thinly-sketched man at the center of <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Madame
            Sat<span style="color:black">ã</span></i><span style="color:black">
