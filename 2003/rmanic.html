            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by 
			<a href="../elias.html" target="_top">Elias Savada</a>,
            16 May 2003</i></font><p class="MsoNormal"><b>
			<font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Manic</i>, the first feature from 
			director Jordan Melamed, pertains to be a candid emulation of mental 
			illness among today's high school crowd. This &quot;truthful&quot; docudrama, 
			captured through the agitated lens of director of photography Nick 
			Hay, is an often frantic study in digital video-camerawork as 
			mounted on an earthquake fault. This aggressive visual styling 
			offers the audience a silent observer, as a crazed fly-on-the-wall. 
			All the better to envelop the viewer in this claustrophobic, 
			emotional roller coaster the rides along the virtual rails in a 
			juvenile mental institution. The camera's&nbsp; subjective approach 
			closely resembles, and reflects, the character of David Monroe, a 
			staff psychologist who desperately wants to break through the 
			mixed-up minds under his surveillance. As played by Don Cheadle, the 
			character can be just a fragile as his patients, bearing up just so 
			much under the barrage of physical and mental abuse the boys and 
			girls shovel on one another.</font></b></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Melamed's 
			cinematic vision of the story by debuting screenwriters Michael 
			Bacall (who also has a featured role) and Blayne Weaver is strictly 
			a straight-forward, in-your-face variety. It imitates the 
			Danish-born <i>Dogme</i> style (hand-held camera, no artificial 
			sound flavorings, no post-production), without being chained to that 
			dictum. The cast is shot mostly in close up or medium shots, with 
			the camera movement offering its own manic interpretation of their 
			ongoing group therapy. There are moments of inter-cutting to fill in 
			some back story, but aside from one out-of-the box edit -- where 
			Doctor Dave sits opposite himself during a probation Q+A, admitting 
			to an exasperating self-frustration with himself -- Melamed relies 
			on his young ensemble to carry the film's weight, emotionally 
			textured by the washed-out color scheme. There's not a blue sky in 
			sight.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><i>Manic</i> 
			relates the stories of a half dozen teenagers who find themselves 
			incarcerated under Dr. Monroe's care, all seeking counsel for a 
			collection of mental anxieties. The bookend character that begins 
			and ends the film is Lyle Jansen, a rage-filled seventeen-year-old 
			who took the fun out of a baseball game when he pummeled a player on 
			the other team, requiring a bat-size dose of anger management in 
			exchange for the fifty-two stitches and broken jaw he inflicted. 
			Joseph Gordon-Levitt, quite a stone's throw off his multi-year stint 
			on television's <i>Third Rock from the Sun</i>, puts on a stoic, 
			stone-faced block of anger as a self- and other destructive 
			man-child, anxious for help, but a too-easy target for the brutish 
			prodding of Michael (Elden Henson), the quintessential bully. Lyle's 
			roommate Kenny (Cody Lightning) is an introverted thirteen-year-old 
			who obviously has painful family issues (wandering hands landed him 
			in his current home) that his caretaker has not properly diagnosed. 
			His only companion before slightly opening up to Lyle is his 
			closely-gripped Native American medicine pouch, a Macguffin that 
			proves, temporarily, more potent for Lyle. Chad (Michael Bacall), a 
			bipolar, shaggy-haired, (possibly) rich kid, rounds out the men's 
			side.</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the ladies' 
			corner are Sara (Sara Rivas), armored in abusive black makeup, but 
			hoping for some cleansing (spiritual and, hopefully, epidermal) and 
			freedom, and Tracey, a silent, fragile beauty wounded by rape and 
			poignantly sketched by Zooey Deschanel (<i>All the Real Girls</i>), 
			daughter of noted cinematographer Caleb Deschanel, who has obviously 
			had a strong impact on her thespian coloring. Tracey's nocturnal, 
			nightmarish screams bring a sympathetic notice from Lyle, a 
			relationship that develops and appears to soothe both their troubled
			</font></p>
			<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Does this work? 
			Well, it's not <i>Boy, Interrupted</i>, but it is nearly as 
			sobering. Melamed's work is an interesting exercise, an exhausting 
			100-minute journey into the darker side of life. We're not talking 
			great filmmaking, but a promising, even admirable first feature, 
			even if I felt at times that this reminded me more of someone's 
			doctoral thesis in a dual major in psychology and filmmaking. <i>
			Manic</i>'s landscape is filled with emotional thunderstorms; don't 
			expect a sunny sky, but you might find a ray of hope.</font></p>
