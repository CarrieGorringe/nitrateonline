            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Peter Farrelly and Bobby
            Farrelly, the minds (if you could call them that) behind <i>Kingpin</i>
            and <i>There's Something About Mary</i>, have generated dozens of
            guilt-inducing laughs by demonstrating that there really are new
            worlds to conquer with bodily function humor. Nonetheless, what
            sometimes sets these two apart from their gross out peers is that
            their movies can involve the brain and touch the heart during breaks
            between embarrassing discharges.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The sibling filmmakers have been
            gradually trying to emphasize these two organs in their more recent
            films like <i>Shallow Hal</i>, and make further steps with their
            long-awaited dream project <i>Stuck on You</i>. The idea of building
            a comedy about conjoined twins sounds potentially derisive, but the
            Farrelly Brothers wisely counterbalance their incorrigible need to
            jolt with a genuine affection for their protagonists.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">True, they manage to milk a few
            laughs merely by inseparably pairing Matt Damon and Greg Kinnear.
            The two actors amusingly bear no family resemblance to speak of
            (other than the fact that they're both Caucasian), and somehow
            they're rather convincing as life mates. Maybe it's because the only
            thing the two characters seem to share is a liver and each other's
            personal space.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The two conjoined New Englanders
            function seamlessly at work (as short order cooks whose output
            exceeds the entire McDonald's chain) and play (just try to get a
            hockey puck past these guys). Walt Tenor (Kinnear) is the more
            outgoing of the pair and has an easy way with women, even with the
            introverted Bob lying on one side of the bed. Bob, instead,
            corresponds with a friendly Chinese immigrant named May (Wen Yann
            Shih) through the Web, without telling her that he and Walt are more
            than close.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While their life in Martha's
            Vineyard is happy, Walt wants to quit flipping burgers and act in
            something other than Community Theater. The two head to LA, where
            Bob finally gets to meet May (amusingly able to hide his seemingly
            obvious connection to his brother), while Walt, through a bizarre <i>Producers</i>-esque
            quirk lands on a popular TV show with Cher, creatively playing a
            character who isn't a conjoined twin.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To their credit the Farrellys
            manage to milk a lot more from their single-joke setup than a few
            cheap guffaws. Kinnear and Damon manage to do several nifty
            coordinated tricks (they do more than merely turn hamburger
            patties). Most of these are done in long, wide takes. This means the
            two probably had to work a long time to get the stunts right because
            these sequences are harder to pull off if the camera doesn't pull
            away before the payoff.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The twins might be painted with a
            stereotypical brush, but thankfully so are all the other characters
            in film. John Casavettes veteran Seymour Cassel is a riot as a half
            senile agent who can't quite get the hang of representing a client
            in the Internet age. He advises Walt to keep his secret in the
            closet (the same advice he gave to Rock Hudson). More importantly,
            though, the filmmakers seem to have a genuine affection for their
            protagonists, and at times, <i>Stuck on You</i> becomes almost
            heartbreaking whenever fate is cruel to the Tenor brothers. Damon
            and Kinnear wisely play the roles straight so that the world, not
            the conjoined twins, seems crazy.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In fact, the entertainment industry
            gets ridiculed far more than Bob and Walt. Cher deserves special
            credit for lampooning her diva image and for not letting pride get
            in the way of some amusingly biting satire. Had she tried to make
            herself seem less self-absorbed or caustic, her scenes wouldn't
            work. It should be noted that she's not the only major actress who
            gets to make a funny cameo.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Farrelly Brothers are also
            demonstrating a surprisingly subtlety that nicely counterbalances
            their outrageousness. One of the biggest laughs comes when Bob
            off-handedly manages to correctly pronounce May's hometown in the
            old country.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At times, one begins to miss some
            of the Farrellys' earlier gross out sequences, and the dénouement
            seems a bit pokey. Fortunately, the two atone for these deficiencies
            with a closing musical number that's wonderfully silly. Let's just
            say that some films really don't lend themselves to show tunes.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It might have been interesting to
            see how the film would have worked out if the Farrellys had been
            able to pair up Jim Carrey and Woody Allen as they had originally
            planned. The film may be better because it doesn't fit their
            original design. Similarly, some audiences might yearn for the
            bodily function gags of the previous Farrelly movies (<i>Stuck on
            You</i> has a PG-13 rating), but others may appreciate the fact that
            these guys can elicit laughs from something other than what could
            euphemistically be called hair gel.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"></o:p>
