            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan
            Lybarger</a>, 7 November 2003</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Screenwriter Richard Curtis has
            given Hugh Grant some of his best roles in flicks like <i>Four
            Weddings and a Funeral</i>, <i>Notting Hill</i> and <i>Bridget
            Jones's Diary</i>, but these movies also featured some juicy
            supporting turns from performers like Rowan Atkinson, Kristen
            Scott-Thomas and Rhys Ifans, whose screen time seemed unduly short.
            At times a viewer wondered if Curtis had spent as much time fine
            tuning the minor characters as he had the principals.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Love
            Actually</i>, Curtis, making his directorial debut, declines to
            center the film around anyone, and the results are generally
            satisfying. There’s a gushy, syrupy romanticism that runs
            throughout the film, but Curtis manages to temper it with sharp
            dialog and abundant laughter.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The film gets off to a rather
            inauspicious start as Hugh Grant drones in a long pointless
            voiceover that accompanies shots of people hugging at the airport.
            Fortunately, the rest of this look at love and rejection over the
            Christmas holiday quickly kicks into gear when we spot a recording
            session where the long burned-out British pop star Billy Mack (Bill
            Nighy) is trying to revive his career with a Yuletide reworking of "Love
            Is All Around."</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Billy clearly hates the gig and
            resents the fact that his jingle is in competition with a boy
            band’s carol for a national prize. Curiously, his obnoxious,
            indifferent behavior during interviews actually makes the tune more
            popular, aggravating Billy’s malaise.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">While all that is going on the
            UK’s new Prime Minister (Hugh Grant) is the only bachelor to take
            the office in some time and has trouble focusing on a meeting with
            the American President (you’ll love who Curtis elected for the
            Oval Office) because he’s beginning to fancy a young, somewhat
            insecure staffer (Martine McCutcheon).</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Meanwhile, his sister Karen (Emma
            Thompson) is beginning to think her husband (Alan Rickman) has been
            straying with a flirtatious employee at his office. One of his
            coworkers Sarah (Laura Linney) is finally getting the nerve to
            pursue a fellow employee who has her pining, and Karen’s
            recently-widowed friend Daniel (Liam Neeson) tries to guide his
            12-year-old son through his first big crush. There’s also a
            subplot involving a cuckolded writer (Colin Firth) and his simmering
            crush he develops on his Portuguese housekeeper (Lucia Moniz) even
            though neither speaks the other’s language.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The omnipresent Kiera Knightley
            (and that’s a problem because?) even shows up as a bride whose
            husband’s pal Mark (Andrew Lincoln) seems to have a fondness for
            either her or her betrothed (Chiwetel Ejiofor, <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Dirty
            Pretty Things</i>). There’s even a sweet young couple who meet
            over innocent conversation, while filming a porno.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This is actually a partial listing
            of the plots and plotlets that run throughout <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Love
            Actually</i>. Towards the end this does get to be a bit of a problem
            because some of the stories end up abruptly resolved or not at all.
            Right when one situation becomes intriguing Curtis develops
            Attention Deficit Disorder and shifts focus.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Fortunately, the cast and Curits’
            eye for absurdly comic situations wins out. Grant’s droll
            delivery, as usual, is a perfect vehicle for Curtis’ wisecracks.
            The standout of the bunch is Nighy, whose bitterness gives the film
            a bite it desperately needs. There’s something oddly appealing
            about the way Billy Mack is so unrepentant about his sordid life ("Don’t
            buy drugs. Become a pop star, and they’ll give them to you for
            free"). It’s a nice counter-balance to the rest of the film.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Curtis used to write for the
            wonderfully cynical British TV shows <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Blackadder</i>
            and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Mr. Bean</i> (Atkinson has
            an amusing cameo here), so it’s nice to see that his recent
            specialization in romance hasn’t completely wiped the scowl off
            his face.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"></o:p>
