            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by <a href="../gregory.html" target="_top">Gregory

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Right now, let's all go out to the
            drive-in.</b></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The first motion picture I can
            recall going out to see was a double-bill at a Norfolk, Virginia
            drive-in. The main feature was <i>A Hard Day's Night</i>. My sister
            was one of the original Beatlemaniacs -- she had all the L.P.'s,
            45's, and a pair of go-go boots, and we watched the band's first
            television appearance on the &quot;Ed Sullivan Show&quot; -- so we
            simply HAD to go. They showed the Beatles' film last; the second
            feature, which was shown first, was what I thought for years to have
            been <i>The Fall of the Roman Empire</i>. My parents kept joking
            that the movie should have been called <i>My Son, the Emperor</i>,
            which could, in a stretch, pretty much fit as a description of the
            plot for the Samuel Bronston epic. All that I could remember was
            that it was in color, had Romanesque columns in it, and the people
            who looked like they could be ancient Romans. It wasn't until the
            1990s that I found out what I thought had been <i>The Fall of the
            Roman Empire</i> was actually <i>My Son, the Hero</i>, a French and
            Italian-made sword-and-sandal drama which had been somewhat
            comically -- and possibly deliberately so -- dubbed into English.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Since we moved around a lot when I
            was a kid (my father being an active Naval officer), being inside a
            car was a very familiar experience. Why not watch a movie there? You
            drive up to the ticket booth, pay your price, and then made a
            contained dash to park in a good spot where you can see the screen.
            You also hope to get a good speaker, if the drive-in is not
            broadcasting the sound on an airwave band that you can pick up on
            your car radio. Then, especially if it's summer, you wait for that
            precipitous moment when the sun will have gone down just enough so
            that it's dark enough to start watching the show....</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Gedunks in hand, you launch into
            the first feature. If the kids get to be too much, you can send them
            on down to play on the swing-sets in front of the screen, where they
            hopefully won't get eaten-up by bugs. When the first feature ends,
            you need to reload on supplies. Ah, watery Coke, or how 'bout a
            pizza? Tim Hansen slept through a showing of <i>Humanoids from the
            Deep</i>, but, before the second feature, <i>Rabid</i>, began, we
            decided to be adventurous and bought a pizza at the concession
            stand. I have never tasted anything like it, before or since. Some
            of the oddest intermission trailers I've seen were at a drive-in in
            Idaho Falls -- they had been made a good twenty years prior, but
            looked just like new, including the one where a couple of parents
            with two offspring appeared, with their heads punched through white,
            canvas-like paper, to exhort us to<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>buy some ice cream on a stick: four disembodied heads, with a
            disembodied hand holding ice cream. It was like something you'd see
            on L.S.D. But, good grief, who's complaining? Especially if you're
            seeing the movie in a two-seat import convertible with the top down.
            By the time the second feature has started, you're having a true and
            unique experience in moviegoing under a canopy of stars....</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The new &quot;Drive-In Disc&quot;
            is the third in a series, put together by the National Film Museum
            and Elite Entertainment, that uses DVD technology to recreate the
            experience of seeing a drive-in double feature. (And there are two
            audio tracks to choose from, the first with regular sound, the
            second done in &quot;Distorto&quot;, which enables you to hear the
            movie just as it would sound coming out of an old-style drive-in
            speaker which you hung on your car window.) The two feature films on
            the DVD are accompanied by vintage advertisements, trailers
            announcing everything from holiday fireworks displays to special
            movie passes, and short subjects. That the two feature films on the
            disc are scare pictures is not unusual. Scare films seem to be
            particularly conducive to the drive-in experience, whether it's <i>Baron
            Blood</i> or the sublime <i>The Abominable Dr. Phibes</i>, or <i>The
            Giant Spider Invasion</i>, where, in one scene, a group of people
            are chased down a street by a Volkswagen done over to look like a
            giant spider. The fondness of seeing these films at southern Oregon
            drive-ins stands in contrast to when I was attending school in Utah,
            where drive-ins were places where you snuck off to see pictures like
            <i>Maniac</i>, William Lustig and Joe Spinell's sensitive art film,
            on a double-bill with <i>The Toolbox Murders</i>.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Pulling down the blinds and turning
            off the lights (what? you're going to see a drive-in program, even
            if it's on DVD, with the lights ON?), one settles in and, after a
            few advertisements, including one for Toddy, a canned chocolate
            malted drink good hot or cold (?!), and a wicky-wacky preview
            trailer for <i>Blood Creature</i> (a panther-man movie made in the
            Philippines and originally titled &quot;Terror is a Man&quot;), we
            see the first of two wonderful &quot;Gumby&quot; cartoons (another
            will precede the second feature). I haven't seen these for years --
            and years and years -- and I'd forgotten the simple charm and appeal
            that Art Clokey's clay and stop-motion animation work had. (Also,
            the deep sense of benevolence behind the work.) The first feature, <i>I
            Bury the Living</i> (1958), I'm already familiar with, but it is
            still one of the most unusually creepy films I've ever seen. Richard
            Boone, in a very good performance, plays a man who reluctantly
            agrees to act as volunteer chairman of the committee that oversees
            the local cemetery. A map in the cemetery caretaker's office
            displays white pins, for those plots not yet occupied, and black
            pins, for those that are. Boone's character accidentally puts in a
            pair of black pins instead of white ones, and the persons for whom
            the cemetery plots were intended suddenly drop dead. He then becomes
            increasingly rattled as he tries to determine whether he has some
            sort of heretofore unknown power over life and death. Plus, what
            would happen if you took some of the black pins already in the map
            out and replaced them with white pins.... Along with Boone's
            performance, the picture benefits greatly from having visuals
            created by the great montage artist Slavko Vorkapich, who devised
            subtly sinister imagery to accompany the sometimes terrifying music
            score by Gerald Fried.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's intermission -- phew! time to
            crawl out from under your seat and return to some state of normalcy
            -- and, of course, gedunks are low. Should I get some of that drink
            announced in the advert for Dutch Treete, ANOTHER canned chocolate
            beverage that's good served hot or cold? (How do you heat it up? Put
            it in the stove?) Huston's Hallucinations is coming to town, in
            which, on-stage, after showing us a &quot;girl without a
            middle&quot; and the &quot;weird and unusual burning of a
            she-devil&quot; (&quot;Actual MURDER!&quot; screams an on-screen
            caption), we'll get to see, ooh, la, la,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
            </span>&quot;the talked about girl in the Topless Swimsuit!&quot;
            (Presumably, Rudi Gernreich's design creation which, in 1964, used
            the &quot;body itself&quot; as &quot;an integral part of a suited
            design&quot;.) There's a trailer that warns us about the perils of
            Pay T.V. -- &quot;Pay T.V. and cable T.V. companies are seeking the
            right to charge you for the very programs you now get free&quot;, at
            a time when you could still get 99.9% of your television programming
            using a rooftop antennae; then a preview trailer for <i>Creature
            from the Haunted Sea</i> -- a picture made, for about $1.98, by
            Roger Corman at the same time that he made <i>The Little Shop of
            Horrors</i>. <i>Little Shop..</i>., even with all its budgetary
            restrictions, was one of those instances where everything clicked
            and it turned out to be one of the best black comedies ever made.
            &quot;Creature...&quot;, if I recall correctly, was like sitting in
            cement while it hardened. But the preview trailer looks great.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The second feature, the 1960 film <i>The
            Hand</i>, I am not previously familiar with. (I did see Oliver
            Stone's 1981 film <i>The Hand</i>, with Michael Caine, and lived to
            tell the tale. As someone noted at the time, the disembodied hand in
            that film crawled all over the place but never did anything
            &quot;fun&quot;, i.e. slither up women's legs or tap sneakily on car
            windows, but, then again, there was this whole
            reality-versus-fantasy thing going on in Stone's film, which proved
            dizzying.) The 1960 <i>The Hand</i> starts out showing three British
            Army men who are taken prisoner by the Japanese at the end of World
            War Two, and are tortured by having their hands cut off. However,
            not content to make a movie about what happens to the three men when
            the story jumps ahead fourteen years to &quot;present-day&quot;
            London, the filmmakers throw in a murder, an amputation, a suicide,
            another murder, a mysterious man who goes by the name of
            &quot;Roberts&quot;, an ambush, a severed hand in a box -- and then
            doesn't explain any of it. (And take my word for it: I looked at
            this picture twice.) Not a particularly unpleasant experience in
            this instance, but it amounts to a bit more than Raymond Chandler
            failing to explain who killed the chauffeur in <i>The Big Sleep</i>.
            And people in this movie, or, rather, the police, smoke: a lot. When
            they're not fumbling with unlit cigarettes or fingering lit ones,
            they're lighting each other up. It's so pervasive that, after a
            while, I was wondering if there was some sort of coded behavior
            going on, like the business with the walking stick in <i>Gilda</i>.
            (The law is represented by actors Ronald Leigh-Hunt, who's first
            line in the movie is, &quot;Blast everybody and everything!&quot;,
            and Ray Cooney, who has the fresh-faced appeal of youth and also
            co-wrote the screenplay.) And there's an attempted kidnapping near
            the end of the film: &quot;Mummy? The telly's gone wrong,
            again!&quot; says a little imp who runs into a room and is then
            snatched up by a malefactor wielding a gun, and who then goes out a
            back door with the hostage. Not for long: the tyke comes right back,
            saying, &quot;Mummy? I got away!&quot; (See? Movie-making is
            simple.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At this point, it's time for all
            good chickens to go home and roost. We are reminded to take the
            sound speaker out of our car window, or at least to turn the speaker
            in on the way out if we yank it loose. This has never happened to me
            -- the only problem I ever encountered was parking next to a speaker
            that turned out to be useless, but was, worse, at a good spot to
            park in.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In southern Oregon, the Valley was
            the first one to go, then the Lithia, the land redeveloped so that
            it is impossible to determine where either drive-in once stood. The
            Starlite was to have been reopened, but while the sign still stands,
            the grounds are untended and gradually being reclaimed by nature. So
            I was pleased to learn, from the information included with the new
            &quot;Drive-In Disc&quot;, about the community effort to
            successfully re-open Hull's Drive-In theater, which was on the verge
            of closing permanently after some fifty years of operation. The
            drive-in is now community-owned and run on a non-profit basis, and
            is located outside of Lexington, Virginia, 165 miles northwest of
            Norfolk.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"></o:p>
