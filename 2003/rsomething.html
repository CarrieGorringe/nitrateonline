            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Someday,
            Amanda Peet will find a great role in a great film. Until then,
            she's showing her diverse talents in a string of imperfect films,
            from formula comedy (<i>The Whole Nine Yards</i> and <i>Saving
            Silverman</i>) to quirky independent drama (<i>Igby Goes Down</i>)
            to headcase thriller (<i>Identity</i>), and now, a &quot;romantic
            comedy for adults,&quot; <i>Something's Gotta Give</i>. While each
            performance is its own little surprise, Peet's work as Marin,
            supporting player for her mother's romance, is especially sharp. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Unfortunately,
            what happens around her is wholly predictable, sometimes obnoxiously
            so. This despite promotional blurbs that suggest the
            &quot;adult&quot; concept makes <i>Something's Gotta Give</i>
            something new. Marin jumpstarts the proceedings. An auctioneer at
            Christie's, she begins dating a customer, superwealthy record label
            executive and renowned young ladies' man, Harry (Jack Nicholson).
            When she brings him to her family's Hamptons beach house, they run
            into obstacles. First, her mother, playwright Erica (Diane Keaton),
            and aunt Zoe (Frances McDormand), note his unsuitability as Marin's
            partner. And second, after a dinner punctuated by Columbia women's
            studies professor Zoe's zingy treatise on sexism in romance, Harry
            suffers a mid-woo heart attack. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
            latter event achieves three important ends: 1) no sex between Marin
            and Harry (so his ensuing tryst with her mother won't seem so yucky,
            even though it still is fairly yucky); 2) 63-year-old Harry's
            self-evaluation; and 3) Erica's assignment to nursing duties, as the
            patient can't be moved back to the city. Their evolving
            age-appropriate relationship reveals to Erica the real life
            (so-called) pain of the love she writes about in her plays. It also
            introduces Harry to the heretofore foreign concepts of commitment,
            maturity, and equality, not to mention jealousy, as Erica is
            simultaneously courted by his own doctor, Julian (Keanu Reeves).
            That Harry finds these concepts so strange is supposed to make him
            seem naïve and desirable; but he's also a creep, waiting to be
            rehabilitated by a &quot;good woman.&quot; Sigh. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">While
            the formulaic romance is surely burdened by its predictability, it
            is also buoyed by Keaton and Nicholson's frankly delightful
            performances. Even the goopy stuff (heavy-handed jokes about his
            blood pressure, her weeping bouts when he inevitably acts out badly)
            is mostly tolerable as handled by these light-touch pros. Likely,
            the heaped-on kudos for these performances -- Keaton has already won
            the National Board of Review's Award for Best Actress -- will drown
            out any concerns about the movie's internal depreciation. That is,
            much like other narratives of this sort, once the sparring partners
            get together, it has little to say. &quot;Oh my god,&quot; Erica
            sighs post-coitally, &quot;I do like sex.&quot; Harry adds,
            punchline-like, &quot;You certainly do.&quot; Or again, he stumbles
            over confessing that he might have thought of her as a &quot;soul
            mate,&quot; and she, knowing everything she knows about him,
            believes he might mean it.</font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Erica
            and Harry's sparring is assisted by a script that grants all players
            scant bits of witty dialogue and/or aching insights (all players
            save Keanu, who turns in a decent performance, despite his
            character's necessary lifelessness -- you need to want Erica to like
            Harry instead of this pretty boy). Marin marvels at Harry's
            &quot;genius&quot; when she tries to break up with him and he turns
            it into dumping her; Erica deprecates Harry's corny self-image (he
            likes to &quot;travel light&quot;), then finds herself stuck in a
            situation befitting a Kaufman and Hart character; and Harry faces a
            daunting metaphor for his recovered sexual potency -- according to
            Julian, he must be able to climb a nicely sun-bleached wooden
            staircase on the beach that looms before him, as if to the sky. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">With
            so much obviously riding on the stars and their star turns, it's
            perhaps surprising that the smaller bits, by supporting players, are
            so outstanding. These include Rachel Ticotin's no-nonsense
            performance as Harry's Manhattan ER doctor (whom he sees a few
            times, and she looks increasingly bored by his bad behavior each
            visit), and Paul Michael Glaser's two or three minutes as Erica's
            director and ex-husband. He's also Marin's father, and inspires her
            most elaborately emotional and yet self-conscious moments, when she
            learns of his impending remarriage, to a woman only two years her
            senior. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Startled
            and somewhat scared by what her blubbery reaction suggests about her
            daddy issues, her own initial attraction to Harry, and her lack of
            poise and strength as compared to Erica, Marin cries, rages,
            self-reflects, and pulls herself together, nearly simultaneously.
            This brief scene, acted with and for Erica, reveals again Peet's
            range, delicacy, and indeed, her Keaton-like brilliance. &quot;You
            see that look on your face,&quot; Marin declares, weirdly triumphant
            when her mother tries to calm her, &quot;That's the gene I didn't
            get!&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></span></p>
            <p><span style="mso-fareast-font-family:&quot;MS Mincho&quot;"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Unfortunately,
            when Marin calls out Erica for being too in control, the movie takes
            her at her word -- allowing Erica to go on and on with her crying
            and her self-berating in subsequent scenes. These extend the running
            time over several potential endings, which is to say, it goes on and
            on as well. Romantic comedies are all about delivering to
            expectations: no surprises. At the same time, they work best with
            taut structure and spare explications of motive: you get in and out
            quickly, without feeling fatigued by the inescapable fact that you
            know exactly what's going to happen. <i>Something's Gotta Give</i>
            overstays its welcome, yes, but worse, it pretends like it's news
            when it isn't. <o:p>
