			cycle </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700">
			<font size="2">Justin Lin's <i>Better Luck Tomorrow</i> comes 
			packing an enthusiastic MTV ad campaign and loads of hype. This last 
			is mostly a function of Roger Ebert's loud defense of it at 
			Sundance, when one audience member suggested that it offered a 
			&quot;negative&quot; view of Asian Americans. Ebert declared that any film 
			should be able to be what it wants to be, and not worry about 
			community reputations or individual judgments. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Lin's film 
			wants to be a lot of things. It is about Asian American kids living 
			in Orange County and making plans for college. It's about violence 
			and excess, about the kind of search for identity that adolescents 
			perennially assume. It's glib sometimes, and it's a low budget 
			project. It's also a smart and engaging high school movie with more 
			on its mind than who's going to the prom. This much is made clear in 
			the opening scene: Ben (Parry Shen) and his buddy Virgil (Jason J. 
			Tobin) lie in an Orange County backyard, sunning themselves and 
			pondering early admissions (&quot;Ivy Leagues love it, gets 'em all 
			wet&quot;). The conversation is unexceptional, the shot looks down on 
			them from overhead, their faces shiny with sweat. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">And then, a 
			phone rings. &quot;Not mine,&quot; Virg says. Not Ben's either. They look at 
			one another, startled, as the camera takes other views -- first 
			through tree branches, on an angle, and then, ground-level, as 
			they're on their elbows and knees, squirming along the lawn until 
			they find the spot from which the muffled sound emanates. They dig. 
			They find it, buried with a hand, worms all over it. &quot;You never 
			forget the sight of a dead body,&quot; says Ben in voiceover. &quot;But then 
			again, I was experiencing a lot of things for the first time. I 
			guess it's just part of growing up.&quot; </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The camera 
			careens, time-lapsing through the neighborhood, pitched roofs, white 
			exteriors, fences dividing the properties. The frame stops on Ben, 
			in uniform, working the counter at a fast food joint, Employee of 
			the Month, the wall plaque says, every month. A white lady twists 
			her necklace, fretful over what to eat; Ben knows the calories and 
			fat grams in each item. So helpful, so polite. So nice. The lady 
			smiles. &quot;It's not as hard as it looks,&quot; he says in voiceover. All 
			you have to do is read the manual. What's important is that it goes 
			on his application, under &quot;extracurricular activities.&quot; Ben works 
			hard at getting to the next step, out of Orange County, Princeton 
			maybe. He practices his free throws for the basketball team, keeps 
			careful notes on his progress, volunteers down at the hospital 
			(where he translates Spanish between doctors and patients), and, in 
			order to get a perfect score on his next SATs, he learns vocabulary 
			words: &quot;They say if you repeat something enough times, it becomes 
			part of you.&quot;</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">&quot;Punctilious,&quot; 
			reads the screen under Ben as he lies in bed, reciting. &quot;Marked by 
			or concerned about precise exact accordance with the details of 
			codes or conventions.&quot; </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Ben is just 
			that, obsessed with doing it everything right, following procedure 
			and keeping his head down; it's the best way he's figured to survive 
			high school. He's a good kid, a &quot;model minority&quot; kid. He lusts just 
			a little after a cheerleader named Stephanie Vandergosh (Karin Anna 
			Cheung), but she's already taken, claimed by rich, slightly older 
			Steve (John Cho). When Ben sees that Steve's also &quot;boning some white 
			chick,&quot; he's almost driven to tell Stephanie, but no. Ben's too 
			honorable, too shy, and too enamored of her to break the news. 
			&quot;Girls like her,&quot; he sighs while the film freezes her face against a 
			block of lockers, &quot;Make you realize that life's not fair.&quot; </font>
			</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">To even things 
			up, perhaps, or because he's bored, or because it's so easy, Ben 
			cheats: &quot;It started with a pack of baseball cards and then it 
			snowballed. I guess it just felt good to do things that I couldn't 
			put on my college application.&quot; As long as these activities are 
			confined to scamming computer warehouses on returns of credit card 
			purchases or even selling cheat sheets to their average-student 
			classmates, Ben and his friends coast. &quot;It's easy as f*ck,&quot; says 
			Virgil's cousin, Daric (Roger Fan). Their straight As are their 
			&quot;passport to freedom&quot; -- as long as they keep up appearances, the 
			kids can stay out at &quot;study group&quot; until four a.m. &quot;The money was 
			really good,&quot; Ben admits. &quot;But I don't think that's what attracted 
			me the most.&quot; </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">They have good 
			reasons to want to stick it to the system. While Ben thinks (or 
			needs to think) he's on the basketball team because he wants to 
			play, he&nbsp; admits to Daric that he spends most games on the bench. 
			Daric sighs. Ben's a token: &quot;It's obvious that the only reason 
			you're on the team is for cosmetic reasons.&quot; It's true, adults are 
			also scamming, to meet requirements, to make their lives easier or 
			more exciting. The film underlines adult hypocrisy and lack of 
			attention by never showing a parent (and the only adult with lines 
			is a science teacher, played by Beaver Cleaver, also known as Jerry 
			Mathers). This isn't to say that Ben and his friends exactly miss 
			any &quot;supervision&quot; that might be offered by adults, but that the film 
			acknowledges, in its visual economy as well as its plotting, the way 
			they understand their lives, their restrictions, obligations, and 
			desires.</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Ben takes his 
			accumulating responsibilities seriously -- hamburgers and homework, 
			stealing and scamming. He observes the toll it's taking as he's 
			snorting coke, trying to stay awake. &quot;It's literally a fulltime job 
			to make people believe you're who you're meant to be.&quot; That Ben is 
			trying to figure out those expectations, how to resist or conform to 
			them, is <i>BLT</i>'s broadest, most conventional &quot;statement.&quot; But 
			in its details, its plot structured around an academic decathlon, 
			its concentrated colors and fisheye lenses, the film is invigorating 
			and vivid, anything but conventional.</font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The style goes 
			to show the kids' sense of pressure and opportunity. Ben's not the 
			only one who notices how hard it is to find himself. In one brief, 
			bracing scene, Steve practices batting (Mr. All American Sports), 
			the camera zooming in and out, then zip-circling him as he observes, 
			&quot;It's a never ending cycle. When you got everything you want, what's 
			left? You can't settle for being happy, that's a f*cking trap. You 
			gotta take life into your own hands, do whatever it takes to break 
			the cycle. That's what it is, breaking the cycle.&quot; That is what it 
			is, but, as <i>BLT</i> reveals, the cycle is designed to resist 
			breaking: even when you think you're out, you're in; if you're Ben, 
			overachieving and banging on the side, you're caught coming or 
			going. </font></span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">The kids' 
			escalating violence -- they beat down one adversary at a party, take 
			up guns at another point -- has generated some controversy (this was 
			one of the questions raised at Sundance). The movie insists that 
			such acting out is just more performance, a way to counter U.S. 
			media's Asian male stereotypes (polite and undesiring, 
			&quot;desexualized&quot; or &quot;feminized&quot;), but not so subversive as Ben and 
			Virgil first imagine it. More compellingly, the film offers insights 
			into intra-community class and gender dynamics -- Ben and Steve's 
			competition for Stephanie layers such tensions, neatly.&nbsp; </font>
			</span></p>
			<p><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">Still, and as 
			much as they consider her as a prize to be won, Stephanie, an 
			adopted child with her own background and identity questions, has 
			been making decisions all along. That she hasn't made right ones, 
			even for herself, makes her like the guys, but also not -- she has a 
			sense of what's at stake, before Ben does. &quot;You know how you make 
			decisions that lead to other decisions?&quot; she asks him. &quot;And then you 
			realize you don't remember why you made those decisions in the first 
			place?&quot; He nods, breathless. Stephanie, as she must, keeps 
			breathing. </font></span>
