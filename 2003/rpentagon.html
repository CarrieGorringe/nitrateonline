			<span style="font-family: Verdana; font-weight: 700"><font size="2">
			Dark streets, running feet, thriller music. The start of FX's <i>The 
			Pentagon Papers</i> sets up for intrigue and danger. As a crew of 
			shadowy men shuffle their way toward an office break-in, the screen 
			breaks up repeatedly, showing U.S. troops in Vietnam and bits of 
			typed-out text that layer onto each other so as to become quickly 
			unreadable: &quot;patriotism,&quot; &quot;Saigon,&quot; &quot;national security,&quot; &quot;ammo,&quot; 
			&quot;freedom,&quot; &quot;explosion,&quot; &quot;deceit,&quot; &quot;Vietnam.&quot;</font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">It's not surprising that &quot;Vietnam&quot; -- the soldiers, 
			rain, weapons and choppers -- is so instantly recognizable. It is 
			disappointing that so many particulars of &quot;Vietnam&quot; -- the nation 
			and people as well its looming presence in U.S. history -- are 
			forgotten. <i>The Pentagon Papers</i> recalls these particulars in a 
			specific framework, namely, by emphasizing the heroism of Daniel 
			Ellsberg (played by James Spader in a curly, mod-style wig), the 
			Harvard Law graduate and ex-Marine who leaked the Pentagon Papers in 
			1971. While the film doesn't neglect some of Ellsberg's vexing 
			traits (say, his self-righteousness), it clearly celebrates his most 
			courageous act.</font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">Ellsberg appears conventionally heroic in the film's 
			opening sequence, as one of the troops in country. Not to worry: <i>
			The Pentagon Papers</i> doesn't rewrite Dan Ellsberg as an action 
			hero, but uses his time as an increasingly distraught &quot;observer&quot; for 
			the Pentagon to accentuate the sense of horror that will, in time, 
			lead him to leak the Papers. Following this glimpse of Young Soldier 
			Dan, Ellsberg appears again, older, somber, and harshly shadowed, 
			filmed in black and white. He sits against a black background and 
			gazes directly into the camera, and describes what it feels like to 
			be caught in quicksand. &quot;It's too late and you can't escape,&quot; he 
			says. &quot;That's how we found ourselves in Vietnam.&quot; </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">This notable phrasing allows for at least two 
			readings: &quot;we found ourselves&quot; horribly trapped, and also, &quot;we found 
			ourselves&quot; in being so trapped. The latter would, of course, be 
			optimistic, implying that &quot;we&quot; learned something from the Vietnam 
			War and the release of the Pentagon Papers. The film makes this 
			lesson explicit when it ends with footage of the real Ellsberg, 
			interviewed by Walter Cronkite in 1971. He asserts, &quot;I think the 
			lesson is that the people of this country can't afford to let the 
			President run the country by himself, the foreign affairs any more 
			than domestic affairs, without the help of the Congress, without the 
			help of the public.&quot; </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><i><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">The Pentagon Papers</font></span></i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
			repeatedly underlines, at times subtly and others more plainly, the 
			responsibility of living in a democracy. Dan is its prime example -- 
			for what not to do as well as what to do. His initial efforts are 
			straightforward. Young Dan believes in the system, and as the film 
			has it, his initially unquestioning belief leads to disaster. He 
			puts it this way in voiceover: &quot;What I wanted most of all was to 
			serve my country, to be one of the President's Men.&quot; </font></span>
			</p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">Dan's dedication here provides a deceptively simple 
			timeline for the United States' descent into what George C. Herring 
			has called &quot;America's Longest War.&quot; He begins, in 1963, as an eager 
			young policy planner working for the Rand Corporation, under the 
			patient direction of Harry Rowen (Alan Arkin). Part of a group 
			running war games, Dan is keenly aggressive: &quot;Use risk, use threat, 
			use coercion,&quot; he pronounces. &quot;That's the peculiarity of 
			thermonuclear threats, they make cowards of virtually everyone.&quot; 
			When his game-mates, including Tony Russo (Paul Giamatti), look 
			skeptical, he pushes the point, quoting John Foster Dulles to make 
			his point that &quot;blackmail is good.&quot; </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">It's not long before Dan, so clever, moves on. After 
			writing a &quot;provocative&quot; paper entitled &quot;The Political Uses of 
			Madness&quot; (essentially arguing in favor of playing the &quot;mad bomber&quot; 
			to scare your enemies into retreating, much like Captain Kirk used 
			to do in <i>Star Trek</i>), Dan is hired away from Rand by the 
			Assistant Secretary of Defense, John McNaughton (Kenneth Welsh). Dan 
			is elated. His wife, Carol (Maria Del Mar), is not. Still, when she 
			informs him that she and their two children will not be coming with 
			him to DC (she's tired of feeling abandoned by her workaholic 
			husband), for half a minute, he protests: &quot;I can change.&quot; She knows 
			otherwise. </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">Next shot: Dan in his office in the Pentagon 
			basement. His voiceover declares that toiling all hours in this 
			cramped space is exactly what he's always wanted to do. He's slumped 
			on his desk, passed out, suggesting otherwise. As the film will go 
			on to show, he doesn't know the half of it: as he slumbers, hundreds 
			and thousands of kids, U.S. and Vietnamese, are, as the contemporary 
			cliché had it, being &quot;turned into cannon fodder.&quot; </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">It's only sixteen minutes into the film when Dan 
			becomes aware of the extent of his calamity: he notes that certain 
			numbers don't correspond with others. A lot of certain numbers. For 
			instance, the figures on DBs (dead bodies) supposedly counted in 
			Vietnam are spectacularly untrue, ranging widely from report to 
			report, obviously trumped up to make U.S. actions look successful or 
			enemy actions look fruitless. At first, Dan thinks he's spotted a 
			series of terrible errors (&quot;The inefficiency was crippling&quot;). But 
			the truth he must eventually realize (and come to believe, for 
			really, the extent of the lies is nearly unbelievable) is that the 
			mistakes are purposeful, both careless and considered, and often 
			malevolent. </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">Still, Dan wants to believe. So, when McNaughton 
			sends him to Vietnam on a &quot;fact-finding mission,&quot; he goes with a 
			sense of purpose and idealism. He ends up staying in Saigon, as well 
			as the Viet Cong-dominated Mekong Delta, for two years, imagining 
			each day that he will find explanations for the bad accounting, the 
			egregious failures of &quot;pacification&quot; efforts, the sickening loss of 
			life. (In real life, Ellsberg worked in Vietnam with 
			counterinsurgency experts Edward Lansdale and John Paul Vann.) His 
			doubts mount, but Ellsberg holds out hope for the Administration's 
			strategies, including the Vietnamization program (which sounds 
			suspiciously like the plan for Iraqi insurgents to beat back Saddam 
			Hussein's forces once the war there is underway, then maintain the 
			peace afterwards, so the U.S. can get out). </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">On his return to the States, Ellsberg frets, knowing 
			that &quot;our situation was dire and that we had to admit our mistakes 
			and change our strategy.&quot; He also knows this will never happen. He 
			gets hold of the Papers, and as he puts it, &quot;The experience of 
			reading those pages altered my anatomy.&quot; Despite this drama, 
			however, Dan doesn't act until after the 1969 Tet Offensive, which 
			reveals to many that the War was &quot;unwinnable.&quot; Once he devises a 
			theory for what's gone wrong, he tells to everyone who will listen 
			(as has the real Ellsberg, who has since gone on to become an 
			anti-nuclear activist, and more recently, a speaker against the Bush 
			Administration's Iraq policy). As Dan sees it, state leaders tend to 
			develop self-interested domestic politics (that is, reelection) and 
			to design foreign policies to uphold that agenda. </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">In the film, his ostensible introduction to U.S. 
			fallibility comes (rather ridiculously) in the form of the woman who 
			will become his second wife, an heiress named Patricia Marx (Claire 
			Forlani). On their first encounter at a DC party, she calls out his 
			faulty &quot;domino theory&quot; reasoning regarding The Communists and 
			Vietnam. He's intrigued but knows he's right. They meet again in 
			Saigon, where she's working as a radio reporter (and how lovely she 
			looks as she makes her way through grimy bars and daunting 
			streets!). Their affair is short-lived, however, as she leaves him 
			in a fury when he refuses to act on his knowledge that U.S. policy 
			in Vietnam is failing miserably. </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">And so, Patricia plays Ellsberg's conscience, a 
			tedious role at best. She comes equipped with a nameless &quot;boyfriend&quot; 
			who appears on occasion to suggest... well, who knows? That she's a 
			loose sort of '70s chick? That she's drawn against her will to the 
			stubborn Ellsberg? That he (or the film) needs an embodied emblem of 
			his awakening? Rich, beautiful, and apparently unbothered by regular 
			people's concerns, she swoops in and out of Dan's life when the 
			script calls for it. She's absent when he's dim-witted, returns when 
			he starts questioning his assumptions, leaves again when he won't 
			face the truth, then comes back again when he's stolen the Papers 
			and is cooking up a way to use them against the very government he's 
			been so zealously defending. </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">Eventually, Dan does deliver the Pentagon Papers to 
			the <i>New York Times</i>' Neil Sheehan (Jonas Chernick), determined 
			to &quot;get in the way of the bombing and the killing&quot; despite the risk 
			that he will be charged with treason. Some hell breaks loose. To be 
			accurate, the effect of the Papers' publication at the time was not 
			so immediate for the War, which went on for another four years. But 
			the fight waged against Ellsberg by the Nixon Administration was 
			momentous, for at least a couple of reasons. One, H.R. Haldeman 
			(James Downing) devised the infamous &quot;plumbers&quot; (to &quot;plug leaks&quot;) in 
			part to bring down Ellsberg (they are the burglars breaking into 
			Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office at film's beginning). Two, the 
			Supreme Court upheld the right of the free press to publish 
			documents that the government would repress. </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">The film grants this episode suitable weight and 
			screen time. Consisting of over 7,000 pages of top-secret documents, 
			the Papers traced policy, deceit, and cover-ups over twenty-three 
			years. That is, the Papers revealed the multifarious ways that five 
			administrations lied about what was going on in Vietnam, from Truman 
			and Eisenhower through Kennedy, Johnson, and Nixon. Ellsberg here 
			calls them &quot;a chronology of our damnation.&quot; </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">With the Papers as its center, the movie has a minor 
			dilemma, to make <i>reading</i> into a supercharged, life-changing 
			activity. It resorts to the usual montagey business: Dan goes to a 
			vaguely hallucinatory pot party, argues with his buddy Tony, is 
			videotaped by his buddy Tony (so the focus can turn strange), and 
			endures musical interludes where he looks out on the ocean, 
			pensively. These segments, so awkwardly calculated to make visible 
			his emotional and moral turmoil, are mercifully brief. Didn't anyone 
			making this movie notice that Spader is a strong and subtle 
			performer, and debilitating angst is his forte. He hardly needs such 
			clunky booster images to make the point. </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">Also adding to the drama are Dan's occasional bad 
			decisions (these aside from and after his gung-ho early period); for 
			instance, he gets his two barely teenaged kids to help with the 
			xeroxing of the Papers (understandably alarming the ex-wife). In 
			real life, his personal &quot;faults&quot; have been pointed out often enough: 
			not only has he suffered emotionally, he's also developed a 
			reputation as a difficult personality (noted in the film by Harry, 
			who calls him &quot;an obnoxious, egomaniacal pain in the ass&quot;). And he 
			has never managed a &quot;second act of much significance,&quot; as Michael 
			Kazin puts it in his review of Ellsberg's <i>Secrets: A Memoir of 
			Vietnam and the Pentagon Papers</i> (<i>Chicago Sun-Times</i>, 1 
			December 2001). </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">Recently, Tom Wells' <i>Wild Man: The Life and Times 
			of Daniel Ellsberg</i> (2001), endeavors to be the definitive 
			(unauthorized) biography, admiring his courage as a whistleblower, 
			as well as the pain he went through to do the right thing, but also 
			describing Ellsberg's sexual exploits, failed marriages, and strict 
			upbringing by Christian Scientist parents, not to mention his 
			mother's early conviction that he would become a great pianist.
			</font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">The film raises many of these issues (as when Dan 
			tells Patricia, &quot;Everybody always thought I was destined to do 
			something great with my life, to make a mark&quot;). But it doesn't dwell 
			on them. In <i>The Pentagon Papers</i>, written by Jason Horwitch (<i>Joe 
			and Max</i>) and directed by Rod Holcomb (<i>The Education of Max 
			Bickford</i>, <i>China Beach</i>), Ellsberg is mostly admirable and 
			his enemies are wholly odious, from the faceless Nixon to the creepy 
			John Mitchell (Sean McCann), Haldeman, and Erlichman (Richard 
			Fitzpatrick). Even Senator J. William Fulbright, who spoke against 
			the War for years before Ellsberg found his conscience and his 
			cause, is depicted here as unwilling to do anything &quot;illegal,&quot; the 
			very risk that Ellsberg will, ultimately and valiantly, take. </font>
			</span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">Though the film doesn't acknowledge specific sources 
			for its story, FX's website includes a selected bibliography (under 
			a &quot;Teaching Guide&quot;), which lists Wells' book, as well as <i>Secrets</i> 
			(2002), Neil Sheehan's <i>A Bright Shining Lie: John Paul Vann and 
			America in Vietnam</i> (1989), and McNamara's mea culpa, <i>In 
			Retrospect</i> (1996), as well as histories of the Vietnam War, like 
			David Halberstam's <i>The Best and the Brightest</i> (1972) and 
			Herring's seminal </font></span><i>
			<span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2">America's Longest 
			War: The United States and Vietnam, 1950-1975</font></span></i><span style="font-family: Verdana"><font size="2"> 
			(1986), and David Rudenstine's <i>The Day the Presses Stopped</i> 
			(1998), about the legal battles over the Pentagon Papers. These 
			sources range from celebratory to derogatory, and include much 
			surrounding material as well. </font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">Whatever criticisms can be made against Ellsberg's 
			motives, or even the means by which he exposed the decades of lies 
			told by the Pentagon, the Presidency, and members of Congress, the 
			fact is that he did it. That doesn't let him off long-term moral 
			hooks, and neither does the work by the Court and the press make 
			these institutions guiltless. But their work together in this 
			instance supports Ellsberg's recurring argument, which he made again 
			in an interview with Fred Branfman last year. The Constitution, he 
			asserts, has provisions to deal with wrongheaded policies toward 
			Vietnam and now, Iraq. The Constitution, he says, is written &quot;to 
			prevent any one man from making the decision on war and peace on his 
			own. Because that gives him the war power that makes him a king. A 
			king in foreign policy is close to what we've had in the past fifty 
			While the film doesn't neglect some of Ellsberg's vexing traits 
			(say, his self-righteousness), it clearly celebrates his most 
			courageous act.</font></span></p>
			<p class="MsoPlainText"><span style="font-family: Verdana">
			<font size="2">What we have now. As Herring noted in the <i>Los 
			Angeles Times</i> last October, &quot;The publication of Daniel Ellsberg'<b>s</b> 
			memoir, <i>Secrets</i>, at this particular moment is undoubtedly 
			coincidental, but there is an eerie timeliness about it. Rumors of 
			war abound, this time perhaps for a unilateral preemptive full-scale 
			attack unprecedented in American history.&quot; How awful that this 
			timeliness has become even more eerie, and more acute, with FX's 
			airing of <i>The Pentagon Papers</i>. Maybe this time, history will 
			read differently.</font></span></td>
