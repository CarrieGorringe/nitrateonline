            big screen <i>S.W.A.T.</i> begins with a cops-and-robbers
            conflagration designed to recall 1997's North Hollywood shootout.
            The scene's very familiarity -- as &quot;history&quot; and, even
            more emphatically, as assembly of actioner clichés (swooping
            cameras, fast cuts, slow motion glass shattering) -- allows it a
            certain shorthand in establishing the supremacy of S.W.A.T. Four
            ski-masked bank robbers (not two, as in the 1997 incident) are
            holding off an LAPD battalion with assault weapons that tear through
            black-and-whites and all available windows. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </b><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Enter
            the S.W.A.T. team. It hardly matters that they're mostly
            unrecognizable in their black helmets and Kevlar, though star Colin
            Ferrell, as Sergeant Jim Street, does stand out, even in his
            uniform. As they make their way inside the bank, it's clear enough
            these urban troopers are the film's designated fetish objects,
            emblems of righteous machismo. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">And
            then, the glitch. One team member, Street's partner Gamble (Jeremy
            Renner), is too gung-ho, disobeying orders and shooting a hostage
            despite Street's dissuasive efforts. Worse, he mouths off to the
            foolish and wholly disrespectable Captain Fuller (Larry Poindexter).
            So: Gamble's kicked off S.W.A.T. for playing cowboy and set up for
            the vengeance plot that will subsume the film's second half. At the
            same time, Street's introduced as the conflicted (if not exactly
            sensitive) hero, caught between fidelity and morality, ambition and
            team spirit. Though he's busted down to manning the gun cage,
            monitoring and maintaining weapons for the rest of the squad, Street
            hangs in, waiting for his chance, that is, the moment when Hondo
            (Samuel L. Jackson) comes looking to recruit a new and improved --
            or at least more visibly &quot;diverse&quot; -- S.W.A.T. squad.<o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">There
            are, in effect, two audience appeal strategies at work here. Most
            overtly, Clark Johnson's <i>S.W.A.T.</i> is a standard summer action
            movie, borrowing character names and the most basic of plot premises
            -- the elite team and fancy hardware framework -- from its '70s TV
            show source, but pledged to deliver seasonal explosions, car chases,
            and firepower. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Less
            explicitly, the film addresses (or at least admits) the lingering
            whiteness of the genre. In 2003, Hondo's team, assigned to restore
            S.W.A.T.'s image following the debacle of the hostage shooting and
            subsequent lawsuit, is multicultural, including white guys Street,
            T.J. (Josh Charles), and Boxer (Brian Van Holt), as well as tough
            single mom Chris Sanchez (Michelle Rodriguez) and super-abbed family
            man Deke (LL Cool J). The only potential team member Hondo rejects
            is a scrub-faced vegetarian (Johnson's old <i>Homicide: Life on the
            Streets</i> costar, Reed Diamond), deemed deficient because he eats
            soy hotdogs and has not one complaint on his record.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">S.W.A.T.
            is comprised of real &quot;men&quot; only, as well as the
            exceptional Sanchez, introduced by way of the huge Mexican banger
            she's beaten into submission. Their evolving cool camaraderie is
            highlighted in a series of music video-style montages in which they
            train on obstacle and weapons courses, rolling and shooting, dodging
            and prowling, infiltrating buildings and stalking around corners, to
            rousing (and occasionally cleverly paced) tracks by the Rolling
            Stones, Linkin Park, and Apollo Four Forty. Though such interludes
            take up more screen time than necessary to make the plot point
            (evolving teamwork and interconnections), they also underline the
            film's commitment to style as substance -- the team is learning to
            shoot on beat. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">This
            isn't to say that such commitment is flawed, per se. It is to say
            that <i>S.W.A.T.</i> knows what it is, namely, an expensive,
            hyper-actionated, CD-selling, multi-raced and multi-buddied flick
            with a catchy motto: &quot;Sometimes, doing the right thing isn't
            doing the right thing.&quot; No doubt, Street remains the central
            guy, even revealing last-minute reserves of skills (owing to his
            time as a Navy SEAL), but by film's end, his crucial comrades are
            decidedly dark-skinned. Street gets to be aligned with Hondo, Deke,
            and Sanchez because he's got an honorable hard-knocks background
            and, importantly, because he's despised by that fussy and faithless
            captain (so banal a device that he almost merits the venom heaped on
            him by the team). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">This
            alignment of faux-underdogs (honestly, who would mistake LL Cool J
            for an underdog?) is bolstered by their shared national identity. <i>S.W.A.T.</i>
            doesn't wave literal flags, but it's hardly shy about its own
            cheerleading tactics, specifically its use of a monstrous French
            villain, Alex Montel (Olivier Martinez, who seduced Diane Lane in <i>Unfaithful</i>),
            all shaggy hair, dark scowls, and sneery observations, to reinforce
            the team's embodiment of traditional American &quot;values.&quot;
            The team members who are parents are good ones, and even single,
            missing-his-girlfriend-who-leaves-him Street reveals exceptional
            skills when it comes to playing with fourth-graders. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Alex,
            by contrast, is vile through and through, no shading -- the team
            repeatedly calls him &quot;that frog.&quot; An &quot;international
            fugitive&quot; who sells drugs and weapons, he invites an especially
            jingoistic hating. Monumentally narcissistic, cruel, and wealthy,
            Alex is arrested following the brutal murder of his own uncle in
            L.A., then, while under supposed super-punched up security, promises
            $100 million to anyone who breaks him out of prison. That Alex uses
            television cameras to make his proposal provides an intriguing
            underpinning to his evil. Alluding most plainly to the
            much-publicized multi-million dollar bounties placed on terrorists'
            heads by the U.S. administration, the offer also makes two points:
            1) a criminal (or maybe a corporation) with this kind of money has
            global clout; and 2) moral lines are regularly crossed when it comes
            to money, since, given the same resources, a criminal and a
            government might make the same offer. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">In
            this film's formulaic moral economy, Alex's extraordinary wealth
            makes him the people's enemy, just as dedication to hard work and
            beating down scumbags make the S.W.A.T. team their representatives.
            Hondo observes that S.W.A.T. is so good at what it does that even
            the FBI and the CIA send their more robust agents to train with
            them. The S.W.A.T. teamers exemplify what seems a set of ideal
            contradictions -- militaristic but individualistic, cartoonish but
            sort of relevant, elite but regular, dangerous but sensitive. And
            so, they ride off, apparently knowing that doing the right thing
            isn't always doing the right thing. <o:p>
