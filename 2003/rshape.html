            </font><font size="1" face="Verdana"><i>review by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan
            Lybarger</a>, 23 May 2003</i></font>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Neil LaBute's movies frequently
            play better at home than they do in the theater. His first two films
            <i>In the Company of Men</i> and <i>Your Friends &amp; Neighbors</i>
            have a humor that's often obscured by the hateful actions of the
            characters. When the character says or does something funny -- like
            when <i>Ben Stiller</i> clumsily seduces Amy Brenneman in <i>Your
            Friends &amp; Neighbors -- </i>it's awkward to acknowledge that
            anything funny is going on because other filmgoers might stare back
            in disgust.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">LaBute's last couple of films, <i>Possession</i>
            and <i>Nurse Betty</i>, allowed him to expand his palette and to
            show he had more to offer than clever, sharply observed misanthropy.
            <i>Possession</i> was especially noteworthy because it's a rare film
            that makes literary research look sexy and exciting. With his
            latest, <i>The Shape of Things</i>, LaBute is back in terra squirma.
            The venom that ran through <i>In the company of Men</i> is back in
            full force along with LaBute's snappy dialogue and skill with
            actors.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In <i>The Shape of Things</i>,
            LaBute gives Paul Rudd (<i>Clueless</i>) a chance to show he can
            play more than handsome, generic nice guys. Reprising his role in
            LaBute's stage play of the same name (the two have known each other
            since both attended the University of Kansas), Rudd stars as Adam, a
            literature student who works as a museum guard to pay bills. Portly,
            bespectacled and socially maladroit, he seems strangely blessed when
            an outgoing, free-spirited graduate art student starts taking a keen
            interest in him. He catches Evelyn (Rachel Weisz, <i>Confidence</i>)
            crossing the ropes at an exhibit and curiously winds up dating
            instead of busting her. Initially flattered by Evelyn's attention,
            Adam gradually discovers there are strings attached to the
            relationship. Many of her demands seem rather helpful. Adam's weight
            drops, he switches to contact lenses and his taste in clothes
            improves.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Some of her requests seem weird and
            less than benign. Evelyn likes to tape their lovemaking. She also
            thinks little of alienating Adam's friends. Jenny (Gretchen Mol) and
            Phillip (Frederick Weller) are rather conservative and don't take
            kindly to Evelyn's more Bohemian outlook. Nonetheless, Evelyn has an
            ability to get under their skins as well because Phillip and Jenny's
            upcoming wedding is beginning to look less and less likely because
            of Evelyn's influence.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">It's not too far off to say that <i>The
            Shape of Things</i> is <i>In the Company of Men</i> with a female
            predator instead of Aaron Eckhart's eerily mesmerizing Chad. Like
            Chad, Weisz's Evelyn has a paralyzing intelligence that subdues
            anyone foolish enough to mess with her. Whereas Chad seemed to revel
            in other people's suffering, Evelyn appears more blithely oblivious
            to the damage she inflicts. It's almost as if being a heartbreaker
            is a duty for her rather than an emotional joyride. LaBute, who took
            some biting potshots at corporate culture in <i>In the Company of
            Men</i>, seems to be indicating that being Bohemian can be just as
            reprehensible.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">LaBute and Rudd also draw Adam well
            enough so that he's sympathetic but that his eventual collapse makes
            sense. Adam at times begs for his misfortune. When Evelyn makes an
            astute observation, he replies, &quot;Those are wise words for
            someone with such a great ass.&quot;</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
            </o:p>
            </font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sadly, <i>The Shape of Things </i>might
            seem a little fresher if LaBute's earlier films hadn't covered this
            territory so well. Like his first two flicks, <i>The Shape of Things</i>
            is rather talky. It's predecessors, however, were written for the
            screen and didn't seem quite as stiff or stagebound. It's an
            interesting tradeoff because it's hard to imagine a regional theater
            troupe doing as well with this material as the cast in the film
            does. Still, with only four speaking parts, <i>The Shape of Things</i>
            comes off as a little too artificial for its own good. Weisz's
            treachery is admittedly fun to watch, but if you've seen any of
            LaBute's earlier films, you wonder if he just needs to start hanging
            out with nicer people once in a while.</font></td>
