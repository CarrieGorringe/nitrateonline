</font><i><font size="1" face="Verdana">interview by <a href="../dan.html" target="_top">Dan
Lybarger</a>, 17 January 2003</font></i></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Today the Disney name is so prevalent and
even iconic that it’s sometimes hard to believe it once stood for a real man.
For all the money and influence that would come from Walt Disney’s cartoons
and the gigantic corporation that bears his moniker, it’s hard to believe that
his massive Hollywood empire actually started in Kansas City and that it took a
four-year-old girl to lead him to his initial success.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The year was 1923. The 20-something Disney had
founded a company called Laugh-O-gram Films, Inc. where he had teamed with
Rudolf Ising and Hugh Harmon (later the founders of both the Warner Bros. and
M-G-M animation studios) and Mickey Mouse designer Ub Iwerks. The only
distributor they could find for their cartoons at the time was the Kentucky
branch of Pictoral Clubs, who only paid $100 of an agreed $11,000 because of a
bankruptcy.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To keep his dream of making cartoons alive,
Walt and his crew seized on the idea of reversing a popular formula in
animation. The Fleischer Brothers in New York had created a popular series where
the animated Koko the Clown would frolic in a "real world" setting.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">In the Alice Comedies, a real girl played by
the young Virginia Davis, would find her way into a cartoon world. The sample
reel titled <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Alice’s Wonderland</i>
attracted the support of national distributor Margaret Winkler, and Walt moved
to California and gradually became a dominant force in animation.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Much of this wouldn’t have been possible
without Davis’ help. Winkler’s initial contract with Disney required the
junior actress’ involvement. She starred in 14 cartoons from 1923-1925. The
series continued until 1928 with Dawn O’Day, Margie Gay and Lois Hardwick
taking over the role.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Davis, who is now 85, had bit parts in <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:
normal">The Harvey Girls</i> and <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Three on
a Match</i> and took odd, but occasionally interesting jobs in the entertainment
industry. She attributes her surprisingly quick and energetic gait to her
training as a dancer, and her memory and alertness are intimidating. When I made
the mistake of showing her an article I wrote about Ub Iwerks two years ago, she
immediately found a couple of errors and even recommended a better book to
follow.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">She recently returned to Kansas City with her
husband Blank McGhee to help with a fundraising auction for Thank You, Walt
Disney, Inc., (<a href="http://www.laughograms.com/" target="_top">www.laughograms.com</a>) a
charity that is working to restore the building where Disney and others put
together some of the legend’s earliest cartoons. Eighty years later, she’s
still helping keep Uncle Walt’s dreams alive.</font></p>

<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">Dan Lybarger: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">One
of the surprising thing about you is that you were considered for the speaking
voice of Snow White.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">Virginia Davis McGhee: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">(In
a high pitched, squeaky voice), "A shoe. This will never do."</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">So
they liked the way you said the line.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">VDM: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">The
speaking voice was fine. The action was fine, but not the singing voice. I could
carry a tune, but that was it. I don’t broadcast that. That was why I didn’t
continue in the Alice comedies was the money situation.</font></p>
<div class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center">
</div>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">How
did you get recruited for the Alice comedies?</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">VDM: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">A
long time ago when you were a lot younger, and I was a lot younger, you used to
flash a picture on the screen, and that would be between the features. And it
would be advertising. That’s what I was doing at that point from about three
years old up. But when Walt saw me, I was about four and a half. That’s how
that started.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Now
the Disney name is iconic, but at the time, this guy was a struggling 21-22 year
old, and he was able to convince your parents to get you involved with this.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">VDM: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">He
was a great salesman. You know, Butch (Righby, of Thank You, Walt Disney, Inc.).
He and Butch were a lot alike on that. Selling, Enthusiasm. You couldn’t help
but like them. Same principle. They grow ‘em that way in Missouri (laughs).</font></p>
<div class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center">
</div>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL:</font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">
I read that he would tell you what would be on the screen, and you would react
to it</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">VDM: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">He’d
say, "A bear’s chasing you. Be frightened. You don’t want to be eaten by the
bear. Start running." So, I’d run in place. But it would work out. He could
direct me. He’s say, "Ohhhhh (in a tone of mock desperation), and I’d go "ohhhh."
But there was no sound, so he could direct me.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">So
without having to have it (recorded), he could say that and it wouldn’t show
up because there are no microphones.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">VDM: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">That’s
right. He was just say, "There’s a big noise. A big boom. Boom!" And I’d
react. I was acting in pantomime.</font></p>
<div class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center">
  <hr size="1">
</div>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">You
went all the way to LA to work on these with Walt.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">VDM: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Well,
there was a couple of things; it wasn’t just him. I had had double pneumonia
when I was about two and I almost died and had the last rites in the Catholic
Church. And the doctor said I would do better in a better climate. California
had a better climate than Missouri. There was that aspect.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Mother thought I had enough ability, and I’d
been dancing since I was two. I think she said that my dad was a traveling
salesman, so he worked different areas at that time. So he said, "I’m going to
work that area." So there was no reason why we couldn’t move.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">They
were doing something with these films that nobody had thought to do before</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">VDM: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">That’s
the whole thing, and that’s why it’s so nice. And, yet it took him a long
time.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Didn’t
you later work as an inker or painter for Disney later?</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">VDM: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Oh,
yes, at one point, he had me come out right after I got out of high school, and
things were rough, ’34-35. I graduated from high school in 1934. And he said,
why don’t you come to work for me as a painter. I said, "I don’t paint.
I’m not an artist." He said, you can learn it." So I did it for six months to
a year. And ended up being an inker, which is a freehand, tricky but nice.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Inking
and painting is tough, but it’s awfully repetitive.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">VDM: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">It
is repetitive, but I was at the Disney Studio, see (she beams). There was also
money coming in, and it was in the Depression when nobody had any money coming
in. And my dad was a salesman, but he worked on what he sold and got commission.
Every little bit I could make would help and give me some things I couldn’t
have otherwise.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Most
of the inkers and painters at Warner Bros. were women.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">VDM: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">They
all were at Disney, too</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Why
do you think that women tended to be put in that department?</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">VDM: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Maybe
patience. The other thing that’s so funny is that the women were kept separate
from the men, a little building by themselves, and the men were not supposed to
come and say hello to the women. (Walt Disney) was a purist. It was really an
old fashioned type of thinking. You stop and think about it, but it was an older
fashioned time. Everybody was gentle. There was no talk of sex. There was none
of that. He liked us ladies, meaning that he liked women to be ladies. I really
do think a lot of men feel the same way today, but they don’t know it
(laughs). I really do.</font></p>

<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">About
what time were you with M-G-M</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">VDM: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">This
was in 1944, while my husband was overseas. I did <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">The
Harvey Girls</i> then and (he) got back in August of ’45. And it was released
at the end of ’45 or first of ’46. So I was only on for that picture.</font></p>

<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">You’ve
had all of these small gigs, but they’re very interesting.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">VDM: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">I
had a natural curiosity about a lot of things. And in the summertime, I wanted
to learn how to make a puppet, crazy things, or how did it work? I guess it’s
a form of intelligence. I was always interested in doing something. I thought if
I could do it and make some money out of it. I think in at one point, I had a
piano to pay for. I wanted a baby grand piano, and I wanted to learn how to
play. And my mother and I went, and we bought a baby grand piano. I bought it,
and she signed the note with me. But she told me in no uncertain terms that if I
missed one payment on it, she was not going to pick it up. So that’s why I
learned to be a pretty good manager of money.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>

</div>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">You
stayed in touch with (Walt) Disney all those years.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">VDM: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">More
or less. I didn’t pay so much attention to him after I was married, though,
because we went back to New Jersey. A lot of books came out at that time saying
that "it all began with Mickey." And I know what (Walt Disney) meant when he
said that because the <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">big</i> success came
with Mickey. Nothing was ever said about the Alice Comedies in a lot of those
big white books. I was back East, and I was about to scream bloody murder.
It’s probably just as well that I didn’t, or I wouldn’t be here today
(laughs).</font><font face="Verdana" size="2">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">No, I felt kind of cheated at that time. But
when this book was written (<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Walt in
Wonderland: The Silent Films of Walt Disney</i> by Russell Merritt and J. B.
Kaufman), it sort of started them to think. Because I went to Pordonone (in
Italy, the home of a major annual international silent film festival) at that
time, and then other things started to happen. So, now they started to think of
me as the first. Roy E. Disney (Walt’s nephew, and the current Vice-Chairman
of Walt Disney Enterprises), at the Legend Award, said that it all began with a
little girl.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">You
had earlier said that you found his father Roy O. Disney to be a nice guy, but
you were a little intimidated by him.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">VDM: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yeah,
I was a little scared of him, and I was even more scared of him when I was going
to the speaking voice in live action. I won’t say he was cold (pauses). Think
of a banker, and he was a banker. He wasn’t "Hi, Virginia. How are you?"
He’d just say, "Hi" or "Hello" but it was just that he was a little cooler
acting. And as a child or even a teenager, you were a little more careful about
what you said to Roy.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">I
noticed that when Chuck Jones was interviewed he would talk about animated
characters as if they were living people. Did you feel that way?</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">VDM: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">I
was too ensconced in the dramatics of the case. I tell you another little thing
that’s a little strange. You know the El Capitan Theater (now owned by Disney)
is? I went to the El Capitan Dramatic College of the Theater. That’s where I
went to dramatic school. I still think I should have a star in front of the El
Capitan Theater. It would be apropos (laughs).</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Didn’t
you go to the same school as Judy Garland?</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">VDM: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">That
was the regular school. That was all grades. See, you weren’t just in the 10<sup>th</sup>
grade or the 12<sup>th</sup> grade. The girl next to you might be in the ninth
grade, but they had enough teachers to they could up their home studies. The
professional school in New York would give them the education they’d need to
pass the child labor laws. So, basically that was the whole idea, we’d get our
schooling, and we could still be able to go on calls and whether we could get
the call or not. If we got it, then the teachers would take it up while we were
being photographed and working. So, it was easy that way.</font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

you considered for any other voice gigs with cartoons?</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">VDM: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">I
don’t do accents, and I suppose if I’d have concentrated I could have done
that. I can’t roll "R’s." (laughs). I can do a child’s voice. I can do an
older voice, and I can do a lower voice by talking and getting looowerrr. I can
do a child’s voice and Snow White’s voice was fine as far as the speaking
was concerned. But not the singing.</font></p>

<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">Did
you get to meet any of the other girls who did the Alice Comedies?</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">VDM: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">No,
I knew one. I did know one. Dawn O’Day did the first one after I left, and
Dawn O’Day became Anne Shirley. Dawn O’Day and I would always be on
interviews together because we were in the same age bracket, and we were both in
<i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Three on a Match</i>. I played Joan
Blondell as a child, and she played Ann Dvorak as a child. Another little girl
played Bette Davis as a child. So, you know it just kind of all goes around that
way.</font></p>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">In
the early Alice Comedies there were more scenes of you playing with other
children because Walt was doing most of the animation himself.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">VDM: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">I
don’t know if that was the reason, but it was the time of Hal Roach’s <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Our
Gang</i>. He tried not to make it like <i style="mso-bidi-font-style:normal">Our
Gang</i>, but I think there was a little bit of it the idea that he could do
more storytelling with a group. But then it was always back to the cartoons.</font></p>

</div>
<hr size="1">
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">DL: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">You
did all of this before modern technology.</font></p>
<p><b><i><font face="Verdana" size="2">VDM: </font></i></b><font face="Verdana" size="2">It
was. I don’t if there was anybody more visual, more imaginative than Walt. And
he wouldn’t take anything if it wasn’t as perfect as it could be. He would
say to the animators, "I don’t think that’s right" and so forth. He never
would compliment them. He came from a strict family. He was up at four-o-clock
every morning delivering papers and things like that. Anyway, he did not get
much in the way of compliments at home. He would never do that. He would make
them do it over if it wasn’t right. And he’d look at it and say, "That’ll
do." And then he might go off and tell another animator or see somebody and say,
"Gee, Thomas did a great job on that."</font></body></html>
