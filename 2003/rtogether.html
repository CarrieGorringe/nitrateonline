            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>In <i>Together</i>, the latest
            film from Chinese director Chen Kaige, a father (Liu Peiqi) takes
            his son, Xiaochun (Tang Yun), a gifted violinist, to Beijing, where
            he will be tutored and have a chance to participate in string
            competitions. Xiaochun at first receives instruction from Professor
            Jiang (Wang Zhiwen), who has a flowing mane of black hair and, while
            listening to Xiaochun play for the first time, sits back, eyes
            closed, listening while the thumbs of his folded hands vibrate in
            time with the music he's hearing. Jiang lives with many cats in
            comfortable neo-squalor, but that is not the reason why the father
            eventually maneuvers Xiaochun to the attention of the more
            high-powered, empirical Professor Yu (played by the film's director,
            Chen) -- Yu can build a career for the boy and get him into
            international competitions. He insists, however, that the boy live
            at his place, with his family, full-time, meaning that Xiaochun and
            his father will have to be separated.</b></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"><o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">One gets the distinct impression
            that Chen is trying for something more slight and disarming, here,
            after two serious misfires, the huge <i>Emperor and the Assassin</i>
            and <i>Killing Me Softly</i>, the latter Chen's would-be
            English-language film debut (which, to paraphrase one of Chen's own
            comments, did not turn out as expected). <i>Together</i> takes an
            overtly sentimental tack towards the end, and its simple -- rather
            too simple -- message is: people must be sincere and maintain their
            emotional ties. Xiaochun plays difficult pieces (Paganini, Vivaldi,
            and a Tchaikovsky violin concerto, among others) with virtuotic
            ease, but Jiang tells him he must learn to &quot;play from the
            heart&quot;. Problem is, we never find out how Xiaochun feels about
            playing music or about the violin (except that the instrument is a
            legacy from his mother). Xiaochun is a cipher, and he's pretty much
            kept that way, a blank slate onto which we can read any feelings.
            When he has to choose between remaining in the city or going back to
            the country, it doesn't seem to make much difference, and the
            choice, for a child with musical gifts, seems bizarre -- does his
            father want him to stay in the sticks and play for the cows? (Unless
            it's to make the cows contented, but, the last time I looked, Borden
            did not have any dairies in China.)</font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Chen may be trying to get back to
            his (rather than Xiaochun's) roots, which may be why the film has a
            Western-versus-home country motif running through it: Western
            buildings, products, and ways-of-living figure decidedly in almost
            every scene, from Prof. Yu's Modernist apartment and choice in
            clothing to a plot turn where Xiaochun sells his violin (!) to buy a
            fancy coat for Lilli (Chen Hong), a woman he's taken a fancy to (she
            happens to live right across from the flophouse the father and son
            reside in), and a model who openly takes money from men so she can
            splurge on clothes. (Images of mid-1950s Marilyn Monroe are
            displayed, prominently, in her apartment.) Lilli comes to her senses
            by the end of the movie; Chen, I'm afraid, does not.<span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt"><o:p>
