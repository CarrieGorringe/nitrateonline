            and out. <i>Respiro</i>, as its title suggests, is about breathing,
            in a spiritual, vivacious sense. Inspired by an Italian folktale,
            Emanuele Crialese's film is at once vibrant and delicate, a study of
            a family unraveling and a fearfully traditional culture. Winner of
            the 2002 Cannes Critics Week award, it's stunningly filmed by
            cinematographer Fabio Zamarion, partly evoking the handheld look of
            neorealism, partly carving out its own, crisply colored and
            painstakingly composed aesthetic. <o:p>
            </o:p>

            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            first scene establishes the primary point of view as belonging to
            young Pasquale (Francesco Casisa). First spotted with his friends,
            checking traps they've set on the beach and shooting slingshots at
            smaller, less aggressive boys, he's tanned and taut. The sky is
            conspicuously blue, the surf sparkling, and the boys finely framed
            in the one-time windows of an abandoned structure. It all makes for
            an ideal image of childhood -- the kids are carefree, nimble,
            endlessly energetic. But Pasquale's experience is framed again,
            metaphorically, by his increasingly difficult relationship with his
            feisty and mesmeric mother, Grazia (Valeria Golino). <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">At
            first, Grazia's spirit is invigorating and alluring. Soon, however,
            the cautionary folktale dimensions become visible: she seems the
            protagonist in an all too familiar account of the tantalizing
            madwoman, at once seductive and scary. This effect is achieved
            through Pasquale's nuanced perspective, which makes her story both
            diffused and complicated. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">The
            family is nominally headed by Pietro (Vincenzo Amato), a fisherman
            in tune with the traditions of the Mediterranean island Lampedusa.
            He goes out in the morning and returns at night, darkened and weary
            from his hours in the sun. His gorgeous young wife, Grazia, works at
            the fish packing plant and looks after their three children,
            Pasquale, his younger brother Filippo (Filippo Pucillo), and
            Marinella (Veronica D'Agostino), now old enough to be eying a cute
            traffic officer. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">For
            all the routine of their lives, tensions are escalating. Bored,
            Grazia seeks mini-adventures with her kids, riding the family
            motorbike, her arms twisted around Pasquale's waist, her cheek
            resting on his shoulder, as if she's his sweetheart instead of his
            mama. She takes both sons to the beach, where she alarms and thrills
            them when she undresses to go swimming, encouraging them to join
            her. Their respite is cut short when Pietro returns from the sea and
            spots his wife, floating and topless. As Pietro sputters on his
            boat, it's left to Pasquale to restore his mother to
            &quot;modesty.&quot; <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">This
            scene introduces Grazia's history of grating against local customs
            and causing her husband embarrassment. As emancipated and
            exhilarating as she seems to Pasquale, she also embodies confusion
            and chaos (in one scene, she suffers a kind of fit, frothing and
            fainting as Pietro endeavors to soothe her, the kids looking on in
            horror). Predictably, the neighbor women are especially judgmental
            of this bad behavior, and they suggest that Grazia be sent away to
            Milano (the unfathomable big city where doctors will put an end to
            her unruliness). In response, Grazia is by turns fretful,
            frightening, and fierce. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">Her
            excess is simultaneously distressing and inspirational, personal and
            broadly emblematic. Other viewers have compared Golino's performance
            to a &quot;young Sophia Loren,&quot; but the actor invests Grazia
            with her own, original verve, less conventionally sexy and more
            dangerously transgressive, particularly in her affection for her
            children, and by extension, for an abstracted childhood. When she
            discovers that Pietro has dragged her favorite dog off to a local
            holding pen for wild dogs, she musters her nerve and makes a fateful
            decision to free the animals. As the dogs tear through the streets,
            excited to be loose, the townsmen shoot at them from rooftops,
            picking them off one by one, leaving bloody carcasses on sidewalks
            and in alleys. <o:p>
            </o:p>
            </span></font></p>
            <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size: 10.0pt; mso-fareast-font-family: MS Mincho">This
            very visceral calamity impels Grazia's more numinous fate. By its
            end, <i>Respiro</i> offers hope in the form of irresolution, and a
            lesson learned by the son at the expense of the father. Perhaps the
            next generation can be different, and more importantly, allow for
            difference. At last, Pasquale and his loving, too lovable mother,
            may be able to breathe out.</span></font></td>
